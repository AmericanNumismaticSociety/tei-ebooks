                <p>My first contact with the American Numismatic Society occurred as a college student in the 1970s. I had a part-time job at Capitol Coin Company, which had the concession in Gimbels
					department store. One day my boss invited me to accompany him to the American Numismatic Society. For a teenage kid from <name type="place">Brooklyn</name>, the trip to <name type="place">Washington Heights</name> was a bit daunting but, as I soon found out, well worth the effort. I had just recently become aware of medals, with a primary interest
					in those from <name type="place">Great Britain</name>. Despite my fears that I was a little out of my league, <name type="pname">Jeremiah Brady</name>, then Curator of Medieval
					Coins and Medals, was more than willing to show me the Society's holdings, which I am sure I did not fully appreciate.</p>
                <p>Over the years my interest in medals remained, though the emphasis drifted from the historic to the artistic. Having become accustomed to the well-catalogued (at least to 1760)
					British series, I was soon faced with the realization that there were relatively few books on American medals, and that most of those concerned early historical issues. In fact,
					the major references for twentieth-century medals at that time were the 1911 edition of the International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals catalogue (<name type="pname">Baldwin</name> 1911), and the 1923 catalogue of the National Sculpture Society's Exhibition of American Sculpture (National Sculpture Society 1923), both still indispensable.
					Fortunately, the late '70s and early '80s saw the rise of several firms dealing in art medals, including Presidential Coin &amp; Antique Co., <name type="pname">Johnson</name> and
						<name type="pname">Jensen</name> with their almost marathon auctions, and World Art Medals, run by <name type="pname">Bob Levin</name>.</p>
                <p>The real turning point in the resurgence of interest in art medals in this country can be traced to the 1983 exhibition of Beaux-Arts medals at the American Numismatic Society,
					organized by curator <name type="pname">Alan Stahl</name> with a fine catalogue by <name type="pname">Barbara Baxter</name> (1988). Additional works began to emerge at a slow but
					steady rate, including two Coinage of the Americas Conferences devoted to the Medal in <name type="place">America</name> (<name type="pname">Stahl</name> 1988, 1999), as well as
						<name type="pname">Susan Luftschein's</name> catalogue of the <name type="pname">John E. Marqusee</name> collection, <hi rend="italic">One Hundred Years of American Medallic
						Art, 1845–1945</hi> (<name type="pname">Luftschein</name> 1995).</p>
                <p>Despite these books, there are still a number of works that I would like to own, but which have not yet been written. This book is one of them. I began to accumulate information on
					medals issued by the ANS when I was appointed to the 125th Anniversary Medal Committee in 1982. Over the years I added to my notes, but I had no clear plan to do anything with them
					until I foolishly mentioned to <name type="pname">Ute Wartenberg</name> that since I wanted a catalogue of ANS medals, I should probably just write one. The words were barely out
					of my mouth when <name type="pname">Ute</name> asked if she could put it on the publications list. Being thus committed, I set out without any idea of just how much work would be
					involved. However, I cannot say it has not been enjoyable, not least due to the many fine people who have given assistance, including <name type="pname">Donald Scarinci</name>;
						<name type="pname">Bob Levin</name>; <name type="pname">Joe Levine</name> of Presidential Coin and Antique Co.; <name type="pname">David Simpson</name>; <name type="pname">David Alexander</name>; <name type="pname">F. Gordon Frost</name> and <name type="pname">Rosalie Frost</name>; <name type="pname">Ira Rezak</name>; <name type="pname">Anthony
						Terranova</name>; <name type="pname">Frederic G. Withington</name>; <name type="pname">Normand Pepin</name>; <name type="pname">Dr. Alan Stahl</name>; <name type="pname">George

						Ken Pickover</name>; <name type="pname">Robert</name>, <name type="pname">Cynthia</name>,and <name type="pname">Kaitlyn Grant</name>; <name type="pname">Mashiko</name>; <name type="pname">James Quigley</name>; <name type="pname">Joe Ciccone</name>; <name type="pname">Dave Baldwin</name>; <name type="pname">Claudia Maartense-van Ham</name> of the
					Dutch Royal House Archives; <name type="pname">Percy Preston</name>, archivist at St. Bartholomew's Church; <name type="pname">Thayer Tolles</name> and <name type="pname">Catherine
						Mackay</name> of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; <name type="pname">Thomas M. Savini</name> and <name type="pname">Catherine Walter</name> of the <name type="pname">Chancellor
						Robert R. Livingston</name> Masonic Library of <name type="place">Grand Lodge</name>; <name type="pname">Christine Nelson</name>, <name type="pname">Sylvie Merian</name>, and
						<name type="pname">Alison Dickey</name> of the Morgan Library; <name type="pname">John Pollack</name> and <name type="pname">Nancy Shawcross</name> of the University of
					Pennsylvania Libraries; <name type="pname">Nancy Mary Panella</name> of the archives for St. Luke's and Roosevelt Hospitals; and my editor, <name type="place">David Yoon</name>,
					whose attention to detail and insistence <pb n="x"/> that I actually finish the book were truly invaluable. I would be remiss if I did not express my great sense of debt to <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name>, whose 1915 <hi rend="italic">Medals and Publications of the American Numismatic Society, with an Historical Sketch</hi> was not only a
					starting point for my research, but also my stalwart guide in trying to understand and reconcile incomplete or conflicting records for medals of the first fifty years. Curiously,
					the publication of this book coincides with the 100th anniversary of <name type="pname">Belden's</name> work, which was the last substantial attempt to catalogue medals published
					by the Society, as well as the 150th anniversary of the Society's decision to produce its first medal. As pointed out to me by <name type="pname">David Yoon</name>, "It almost
					looks planned that it took so long to produce the book." Finally, I must also thank my wife <name type="pname">Roslyn</name> and son <name type="pname">Daniel</name>, who have had
					to hear far more about medals than anyone should ever have to.</p>

                </head>
                <p>During the past 150 years, the American Numismatic Society has been a leader in the publication of art medals in the <name type="place">United States</name>. Generally employing the
					finest medalists available, the Society has set an example few can match. In addition, with the exception of the <name type="place">United States Mint</name>, no entity in this
					country can boast so long and distinguished a contribution in this area. Founded in 1858, the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society, as it was known from 1864 to 1907,
					believed the issuance of medals to be a part of its mission from the earliest years of its existence.</p>
                <p>The initial effort of the Society was inspired by the tremendous emotional response to the assassination of <name type="pname">Abraham Lincoln</name>. At a special meeting held
					April 27, 1865, the Society passed a resolution to strike a bronze medal in commemoration of <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 44; see p.
					6). Despite a rather fitful start, the next twenty-five years saw a regular issuance of medals by the Society. During this period, five medals were struck, three being executed by
					the Swedish medalist <name type="pname">Lea Ahlborn</name>.</p>
                <p>The year 1889 bore significance as the centennial of <name type="pname">George Washington's</name> oath of office as the first President of the <name type="place">United
						States</name>. Although the Society did not issue a medal to mark this occasion, many others did. One designed by <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name> can be
					considered a turning point as the time from which the American art medal can trace its origin.</p>
                <p>The period from 1893 to 1939, which saw the greatest production of medals by the Society, also coincided with a golden age of American sculpture. As a result of the tremendous
					influence of <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name> and his students, as well as the prestige of French medalists of the late nineteenth century, many of the nation's
					most prominent sculptors were also medalists of note. Accordingly, medals were designed for the Society by such masters as <name type="pname">Adolph Weinman</name>, <name type="pname">Daniel Chester French</name>, <name type="pname">Hermon MacNeil</name>, <name type="pname">Gutzon Borglum</name>, and <name type="pname">Anna Hyatt</name>.
					However, the successful medallic program enjoyed by the Society could never have been attained solely by the availability of fine artists. The generosity of medal enthusiasts
					affiliated with the ANS was just as crucial. Without the support of <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name>, who underwrote many of the issues, as well as <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name> and others, the Society would not have been in a position to publish so extensive a list of medals. In fact, the two medals that were issued shortly
					after <name type="pname">Saltus's</name> death were considered financial failures, largely because <name type="pname">Saltus</name> was not there to help defray costs.</p>
                <p>The combined effects of the Great Depression and the lack of a patron brought a virtual end to the Society's medal program. During the 1930s only one medal was issued. <name type="pname">Struck</name> in 1939 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of <name type="pname">George Washington's</name> first inauguration, its sales were disappointing,
					notwithstanding the recent economic improvement. Despite the availability of worthy subjects, including the death of <name type="pname">President Franklin D. Roosevelt</name> and
					the victories in World War II, no further medal was issued until the Society celebrated its centennial in 1958, when a fine medal by <name type="pname">Laura Gardin Fraser</name>
					was struck.</p>
                <p>More recently, during the incumbency of <name type="pname">Alan Stahl</name> as Curator of Medieval Coins and Medals, the Society once again began to issue medals on a regular
					basis. Largely through the efforts of <name type="pname">Dr. Stahl</name>, four medals were issued between 1983 and 1992. Two of these, the Statue of Liberty Centennial medal by
						<name type="pname">Eugene Daub</name> and the Society's 125th Anniversary medal by <name type="pname">Marcel Jovine</name>, remain among the most popular of the Society's
					medals.</p>
                <p>Over the years, several themes emerged in the medals issued by the ANS. Events surrounding the Society itself proved popular as reasons to issue a medal. Surprisingly, however,
					relatively few relate to contemporary events of national importance. Some of the major events of the last century and a half are absent, such as World War II, the 1969 moon
					landing, and the events of September 11, 2001. Local events in <name type="place">New York</name>, on the other hand, were often deemed <pb n="2"/> worthy of commemoration. In
					other instances, the Society did little more than allow its name to be used, providing a certain seal of approval to the quality of the work.</p>
                <p>Among the most interesting medals are the ones that were never made. A number of medals were proposed over the years that the Society decided were not worth pursuing. <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name>, an enthusiastic fan of anything related to European royalty, proposed a medal for the coronation of <name type="pname">King Edward
						VII</name>. That medal, to be made of gold, was to have inserted in it a piece of wood from the oak tree that <name type="pname">Edward</name> had planted in <name type="place">Central Park</name> when he visited the <name type="place">United States</name> as the <name type="place">Prince of Wales</name> in 1860. <name type="pname">Saltus</name>
					suggested the medal bear a suitable inscription and be presented to <name type="pname">King Edward</name> at his coronation. After displaying sketches to the Society's Executive
					Committee, <name type="pname">Saltus</name> explained that <name type="pname">Victor Brenner</name> had offered to make the medal for $75 plus the cost of materials. After some
					discussion, the matter was deferred to the next meeting, and nothing further came of the proposal (minutes, Executive Committee, December 19, 1901, ANS Archives).</p>
                <p>A proposed visit of <name type="pname">Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III</name> to the <name type="place">United States</name> would likely have been the subject of a medal issued by
					the Society, with costs guaranteed by <name type="pname">Saltus</name>. Although the visit, and consequently the medal, never came to fruition, <name type="pname">Saltus</name> did
					receive an acknowledgment of his generosity in making the offer (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1921: 106).</p>
                <p>Another suggestion that was taken seriously was a medal honoring the explorer <name type="pname">Robert Cavelier de La Salle</name>, for a series of medals honoring notable events
					and persons in American history. Three medals were issued in this short-lived series—those of <name type="pname">Amerigo Vespucci</name>, <name type="pname">John Paul Jones</name>,
					and <name type="pname">Sir Francis Drake</name>. Correspondence exists in the Society's archives between <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name> and <name type="pname">Peter A.
						Porter</name> concerning the La Salle medal over a period of about ten years, from 1905 to 1915. The medal, as envisioned by <name type="pname">Adams</name>, would portray a
					youthful bust of <name type="pname">La Salle</name> on the obverse, while the reverse would bear a figure of <name type="pname">La Salle</name>, possibly on a rock with Indian
					companions, viewing <name type="place">Niagara Falls</name> (letter, <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name> to <name type="pname">Peter A. Porter</name>, June 9, 1915, ANS
					Archives). However, despite much research and discussion, this medal never went beyond the planning stage.</p>
                <p>Other medals that were proposed but not realized include some suggested by medallic firms, no doubt looking for business. In 1922 <name type="pname">Mr. W. D. Loweree</name>,
					District Manager of <name type="pname">Whitehead</name> &amp; <name type="pname">Hoag</name>, wrote that "No doubt [the Society] will have a medal struck up to commemorate the
					invention of the telephone and in honor of <name type="pname">Dr. Bell</name> who died on Wednesday of this week" (letter, <name type="pname">W. D. Loweree</name> to ANS, August 5,
					1922, ANS Archives). In 1931, <name type="pname">Clyde Trees</name> of the Medallic Art Company made several suggestions to the Society, including the striking of medals for the
					visit of the King and Queen of <name type="place">Siam</name> and another for the launching of the "largest Zeppelin ever made" (letters, <name type="pname">C. C. Trees</name> to
						<name type="pname">Sydney Noe</name>, May 4 and May 11, 1931, ANS Archives).</p>
                <p>One of the generally forgotten aspects of the Society's interest in medallic art in the early twentieth century was its short-lived School for Coin and Medal Designing. The idea for
					this school was first proposed by the Society's <name type="pname">President Andrew Zabriskie</name> in 1898. Although his idea met with little support at first, <name type="pname">Zabriskie</name> renewed his vision at the annual meeting in 1900. Within a year the school, a collaboration between the Society and the National Academy of Design, was up and
					running, with <name type="pname">Charles J. Pike</name> as its first instructor. Although famed medalist <name type="pname">Victor D. Brenner</name> taught at the school for a
					brief period, enrollment in the School was generally disappointing. During its brief existence, it never had more than ten students, and sometimes as few as two or three. By May
					1905, a decision was made to end the school (<name type="pname">Ciccone</name> 2006).</p>
                <p>Another area related to the Society's medals that merits some discussion is the issue of mintage figures. Whenever possible, the actual number of medals received and distributed by
					the Society is provided. However, in most if not all cases there will be a small number of medals beyond those figures. These additional medals include trial strikes (including a
					number of off-metal versions), archival strikes for the striking mint and/or artist, as well as a few others. It was and apparently still is a common practice for mints not only to
					maintain samples of their own work, but also to provide examples to museums or other mints on a reciprocal basis. These archival issues can sometimes be distinguished by the
					absence of a serial number or a difference in finish or metallic composition. These observations are not absolute, as examples without serial numbers, or with duplicate numbers,
					have been known to creep into batches of delivered medals.</p>
                <p>In many cases, the Society's medal sales ledger has been of invaluable help. Beginning with the Hudson-Fulton <pb n="3"/> medal in 1909, this ledger book lists the serial numbers
					for each medal and to whom each was sold. Unfortunately, some of the records, most notably those for the Lincoln Centennial and New Theatre medals, are not complete. For some
					unknown reason, there is no entry at all for the 1925 Paul Revere medal.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The question of what to include as an ANS medal proved more difficult than I ever imagined. Despite several attempts at catalogues and lists in the past, none were complete or
					wholly accurate. In the case of multiple varieties of a medal, deciding which would warrant a separate listing and which would be relegated to a brief footnote resulted in a number
					of discussions with <name type="pname">David Yoon</name>, and helped bring about some consistency in the listings. In general, any medal that could be documented as having been
					issued by or with the consent of the Society was deemed to be an ANS medal. This included medals with a very limited connection, such as the New Theatre medal, which appears to
					have been commissioned and designed without the Society's involvement and only later given to the Society to issue, or the Catskill Aqueduct medal, for which the Society's own
					internal documentation disagrees on whether it was issued under the Society's auspices. With regard to varieties, any authorized version that had a clearly distinguishable
					difference in design or inscription received a separate listing, while minor differences, such as in type of finish or mint would only receive mention within a general listing.</p>
                <p>Today, the Society's future role in the issuance of medals is uncertain. Rising costs, personal involvements of curators and Trustees, and popular demand all have an influence on
					the medals program. However, if the last 150 years are any indication, we can expect periods of inaction overshadowed by some truly outstanding medals.</p>

                    <p>This was the first medal issued by the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society, as it was then known. Seeking an appropriate reaction to the shocking assassination of
							<name type="pname">President Abraham Lincoln</name>, the <pb n="6"/> following resolution was passed at a special meeting of the Society on April 27, 1865: <q>
                            <hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That since it is the duty of this Society to perpetuate the memorials of historic greatness, we will cause to be struck in bronze a medal,
							designed to commemorate the life and perpetuate the name of <name type="pname">Abraham Lincoln</name>; and that a Committee be appointed to carry this resolution into
							effect (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1866: 5).</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>After consideration of the designs submitted by several die-sinkers, a contract was entered into with <name type="pname">Emil Sigel</name> on May 25. The earliest notices
						offering this medal provided scant information. One such mention in a Buffalo newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Commercial Advertiser</hi> of May 29, 1865, merely noted that the
						Society proposed "to strike a medal in honor of the memory of <name type="pname">President Lincoln</name>, which they intend shall surpass anything of the kind before done in
						the <name type="place">United States</name>" and that the subscription price would be $5.00 (clipping in <name type="pname">R. H. Lawrence</name> scrapbook 2, ANS Archives).
						This notice dates from about the time of the first circular seeking subscriptions, which describes the medal as being bronze and three inches in diameter, with a bust of <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> on the obverse and an appropriate inscription on the reverse (untitled circular announcing Lincoln Memorial medal, <name type="pname">R. H.
							Lawrence</name> scrapbook 1, ANS Archives).</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>By July 1865, the design had sufficiently progressed that a second circular was printed bearing a woodcut of the medal in bronze ink ("American Numismatic and Archæological
						Society," <hi rend="italic">New-York Times</hi>, July 14, 1865). On February 11, 1866, bronze medals struck from unfinished dies were presented to <name type="pname">President
							Andrew Johnson</name> and orator <name type="pname">George Bancroft</name>. Meant to have been given as part of a celebration in honor of <pb n="7"/>
                        <name type="pname">Lincoln's</name> birthday, the decision to do so was made too late to have been included in the program (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 47).
						Finally, on March 30, 1866, the committee reported that after a number of difficulties, the first finished medals were finally struck (minutes, special meeting, March 30, 1866,
						ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>Despite the oft-repeated tale of the dies breaking after only sixteen strikes, the facts are somewhat different. <name type="pname">Emil Sigel</name> did notify the Society that
						the dies had broken after the sixteenth strike (AJN 1866: 5). After reporting that the dies were unusable, <name type="pname">Sigel</name> convinced the Lincoln Medal Committee
						of the need to finance a new set. He did make these new dies, but they were not used to strike any medals until 1915. An examination of the dies in the Society's cabinet shows
						some breakage on the shoulder of the first obverse die, but not so severe that additional strikes could not be made. In 1868 <name type="pname">Sigel</name> made additional
						strikes using the first set of dies, with numbers delivered reported in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1868a, 1868b,
						1868c; Weeks 1892: 24). The reports are a little confusing because it is unclear if the numbers are to be taken individually or cumulatively.<ref target="#n1">

                    </p>
                    <p>According to a note in <name type="pname">S. H.</name> and <name type="pname">H. Chapman's</name> 1894 sale of the <name type="pname">Isaac F. Wood</name> collection of American
						medals, the idea for this medal originated with <name type="pname">Wood</name>, and <name type="pname">F. H. Norton</name> proposed it to the Society. Evidently based on Wood's
						recollections, this statement was partly in error, as the motion proposing this medal was presented to the Society by <name type="pname">Frank Leathe</name>. This sale, which
						included two examples in tin, also indicated that the dies broke on the sixteenth impression (<name type="pname">Chapman</name> and <name type="pname">Chapman</name> 1894).</p>
                    <p>The bronze medals were originally offered for sale at $5. Later on, when the condition of the dies became an issue, tin strikes were offered at two for $5 or one in an elegant
						case for the same price, though additional bronze medals were also later offered (Weeks 1892: 22). Actual mintage figures are unknown. Weeks believed about 60 bronze and 30
						white-metal examples were struck (Weeks 1892: 8), while <name type="pname">Belden</name> put the total number struck at slightly over 100 (<name type="pname">Belden</name>
						1915: 19). The actual mintage is probably between 100 and 125, with the bronze examples somewhat more common than those in white metal.</p>
                    <p>The issuance of this medal proved to be something of a disaster for the Society, both financially and administratively. Unforeseen costs, largely due to the unnecessary second
						set of dies as well as striking delays, contributed to this situation. In an attempt to recover the excess funds paid, a new contract was made between the Society and <name type="pname">Sigel</name> dated February 17, 1868, in which the Society could have the original dies for half the original price. The contract noted that although the new
						set of dies was made for $600, no medals were struck from that set. <name type="pname">Sigel</name> was obliged to pay the Society $720, less $1 for each tin medal and $5 for
						each bronze medal delivered. Further, the Society would have a lien against the dies until the sum was paid in full. It was not until 1875 that the books on this medal were
						closed. Even then, certain aspects related to this medal continued to surface; during a meeting in 1876 the Executive Committee voted to sell the remaining tin medal with case
						for $7.50 (minutes, Executive Committee, October 27, 1876, ANS Archives). In 1881 the Society paid $75 to <name type="pname">Sigel</name> for his interest in the dies for the
						Lincoln Memorial Medal (<name type="pname">Betts</name> 1881: 6, 8).</p>

                    <p>The medals struck for <name type="pname">Johnson</name> and <name type="pname">Bancroft</name> from the unfinished dies remain an unresolved question. There appears to be no
						description to help identify these medals. However, there is a reliable report of a <pb n="8"/> bronze medal having been struck using an obverse die depicting two button holes
						on the lapel of <name type="pname">Lincoln's</name> coat along with the first reverse die (<name type="pname">David T. Alexander</name>, personal communication). At first this
						seemed to be a mule of the second obverse die with the first reverse. However, close examination of a photograph revealed the buttonholes to be spaced differently; both are a
						bit higher than on the second obverse die (<name type="pname">David T. Alexander</name>, personal communication). Since this does not match the second obverse, it seems
						possible that it was struck using the unfinished first die, and that the two buttonholes were removed prior to striking medals for sale. Further, based on the reported location
						of this specimen in the possession of a descendant of <name type="pname">Sigel's</name> colleague <name type="pname">Rudolph Laubenheimer</name>, it seems plausible that it was
						struck by <name type="pname">Sigel</name> for his own use and presented to an acquaintance.</p>
                    <p>Silver, bronze, and white-metal reductions of 7, 16, and 35 millimeters are sometimes seen. These were produced by the <name type="place">London</name> firm of <name type="pname">J. S.</name> and <name type="pname">A. B. Wyon</name> using their new reducing machine. Although only six reductions were initially authorized, the number
						actually struck was greater. The Society eventually authorized the purchase of twenty-five sets of reductions for its members. Two sets appear to have been acquired for the
						Society's cabinet on December 12, 1866, at a cost of $12 (accession register, 1858–1904, entry 1866.022, ANS Archives). Unlike the 16- and 35-millimeter versions, the smallest
						ones are uniface. Two varieties exist for the 7-millimeter reductions. Of the three examples in the Society's cabinet, one silver example was struck without a reverse die (ANS
						0000.999.3564), while one bronze (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.3566">ANS 0000.999.3566</ref>) and one silver (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.3565">ANS 0000.999.3565</ref>) were struck with a blank reverse die, exhibiting only a raised rim.</p>
                    <p>The <name type="pname">Edward Cogan</name> sale of June 9–11, 1873, included a single lot (lot 554) consisting of six Wyon reductions. Three were size 22 (35 millimeters) in
						silver, bronze, and white metal; the other three were described as size 8 (about 12 millimeters) in "the same metal" (<name type="pname">Cogan</name> 1873). The set of six was
						sold for the impressive sum of $25.00, with the named and priced copy in the ANS Library giving the purchaser as "<name type="pname">Cogan</name>".</p>

                    <p>As described for no. 1 above (see p. 7), the complicated story of the Lincoln Memorial Medal involved preparation of a second set of dies. The most frequently heard explanation
						for the existence of two sets of dies is that the first dies broke after only sixteen <pb n="11"/> strikes. <name type="pname">Emil Sigel</name> told the Society that the dies
						had broken and new dies would be necessary. However, although the shoulder of the obverse die was damaged, it was still useable. After producing a second set of dies, <name type="pname">Sigel</name> struck additional medals from the first set. In 1915 lead impressions were made from the second pair of dies for the Society's cabinet (accession
						register, 1911–1921, entry 1915.82, ANS Archives). With the exception of these lead strikes, it appears that all medals were struck using the first dies. Curiously, there is a
						third obverse die in the Society's cabinet, distinguishable by the fact that the inscription has been effaced.</p>

                    <p>The idea for a membership medal can be traced to a suggestion made by <name type="pname">Isaac Wood</name> in November 1875 (minutes, Executive Committee, November 15, 1876, ANS
						Archives). Two months later <name type="pname">Wood</name> reported that he had met with <name type="pname">George Lovett</name> about the medal, to be size 27, the same size
						as the Society's seal. <name type="pname">Lovett</name> indicated the dies would cost not more than $75.00, and that he would become a life member out of that sum. Medals in
						gold would cost $50.00, silver $5.00, and bronze $1.50. (minutes, Executive Committee, January 16, 1876, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>According to <name type="pname">Belden</name>, this first reverse die was rejected (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915: 21). A new die was then prepared, similar to the first
						but lacking the raised band upon which the oak wreath rests. In addition to requesting the removal of the raised band, it appears the Medal Committee also wanted the oak wreath
						to be a little heavier than on this first die (minutes, Executive Committee, March 23, 1876, ANS Archives). Two examples are contained in the Society's cabinet. The first bears
						the inscription Cabinet of / Am. Num. &amp; Arch. Soc. / from / <name type="pname">Isaac F. Wood</name>. / Rejected die, 12 struck. (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.3349">ANS 0000.999.3349</ref>). On the second specimen is engraved Cabinet / of the / Society, / from / <name type="pname">Geo. H.

                    <p>After <name type="pname">Lovett</name>'s first reverse die was rejected (see p. 12); he made a second die, removing the raised band upon which the oak wreath sat and making the
						wreath heavier. This modified design was accepted at a meeting on March 23, 1876. Prices were to be $50.00 for gold, $5.00 for silver, and $1.50 for bronze, as quoted earlier,
						for those who had subscribed to the cost of the dies. A slightly higher price was to be charged to nonsubscribers, and the Secretary was requested to notify all members that
						they still had the opportunity to subscribe to the cost of the dies (minutes, Executive Committee, March 23, 1876, ANS Archives). Silver impressions of the medal were exhibited
						by <name type="pname">Isaac Wood</name> at a meeting of the Executive Committee on December 22, 1876. The Committee reported they thought the price for the silver medals was
						too high. Wood then offered to see <name type="pname">Lovett</name> about it (minutes, Executive Committee, December 22, 1876, ANS Archives). By January 12 of the following
						year, the Membership Medal Committee felt the medal was now satisfactory (minutes, Executive Committee, January 12, 1877, ANS Archives). Shortly thereafter, <name type="pname">Lovett</name> sent a certificate to the Society certifying that the first reverse die had been destroyed (minutes, Executive Committee, March 8, 1877).</p>
                    <p>In a notice dated January 1877, members were notified that the dies for the Medal of Membership were ready and were to be considered "a special Certificate of membership
						peculiarly appropriate to a Numismatic Society". They were to be available only to current members in good standing, or to former members who had left the Society in good
						standing. Priced at $5 in silver and $3 in bronze, each medal was to be engraved with the name, date of election, and class of membership of the member. Each member <pb n="14"/> was allowed to buy only one medal in each metal, though additional medals could be purchased upon changing the type of membership held. Gold medals were also available, with
						the price to be furnished upon application (unititled circular to members announcing availability of Medal of Membership, January 1877, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>An engraving illustrating the medal was published in the July 1879 issue of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> accompanied by a brief descriptive article
							(<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1879). At the regular meeting held January 20, 1880, <name type="pname">Isaac F. Wood</name>, chairman of the Membership Medal Committee,
						reported that a total of forty-four membership medals had been distributed. The committee was then discharged; the dies and related material were entrusted to the treasurer
							(<name type="pname">Poillon</name> 1880).</p>
                    <p>The first membership medal was available to members from 1876 until the Society changed its name in 1907. The class of membership is often found engraved with the member's name
						on the reverse. According to Article IV of the 1878 printing of the Society's constitution and by-laws, there were four classes of membership: Resident, Corresponding, Life,
						and Honorary. Any person residing in the <name type="place">United States</name> was eligible for resident membership. Corresponding members were elected for a two-year term,
						after which they could be elected as permanent corresponding members; earlier, they appear only to have been elected permanently. Corresponding members were not required to pay
						initiation fees or dues, but they were "expected to correspond with the Secretary at intervals, not exceeding six months, on topics relating to the objects for which this
						Society is established" (Constitution and By-Laws 1878). Life membership was available to members in any class of membership upon payment of $30. Honorary membership was
						limited to a maximum of fifty individuals, serving to recognize special services to the Society or to its subject. The Director of the <name type="place">United States
							Mint</name> was to be, at all times, an honorary member <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Throughout its history, the ANS has occasionally used its current membership medal as an award. In early 1877 the Society received a letter from a <name type="pname">Mr. John
							Davidson</name> of <name type="place">London</name>, who wrote that he had recently purchased a copy of de <name type="pname">Saulcy's</name>
                        <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs numismatiques de la révolution de 1848</hi> that had "The Numismatic Society / <name type="place">New York</name>" stamped on the cover. <name type="pname">Davidson</name> wanted to know whether or not the book belonged to the Society, and indicated that if it did, he would return it (letter, <name type="pname">John Davidson</name> to Numismatic Society of <name type="place">New York</name>, January 22, 1877, ANS Archives). The Secretary was directed to notify <name type="pname">Davidson</name> that the book did belong to the Society (minutes, Executive Committee, February 8, 1877, ANS Archives). By May, the book had been returned to the Society.
						During an Executive Committee meeting that month, <name type="pname">William Poillon</name> moved that <name type="pname">John Davidson</name> be made a corresponding member of
						the Society. <name type="pname">Benjamin Betts</name> added that as a token of their esteem, <name type="pname">Davidson</name> should be sent a bronze medal as a corresponding
						member; the motions were carried (minutes, Executive Committee, May 30, 1877, ANS Archives). Davidson's medal was offered for sale as lot 189 in Presidential Coin and Antique
						Company's Auction 83 on June 22, 2013.</p>
                    <p>In 1878 the Society's members had a gold membership medal struck for the Society's president, <name type="pname">Charles E. Anthon</name>. The medal was presented to <name type="pname">Anthon</name> at the twentieth annual meeting on March 19, 1878, by <name type="pname">Benjamin Betts</name>, who remarked: <figure>

                            <p>The 1876 membership medal in silver, inscribed to <name type="pname">Benjamin Betts</name>, who was president of the Society from 1870 to 1873 (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.3345">ANS 0000.999.3345</ref>).</p>

                        <q>The members of this Society having for a long time been aware of the many obligations they are under to their worthy President, whose efforts for their instruction and
							entertainment have been so untiring and continuous, and whose labors in their behalf so <pb n="15"/> freely and ungrudgingly given, and being now desirous of manifesting in
							some suitable manner their appreciation of his services, have determined to present him with a slight testimonial of their regard. In accordance with this determination,
							they have had prepared from the Society's dies a Membership Medal in Gold, suitably inscribed, to be presented to you in the name and in behalf of the Society as a token of
							their affection and esteem (Proceedings 1878: 7).</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <name type="pname">President Anthon</name> responded: <q>
                            <name type="pname">Mr. Betts</name> and gentlemen of the Society: It is with feelings of pleasure and thankfulness that I receive this magnificent token of your esteem,
							and, I may perhaps venture to say, your affection. So entirely unexpected is your gift, that I am not prepared with any remarks appropriate to the occasion. Let me,
							however, be permitted to say, that in the course of many years nothing has occurred to me of a more gratifying nature. The character of your testimonial is entirely in
							accordance with my taste. I could not have selected or suggested anything so desirable as this beautiful and thus far unique memorial of the foundation and incorporation of
							our Society. At the same time, and without any affectation of modesty, I am constrained to say that I regard this Medal not as an acknowledgment for services rendered, but
							rather as an encouragement to greater industry and zeal in furthering henceforward the interests of the elegant and instructive study to which our Society is devoted. May
							we all continue to profit by it, and to cherish the kindly feelings of which your valuable memento gives such acceptable evidence (Proceedings 1878: 7).</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>Gold membership medals were also occasionally presented to important honorary members, such as the king of <name type="place">Italy</name>. In 1901, several members contributed
						the cost of a gold medal to be presented in the name of the Society to <name type="pname">King Victor Emmanuel III</name> after he accepted an honorary membership (minutes,
						Executive Committee, April 25, 1901, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>The membership medal was struck over a number of years, as examples were needed. While most silver examples in the Society's cabinet have a thickness of 3 millimeters, two
						examples measure 4 and 5 millimeters. As these were purchased by members who joined in the 1890s, it would appear that the medals struck on thicker planchets represent later
						strikes.</p>

						accounts concerning this medal, based on the symbols on the box, it was probably given by a <name type="place">Masonic</name> lodge. Struck in pure gold and weighing 990
						grains, the cover of the elaborate box in which it was contained bore a <name type="place">Masonic</name> emblem and the date MARCH 4<hi rend="sup">TH</hi> 1881. within a
						circle, and the inscription PRESENTED TO / <name type="pname">HENRY H. GORRINGE</name>, / <name type="pname">LIEUT.-COM'DR</name>
                        <name type="place">U.S.N.</name> Stamped on the inner cover of the box is a rising sun emerging from clouds and the inscription <name type="pname">HELIOPOLIS, XVI</name>
						CENTURY B.C. / <name type="place">ALEXANDRIA</name> B.C. 22 / <name type="place">NEW YORK</name>, JAN. 22, 1881 A.D. The medal itself was housed within an insert with fringes
						at top and bottom and metal rollers to the left and right, to give the appearance of a scroll. When its existence was first reported in <hi rend="italic">Coin World</hi> in
						1972, this medal was owned by a <name type="place">Georgia</name> collector, who had purchased it from the <name type="pname">Gorringe</name> family (letter, <name type="pname">Jay Guren</name> to Chief Archivist, <name type="place">Masonic Hall</name>, July 5, 1972; <name type="pname">Guren</name> 1972: 30). This medal, no longer accompanied by
						its presentation case, was later offered for sale in the January 2012 Stack's Bowers Americana Sale and is now part of the Society's cabinet (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/2012.9.1">ANS 2012.9.1</ref>).</p>

						1906. As for the bronze medals, although mintage figures are not known, their infrequent appearance for sale would suggest a very small number struck.</p>

						to the New-York Historical Society and the American Geographical Society." It is not known whether or not these two references concern the same frame, whose location is

                        <name type="pname">Daniel Parish, Jr.</name>, joined the ANS on April 13, 1865, and held a variety of offices, including Corresponding Secretary, Librarian, and both First and
						Second Vice-President. In 1883 <name type="pname">Parish</name> succeeded <name type="pname">Charles Anthon</name> as President of the Society and held that office until March
						16, 1896. In 1908 he was made Honorary President for Life, and he was later one of the five Governors of the Society. At the time of his death in 1914, <name type="pname">Parish</name> was the last survivor of the officers who served at the time of the Society's incorporation in 1865 (Proceedings 1914–15: xviii; <name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 348–356). Parish was also a long-time member of the <name type="place">New-York</name> Historical Society and was Chairman of its Executive Committee
						at the time of his death (Death notices, <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, December 19, 1914).</p>
                    <p>This medal was struck to commemorate <name type="place">President Parish's</name> generous gifts to the Society's library, cabinet, and funds. In 1908 <name type="pname">Parish</name> became the third person to be named a Benefactor to the Society, receiving this distinction after <name type="pname">Archer Huntington</name> and <name type="pname">Arabella (Mrs. Henry E.) Huntington</name>. Among the most noteworthy of <name type="pname">Parish's</name> donations was his 1908 donation of 3,541 modern
						European coins and medals, valued at the time at $50,000 (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 190, 376). The gold medal presented to <name type="pname">Parish</name> is now
						in the Society's cabinet; the solitary silver specimen was struck for <name type="pname">James B. Wilson</name>, a prominent member of the Society.</p>
                    <p>According to a letter from <name type="pname">Charles Gregory</name> to <name type="pname">Charles H. Wright</name> dated January 29, 1892, <name type="pname">Lea Ahlborn</name>
						made 37 medals for subscribers to the <name type="pname">Parish</name> medal as follows: 1 gold, 1 silver, 35 bronze. Medals were paid for and delivered to the following
						subscribers:</p>

                    <p>Despite this letter detailing the initial subscribers to the Parish medal, the final mintage of 35 bronze medals is possible but not certain. <name type="pname">Belden</name>
						recounted the striking of single medals in gold and silver but refrained from providing any number for the bronze strikes, noting only that "bronze medals were distributed
						among the members of the Society who had subscribed for them." He also noted that as of 1915, there remained one bronze for sale at $5 (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915:
						27).</p>
                    <p>In <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi>, <name type="pname">Albert Frey</name> reported the total mintage as 83: one in gold for <name type="pname">Daniel Parish</name>, one
						in silver for <name type="pname">James B. Wilson</name>, and 81 bronze examples for members of the Society (<name type="pname">Frey</name> 1905: 360). According to <name type="pname">Frey</name>, the gold medal was presented to <name type="pname">Parish</name> by <name type="pname">Charles Gregory</name> at a special meeting of the Society
						on June 12, 1890. Repeating information reported in the July 1890 issue of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi>, the medal was incorrectly described by
							<name type="pname">Frey</name> as "the first gold medal that the Society ever issued" (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1890: 27). Since <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name>
						would presumably have had access to the same material as <name type="pname">Frey</name>, and had been active in the Society since 1886 (while <name type="pname">Frey</name>
						only joined much later), the number of bronze medals struck must be considered as unknown until definitive evidence is located.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the unique gold and three bronze examples, the Society has a thin silver shell of the obverse (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.3368">ANS
							0000.999.3368</ref>) as well as a 9¼-inch plaque, differing from the medal in minor detail.</p>

                    <p>This medal was issued to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of <name type="place">America</name> in 1492. The Society adopted a resolution to issue a medal based
						on a proposal made by <name type="pname">Sigmund Oettinger</name> on January 16, 1893, which also included a desire that Tiffany &amp; Co. design and strike the medal. A
						committee of three, consisting of <name type="pname">President Daniel Parish</name>, <name type="pname">John M. Dodd</name>, and <name type="pname">Oettinger</name>, was
						directed to approach Tiffany &amp; Co. as the Society's representative (<name type="pname">Weeks</name> 1897: 23). Before <name type="pname">Oettinger</name> proposed the
						resolution, the Tiffany firm had been consulted; it gave assurances that it was not only willing to accept the commission, but "would willingly bear the entire expense of
						issuing the medal, and assume all the risk of its success, financial and artistic" (<name type="pname">Weeks</name> 1897: 23).</p>
                    <p>The medal was announced in the January 1894 issue of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi>, where it was said, "We believe it has long been in preparation,
						though the time of its appearance is 'the day after the fair'" (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1894a: 53). The design of the medal was well received, though some criticism was made
						of the fact that while the manufacturer's name was prominently <pb n="31"/> placed, that of the designer was omitted. The article further reported rumors "that the artist who
						made the model is a <name type="pname">Mr. Whitehouse</name>, and that the dies were engraved abroad." The medal was reported as having been "struck in red copper, bronze, gold
						bronze (which we hear was a failure), and silver…" (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1894a: 54).</p>
                    <p>In the April 1894 issue of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, an editorial clarified several points concerning the medal (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1894b). This explained that
						the dies were actually engraved in <name type="place">New York</name> rather than abroad. A letter from Tiffany &amp; Co. was printed, reading in part: <q>The medal was
							designed by <name type="pname">Mr. James H. Whitehouse</name>, who for more than thirty years has been prominent as one of our chief designers. The head was modelled and
							the die cut here by <name type="pname">Mr. Wm. Walker</name>, one of our corps of die-sinkers, and the entire work was done in one of our shops in Union Square, under the
							supervision of <name type="pname">Mr. Whitehouse</name>. No medal has been struck in gold bronze, but some bronze medals have been treated with gold and tellurium and have
							been greatly admired" (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1894b: 79).</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>Since its issue, there has been some confusion regarding the metals in which this medal was struck. It would appear that only three versions were struck: silver, copper bronze,
						and gold bronze. On November 20, 1893, Tiffany &amp; Co. sent medals in these three compositions to the Society (<name type="pname">Weeks</name> 1897: 23). The original plaster
						models were exhibited at the Society's Columbian Exhibition of Medals (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1894a: 54).</p>
                    <p>In December 2003, a number of medals from the estate of a former medal designer at Tiffany, a <name type="pname">Mr. Wheeler</name>, came onto the market (eBay). Among the
						medals sold at that time was a bronze Columbus medal with the edge engraved bearing weights in copper, silver, and gold, as follows: COPPER BRONZED 170 DWTS, ST'G SILVER 191
						5/10 DWTS, FINE GOLD 378 1/3 DWTS. Although no report of a gold specimen has been noted, it is apparent that such a medal was at least contemplated.</p>
                    <p>As originally envisioned by <name type="pname">Whitehouse</name>, the reverse was to bear an allegorical design. However, this was thought to be in too stark a contrast with the
						simple boldness of the obverse, and was not accepted. Instead, a simpler reverse consisting of an inscription within a wreath was substituted, the reverse design being
						"virtually suggested" by <name type="pname">William Weeks</name> (<name type="pname">Weeks</name> 1897: 23–24).</p>

                    <p>In a circular dated November 9, 1893, members of the Society were notified of the availability of the Columbus medal. Offered in three metals, the medals were priced at $10.50
						in silver, $3.00 in gold bronze, and $2.00 in bronze. Cases for this medal were also available for an additional $1.25 each (circular, <pb n="32"/> Columbus Medal, November 9,
						1893). As of 1915, a few bronze medals were still available for $5.00 each (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915: 29). The dies for this medal, as well as those for the Grant
						Memorial medal, were presented to the Society in March 1915 (letter, Tiffany &amp; Co. [<name type="pname">G. F. Kunz</name>] to American Numismatic Society, March 18,
						1915).</p>

						Société Française de Numismatique and the <name type="pname">Musée de la Monnaie</name> (<name type="pname">Saltus</name> 1898: 9). One bronze medal has been noted with the

                    <p>St. Luke's Hospital was founded by <name type="pname">Dr. William Muhlenberg</name>, an Episcopal clergyman, in 1858 as a private hospital. The original building was located at

                    <p>According to the Society's notice of January 21, 1897, announcing its intention to issue a medal for the dedication of the <name type="pname">Grant Monument</name>, members were
						informed that prices would not exceed $10 for silver medals and $3 for bronze. Members were invited to subscribe for one silver and an unlimited number of bronze medals
						(untitled circular for Grant Monument medal, January 21, 1897, Grant Monument Medal scrapbook 1, ANS Archives). Ultimately, the bronze medals, housed in a "neat case", were
						available for $2.50 to members of the Society and to the public through Tiffany &amp; Co. (untitled circular for <name type="pname">Grant Monument</name> Memorial Medal,
						undated, Grant Monument Medal scrapbook 1, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>The single gold specimen was presented to <name type="pname">General Horace Porter</name>, <name type="pname">Grant's</name> former secretary and the president of the Grant
						Monument Association, on the evening of April 23, 1897, at the <name type="place">Academy of Medicine Building, New York</name>. The edge of Porter's gold medal bore the
						inscription "Presented to <name type="pname">General Horace Porter</name> by the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society, April 23, 1897" (Grant Monument Medal Committee
						1898: 57). A detailed account of this event can be found in the Society's Proceedings for 1898, including the texts of addresses by <name type="pname">Society President
							Zabriskie</name>, <name type="pname">General Porter</name>, and two other dignitaries— <name type="pname">George Macculloch Miller</name> of St. Luke's Hospital and <name type="place">Seth Low of Columbia University</name> (Grant Monument Medal Committee 1898).</p>
                    <pb n="37"/>
                    <p>In addition to the gold medal, silver specimens were presented to sixteen distinguished individuals: <name type="pname">Mrs. Julia Dent Grant</name>; <name type="pname">President McKinley</name> of the <name type="place">United States</name>; the mayor of <name type="place">New York</name>; the emperors of <name type="place">Austria-Hungary</name>, <name type="place">Russia</name>, <name type="place">Germany</name>, <name type="place">China</name>, and <name type="place">Japan</name>; the
						queens of the <name type="place">United Kingdom</name> and the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>; the kings of <name type="place">Sweden-Norway</name>, <name type="place">Spain</name>, and <name type="place">Italy</name>; <name type="pname">Pope Leo XIII</name>; the <name type="pname">president of France</name>; and <name type="pname">Li
							Hongzhang</name>, the former <name type="place">Viceroy of Zhili in China</name> (Grant Monument Medal Committee 1898: 57).</p>
                    <p>These medals, housed in special cases, were accompanied by presentation letters from the Society. Due to a problem relating to etiquette, there was a slight delay with the medal
						for the Emperor of <name type="place">Japan</name>. It appears that the case and the letter had different forms of address, with one improperly including the personal name of
						the emperor, <name type="pname">Mutsuhito</name>. In a letter to <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name>, the Secretary of the Legation of <name type="place">Japan</name>
						requested that the form of address be changed to "His Majesty the Emperor of <name type="place">Japan</name>", after which the medal was forwarded without incident (letter,
							<name type="pname">K. Matsui</name> to <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name>, July 12, 1897, Grant Monument Medal scrapbook 2, ANS Archives). The remaining silver
						medals were available for purchase by members of the Society at a price of $10.00 (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915: 33). A number of bronze medals were also presented to
						American and foreign numismatic organizations (Grant Monument Medal Committee 1898: 57).</p>
                    <p>Although the silver medals have serial numbers stamped on the edge, there does not appear to be any corresponding list to indicate the disposition of these medals by number. Of
						the silver presentation medals, the one presented to the Queen of the <name type="place">Netherlands</name> reportedly does not bear a serial number and, while no longer housed
						in its presentation case, is accompanied by the letter of presentation (<name type="pname">Claudia Maartensevan Ham</name>, personal communication).</p>
                    <p>Three bronze medals were given to <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name>, to be presented as he saw fit in the name of the Society, while he was in <name type="place">Paris</name> during the summer of 1897. He gave these to the <name type="pname">Musée de la Monnaie</name>, the King of <name type="pname">Siam</name> (who was then in
							<name type="place">Paris</name>), and the <name type="pname">duc d'Orléans</name>. This last medal was presented in remembrance of the service in the United States Army
						during the Civil War by <name type="pname">Orléans's</name> father, the comte de <name type="place">Paris</name> (<name type="pname">Saltus</name> 1898: 9). The dies for this
						medal were presented to the Society in March 1915 (letter, Tiffany &amp; Co. to American Numismatic Society, March 18, 1915, ANS Archives).</p>

                    <p>A number of bronze medals appear to have been retained by the Grant Monument Association for later use. One was given to the <name type="place">Prince</name> of <name type="place">Wales</name> when he toured <name type="place">New York</name> in 1919 (<name type="pname">Sotheby's</name> 1997: lot 202). Another bronze example (in a
						private collection) was presented to <name type="pname">Marshal Joffre</name> in 1922, upon the centenary of <name type="pname">Grant's</name> birth.</p>
                    <p>The bronze medals were issued in purple card boxes with gold imprint on the cover. General Porter's gold medal was, until recently, thought to have been lost. Among his papers
						and effects at the <name type="place">Georgetown <pb n="38"/> University</name> Library is the <name type="pname">rosewood</name> presentation case marked TIFFANY &amp; CO
							<name type="place">NEW-YORK</name> which originally housed the gold medal. When presented to the library it contained a silver example of the Society's Hudson-Fulton medal.

						April 23rd. 1897. The gold medal is reportedly now in <name type="place">New York</name> in the possession of the National Park Service (e-mail, <name type="pname">Lucas

						the discovery or development of <name type="place">America</name>" (Committee on Medals 1903: 9). It was issued in honor of <name type="pname">Amerigo Vespucci</name>, the
						explorer for whom two continents were named. It also honors <name type="pname">Martin Waldseemüller</name> who, together with <name type="pname">Matthias Ringmann</name> in the
						book <hi rend="italic">Cosmographiae Introductio</hi>, first proposed the name of the continent and in 1507 issued the first map to depict the new discoveries as entirely new
						continents, separate from <name type="place">Asia</name>.</p>
                    <p>The single gold specimen was originally struck for <name type="pname">J. P. Morgan</name> and bears his name engraved on the edge. In 1978 the Society acquired this example

Silver medals were issued at a price of $7, with bronze examples offered for $5. Those medals not subscribed for were purchased by the members of
						the Medals Committee (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1908: 17).</p>
                    <p>The serial numbers for this medal are generally found with the numbers stamped backwards. At least one pair of uniface examples was struck in bronze; a set was donated to the
						Society in 2000 (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/2000.1.341">ANS 2000.1.341</ref>, 2000.1.342) Also, at least one set of large <pb n="51"/> bronze plaques
						bearing the design of this medal was cast for the Society (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1908: 17).</p>

It was the second in the series of medals commemorative of notable events or distinguished persons in American history. Although the original
						intent was to issue one medal in this series yearly, it soon became evident that this was not to be. At the Society's annual meeting on January 16, 1905, the Committee on
						Medals begged "leave to report that, notwithstanding diligent efforts, it has been unable as yet to arrange definite terms for the design and issue of the medal for which the
						necessary authentic data have, after much delay, been successfully gathered" (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1905: 8).</p>
                    <p>Although the original plan was to issue this series of medals in chronological order, the discovery of the remains of <name type="pname">John Paul Jones</name> and their
						subsequent transfer to the <name type="place">United States</name> was considered so important an event as to warrant a departure from the original plan. <name type="pname">Victor D. Brenner</name>, who was given the commission for this medal, was in <name type="place">Paris</name> when the ceremonies surrounding the transfer of remains took
						place (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1907: 19).</p>
                    <p>Of the 201 medals struck, the Society retained one each in bronze, silver, and gold. Silver examples were also presented to the <name type="place">United States</name> Naval
						Academy at <name type="place">Annapolis</name> and to <name type="pname">General Horace Porter</name>, recent Ambassador of the <name type="place">United States</name> to <name type="place">France</name>. The <pb n="53"/> remaining medals were offered to members of the Society, with orders accepted for a period of one month ending January 1, 1907.
						Bronze medals were offered at a price of $8, and silver for $10 (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1907: 20). Those medals that were not sold by the end of the
						subscription period were purchased by members of the committee, leaving a surplus of $467.17. At least one set of large bronze plaques was cast for the Society (Committee on
						the Publication of Medals 1908: 17). In addition, an unknown number of sets of uniface clichés were made bearing the cornucopia and bronze edgemarks; a number is stamped in
						each of the four corners of the back of the cliché.</p>

                    <p>Through the cooperation of <name type="pname">Lady Fuller-Elliott-Drake</name>, the obverse portrait was based on an oil painting from life by <name type="pname">Abraham

						was made; the obverse was sold by Presidential Coin and Antique Co. in 1989. Four additional examples were struck, two each in silver and bronze, marked A and B, for the
						artist. There <pb n="55"/> was also at least one set of large bronze plaques cast, bearing the design of this medal for the Society (Committee on the Publication of Medals
						1908: 17). The entire mintage was reported as having been struck at the Imperial-Royal Mint in <name type="place">Vienna</name> (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1908:

						and privately. The dies are currently in the possession of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, having been donated by <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name> in 1908 (MMA
						08.128.1, 08.128.2).</p>

                    <p>A potentially embarrassing situation had to be resolved with regard to the design of this medal. Two months earlier, <name type="pname">Victor D. Brenner</name> had submitted a
						sketch for just such a medal to <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name>, the Society's Recording Secretary. However, the chairman of the Committee on the Publication of Medals,
							<name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name>, intended to have a different artist prepare the medal. Concerned that the Society might in some way be obliged to <name type="pname">Brenner</name> for the production of this medal, both <name type="pname">Adams</name> and <name type="pname">Belden</name> corresponded with <name type="pname">Brenner</name> to determine what the artist's understanding was with regard to the medal. <name type="pname">Brenner</name> responded, "After having done a certain amount
						of work, I could find no one of the gentlemen interested willing to take up the responsibility of the medal and in consequence have destroyed all the studies I had."</p>
                    <p>Subsequent to <name type="pname">Kunz's</name> resolution, <name type="pname">Huntington</name> made it known that he did not wish his portrait to appear on the medal. The

                    <p>This alteration seems to have met with approval, as <name type="pname">Wood</name> forwarded an additional seven silver medals to the Medallic Art Co. to have the reverses

							0000.999.3176</ref>). The ten bronze examples owned by the Society bear serial numbers ranging from 58 to 128, indicating the numbering was probably consecutive, regardless
						of composition. Based upon the medal with a serial number higher than 126, it is possible that the actual mintages are slightly higher than reported. The bronze examples bear
						the serial numbers and maker's mark on the edge, while the silver specimens are marked on the reverse of the oak-leaf suspender. All the bronze examples in the Society's
						cabinet display some degree of verdigris, as do those examined in private collections, suggesting that they were issued with some verdigris in the patina.</p>

                    <p>Although this medal was not originally commissioned by the American Numismatic Society, its connection to the Society justifies its inclusion in this listing. Until a group of
						forty medals, each housed in its original blue cloth book, was found at the Society in 1983, little was known of this medal. Most of the small hoard discovered was offered for
						sale to the Society's members for $75 each, with a maximum order of two per member ("Early ANS Medals Offered by Society," <hi rend="italic">ANS Newsletter</hi>, Summer 1984,
						p. 5). Although it was originally believed that all the medals were bronze, it later turned out that a small number, possibly five or <pb n="62"/> six, were silver. The book
						contains, in addition to the medal, a biography and tributes to <name type="pname">Sullivan</name>.</p>
                    <p>In order to understand this heretofore enigmatic medal and its relation to the American Numismatic Society, it might be best to quote from the book in which it is housed: <q>The
							Algernon Sydney Sullivan Medal is issued and presented by the American Numismatic Society as the successor, in this matter, to the <name type="pname">Algernon Sydney
								Sullivan</name> Memorial Committee. The medal may be issued from time to time by the society in commendation of excellence of character, conduct and attainments, and to
							encourage in others the humane and noble use of their abilities, so conspicuous in the life of <name type="pname">Mr. Sullivan</name>.</q>
                        <q>More especially, it is the intention to issue the medal to young men and women admitted to practice at the bar in <name type="place">New York City</name>. For it was in the
							practice of the law in that city that the greater part of <name type="pname">Mr. Sullivan's</name> life was spent; and it is a significant fact that the members of the bar
							who observed him in the daily conduct of their profession, held him in admiration and affection (<name type="pname">Kobbé</name> 1911: 9).</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>The Algernon Sydney Sullivan Memorial Fund was established by Sullivan's son and law partner, George <name type="pname">H. Sullivan</name>. In 1913 he gave the Society the
						medals in their books, along with a small endowment to support future striking as needed. Five medals were to be presented yearly to those new attorneys in <name type="place">New York City</name> who had done best in the bar examination. However, the medals and the fund remained unused for years, because nobody was willing to take
						responsibility for selecting the winners of the medal. In 1929, realizing that the Society would never be able to fulfill its trust and award the Sullivan medals, <name type="pname">George Sullivan</name> reestablished the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Memorial Fund as an endowment for the purchase of medals, preferably by foreign artists
							(<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 187). The Sullivan medals remained unissued.</p>
                    <p>The Society's cabinet contains two bronze examples with different finishes. The first, with a smooth finish, is stamped on the edge with BRONZE and a triangle, possibly
						indicating it was struck by <name type="pname">Arthus Bertrand</name> (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.4310">ANS 0000.999.4310</ref>). The second medal
						has a matte finish and bears the edge stamp <name type="pname">DAVISON PHILA</name>. (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1940.100.450">ANS 1940.100.450</ref>).</p>

                        <name type="pname">Algernon Sydney Sullivan</name>, who became a member of the Society in 1880, was a prominent <name type="place">New York</name> lawyer. Several years after
						his death in 1887, a memorial committee was established to preserve the memory of his personality as a model for others.

                    <p>Unnumbered bronze specimens were struck in 1908 for the <name type="pname">Roman Catholic Church</name> in <name type="place">New York</name> by J. K. Davison's Sons, <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. They are sometimes found in green boxes similar to those issued by the Society, but lacking the numerical limitation on the inside back
						cover. A gold example, lacking a serial number, was until recently in the possession of <name type="pname">Anthony Terranova</name>, the well-known East Coast coin dealer, who
						was informed that it was the one given to <name type="pname">Pope Pius X</name> but apparently never forwarded to him. While the lack of a serial number raises questions as to
						whether or not it was the medal presented to <name type="pname">Pope Pius</name>, the medal's provenance, coupled with the fact that <name type="pname">Belden</name> does not
						indicate the gold medal presented to the <name type="pname">Pope</name> bore a serial number, indicates this medal could very well be the same one struck for His Holiness.</p>
                    <p>Additional medals were issued by the Diocese in 1910 for the consecration of the cathedral. These were <pb n="66"/> struck by the Medallic Art Company and issued in green cases
						similar to the original issue, but with the additional inscription AND / THE·CONSECRATION· OF / ✠ THE·CATHEDRAL ✠ / 1910.</p>

						1910, with silver specimens priced at $10 and bronze ones at $5. Two gold specimens of this medal were struck (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915: 55): one is in the
						Society's collection; <pb n="68"/> the other was sold by Presidential Coin and Antique Co. in its December 14, 1991, auction, lot 355. One silver specimen was presented to
							<name type="pname">Mrs. Cleveland</name>, and one bronze to the president's son, <name type="pname">Richard Cleveland</name> (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1911:
						15). In addition, four silver medals bearing serial numbers 3, 10, 16, and 46 were "junked" on September 24, 1918 (Medals ledger, ANS Archives). It is quite likely that none of
						these four were actually melted, as a silver medal bearing the serial number 46 was reliably reported in 2012.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with the instructions of <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name>, in 1909 the Medallic Art Company forwarded to the Society the dies and collar from which this
						medal was struck (letter, Medallic Art Co. to <name type="pname">Bauman L. Belden</name>, September 15, 1909, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>The breakdown of the distribution of this medal as of early 1911 was as shown in the table above (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1911: 15).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the regular struck medals, at least three large bronze casts of the obverse and a pair of uniface casts included in the 1910 International Medallic Exhibition of
						the American Numismatic Society were produced. The first was to be placed on a boulder at the entrance to <name type="place">Cleveland Road</name> in <name type="place">Tamworth</name>, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>, where <name type="pname">Cleveland</name> had a vacation home. The other two were for display in <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, at the <name type="pname">Grover Cleveland Home</name> in <name type="pname">Caldwell</name> and at the <name type="place">Cleveland High
							School in Cranford</name>, which is no longer in existence (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 182). A recent visit to the <name type="pname">Cleveland Home</name>
						confirmed the plaque was still on display.</p>

                    <p>Officially, there is no obverse or reverse. According to <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name>, <q>By reason of the importance and distinctive character of each design,
							neither supplementing the other, and because the events commemorated occurred two hundred years apart, the faces of the medal do not properly come under the customary
							designation of obverse and reverse. There is no reverse to describe or illustrate the obverse; each side is complete by itself. Chronologically the <name type="pname">Hudson</name> side would be the obverse and the <name type="pname">Fulton</name> side the reverse. Practically this technical relation will change according to the
							artistic tastes or sympathies of the observer. In order to facilitate the exhibition and examination of each side, from time to time, as may be desired, some of the cases
							prepared by the Commission for <pb n="70"/> the presentation examples have been made to hang or stand, so that the medal may be reversed in position (<name type="pname">Adams</name> 1909: 154).</q>

                        <name type="pname">Robert Hewitt</name>, a prominent collector of Lincoln medals, joined the Society on February 22, 1866 and remained active until his death on October 6, 1913
						(Proceedings 1914: 3). Shortly thereafter, <name type="pname">Mrs. Hewitt</name> donated his collection of Lincoln medals to the Smithsonian Institution. Among the 1,200 medals
						and plaques were silver, bronze, and lead examples of the Society's <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> Centennial plaquette (Smithsonian Institution 1919: 27). Based upon
						correspondence in the Society's archives, there may be some question as to the ownership of the lead strike.</p>
                    <p>In a letter to <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name> dated August 5, 1914, <name type="pname">Herman C. Page</name>, manager of the Metal Sales Department at <name type="pname">Whitehead</name> &amp; <name type="pname">Hoag</name>, responded to an earlier inquiry by <name type="pname">Belden</name> concerning the <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> plaquettes. <name type="pname">Page</name> related that he instructed <name type="pname">Mrs. Hewitt</name> to return the lead proof that he had loaned her
						husband. He also requested return of a bronze example marked "sample", and upon receipt both would be returned to the Society if desired. The lead proof, which bore <name type="pname">Mr. Page's</name> name on the reverse, was the first impression of the die and was lent to <name type="pname">Mr. Hewitt</name> for exhibition purposes only
						(letter, <name type="pname">Page</name> to <name type="pname">Belden</name>, August 5, 1914, ANS Archives). Later that month, <name type="pname">Page</name> again wrote to
							<name type="pname">Belden</name>, noting that <name type="pname">Mrs. Hewitt</name> informed him that <name type="pname">Belden</name> had given her the Society's
						permission to keep the sample plaquette and the lead proof with the collection, but that the plaques were to be returned to <name type="pname">Whitehead</name> &amp; <name type="pname">Hoag</name> upon the disposal of the collection or <name type="pname">Mrs. Hewitt's</name> death (letter, <name type="pname">Page</name> to <name type="pname">Belden</name>, August 22, 1914, ANS Archives). Today, the lead proof resides in the collection of the <name type="pname">Smithsonian</name> Institution.</p>
                    <p>
                        <name type="pname">Page</name> also referred to <name type="pname">galvanos</name> and <name type="pname">plaster</name> casts of this plaquette. It appears that several copies
						were made in each of these formats. He indicated that some of these had a different legend than the final version, suggesting that they had been made prior to <name type="pname">Roiné's</name> sale of the design to the Society (letter, <name type="pname">Page</name> to <name type="pname">Belden</name>, August 5, 1914, ANS Archives).
						One plaster cast is currently in the possession of the Society. According to <name type="pname">Adelson</name>, one of the <name type="pname">galvanos</name> was on display at
						the Society when he was writing his centennial history in 1958 (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 183).</p>
                    <p>Although at least some medals were struck as early as 1909 (letter, <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name> to <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name>, September 7, 1909, ANS
						Archives), neither this nor the New Theatre medal was offered for sale until 1916. According to the 1911 report of the Committee on the Publication of Medals, the Lincoln
						Centennial medal had already been prepared and would be offered to the members later that year (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1911: 15). There is no indication of the
						reason for the seven-year delay. It is possible, however, that the lackluster sales of the <name type="pname">Catholic Diocese</name> and Cleveland medals, coupled with the
						number of new medals waiting to be offered, was a consideration.</p>

                    <p>This medal was struck to commemorate the opening of the New Theatre on November 6, 1909. Dissatisfied with the current state of theater, a group of notable New Yorkers banded
						together to found the New Theatre, one that would reflect their sophisticated taste. Intended to be non-commercial in nature, with profits placed in an endowment fund,
						committees were to be appointed to approve various aspects of production, such as scenery and costumes.</p>
                    <p>Located at 62nd Street and <name type="place">Central Park</name> West in a magnificent, Italian Renaissance building that cost $3,000,000, the theater opened with a performance
						of Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>. Unfortunately, the New Theatre never proved popular, having earned a reputation as being only for the wealthy, and
						survived for only two years. The building was then leased to another manager and renamed the Century Theater. In 1929 the building was demolished and replaced with the Century
						Apartments (<name type="pname">Atkinson</name> 1970: 123–124).</p>

						1911 (<name type="pname">Sam</name> 1988: 179), this was was the second Founders' Medal to be awarded. The first was presented to <name type="pname">Shakespearean</name>
						scholar <name type="pname">Dr. Horace Howard Furness</name> on April 12, 1910, in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>.</p>
                    <p>According to <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name>, the gold medal presented to <name type="pname">Terry</name> bore the same design as the one sold by the American Numismatic
						Society in commemoration of the opening of the New Theatre. Based only on this information, it would seem reasonable to believe <pb n="78"/> that the gold medal contained an
						engraved inscription bearing <name type="pname">Miss Terry's</name> name, and possibly other information. While several contemporary accounts of the presentation include an
						illustration of the obverse of the medal, identical to that of the Furness medal ("Gold Medal for <name type="pname">Ellen Terry</name>", <hi rend="italic">Boston Evening
							Record</hi>, December 30, 1910), experience has shown <name type="pname">Belden's</name> descriptions of the Society's medals to be very reliable. Thus, the gold medal
						presented to <name type="pname">Ellen Terry</name> almost certainly bore the design of the ANS issue.</p>
                    <p>There has never been any satisfactory explanation for the issuance of this medal in two sizes. The record in the ANS medals ledger for this issue is very sparse. The few sales
						noted are only for the 77-millimeter medal, with no mention at all of the larger version. The silver and bronze 77-millimeter medals were numbered 1 through 50 (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915: 57). Silver 77-millimeter medals were originally sold for $10 and bronze, regardless of size, for $5; they were struck by the Medallic Art
						Co. (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915: 57). In 1917, a number of medals were liquidated to help alleviate financial difficulties experienced by the Society (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 204). According to Society records, five silver medals bearing serial numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, and 11 were "junked" on September 24, 1918. The
						large bronze medals were not numbered and are generally found untrimmed and without a finish, although an example with an old, trimmed edge was sold as lot 237 in Presidential
						Coin and Antique Company's Auction 83, June 23, 2013. During the 1970s, some of these large, untrimmed bronze medals were available through a well-known coin dealer, <name type="pname">Charles McSorley</name>. Others appearing on the market in the 1970s and 1980s were trimmed and given modern finishes. A silver example of the 106-millimeter
						medal was listed as number 3503 in the catalogue of medals from the ANS collection exhibited during the 1910 International Medallic Exhibition (American Numismatic Society
						1910: 252). Despite this record, the Society's cabinet does not contain a specimen in silver, and neither <name type="pname">Belden</name> nor the Society's medals ledger makes
						any mention of one.</p>
                    <p>The issue date of the ANS New Theatre medal has raised questions for collectors for a number of years. Although it is dated 1909, there was a five-year gap between the
						presentation of the medal to <name type="pname">Ellen Terry</name> and the first recorded sale of the medal by the Society. In his 1977 Check List, <name type="pname">Jeremiah
							Brady</name> dated the New Theatre medal to 1917, commenting "usually dated 1909, but delivered in 1917". Another reason the record appears obscured is that for some of the
						years between 1909 and 1917 the ANS Proceedings did not include reports from the Committee on the Publication of Medals. Finally, the ANS medal sales ledger, which usually
						provides very specific information about mintage figures and dates of sales, provides little useful information about this medal. Fortunately, other sources help clarify the
						issue.</p>
                    <p>The New Theatre medal is recorded in the ANS medals ledger right after the Lincoln Centennial medal and before the Declaration of War medal, thus establishing the 1916 date of
						its entry into the ledger to be correct. However, not only was the gold medal presented to <name type="pname">Ellen Terry</name> in 1911, but <name type="pname">Belden</name>
						listed this medal in his 1915 book, noting that a number of medals in both sizes were still available (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915: 57). The dating of ANS medals in
						general is somewhat difficult during this period, as a number of medals are found where the earliest recorded date of distribution is at odds with the date on the medal and
						other documentation regarding production or stock on hand.</p>
                    <p>The catalogue of the medals in the Society's collection exhibited during the 1910 International Medallic Exhibition contains a section on medals issued by the Society. Entries
						3501 through 3504 list bronze and silver 77-millimeter medals (3501), obverse and reverse dies for the 77-millimeter medal (3502), a silver 106-millimeter medal (3503), and
						obverse and reverse dies for the 106-millimeter medal (3504), establishing that the medals had been struck by that time.</p>
                    <p>In 1915, the Society published <name type="pname">Bauman</name>
                        <name type="pname">L. Belden's</name>
                        <hi rend="italic">Medals and Publications of the American Numismatic Society, with an Historical Sketch</hi> (<name type="pname">Belden</name> 1915). This medal is listed among
						those for 1909, with the comment that it was struck to commemorate the opening of the New Theatre. After noting the presentation of a gold medal to <name type="pname">Ellen
							Terry</name>, <name type="pname">Belden</name> indicated that a number of 77-millimeter bronze and silver medals were still available, as well as 106-millimeter bronze
						examples; only the smaller medals were numbered.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there is in the ANS Archives a note dated December 28, 1909, from <name type="pname">Archer Huntington</name> to <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name>, which makes
						clear that the Society did little more than allow its seal to be placed on the medal. It reads, "Herewith I enclose to you copy of a form of Resolution which should be
						carefully filed for future reference, as it refers to a matter which the Medal Committee will shortly have to consider." The enclosed resolution reads as follows: <pb n="79"/>
                        <q>Resolved: That in view of the change of plan in the issuing of the New Theatre Medal and in the change of the form of the medal itself, those examples already struck of the
							original form be issued by the American Numismatic Society to its members or others; it being understood that, in consideration of the remuneration received by the American
							Numismatic Society through the sale of these medals, the New Theatre shall bear no further burden of expense, either for the cost of making the medals or dies. That the
							dies shall be deposited with the American Numismatic Society, and no further examples shall be struck without permission of the New Theatre (letter, <name type="pname">Huntington</name> to <name type="pname">Belden</name>, December 28, 1909, ANS Archives).</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>It would seem that the ANS issue may have been the original design and was intended to commemorate the opening of the New Theatre. These medals were struck sometime before
						December 28, 1909. In a letter to his mother dated January 25, 1909, <name type="pname">Bela Pratt</name> wrote that he had just received two orders for medals from <name type="pname">Archer Huntington</name>, including one for the New Theatre (letter, <name type="pname">Bela Lyon Pratt</name> to <name type="pname">Sarah Whittlesey
							Pratt</name>, January 25, 1909, <name type="pname">Pratt</name> letters 2011–12: letterid=1909-0125-BLP-SVWP). Nearly three months later, <name type="pname">Pratt</name>
						wrote again to his mother that he had shown photos of his design to <name type="pname">Huntington</name>, who said, "I consider it the very best medal ever made by an American
						sculptor, the best ever made in this country, and I have seen them all" (letter, <name type="pname">Bela Lyon Pratt</name> to <name type="pname">Sarah Whittlesey Pratt</name>,
						April 11, 1909, <name type="pname">Pratt</name> letters 2011–12: letterid=1909-0411-BLP-SVWP). Finally, in another letter to his mother dated October 3, 1909, <name type="pname">Pratt</name> mentioned that <name type="pname">Huntington</name> wanted changes made to the New Theatre medal including removal of the central figure on the
						reverse (letter, <name type="pname">Bela Lyon Pratt</name> to <name type="pname">Sarah Whittlesey Pratt</name>, October 3, 1909, <name type="pname">Pratt</name> letters 2011–
						12: letterid=1909-1003-BLP-SVWP).</p>
                    <p>Based on <name type="pname">Huntington's</name> description of the ANS medal as the original design and <name type="pname">Pratt's</name> account of the changes requested in
						October, it would appear that the <name type="pname">Furness</name> version was reworked from the original design. However, until the medal presented to <name type="pname">Ellen Terry</name> is located, we will not be certain whether she actually did receive a gold example with the first, commemorative design.</p>
                    <p>The first Founders' Medal was presented to <name type="pname">Shakespearean</name> scholar <name type="pname">Horace Howard Furness</name> on April 12, 1910, in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. Although it was intended to award the medal to <name type="pname">Furness</name> at the opening of the New Theatre, this could not be done
						due to his health at the time ("<name type="pname">Dr. Furness</name> Gets a Medal," <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, April 13, 1910). In discussing the presentation of
						the medal to <name type="pname">Furness</name>, <name type="pname">Winthrop Ames</name> noted <name type="pname">Furness</name>'s work as an editor of <name type="pname">Shakespeare's</name> plays as the reason he was chosen to be the "first recipient of the first medal the New Theatre would present to those who have contributed to the
						dramatic art in this country" ("New Theatre Gives First Honor Medal to <name type="pname">Dr. H. H. Furness</name>," <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, April 24, 1910). The
						Furness medal is currently located with the <name type="pname">Furness</name> Family Papers at the <name type="place">University of Pennsylvania</name>. Based on the similarity
						of design as well as the <name type="pname">Huntington</name> letter, it seems that the medal presented to <name type="pname">Furness</name> was a slightly reworked version of
						the one issued by the ANS:</p>

                    <p>
                        <name type="pname">Winthrop Ames</name>, the managing director of the New Theatre, was presented with a gold Founders' Medal at a meeting of the founders on November 4, 1909.
						The presentation was made by <name type="pname">William K. Vanderbilt</name> following the unanimous adoption of a resolution reading, "Resolved, that <name type="pname">Mr.
							Vanderbilt</name>, on behalf of the founders present to <name type="pname">Mr Ames</name> a Founders Medal of the New Theatre in recognition of the energy, perseverance,
						tact, skill, and painstaking efforts displayed by him in the midst of many difficulties surrounding the building and opening of the theatre" ("<name type="pname">Winthrop Ames
							Honored</name>," <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, November 5, 1909).</p>
                    <p>This was an entirely different design from the <name type="pname">Bela Pratt</name> medal issued by the Society. The Founders' Medal presented to <name type="pname">Ames</name>
						was an 89-millimeter medal designed by <name type="pname">Gutzon Borglum</name>. An example of this medal was exhibited in the 1910 International Exhibition of Contemporary
						Medals along with a plaster model (described in the catalogue as having been presented in 1910; <name type="pname">Baldwin</name> 1911: 15). A 16½-inch bronze cast of the
						obverse was sold by <name type="pname">Stack</name>'s in its <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Americana Sale of September 23, 2009. <pb n="80"/> Although <name type="pname">Borglum's</name> New Theatre medal had no connection with the ANS, <name type="pname">Archer Huntington</name> gave the dies to the Society. A full account of
						this medal and a related marble relief at the American Numismatic Society was published in the Winter 2009 issue of the <hi rend="italic">ANS Magazine</hi> (<name type="pname">Silberberg</name> 2009).</p>

                    <p>In 1907 the name of the Society was changed back from the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society to the American Numismatic Society. As a result of this change in name
						and the resulting change in seal, it was felt that a new membership medal was warranted (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 184). This first version of the second member's
						medal is remarkable in that the Society's motto was misspelled "Parva Ne Perant" instead of "Parva Ne Pereant". All examples so far examined do not have a member's engraved
						name. It would therefore appear that the error was noticed before any examples were sold. A silver specimen can be found in the Society's collection (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1913.6.1">ANS 1913.6.1</ref>), donated by <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name>.</p>

                    <p>Gold membership medals have occasionally been presented to individuals as special marks of favor. In 1913 <name type="pname">Samuel Avery, Jr.</name>, offered the sum of $2,500

						$2,500 could be made up of a number of smaller donations, and also allowed the fund to be started with only three donors. For his generosity, <name type="pname">Avery</name>
						was presented with a gold membership medal (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 193).</p>

						member of the Society, it was decided to elect <name type="pname">Queen Elisabeth</name> to the same position. The presentation was made during an informal reception at the
							<name type="place">New York</name> Public Library on October 4, 1919, the royal couple being unable to visit the Society due to their full schedule (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 221–222).</p>
                    <p>Silver membership medals have also been presented on occasion, such as that presented to <name type="pname">Isaac Greenwood</name> shortly before his death in 1911. He was, at

						Vice-President from July 28, 1864, until March 22, 1866. Also in 1911, <name type="pname">Greenwood</name> gave the Society his collection of more than 3,000 coins, medals and

                    <p>There is a single gold-plated bronze specimen in the Society's cabinet (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1967.30.3">ANS 1967.30.3</ref>), bearing the name of <name type="pname">Gilbert S.

                    <p>This medal was produced as a result of the Society's 1910 International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals. It was decided to award the commission of a commemorative medal to the
						medalist with the best exhibit, and <name type="pname">Godefroid Devreese</name> was awarded that honor. The artist sent his finished dies to <name type="place">New York</name>
						in time for them to be exhibited at the 1912 annual meeting (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 184). According to Society records, only one bronze example was struck for
						its cabinet (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.4010">ANS 0000.999.4010</ref>). In addition, one two-sided and several uniface artist's proofs were
						produced by <name type="pname">A. Michaux</name> (<name type="pname">De Witte</name> 1911–12: no. 98).</p>
                    <p>The reason for not striking additional examples for sale to members is not clear. In his listing, <name type="pname">de Witte</name> noted that examples would be struck for sale
						by the Society. In a 1913 letter to <name type="pname">John Waterbury</name>, the new chairman of the Committee on the Publication of Medals, explaining the status of various
						medals in <pb n="86"/> progress, <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name> wrote, "The Council has also authorized the striking of the medal by <name type="pname">Devreese</name>
						for the International Medallic Exhibition for 1910 with the idea of offering it for subscription in the early fall. We have here the dies for this medal. One example was struck
						before the dies were sent to us, and that example we have. No other medals have, so far, been struck" (letter, <name type="pname">Belden</name> to <name type="pname">Waterbury</name>, April 16, 1913, ANS Archives).</p>

                    <p>Based on this correspondence, it would appear that the Council did intend to strike examples of this medal for the membership. The Council also discussed using one side of this
						medal as the obverse for the Saltus Award, but that idea was eventually rejected (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 185). While the reasons may never be known, it is
						possible that this medal was simply caught up with the same issues that caused a delay in issuing the New Theatre and Lincoln Centennial medals.</p>
                    <p>Although never offered for sale, Devreese's medal was used as an award by the Society. At least two uniface gold examples were struck utilizing the obverse die and bearing
						inscriptions on the reverse. They were presented to retiring Treasurer <name type="pname">Charles Pryer</name> and to <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name> at the

                    <p>The idea for this medal originated with <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name>, who paid the cost of the dies. The design concept itself originated with Secretary of the

						Loans". The medal was to have been available for purchase only by subscribers to the loan, with different bars to indicate the varying loans. This plan was abandoned due to the
						lack of government sanction for the project, and the small medal was replaced with a larger version (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1918: 25).</p>
                    <p>Although first designed as two-sided, this was ultimately issued as a uniface medal. According to the Committee on the Publication of Medals, the date of the declaration of war
						would suffice, along with the "fighting attitude of our national bird … to convey in symbol the spirit with which our country has entered the conflict" (Committee on the
						Publication of Medals 1918: 25).</p>

                        <name type="pname">Eli Harvey's</name> model for the eagle was approved by <name type="pname">William T. Hornaday</name>, Director of the <name type="place">New York</name>
						Zoological Park. The medal's design was used by the Bankers Trust Company in their Third Liberty Loan Circular, with a large bronze plaque on display at the company's office
							(<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 216).</p>

                    <p>In recent years, two specimens of the Declaration of War medal have surfaced that bear impressions from the reverse die. The first was purchased by the Society in 1992. The
						second, which is holed, was sold in a Presidential Coin &amp; Antique Co. auction (PCAC 66, lot 438).</p>
                    <p>The first was described in the section on medals of the 1992 annual report of the ANS. <name type="pname">Alan Stahl</name> proposed there that it was a trial piece and that
						after examination, "a committee … felt that the reverse was redundant and detracted from the whole medal" (<name type="pname">Stahl</name> 1992: 30). The trial was then mixed
						up with the entire order. This medal (serial number 69; <ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1992.155.1">ANS 1992.155.1</ref>) was one of eleven examples ordered by
							<name type="pname">John Waterbury</name>, president of the Manhattan Trust Co. (<name type="pname">Stahl</name> 1992: 30).</p>

                    <p>Three gold medals were struck. One was placed in the cornerstone of the building, a second was retained by <name type="pname">St. Bartholomew's</name>, and the third was
						presented to <name type="pname">Bishop David Greer</name>. As this last medal has since been returned to <name type="pname">St. Bartholomew's</name> Church, all three are
						currently in its possession. A limited number of 51-millimeter silver medals were presented to members of the vestry, the church's governing council. The 38-millimeter bronze
						examples were given to those individuals who made contributions toward the cost of the building. The model of the building as depicted on the obverse is that which was
						originally envisioned by the architect, <name type="pname">Bertram Goodhue</name> (<name type="pname">Percy Preston</name>, archivist of <name type="pname">St.
							Bartholomew's</name> Church, personal communication, February 19, 2008).</p>
                    <p>In May 1917, <name type="pname">Field</name> wrote to the Society's <name type="pname" corresp="#ans_newell">President, Edward Newell</name>, that the church planned to have two gold and eleven
						silver medals struck. With regard to the bronze medals, <name type="pname">Field</name> mentioned that 2,000 bronze medals would be required for distribution to <pb n="97"/>
						all who made a contribution towards the building. He proposed to use the smaller size of 1½ inches in order to reduce costs (letter, <name type="pname">Field</name> to <name type="pname">Newell</name>, May 9, 1917, ANS Archives).</p>

                    <p>As for the Society, <name type="pname">Field</name> believed the Society should receive one example of each kind struck. Moreover, he asked <name type="pname" corresp="#ans_newell">Newell</name> if
						anyone else would like to order a gold medal, and that if any extras were ordered, he would like one each in gold and silver (letter, <name type="pname">Field</name> to <name type="pname">Newell</name>, May 17, 1917, ANS Archives). Despite these intentions, by January 1918, <name type="pname">Sydney Noe</name> wrote to <name type="pname">Field</name> asking whether or not the medal had been issued. He noted that permission to use the Society's seal was conditioned upon some acknowledgment to the Society
						and that some medals be given to them. As of then, they had not received any medals and had been unable to obtain any information about them, though <name type="pname">Robert
							Eidlitz</name> believed the medals had already been issued (letter, <name type="pname">Noe</name> to <name type="pname">Field</name>, January 9, 1918, ANS Archives). On
						March 25, 1918, the Society finally received one of the large silver medals from the rector of <name type="pname">St. Bartholomew's</name>.</p>

                    <p>Despite the evidence cited, this medal has, by tradition, been included with those published by the Society. While that alone would not be sufficient to consider this an ANS
						medal, the report by the Committee on the Publication of Medals in the 1918 Proceedings indicates that the Society did, in fact, authorize this medal at the request of <name type="pname">Robert W. de Forest</name> (Committee on the Publication of Medals 1918: 25). It is for this reason that the medal is included as an issue of the American

                    <p>The tenth silver medal was collectively presented to all the assistant engineers, contractors, workmen, and other individuals whose work contributed to the successful completion

						VISION, GENIUS, LOYALTY AND LABOR (<name type="pname">Hall</name> 1918: 903–904).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the 3-inch cast medals, the Medallic Art Company struck 2000 38-millimeter bronze medals bearing the same design. These should not be considered as having any
						connection with the ANS. Of the 2000 small bronze medals struck, two were given <pb n="103"/> to each of 600 schools for presentation to students for the best essay on the
						subject of the aqueduct. About 750 were sent to members of the Mayor's Committee who were each charged $1.00 for the medal, while a few were sold to other interested
						individuals (<name type="pname">Hall</name> 1918: 909).</p>

						staff denoting peaceful intercourse suggests that the celebration is universal. As <name type="pname">Mercury</name> was born in the fourth month, the number four was always

						pay for the dies and the gold medal to be presented to <name type="pname">King Albert</name> and <name type="pname">Queen Elisabeth</name>, which was made from gold obtained by
						melting <name type="place">Belgian</name> coins. <name type="pname">Saltus</name> also bore the expense for presenting unnumbered silver specimens to honorary members <name type="pname">King Victor Emmanuel III</name> of <name type="place">Italy</name>, <name type="place">King Alfonso XIII</name> of <name type="place">Spain</name>, and <name type="pname">King Manuel II</name> of <name type="place">Portugal</name>, as well as a tinted-metal example to the British Numismatic Society (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 218–219).

                    <p>The Saltus award, which ranks as the most prestigious recognition of achievement for medallic sculpture, originated in 1913 when <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name>
						donated $5,000 to establish a permanent fund for the striking of an award medal to be given "…sculptors for distinguished achievement in the field of the art of the medal, to
						authors who have merited signal honor for numismatic research and scholarship, or to those who have materially aided in broadening the knowledge of the Science of Numismatics"
						(letter, <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name> to <name type="pname">Archer M. Huntington</name>, October 22, 1913, quoted in <name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958:
						191–192). Because the Archer Huntington medal award was also intended to honor numismatic research, the Society decided, in order to distinguish the two awards, that the Saltus
						medal would be reserved for excellence in medallic art (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 213). Since 1919, fifty-five medals have been awarded (see Appendix 2 for list
						of recipients). Originally given only to American artists, since <pb n="108"/> 1983 the award has been presented to foreign medalists as well, beginning with the award to <name type="pname">Guido Veroi</name>. In addition to the awarded medals and those in the Society's cabinet, several sets of shells exist, as well as one unawarded silver example
						now in the possession of a prominent <name type="place">New Jersey</name> collector.</p>

                    <p>The first award, to <name type="pname">James Earle Fraser</name>, was a cast medal. However, as this method of manufacture proved unsatisfactory, struck examples have been given
						since 1920 (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 214). The struck medals were produced by the Medallic Art Company (letter, <name type="pname">Sydney Noe</name> to Medallic
						Art Co., March 3, 1920, ANS Archives). The Society's cabinet contains two silver examples acquired in 1920, one cast (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1920.167.2">ANS 1920.167.2</ref>) and one struck (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1920.167.1">ANS 1920.167.1</ref>). Other noteworthy specimens owned by the Society
						include a silvered electrotype of the obverse, the gift of <name type="pname">Robert Weinman</name> (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1976.263.5">ANS
							1976.263.5</ref>), a pair of joined electrotype shells (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.4432">ANS 0000.999.4432</ref>), and two bronze examples. The
						first of these was cast by Tiffany &amp; Co. (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.4430">ANS 0000.999.4430</ref>), while the other bears the Medallic Art Co.
						imprint (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.4431">ANS 0000.999.4431</ref>). The Society also has a set of large galvanos, which used to hang in the
						reception office in the building on Audubon <pb n="109"/> Terrace and is now on display in its exhibit hall. Over the years, there has been no consistent pattern for the
						engraving of this award, so that the presentation inscription may be found either on the edge or on the field.</p>

						6 to February 8, 1913 (Joan of Arc Statue Committee 1913). In 1919, the section of Riverside Park around the statue was named <name type="pname">Joan of Arc Park</name>.</p>
                    <p>The pedestal upon which the statue rests contains a number of historic pieces of stone, the inclusion of which was the idea of <name type="pname">George F. Kunz</name>, who
						wanted to include in the monument something personally connected to the life of <name type="pname">Joan of Arc</name>. The pedestal includes most of a group of 229 blocks
						obtained by the Statue Committee from the turret of the <name type="pname">Château de Rouen</name>, where <name type="pname">Joan of Arc</name> was imprisoned by the English
						after her capture in 1430 (<name type="pname">Kunz</name> 1915: 20–23). In 1916, a year after the statue's dedication, another stone was set into the pedestal, one from the
						cathedral at <pb n="111"/> Reims where, in 1429, <name type="pname">Charles VII</name> was crowned <name type="pname">King of France</name> (<name type="pname">Kunz</name>
						1915: 24–25).</p>

                    <p>Prior to placement of the capstone, a copper box was placed inside the pedestal. In addition to a number of documents, the box contains coins from the <name type="place">United

                    <p>The single gold specimen of this medal was issued bearing serial number 1; the silver examples carry serial numbers 2 through 75. The issue price for this medal was $10 for

                    <p>bronze: 318</p>
                    <p>The design for this medal was the result of a competition limited to sculptor-members of the Society. A total of fifteen designs were received by the closing date of January 15,
						1919. Since the decision to strike a medal and the acceptance of a design preceded the actual conclusion of the treaty, striking of the medal was delayed until after the treaty
						was signed (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 219).</p>
                    <p>The original circular described the complex allegorical images in detail: <q>On the obverse Peace is shown with the palm branch and wreath of victory—a beautiful womanly
							embodiment. On the other side of the winged horse, there is the manly form of Justice—a figure of Right Triumphant. The helmet of conflict is still upon his head, but the
							sheathed sword shows that the battle has been won. At the side, the wreathed scales appear. Justice and Peace advance together. Above the longing for peace and justice,
							however, the treaty of 1919 is distinguished beyond all others by the earnest desire that in future, war may be eliminated. The powerful figure mounted on <name type="pname">Pegasus</name> expresses the idea of the League of Nations incorporated in this treaty. The clasped book of the law and the dynamic outstretched arm need
							no interpreting—the forcefulness of the type and its virility suggest that henceforth the principles of righteousness will be in control. The thought is further emphasized
							in the fallen figure of <pb n="113"/> destruction, whose torch is being trampled beneath the foot of Justice. In its lines, in its planes and in the composition this is a
							monumental design.</q>
                        <q>On the reverse is shown the palace of <name type="place">Versailles</name> where the treaty was signed. The sun is bursting through the clouds of war and its rays light up
							the facade. The whole is framed by a decorative wreath. The inscription Peace of <name type="place">Versailles</name>, 1919, and the name of The American Numismatic Society
							complete the design ("Medal Commemorating the Signing of the Treaty of Peace," circular, undated, ANS Archives).</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>Silver and bronze medals were offered to members of the Society at $10 and $5, respectively; by special action of the Council, bronze medals were offered for sale to non-members
						at the same price ("Medal Commemorating the Signing of the Treaty of Peace," circular, undated, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>
                        <name type="pname">George F. Kunz</name> of Tiffany &amp; Co. placed an order for ten silver Peace Treaty medals, requesting that three be left unfinished. The appearance of
						these medals apparently differed little from the regular, finished examples. It seems that they were delivered to the Society as part of an order of medals without having been
						separated out or distinguished in any way. As a result, they were distributed with the regular medals. Two additional unfinished medals were therefore ordered, which were to be
						given serial numbers 68 and 69 (letter, <name type="pname">Sydney Noe</name> to <name type="pname">Mr. [Henri?] Weil</name>, May 3, 1919, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>Another issue that arose with this medal involved the artist's signature and name of the manufacturer. According to a motion approved by the Council on November 4, 1918, "no
						medal issued in the name of the Society shall bear the imprint of the manufacturer; and the signature of the sculptor shall be confined to a monogram or initials, the size and
						location of which shall be specifically approved by the Committee on Publications of Medals" (letter, <name type="pname">Sydney Noe</name> to <name type="pname">Mr. [Henri?]
							Weil</name>, April 5, 1919, ANS Archives). While the restriction on the artist's name lasted for some time, only a few medals were struck without reference to the mint
						responsible.</p>

                    <p>As usual with medals concerning <name type="place">European</name> royalty, this medal was suggested by <name type="pname">J.

						gold medal for presentation to the Prince, and six silver specimens for the Society (letter, <name type="pname">Saltus</name> to <name type="pname">Noe</name>, June 7, 1919,
						ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>In an undated circular, silver medals were offered by subscription at $10, and bronze medals for $5 ("Medal Commemorating the Visit of <name type="pname">H. R. H.</name> the
							<name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> to the <name type="place">United States</name>, November, MCMXIX," circular, undated, ANS Archives). Although originally stated as

						March 18, 1920, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>The gold medal was presented to the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> on board HMS <hi rend="italic">Renown</hi> on November 18, 1919. Present on behalf of the Society

                    <p>As with the Catskill Aqueduct medal several years earlier (see p. 101), the Society's role in the creation of this medal was minimal. Nevertheless, the Society's authorization
						and its participation in the medal's production and sale merit its inclusion in this catalogue.</p>
                    <p>The commission for this medal was offered to <name type="pname">French</name> by <name type="pname">Robert de Forest</name> in a letter dated March 31, 1919, with <name type="pname">French</name> accepting on April 9 (<name type="pname">Richman</name> 1988: 148). <name type="pname">De Forest</name> suggested to French that "either the
						program of your Catskill medal should be followed, that is a large medal which could be cast for presentation, with a possible reproduction in smaller size, or else the medal
						should be of the largest size that can be stamped with a die" (letter, <name type="pname">de Forest</name> to <name type="pname">French</name>, April 10, 1919, quoted in <name type="pname">Richman</name> 1988: 148).</p>
                    <p>The model for the obverse was <name type="pname">French's nephew Prentiss French</name>. The original reverse design showed a nurse behind a recumbent, wounded soldier. The
						change of positions as seen on the finished model, where the nurse stands in front of the soldier, was made on the suggestion of the artist <name type="pname">Will H.
							Low</name>. As a result, the reverse carries both <name type="pname">French's</name> and Low's initials (<name type="pname">Richman</name> 1988: 149). Another, presumably
						earlier version of this design was exhibited by <name type="pname">French</name> at <pb n="118"/> the 1923 National Sculpture Exhibition and illustrated in that catalogue.
						Listed as a struck medal, this version is most easily distinguished on the obverse by the vertically arranged letters AEF to the right of the bust and the more complete
						signature on the truncation (National Sculpture Society 1923: 291, 356).</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>French charged $1,250 for the artwork and $250 to make the dies, claiming he would normally have charged $2,500. Prices quoted for production were $4.00 each for 50 bronze
						medals or $3.75 each for 100–125 medals (<name type="pname">Richman</name> 1988: 155 n. 21).</p>
                    <p>The circular announcing the sale of bronze copies of the medal is dated <name type="pname">January 15, 1921</name>, and carries the names of both the American Red Cross and the
						American Numismatic Society at the top. It describes the twelve gold medals as having been presented to the members of the American Red Cross's War Council, the name of each
						recipient being engraved on the rim. An additional four medals in silver were noted as having been issued, but without further information. With the approval of the National
						Society, bronze examples were to be offered for sale to "Chapters and members of the Red Cross as well as to art museums and lovers of art". The subscription price for a bronze
						medal was $6 ("The American Red Cross Medal," circular, January 15, 1921, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>Although the mintage in bronze was 205 examples, the Society handled the sale of only 178. According to the medals ledger, the serial numbers of the bronze medals were 1–205,
						and 27 bronze medals were delivered directly to <name type="pname">de Forest</name> (medals ledger, ANS Archives). However, according to an account dated March 21, 1921, the
						medals delivered to the Society were to be numbered 51–228. Assuming the reported numbers of 12 gold and 4 silver are correct, and assuming all medals have a unique serial
						number regardless of composition, we would still be left with 7 medals unaccounted for with the numbers listed. The mintage figures listed should therefore be considered as
						approximate.</p>
                    <p>One of the silver medals can be found in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, donated by <name type="pname">Robert de Forest</name> (MMA 21.37). The edge bears the
						Medallic Art Co. stamp, but no indication regarding composition or serial number.</p>
                    <p>This medal was not the first effort at a collaboration between the Society and the American Red Cross. In early 1918, <name type="pname" corresp="#ans_newell">Edward Newell</name> had discussed with
							<name type="pname">George Peck</name> of the American Red Cross the joint <pb n="119"/> publication of a "Triumph Token". Designed by <name type="pname">Victor D.
							Brenner</name>, the model was approved by the Red Cross Committee with the intention that it be struck in bronze and sold for $1.00. In a letter dated March 16, 1918,
						Newell made a request to <name type="pname">Peck</name>, "In the same way that the seal of the American Numismatic Society is to be used as an indication that the Triumph Token
						has received the approval of those presumably able to adjudge its merits, so permission to employ the seal of the Red Cross Society is desired that there may be an
						understanding that no profit will accrue to any of the agencies through whom this token will be published" (letter, <name type="pname" corresp="#ans_newell">Newell</name> to <name type="pname">Peck</name>, March 16, 1918, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>In his reply to <name type="pname" corresp="#ans_newell">Newell</name> later that month, <name type="pname">Peck</name> conveyed the news that he had discussed with <name type="pname">Mr. S. M.
							Greer</name>, the Director of Development, American Red Cross, "the matter of the medal proposed to be issued by the Numismatic Society as a measure for aiding the Red
						Cross." Unfortunately, Greer thought it not advisable due to limitations imposed on the Red Cross by its charter and the possible appearance of this being merchandising
						(letter, <name type="pname">Peck</name> to <name type="pname" corresp="#ans_newell">Newell</name>, March 27, 1918, ANS Archives).</p>

                    <p>This medal was struck in cooperation with the Century Association, of which <name type="pname">Choate</name> had been president. In 1919 the ANS lent a number of medals and
						plaques for an exhibition held at the Century. As a result, that association decided to issue a series of medals in honor of men who had distinguished themselves in public
						service, the arts, letters, or other activities. The Choate medal was the first in this series.</p>
                    <p>In addition to members of the Society, subscriptions for this medal were offered to members of the Century Association, the Bar Association, the Harvard Club, and a limited list
						of other friends and collectors. The issue price was $10 for a silver specimen and $5 for one in bronze ("The Choate Medal," circular, undated, ANS Archives).</p>

                    <p>This medal was issued to commemorate the 150th anniversary of <name type="pname">Paul Revere's</name> historic ride. Due to the topics <name type="pname">J. Sanford
							Saltus</name> had chosen to sponsor, many of the medals issued in the preceding years had related to foreigners. This resulted in some criticism, which would be allayed by
						this and the following medal, issued for the tercentenary of the <name type="place">Dutch</name> purchase of <name type="place">Manhattan</name>. Despite the support of several
						jewelers and booksellers in <name type="place">New York</name> and <name type="place">Boston</name>, who offered the Revere medals for sale at cost, sales were deemed
						disappointing and the medal was a financial failure (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 224). However, it is likely that many of the medals issued in the years before
							<name type="pname">Saltus</name> died in 1922 would also have lost money if not for his generous support.</p>
                    <p>According to <name type="pname">Adelson</name>, the obverse of this medal required a certain amount of imagination, as "no medal with a satisfactory likeness of <name type="pname">Paul Revere</name> had ever been struck, and the portraits by <name type="pname">Gilbert Stuart</name> and <name type="pname">St. Memin</name> showed him only
						during his advanced years" (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 224). Evidently they were unable to obtain a copy of <name type="pname">Copley's</name> famous portrait of
							<name type="pname">Paul Revere</name>, which was then rarely exhibited. That portrait, painted in 1768, remained in the possession of the <name type="pname">Revere</name>
						family until 1930, when it was presented to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts by <name type="pname">Joseph W. Revere</name>, <name type="pname">William B. Revere</name>, and <name type="pname">Edward H. R. Revere</name> (MFA 30.781). The reverse caused some criticism, as <pb n="125"/> it looks like <name type="pname">Revere</name> is about to mount
						his horse from the wrong side (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 225). As described in the medal circular, Revere was only standing by his horse, waiting for his
						signal.</p>
                    <p>There has been some question as to the method of manufacture of this medal. Although it has often been described as cast, a number of contemporary references describe it as
						having been struck, though preparations were unusual. According to the original 1925 circular, "At his [<name type="pname">Francisci's</name>] suggestion, a radical departure
						in the form of our medal was agreed upon—the rounded edge—an element which contributes in no small degree to the attractiveness of the result. It is also of interest that the
						reverse was first modelled in the exact size of the medal itself. It was then enlarged and again reduced after having been retouched, this course having been taken in order to
						eliminate the pantographic effect of the reducing machine. The obverse was modelled on a scale of only three diameters" ("Medal Commemorating the Paul Revere Sesqui-centennial,
						MCMXXV," circular, undated, ANS Archives). The belief that this medal was cast may be due, at least in part, to the rounded edge. However, the circular further stated that "a
						limited number will be struck and ready for delivery by April 18th, the date of the ride".</p>

                    <p>This medal was originally conceived as being issued in honor of the 300th anniversary of the founding of <name type="place">New York</name>. However, due to uncertainty over the

						1925). This was a joint issue with the New-York Historical Society and the initials of both societies can be seen on the reverse, in the lower left. Like the Paul Revere medal
						(see p. 124), this medal was considered a financial failure; without the financial support previously provided by <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name>, <name type="pname">J.

                    <p>The issue price for this medal was set at $10 for silver and $5 for bronze. A limited number of medals ordered were to be available for delivery by May 4, the anniversary of the

                    <p>The 1930s saw several important anniversaries connected with <name type="pname">George Washington</name>. Although the 1932 bicentennial of <name type="pname">Washington</name>'s birth was the one that seems to have most caught the public's interest, <name type="pname">Howard Adelson</name> offered the opinion that the Society made
						a conscious decision to honor only one event, due to the close proximity in time (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 250). More important, perhaps, might have been the
						combined effects of the Great Depression and the lack of financial success of some of the more recent medals. Without the financial backing of supporters such as <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name>, the true cost of striking medals became a greater concern than in the past, and the relatively low mintage of this issue, even in
						1939 when the Depression was less severe, is an indication of how difficult an earlier medal might have been. The financial situation, which began to show improvement by 1935,
						would certainly have been a factor in deciding to issue a medal in 1939, and not earlier (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> 1958: 244).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the thirty-eight silver and ninety-five bronze medals, at least one silvered bronze example was struck, which can be found in the Society's cabinet (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1939.75.2">ANS 1939.75.2</ref>). A bronze medal bearing serial number 100 has been reliably reported. Although documentation has
						not been located, it would seem that the Medallic Art Company likely struck 100 numbered examples but only delivered the 95 ordered, the remaining medals being relegated to the
						company's archives or corporate use.</p>

                        <q>When Nature petrified the first forms of animal and plant life, Nature made the first dies. The obverse of the American Numismatic Society Centennial Medal shows the
							potential archeologist, who, having broken a stone asunder, discovers a petrified animal form in one half and in the other a perfect impression of it, or the die.</q>
                        <q>Since tablets, coins and medals constitute the authority for historical data and our earliest civilizations expressed themselves in terms of their particular mythologies, on
							the reverse of the medal I used the Pegasus as a symbol of the arts, to indicate as in a vision, that numismatics was a science from the era of the <name type="pname">Pegasus</name> to the geo-physical year of the harnessing of the atom.</q>
                        <q>To the fore of this vision are the artisans who are in the act of forging a medal, using such tools as are the basis of modern medal making" ("Centennial Medal of the
							American Numismatic Society" [leaflet]).</q>

                    <p>The commission for this medal was given to <name type="pname">Laura Gardin Fraser</name> without resorting to any competition. In accepting, <name type="pname">Fraser</name>
						noted that there would be no obligation on the part of the Society if the designs were not satisfactory (letter, <name type="pname">Laura Gardin Fraser</name> to <name type="pname">Louis C. West</name>, June 23, 1957, ANS Archives). In fact, <name type="pname">Fraser's</name> original design was only accepted after substantial
						modification. On July 9, <name type="pname">Fraser</name> submitted a photograph of her sketch for the medal, with the reverse showing "the role that Numismatics have played in
						rendering the most complete record of history from the era of Pegasus to the rocket and the smashing of the atom". <name type="pname">Fraser</name> further wrote that "in the
						finished model the rocket would be more discernible with the purifying of its form as it is seen against the cloud effect suggestive of the atomic burst" (letter, <name type="pname">Laura Gardin Fraser</name> to <name type="pname">Louis C. West</name>, July 9, 1957, ANS Archives).</p>
                    <p>In response, <name type="pname">President Louis West</name> expressed some reservations about the design for the reverse. In addition to minor recommendations, such as one
						regarding the placement of the Society's oak leaves, he suggested "… a slight change in your present sketch by showing the two workmen more clearly making a coin or medal
						surmounted, perhaps with the <name type="pname">Pegasus</name> you now have but, if you wish, with a cloud instead of an atomic burst" (letter, <name type="pname">Louis C.
							West</name> to <name type="pname">Laura Gardin Fraser</name>, July 10, 1957, ANS Archives). In the end, the final version displayed classical images with no apparent
						reference to the modern, atomic age.</p>

						1953 the Council voted to retire <name type="pname">Noe</name> with the title <name type="pname">Chief Curator Emeritus</name>.</p>
                    <p>A specialist in Greek coins, <name type="pname">Noe</name> also researched <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> colonial coinage and <name type="place">Mexican</name>
						hacienda tokens. He published more than forty monographs and articles. Among the honors he received were the Society's Huntington Medal in 1938 and the Medal of the Royal
						Numismatic Society in 1949. After his retirement, <name type="pname">Noe</name> continued to go to the Society several days a week. The Council presented him with this gold
						medal in 1965 in recognition of fifty years of service to the Society. <name type="pname">Noe</name> died four years later at age 84 (American Numismatic Society n.d.).</p>

                        <q>He has held many posts with us, starting with that of Librarian and Secretary, Editor, later <name type="pname">Curator</name> and, since 1953, <name type="pname">Curator

                    <p>The bicentennial of American independence saw a tremendous explosion in the number of medals issued, <pb n="135"/> a trend which proved remarkably short-lived. This was the
						official New York State Bicentennial medal. The Society's involvement in this medal was limited to sponsoring the 1972 design competition, in cooperation with the Medallic Art
						Company and the New York State American Revolution Bicentennial Commission. It also lent use of its seal, which can be seen on the obverse below the date 1776. With the
						exception of the small silver proof medal that was sold as part of a set of proof medals of the thirteen original colonies, these were sold by banks throughout the state. The
						gold medal was housed in a red box, while the bronze and silver medals were issued in black card holders. Several off-metal strikes are known, most notably in silvered bronze
						and marked SAMPLE.</p>
                    <p>There are small design differences between the large and small versions of this medal, most notably in the relief and the fact that the dates are incuse on the larger medals but
						in relief on the smaller ones. The large medals and the small silver medals with a proof finish have plain edges, while the small medals with a matte finish have reeded edges;
						in addition, all silver medals bear serial numbers on the edge.</p>

						a pair of uniface lead die trials (<ref target="http://numismatics.org/collection/1978.137.3">ANS 1978.137.3</ref> and 1978.137.4). The box containing the obverse trial carries

                    <p>In the October 6, 1982, issue of <hi rend="italic">Coin World</hi>, the various artists' entries were published, with a free medal being offered to the first five readers who
						could correctly match the artist with each entry. Included in the article for comparison were identified illustrations of another medal by each artist ("Match Medallists, Works
						to Win Top Design Medal," <hi rend="italic">Coin World</hi>, October 6, 1982, pp. 3, 32). Only one reader, <name type="pname">N. Neil Harris</name>, was successful ("ANS

                    <p>Despite the Council's rejection of the original, recommended design, some members of the 125th Anniversary Medal Committee were so pleased with it that twelve sets of uniface
						bronze casts were ordered from the artist.

                    <p>The design for this medal was the result of an open competition which required that submissions be in the hands of the jury by March 15, 1985 (draft, Competition Fact Sheet,
							<name type="pname">Alan M. Stahl</name> correspondence, ANS Archives). More than forty submissions were received and reviewed by the Medals Committee on March 30, 1985. The
						committee's selection of a design by <name type="pname">Eugene Daub</name> was unanimously approved by the Council (letter, <name type="pname">Alan M. Stahl</name> to Committee

						7–9, 1999, as lot 2094 of the <name type="pname">Harry W. Bass, Jr.</name>, sale. One hundred silver medals with an antique finish were initially ordered and housed in blue
						velvet-covered presentation cases. When this proved insufficient for demand, an additional fifty were ordered; these were contained in simple card cases. Additionally, the
						original strikes can be identified by a serial number of the form xx / 100, while the later strikes only indicate the serial number alone. The 500 bronze specimens, also
						numbered, were given a green torch finish to emulate the finish on the statue itself. These were issued in white card boxes bearing the Society's seal in gold on the cover. The
						issue prices were $30 for bronze, $175 for silver, and $200 for a set of bronze and silver.</p>

                    <p>The gold medal was presented to <name type="pname">Donald Partrick</name> at the annual meeting on October 23, 2004.

Work on the medal was conducted in secret over a period of several months by a committee consisting
						of Executive Director <name type="pname">Ute Wartenberg Kagan</name>, <name type="pname">Tony Terranova</name>, <name type="pname">Roger Siboni</name>, <name type="pname">Stephen Scher</name>, <name type="pname">Scott Miller</name>, <name type="pname">Donald Scarinci</name>, and <name type="pname">Jonathan Kagan</name>. Presentation of the

						him.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the unique gold medal presented to <name type="pname">President Partrick</name>, bronze and silver sets were presented to major donors, with bronze examples
						available for sale to members and the public at $175 and $200, respectively. The medal also served to commemorate the Society's move to its new home <pb n="153"/> at <name type="place">Fulton</name> and <name type="place">William Streets</name>, as noted in the Latin phrase "domus nova", or "new home". The pine tree was placed on the obverse
						as a reference to <name type="pname">Partrick's</name> interest in American Colonial coins. The obverse design is unusual in that no name is given to identify the portrait. At
						the suggestion of <name type="pname">Ute Wartenberg Kagan</name>, who noted that the new building was to be known as the <name type="pname">Donald Groves</name> Building, and
						of <name type="pname">Donald Scarinci</name>, the initials DGP were included to identify the subject, but in letters so small as to require a magnifying glass to read—a measure
						the committee thought would please <name type="pname">Mr. Partrick</name>.</p>
                    <p>As an additional sign of their esteem, the committee also arranged to present to <name type="pname">Partrick</name> an original, framed sketch of one of the rejected designs.
						This version depicted <name type="pname">Partrick</name> examining a coin through a magnifying glass.</p>

                    <p>During the Society's annual gala dinner in January 2006, a uniface silver example of this medal was presented to <name type="pname">Q. David Bowers</name>, who also received the
						Trustees Award that year. The original mintage was very small, and examples were not offered for sale as is the general custom. However, due to the number of requests for
						examples of this medal, the Society decided to strike a two-sided version which would be made available to the public. It was issued in both silver and bronze.</p>
                    <p>Publication of this medal was announced in the summer of 2010, and it was available by subscription until October 31, 2010. According to the original announcement, "In 2006 the
						ANS honored <name type="pname">Q. David Bowers</name> for his contributions to numismatic scholarship and for promoting coin collecting to a broad and growing audience" ("<name type="pname">Q. David Bowers</name> Medal," <hi rend="italic">American Numismatic Society E-News</hi>, June/July 2010).</p>
                    <p>The coin depicted in the owl's claws on the reverse is based on those of ancient <name type="place">Taras</name>. Minted during the fifth and fourth centuries BC, they depict
						the personification of <name type="place">Taras</name> riding on a dolphin.</p>
                    <p>The issue prices for this medal were $165 for silver, $45 for bronze, and $195 for a set of both; ANS members were able to purchase examples at the reduced prices of $150, $35,
						and $165, respectively.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the dinner, held January 12, 2006, remarks in honor of <name type="pname">Mr. Bowers</name> were presented by <name type="pname">Beth Deisher</name>, Editor

                <p>On November 8–9, 1997, the second Coinage of the Americas Conference (COAC) on the theme of the Medal in America was held at the American Numismatic Society. The first day consisted
					of the presentation of papers on American medals, while the second day consisted of workshops in medal- and die-engraving by <name type="pname">Virginia Janssen</name> and <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name>; both aspects of engraving were covered in the papers published in the proceedings of the conference. During the course of the workshops, <name type="pname">Janssen</name> and <name type="pname">Landis</name> produced two medals.</p>
                <p>Although not made available for sale to its members by the Society, these two medals were created under its auspices and distributed to the attendees of the workshops.</p>

                <p>While researching this book, it quickly became apparent that some medals have mistakenly been either attributed to the ANS or omitted from the canon. Over the years, there have been
					at least four attempts to list medals issued by the American Numismatic Society; none has been completely without error. I am sure that in years to come, another researcher will
					remark that the last five attempts have not been without error. In all fairness, I should mention that I would never have even attempted this work were it not possible, like <name type="place">Newton</name>, to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
                <p>Of the various medals that have been erroneously thought of as being issued by the Society, that for the Actors Fund has, in recent years, been classified by many as an ANS issue
					due to the small ANS seal that appears on the obverse of some examples. In addition, others that have been included in the list of official medals are debatable, such as the
					Catskill Aqueduct medal, which has already been addressed.</p>

                        </hi>, March 13, 1910). It was to be presented by twelve leading actresses to President <name type="pname">William Howard Taft</name> when he opened the Actors' Fund Fair on
						May 9. In addition to the gold medal, 1,000 silver medals were to be struck for guests and 5,000 bronze specimens for the public. A brief notice in <hi rend="italic">The
							Numismatist</hi> for April 1910 noted that the medal was commissioned by <name type="pname">Archer Huntington</name> and that 100 silver and 1,000 bronze examples were to
						be struck (<name type="pname">Lagerberg</name> 1910: 113). However, based on the frequency with which this medal appears, it would seem that even the more modest mintage
						figures were never realized.</p>
                    <p>There has been much speculation about this medal as a possible issue by the American Numismatic Society due to the fact that a number of examples have appeared with what appears
						to be a small depiction of the Society's seal. A photograph of the original plaster model can be found in the 1911 edition of the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the
							International Exhibition of Contemporary Medal</hi>s (<name type="pname">Baldwin</name> 1911). The ANS seal is clearly absent in that photo. It therefore appears that
						originally, at least, there was no intention of placing the seal on the medal. Whether its faint presence was an error by the die maker or was based on the hope that the ANS
						would give its permission to include its seal, as it had for other organizations, remains speculative. <pb n="165"/> However, as no documentation has yet appeared to establish
						a connection with the Society, it would appear that this cannot be classified among those medals issued by or under the auspices of the ANS.</p>

					together books relating to the subject, as also in the formation of a collection of coins and medals. — Patient work and careful attention has finally awarded our endeavors, — for
					we have the largest library of numismatic works in this country, and our cabinets for coins and medals now contain upwards of 20,000 specimens.</p>
                <p>When you realize that the Society has never had any sum of money to expend in accomplishing these objects, — and has always supported itself, and printed its annual proceedings by
					dues from members, we feel that we should be proud of our record.</p>
                <p>Naturally we work in a limited field, numismatists are generally termed cranks — and I am frank to say are really few and far between. What we have gathered has been due in the main
					to the kindly interest and beneficent donations of a few enthusiastic members, who have always endeavored to do what little they could to promote and further the interests of our
					Society. On various occasions we have also caused medals to be struck, of which there now exists quite an interesting series, that bear either the name or seal of the Society</p>
                <p>Among those worth [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of mention are the following:-</p>

                </list>
                <p>For a long time, so great was the difficulty in securing artists who could do good work in this country, that several of these medals were ordered abroad and were designed and cut
					by <name type="pname">Mme. Lea Ahlborn</name>, the talented medallist of the Swedish Mint.</p>
                <pb n="168"/>
                <p>Much time is also devoted by the Society in answering inquiries regarding coins and medals which come from all over the <name type="place">United States</name>, and to the
					dissemination of general information on these subjects.</p>
                <p>It is not my wish at this time to give you a lot of details, or a history of the Society. Our main object at the present time is to raise the standard of coin and medal designing
					and die cutting in this country. — This to me is a subject that has never received enough careful attention on this side of the water, the work done here has been of rather poor
					workmanship, and has shown but little originality of design. — Looking the whole field over we find but few specimens that are of higher class than the political or commemorative
					medals that are peddled on the streets at the time of such celebrations. — Then when we turn to the coinage of the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint we notice a
					retrograde movement from the very beginning, and today we have a design on our half-dollars, quarters and dimes — that I am frank to say could be taken for either a male or female
					head. Only one of our present coins really shows merit, and that is our copper cent which appeared in 1859, and has been issued without change since that date. The rest of the
					current issue serve to represent the value stamped thereon, and as far as this is concerned answer the purpose. I regret, however, that very little can be said as to their showing
					any artistic design or work.</p>
                <p>The first issues of our coins and medals — following the War of the Revolution — were of bold executions and classic style, being in the main of <name type="place">French</name>
					origin, and either the work of <name type="place">French</name> artists, or in part copies of their designs, and with a few rare exceptions the science of die cutting has since
					shown more deterioration than advancement.</p>
                <p>Today we have one or two among us who are making great progress, and some really artistic medals are the first fruits of the new era — as an example let me call attention to the
					recently issued medal commemorating the visit of <name type="pname">Prince Henry</name> of <name type="place">Prussia</name>, designed by <name type="pname">Mr. Victor D.
						Brenner</name>, a member of our Society.</p>
                <p>It is to be hoped that the new standard of excellence may ultimately reach the <name type="place">United States</name> mint, and that we may yet have coins that we will be proud of,
					and that will compare favorably with those struck abroad. — As a Society — we are "Contributing our mite" to educate the people as to this particular class of art, — so that there
					will be a better understanding as to what is requisite to produce effective and artistic work, — and at the present time we are supporting in this city a School for Coin &amp;
					Medal Designing &amp; Die Cutting, Cö-operating with the National Academy of Design, — feeling that by cultivating the root we may finally raise a tree or two that will bear fruit.
					It is going to be a slow process, but we hope the ultimate results will show that our labor is not in vain.</p>
                <p>In concluding, permit me to state, that our Society is located in the Dime Savings Bank B'ld'g, Cor. 32nd St. &amp; B'dway. On Thursday afternoons &amp; evenings our Rooms are
					always open to the public, and it affords us great pleasure to extend a cordial invitation to all interested in coins and medals — to come and see — what we have — and what we are
					doing.—</p>
