Robinson</name> of Newport and the Curator of the American Numismatic Society as to the probable method or methods of silver plating as exemplified in ancient coins—the <hi rend="italic">fourée</hi> or <hi rend="italic">subaerati</hi> pieces. <name type="pname">Dr. Robinson</name> had given considerable study to the problems involved and had made a number of experiments. Up to that time, however, he had been unsuccessful in enlisting the aid of anyone prepared to carry forward the investigation scientifically. Knowing the wonderful results to be obtained with the metallographic microscope, especially after etching, I offered to make a metallographic examination of any samples he cared to submit. This monograph is the result of that offer.</p>
            <p>A preliminary examination was made of a couple of specimens which showed clearly that the silver coating was stuck to the copper core by means of an alloy of silver and copper with a low melting point—in other words, the alloy containing 72% silver and 28% copper, melting and freezing at 778° C., called the eutectic alloy, or, in the trade, pure silver solder.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>The examination was complicated by the presence of more or less corrosion of the copper core beneath the silver coating, but enough uncorroded areas were found to permit exact determinations. To make sure that these were not exceptional cases, <name type="pname">Dr. Robinson</name> supplied ten ancient counterfeits as well as an experimental piece of his own to demonstrate close-plating. The other two of the coins under consideration in Part I were supplied by The American Numismatic Society. Most of these specimens had been carefully cut into halves by <name type="pname">Dr. Robinson</name>. One each of these respective halves was mounted in the manner hereinafter described. The other half sections not so treated are illustrated on Plates A and B in order to show where the cut was made.</p>
            <p>To <name type="pname">Dr. Robinson</name> I am indebted for the original idea of this work as well as for most of the samples on which to work.</p>

               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> and the other officers of the Society I am indebted for encouragement and advice.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Preparation of Specimens</hi>.</head>
               <p>In order to obtain a flat cross section for microscopic examination the <hi rend="italic">half coins</hi> were mounted in small brass cups filled with fusible metal (bismuth, 4; lead, 2; tin, 1; and cadmium, I) melting at about 75° C. Each specimen was then filed down flat by rubbing the flat surface on a "smooth" file held horizontally in a vise. Having obtained a perfectly flat surface the piece was rubbed on No. O emery paper until all the file marks had disappeared. It was then rubbed on Nos. O and OO French emery papers, stopping as soon as the scratches of the previous paper had been removed. The next step consisted of polishing out all the scratches of the OO French paper on a horizontal revolving disc, covered with fine broadcloth armed with levigated alumina and kept quite moist. After four or five minutes on this broadcloth disc the surface is perfectly bright and all scratches have disappeared. The specimen is carefully washed under the tap to free it from all polishing powder and then dried with absolute alcohol.</p>

               <p>The sample is now ready for examination. Under the microscope, which is illuminated by prism in a collar just above the objective so as to give vertical light, the specimen shows a pinkish core of copper, surrounded by an envelope of bright white silver, which is again surrounded by the fusible metal matrix. In most of the specimens the copper core showed corrosion in the form of copper oxides or carbonate lying between the silver coating and copper as irregular patches. By vertical light this corrosion product appears in different shades of gray, but with oblique light it has its natural colors, claret red to clear red for the oxides, and green for the carbonate.</p>
               <p>To bring out the structure of the silver coating and of the copper core the specimen is etched with a solution of hydrogen peroxide in ammonia by gently rubbing the surface with a swab of absorbent cotton. The etching is stopped as soon as the crystalline structure of the copper becomes clear to the eye. The specimen is then washed thoroughly under the tap and dried with absolute alcohol as before.</p>

               <p>The microscope takes the place of the lens in the camera. The image on the screen is focussed just as in visual examination, by the fine adjustment of the microscope.</p>
               <p>Two equipments were used. The first was an old-fashioned vertical microscope and camera and this was used for magnifications of 60 and some at 100 diameters of the first micrographs taken. Later an inverted microscope was used for a magnification of 500 diameters as well as for lower magnifications at 25 and 100 diameters. This equipment uses a prism between the objective and the ocular to throw the image from the vertical into the horizontal, because the camera lies in the horizontal position and thus can be extended to any length desired. This prism naturally reverses the image, so that pictures taken with this equipment seem and are reversed with respect to those taken with the normal vertical microscope-camera equipment. Where necessary, attention is called to this in the text.</p>
               <p>The first twelve of the coins which follow are fairly well distributed geographically as well as in point of time.

the Roman coins four are issues of the republic, the so-called consular or family coins dating from the second to the first centuries B. C. The last is a piece bearing the head of the Emperor Domitian (81-96 A. D.).</p>
               <p>From the description it will be seen that "coin 13" is an experimental piece prepared by <name type="pname">Dr. Robinson</name>, showing the structures which result when tin is used as a soldering medium. When the enlargements of this experimental piece showed that there was no analogy with the structures of the previously studied coins, Experiments A and B were decided upon. In the first copper-silver solder was used—in the second the Sheffield plate method was duplicated—that is, no solder at all was used. Enlargements of the cross sections show the structures thus obtained and make them available for comparison with those developed in the coins.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Conclusion</hi>. From what follows it is evident that the silver coating was not produced by dipping a copper blank into either molten silver or a molten silver-copper alloy. The process of producing Sheffield plate, in which a coating or sheet of silver was attached to a copper slab by heating the two in close contact to a temperature at which they firmly adhered to each other, through the production of a film of the eutectic alloy by diffusion, could not give rise to the structures met with here. It would seem that silver solder had been employed, using an alloy of 72 silver, 28 copper, possibly with a flux, and that, having attached the silver coating, more silver solder was added, and a second heating caused this additional solder to "run", dissolving more or less of the original silver coating and producing the structures seen in Figures I<hi rend="sup">b</hi>, I<hi rend="sup">c</hi>, I<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and I<hi rend="sup">e</hi> on the under side of the coin. It is possible that a single disc of thin silver was cupped or dished over the copper blank, then the edges flattened over till they roughly met near the center, just as silver buttons have been made in the past. A supply of silver solder was applied at this point and the whole heated strongly until the solder flowed easily. Such a method would account for the structures shown on the lower side in Figures I<hi rend="sup">c</hi>, I<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and I<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, for the excess solder at C could undoubtedly dissolve the silver coating at that point. But this does not explain the structures on the upper side at C and A, Figures I<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and I<hi rend="sup">e</hi>.</p>

Such a structure would be produced by making a cup and cap of sheet silver and joining them to the copper core by means of the copper-silver solder, but on account of the irregularity of the eutectic alloy it is quite possible that no solder was used and the eutectic was produced by heating the two metals in contact as in the process of making Sheffield Plate.</p>

This is the best example of a silver coating applied in two pieces, lapping one over the other and soldering the whole by the silver-copper eutectic which was applied in pieces as in the ordinary method of silver soldering. The heat was not high enough or the copper surface was not clean enough to produce an even flow of the solder, hence the unsoldered areas between copper and silver. However, it is possible that this coin may have been produced by the old Sheffield plate method, though the structures at A and E seem to prove the use of silver solder.</p>

The coin looks like silver but in places has a fine pitted appearance. It was mounted whole and filed down well below the outer skin. The interior has a silvery appearance. Under the microscope the core has all the appearance of pure silver, but at the surface it has a peculiar corroded appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Conclusion</hi>. Such a structure is very similar to that of corroded sterling silver or standard silver 900 fine, in which the copper has become oxidized at the surface. Some filings were therefore taken from the inner core and dissolved in nitric acid, but the solution failed to show a trace of blue color, which proves that the core is practically pure silver, or at least that it contains no copper. Hence the surface structure cannot be due to oxidation of copper, unless the surface layer did contain some copper while the core was pure silver, which hardly seems reasonable.</p>

A copper blank was taken and two pieces of silver foil were burnished over it. The whole was joined with a film of tin and then struck between dies. The surface shows a distinct lap where the one piece of foil overlaps the other. A cross section was cut and polished and three distinct zones were seen, the copper core, a tin-rich solder containing silver and copper, and the outer coating of silver.

            <p>In order to compare the structure produced by joining silver to copper by means of solder, with that resulting from a junction produced by heat alone as in the old method of making Sheffield Plate, two samples were made by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_111979379">Mr. Robert Leach</name> of the <name type="pname">Handy</name> &amp; <name type="pname">Harman</name> Company.</p>
            <p>In the first, a sheet of silver 1/8 of an inch thick was placed between two pieces of pure copper each ½ of an inch thick and 1 inch wide. Two pieces of copper were used so that the junction of the copper and the silver would lie in the center of the sample which would make the preparation of a perfectly flat specimen comparatively easy.</p>
            <p>Experiment A was made using silver solder, 72% Ag, 28% Cu. Cross sections about one-half of an inch thick were cut from each, polished and etched with ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. Micrographs with a magnification of 35, 100 and 500 .diameters were taken to show details of structure.</p>

by covering the copper cores with silver sheet, cupped and overlapping, the whole being joined by a relatively fusible silver copper alloy, in most cases the eutectic alloy which melts at 778° C.</p>
               <p>Others were apparently made by sprinkling the copper core with powdered silver or silver copper alloy and heating strongly till the powder melted and "ran", or by dipping the copper core in liquid eutectic alloy or one rather richer in silver.</p>
               <p>The joining of the silver coating to the copper core to produce such structures can be done in two ways. The first, by using silver solder, would explain all of the structures found but not their marked irregularities. The second, in which no solder is used, is the same as that discovered by Bolsover for making Sheffield plate, in which the two metals are heated in contact to the point where a film of the eutectic alloy is produced (i. e. 778° C.). This gives rise usually to an irregular layer of the eutectic alloy such as occurs in most of the samples above. If we assume that silver solder was not known down to the time of <name type="pname">Pliny</name>, for he does not mention it, then it would seem that the Sheffield plate or diffusion method must have been used by the ancients, where the copper core is covered with sheet silver.</p>

               </head>
               <p>On the Constitution and Structure of the Alloys of Copper and Silver.</p>
               <p>The constitutional diagram of the silver copper series of alloys is shown in Fig. 1 with temperature in the vertical scale and composition in the horizontal.</p>
               <p>The curve AE is the freezing-point curve of silver which is lowered as the copper in the alloy increases. The curve CE is the freezing-point curve of the copper which is lowered as the silver in the alloy increases, for the addition of copper to silver or of silver to copper depresses the freezing-point of the metals.</p>
               <p>These two curves intersect at the point E which is the alloy with the lowest freezing point of the series. It contains 72% of silver, 28% of copper and melts and freezes at the same temperature 778° C. This is the eutectic alloy and is a mechanical mixture of copper and silver.</p>
               <p>Any alloy with less than 28% copper consists of grains and dendrites of silver surrounded by a matrix of the eutectic while any alloy with more than 28% of copper consists of grains and dendrites of copper in a matrix of the eutectic.</p>
               <p>In alloys cooled at normal rate in the air if more than ½% of copper is present we find the
<pb n="146"/>
eutectic under the microscope, while if more than ½% silver is present the same thing happens. In other words, between ½ and 99½% of copper there is more or less eutectic present in the solid alloy. The end of freezing or the beginning of melting is shown by the curves AaEcC. From the above an air-cooled alloy consisting of 50% silver dendrites and 50% of eutectic ought to contain 28 + ½% of copper divided by 2 or 14¼% copper, for the silver crystals should contain ½% of copper in solid solution and the eutectic contain 28% of copper. The same applies to the copper-rich alloys.</p>
               <p>But these air-cooled or cast alloys are not in a state of equilibrium because the silver crystals or dendrites are not saturated with copper, neither are the copper crystals saturated with silver. This state of equilibrium is only brought about by very slow cooling or, more rapidly, by annealing at high temperatures near the melting point. When equilibrium is reached, the silver or copper crystals are saturated with copper or silver, as the case may be. The saturation point, however, varies with the temperature; the higher the temperature the greater the solubility in the solid state, as shown by the solubility curves <hi rend="italic">fg</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hk,</hi> the former being the solid solubility curve of copper in silver and the latter that of silver in copper. These have not yet been determined with
<pb n="147"/>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-138">

extreme accuracy, but are approximately as given. The point <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is about 1% copper while <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is probably just over 9% copper. Hence our 50% silver dendrites, 50% eutectic alloy does not have only ½% Cu in solid solution in the silver. In the first place, the original silver crystals have a composition lying somewhere between <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> say 5+% of copper. They are not homogeneous, but have cores richer in silver. As the temperature falls, these crystals of silver become saturated with copper at the solubility curve <hi rend="italic">fg</hi> and copper begins to separate out, mainly at the crystal boundaries. At normal temperature the silver dendrites have only 1% of copper in solid solution. Hence our alloy really consists of silver dendrites and grains, surrounded by envelopes of precipitated copper in a matrix of the eutectic. In the same way the copper and silver of the eutectic mixture contained 8½% and 9% of the other in solid solution <hi rend="italic">(h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> percent) at the freezing point 778° C. but at normal temperature they contain ½% and 1% respectively <hi rend="italic">(k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> percent) due to precipitation of the excess over and above that shown by the solubility curves <hi rend="italic">hk</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fg.</hi> For example, sterling silver 925 fine (92.5% of silver, 7.5% of copper) at ordinary temperatures consists of grains of silver with about 1% of copper in solid solution, the excess copper being found as tiny flakes precipitated in the cleavage
<pb n="149"/>
planes and at the boundaries of the silver crystals. This copper, of course, is saturated with silver. On annealing at temperatures about 750° C. above the solubility curve <hi rend="italic">gf,</hi> the copper goes into solution in the silver crystals and we have a homogeneous alloy, a solid solution of copper in silver, assuming that <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is 9% or a trifle more. While quenching in water from this temperature does not prevent the copper from precipitating again, the flakes and particles of copper occur in very much smaller size than in the case of the slowly cooled alloy, in fact they are submicroscopic and can only be shown by X-ray methods, and hence the color is improved by quenching and the metal does not discolor so rapidly. For the same reason standard silver which contains 10% of copper (900 fine) has a much poorer color than sterling silver and discolors more quickly, even when quenched for at 750° C. the solubility is only 8% of copper, leaving 2% undissolved. The greater the copper content the more readily does silver corrode as shown by the new silver coinage of Great Britain which is only 50% silver (500 fine).</p>
               <p>Just as in the lead-tin series the eutectic alloy with 63% of tin melting at 182° C. (tin solder), can be used as a solder for lead or tin whose melting points are 3270 C. and 2320 C. respectively, so the eutectic alloy of silver and copper with
<pb n="150"/>
72% silver and melting at 778° C. makes an excellent solder for silver or copper, whose melting points are 961° C. and 1084° C. respectively. Modern silver solders contain, in addition, varying amounts of zinc which lowers the melting point and tends to keep the white color.</p>
               <p>It is generally believed that the ancient Greeks were ignorant of the art of soldering, while the Romans were familiar with soft soldering but not with silver soldering which was invented in the middle ages by melting together silver and copper. In this regard, Theophilus in his <hi rend="italic">De Diversis Artibus</hi> (late in the 11th Century) says of silver solder ". . . weigh two parts of pure silver and a third part of copper and mix, and finely rasp into a clean vessel and put this in a quill. Take winestone and burn it till no vapor comes off. Grind in a copper vessel with water and salt until it is as thick as lees; with a thin piece of wood you anoint the pieces to be soldered . . .". At a later date silver solder was made by melting together silver and brass.</p>
               <p>That the ancients were acquainted with pure silver soldering at least 300 B. C. is shown by some of the coins in the above examination, assuming these plated coins were contemporaneous with the genuine silver ones, which undoubtedly they were, as vouched for by <name type="pname">Mr. Newell</name>.</p>
               <pb n="151"/>
               <p>That they were well aware of the process of joining silver to copper without solder is also shown by some of these coins. In other words, when Bolsover discovered or invented the method of making Sheffield plate, it was truly one of the lost arts of the ancients.</p>

               <p>Liber XXXIII. Par. 93. Chap. V, Sect. 29. "Goldsmiths also claim chrysocolla as their own for soldering gold, saying that all other varieties with a similar verdant hue were named from this one. It is mixed in due proportion with <name type="pname">Cyprian</name> verdigris and the urine of a beardless boy. Nitrum (carbonate of soda) is added, and the whole triturated with a pestle of <name type="pname">Cyprian</name> copper in a mortar of the same material. The mixture obtained we call santerna. With it is soldered gold which contains silver, the presence of which is indicated by the brilliance of the surface when the santerna is applied. On the other hand, gold which contains copper, contracts and grows dull, and is soldered with difficulty. For this kind of metal, the solder is made by adding gold and one-

seventh part of silver to the substances mentioned above, and grinding them all together."</p>
               <p>Par. 93 (Notes). We are told that <name type="pname">Galen</name> and <name type="pname">Dioscorides</name> omit nitrum from the recipe for santerna. Nitrum was probably sodium carbonate, not our nitre. Alloys of copper, silver and gold are in use as gold solders. No doubt in soldering with chrysocolla some metallic copper was deposited and presented a clean metallic surface suitable for union.</p>
               <p>Liber XXXIII. Par. 86. Chap. V, Sect. 26. "Chrysocolla is an exudation found in the shafts which we have already mentioned. It oozes down the vein of gold, and its muddy substance is congealed under the influence of the winter cold till it is as hard as pumice. It is well established that the best quality forms in copper mines and the next best in silver mines. It occurs in lead mines also, but this kind is inferior to that found in gold mines."</p>
               <p>Par. 86. (Notes) Chrysocolla. The identity of chrysocolla has been a matter of some dispute. The use from which the name is derived suggested that it was a borax, a meaning still given by <name type="pname">Lewis</name> and <name type="pname">Short</name>, while Ajasson held that the chrysocolla strewn on <name type="pname">Nero's</name> arena was yellow mica or talc. Both these views are clearly wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Dioscorides</name> gives an abbreviated account, probably drawn from the same source as <name type="pname">Pliny's</name>.
<pb n="153"/>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q22074744">Isidorus</name> says that chrysocolla is a product of copper mines, and when found in gold and silver mines is due to the presence of copper.</p>
               <p>The usual identification with malachite or basic copper carbonate, is clearly correct, though it is quite possible that other copper minerals such as the modern chrysocolla (a silicate of copper) are included under the name.</p>
               <p>Liber XXXIII. Par. 94. Chap. V, Sect. 30. "Other similar facts may well be grouped with this, that Nature may have her meed of admiration from all. Gold is soldered with the mixture described above, iron with clay, masses of copper with cadmea, copper plates with alum, lead and marble with resin, but black lead (lead) is soldered with white lead (tin), and white lead to itself by means of oil. Stagnum too is soldered with copper, and silver with stagnum. Pine-logs make the best fire for melting copper and iron, but Egyptian papyrus is also serviceable, and gold is melted on a fire of chaff. Lime develops heat in contact with water, and so does Thracian stone. The latter is quenched by oil, but fire is best quenched by vinegar and birdlime and egg. Earth is the least combustible of all substances. Charcoal, on a second ignition, burns more furiously."</p>
               <p>Par. 94. (Notes) The soldering materials given here are unclassified, some forming part of the joint, some acting simply as cleaning materials or
<pb n="154"/>
as fluxes. Alumen, no doubt, was a cleaning material. Resin is still used as a flux for soft alloys, and oil for pewter and Britannia metal.</p>
               <p>Cadmea. Cf. H. N. 34, 100, ff., where several varieties obtained as sublimates in the roasting of copper ores are described. There can be little doubt that this cadmea was zinc oxide. That which is described in H. N. 34, 2 was a natural mineral, perhaps calamine.</p>
               <p>Stagnum. An alloy of lead and silver, and not tin.</p>
               <p>A. Barb. Zur antiken M¼nztechnik. Numismatische Zeitschrift. Vol. 23, 1930. Pp. 1-8. Part III entitled Nummi Subaerati reads as follows :</p>
               <p>"A problem, the solution of which has caused much racking of brains is the manufacture of the so-called 'plated' coins, which consist of a core of base metal (copper, iron) coated with thin silver (or gold?) plate. This plating is found especially in Roman denarii of the republic and early empire. Mommsen<ref target="#CH1-n1">*</ref> has established that these were not made by counterfeiters, but that they were an official coinage of a fiduciary nature.</p>
               <pb n="155"/>
               <p>"The same technique is also to be noted frequently on barbarian coins.<ref target="#CH1-n2">†</ref> Von Ernst first explained this plating as being accomplished by immersing red-hot copper in molten silver. This method seems impossible; such a coating would not be uniform, but would be thickened in the places on the blank which are depressed; furthermore, the manner of immersion cannot be explained. The coins could be dipped only by means of a tong- or tweezer-instrument or by being fastened on a wire. In each such case there must be places on the blank where the instrument or the wire would touch and be inaccessible to the plating."</p>
               <p>"There are a considerable number of methods of covering base metals with gold or silver, which are no longer known, since the galvanic method
<pb n="156"/>
has come so generally into use, such as the so-called hot-gilding—a considerable number of methods through smelting or by means of 'cold-plating', yet because of the technical ignorance of the ancients, none of these need to be considered."</p>
               <p>"Opposed to this, the following methods appear relatively simple; the melting temperature of silver (and also gold) lies below that of copper (with fine silver the difference constitutes 130 degrees, with silver-alloys, correspondingly more). Now if one lays a copper blank (or even one of iron, whose melting point is still 100 degrees higher) between two thin sheets of silver (which must not exactly correspond in size and form with the blank) and heats gradually to approximately 1000 degrees, the silver will flow onto both sides of the blank and cover them; the steady, gradual heating which is the condition (otherwise the silver sheet runs together into a globule) is to be obtained by such a device as a potter's oven, which provides also the guarantee that the temperature will not be exceeded."</p>
               <p>"This proceeding calls for but little time or work; a great number of blanks could be laid out quickly between two sheets of silver on a clay or charcoal support and a greater number be shifted into the oven at a given time."</p>
               <pb n="157"/>
               <p>"By way of supplement, after I had tried to clarify the preceding explanations of plated coins, I saw that Von Ernst was convinced of the impossibility of the method first proposed to him, and simultaneously with <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name>, decided for a process proposed by <name type="pname">Piccioni</name> which essentially coincides with the above. The 'only possible' conclusion of <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> 'that this subtle and time-consuming way of plating coins is not applicable to the wholesale plating of coins' falls to the ground in the light of the development proposed above by me, even though to him another supposition seems established."</p>
               <p>In criticism of the above idea of Barb's, it must be pointed out that all of the plated coins we have examined have been plated before they were struck. Therefore his objections do not have so much weight as regards the variations in thickness of the silver coating.</p>
               <p>In the second place, when he speaks of heating silver sheet on a copper blank up to the melting point of silver so that it melts he has evidently not examined many actual coins because the majority show that the silver foil was never actually melted.</p>
               <p>Our microscopic examination seems to have cleared up the above questionable points.</p>

               <p>He points out the difficulties, emphasizing the fact that where the copper blank was held by means of pincers the silver would not cover the copper.</p>
               <p>It seems almost impossible to avoid the formation of a copper-silver alloy. The blanks would have to be heated and would be oxidized although borax or sal-ammoniac might be used to flux the oxide. The process is complicated as well as difficult.</p>
               <p>b) The silver plating is done by means of melting it on the copper coin. The author tried this method also.</p>
               <p>Well cleaned copper blanks were covered with sheet silver, about 1/10 mm. thick and hammered on the copper in the cold state. The coin was then heated up to the fusing point of silver
<pb n="159"/>
and then cooled down again. Any oxide formed was removed by dilute sulphuric acid. After some practice, coins were obtained showing a compact silver plating on all sides. But by this method it is hardly possible to obtain a silver plating which would be so sharply separated from the copper core as in the case of the denarii. The author thinks these plated coins were not made by this process.</p>
               <p>c) Silver plating by means of quicksilver. This process corresponds to hot gilding and hot silvering. A silver amalgam is applied to clean copper and the quicksilver removed by heat, leaving a silver coating. In practice, this process is not at all simple and would have to be repeated twice in order to obtain a thick covering of silver. It seems unlikely, therefore, that this process was used as a general method, but it may have been employed where only a thin coating of gold or silver was desired.</p>
               <p>d) Plating of the copper by means of sheet silver. The copper was wrapped in sheet silver and heated to a red heat. Then the silver is fixed to the copper by hammering, nowadays by means of the roller. The author's experiments with this method were not satisfactory and the union of the silver and the copper was only imperfect. In the case of lenticular blanks for coining as they were used in antiquity, this process seems
<pb n="160"/>
to be almost impossible. Moreover, no edge could be obtained as in the case of antique <hi rend="italic">subaerati</hi> which have one. This edge would then have to be made after the silver was applied by melting the silver edges overlapping the coin. In short, this complicated and difficult process is almost impossible to carry out.</p>
               <p>The author's method of making "filled" coins is carried out as follows: A lenticular piece of copper is inserted between two dish-shaped semispherical caps fitting closely and made of thin sheet silver. On the inside and especially on the edges some hard solder has been applied, and the piece of copper together with the two closely fitted caps is heated until some of the hard solder flows out. After cooling down the edge is flanged a little and a compact piece is obtained, the silver plating of which is quite consistent and its structure solid enough to allow stamping. The author then goes on to explain how the work was done in antiquity.</p>
               <p>a) Copper blanks for coining, lenticular in form and a bit curved, were cast in the usual way and cleaned. Sometimes they were stamped out of sheet copper of suitable thickness. For such work it would be necessary to use a swage.</p>
               <p>b) The silver cases were made by stamping out of a piece of sheet silver by means of a steel stamper, using a block of lead as a support. By
<pb n="161"/>
this means cup-shaped silver cases are obtained, the edges of which will only have to be trimmed. The copper blank, when put between the two silver caps, will be completely covered by them and the edges of the silver cases will then lie one on the other.</p>
               <p>c) Some hard solder is put on the side of the inner cap, brought to fusion, then the blank is inserted between the silver caps and the whole heated until the solder flows. Antique accounts about solder and soldering are somewhat unintelligible and often, as in the case of <name type="pname">Pliny</name> at least, part of them erroneous. For soldering purposes a metal alloy has to be used whose fusing point is a little lower than that of the metals to be soldered. Hard solder is made in the proportion of 3 parts of silver and I part of copper, and is quite ductile. As means of doing the soldering, and especially to avoid the oxidation of the copper, borax or sal ammoniac may perhaps have been used. The chrysocolla as mentioned by <name type="pname">Pliny</name> was probably malachite. If silver mixed with a little chrysocolla is heated malachite separates into carbonic acid and copper, which latter combines with the silver and produces hard silver solder.</p>
               <p>It is necessary that the silver cap should fit tightly upon the copper core so that no air can get in, otherwise the copper would be oxidized and
<pb n="162"/>
soldering would be difficult. The method when properly carried out gives the best results and the process is far simpler than this description might lead one to think. The author then goes on to describe a probable method of heating on a grate over glowing coals whereby a number of coins could be soldered simultaneously.</p>
               <p>The author goes on to state that filled antique coins may offer other cores than copper, then gives an example—Syria, Antiochus VIII, 121-96 B. C. This coin had a core of zinc.</p>
               <p>"When I had come almost to the end of my experiments, I was given the opportunity of reading the treatise of M. <name type="pname">Bahrfeldt</name> about 'Technique employed in antiquity when minting,' <hi rend="italic">Berliner Münzblätter, Neue Folge,</hi> January, 1904, page 433. That Professor <name type="pname">Piccione</name> has solved the 'problem of how silver coins were plated,' and this, 'splendidly and unobjectionably' I do not quite believe. It must be said that the professor is of the opinion that the silver was smelted on the copper core, a thing I have also tried when making my experiments and which I have described above. As to <name type="pname">M. Bahrfeldt</name> he too has his doubts and writes: 'how could this subtile method which took so much time, be made to agree with the abundant minting and the bringing out of the coins ? ' "</p>
               <pb n="163"/>
               <p>In criticism of this work of Professor <name type="pname">Darmstaedter</name> it may be pointed out that while such silver soldering was probably used in a number of cases, it is also most probable that many of these coins were made without silver solder by what is known as the Sheffield Plate method. Furthermore, examples of Roman denarii had been examined in which the silver has certainly been melted on copper either in the form of sheet or more likely as a powder, perhaps of a silver-copper alloy in order to make use of its lower melting point. <name type="pname">Pliny</name> does mention chrysocolla for soldering gold, but he says nothing of soldering silver to copper. He says that silver is soldered with stagnum, which is an alloy of silver and lead. However, for gold containing copper, solder is made by using gold and one-seventh part of silver mixed with chrysocolla, <name type="pname">Cyprian</name> verdigris and nitrum (carbonate of soda) ; this last mixture he calls santerna, which apparently works as a flux.</p>

            <head>PART II.</head>
            <p>Notwithstanding the conclusions obtained from specimens studied in Part I and even though the microscopic evidence submitted supplements our previous knowledge regarding the plating process, it was deemed wise to extend the investigation to a larger number of coins to see whether the conclusions reached held uniformly. Twenty-five additional coins were subjected to a careful examination by hand lens and of this number five of the most interesting were cut and mounted as had been done with the pieces described in Part I. Enlargements of the other twenty coins made it possible to detect analogies with coins previously studied. The geographical as well as the chronological distribution has been considerably extended. No evidence controverting the conclusions reached previously was found. The description of these twenty coins and the conclusions reached regarding each one of them follow. The illustrations of the pieces are grouped and come after the text, where they precede the remaining five pieces which were cut and mounted, and these last have the notes accompanying the respective illustrations just as was done in the first portion of this work. In order to bring the pages of text together the summary of the conclusions concerned with these twenty-five coins is given here.</p>

Copper shows through at several places on the edge where the lap is very distinct. The silver disc for the face of the coin was only slightly larger than the copper blank and therefore the lap or join is very close to the edge of the reverse. These incuse coins are rarely found plated.</p>
            <p>In addition to coins 14-33A five others were chosen on which to make a microscopic examination. These were taken because they appeared to represent typical examples of the main structures met with in the previous examination. The coins were mounted as before in fusible metal and then the whole was filed down until enough of the edge of the coin had been exposed in order to show the structure from the copper core to the outer skin. In the cases where the section was made near the edge (cf. Plates 149-150), the silver coating seems to be unusually thick. With the other coins, where the cut coincides with the diameter, the coating is crossed at a right angle.

Near the edge the coating is crossed diagonally, and this makes it seem thicker than it is in reality. There were two cases, however, in which the coins had been previously cut medially; these were mounted and the cut surface polished in the usual way.</p>
            <p>All except two of these coins show the usual coating of silver sheet with more or less distinct lapping of the edges over the copper core, as in the previous examples.</p>
            <p>The two exceptions are Nos. 32 (0.66) and 38 (0.70) in which the silver coating was put on either by dipping or by sprinkling the copper core with powdered silver or copper-silver alloy and heating up till the powder melts and "runs" over the surface.</p>

            <head>SUMMARY.</head>
            <p>An examination of this second series of coins was made and the structures found were similar to those of the previous examination.</p>
            <p>There seems little doubt, therefore, that our previous findings were more or less correct, namely, that some of the samples show a coating which was probably produced by attaching the silver foil to the copper core by means of silver solder in the form of the eutectic alloy of silver and copper. Other samples seem to indicate that no solder was used but the silver was attached to the copper by heating to the eutectic temperature and the junction was produced by diffusion as in the more modern method of making Sheffield plate. A third method was one in which silver foil was not used. It is possible to produce such a coating by dipping the copper core in a bath of silver-copper alloy, but as all of these coatings are very thin it is more probable that the method consisted of using powder and a suitable flux and heating until the silver melted and ran to form a continuous but irregular coating.</p>

            <p>On the reverse (Pl. 171 × 5.9) a distinct lap is visible. A cross-section is shown in Fig. 1 × 4.5 diams. The silver coating is seen distinctly; it varies in thickness. Under the microscope the copper has a wavy appearance, probably a coring effect due to some impurity such as arsenic or perhaps silver in the original casting not completely diffused in the subsequent fabrication. Such a structure is common in some of our alloys today. The lap is not always distinct but where it does show there is a film of eutectic between the two layers of silver. At the ends of the section are patches of eutectic containing excess grains of copper which are very marked.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Coin</hi> 36 (0.61); Figs. 2 and 3 × 100. The fusible metal mounting did not make a very good join, for the black areas are spaces between it and the silver coating. The lower part of the photograph consists of the copper core with its distinctly wavy or banded appearance. The silver
<pb/>
coating shows a distinct lap, while on the right-hand side of Fig. 3 a thick area of the eutectic is seen, which, as we pass towards the left, thins very considerably but it is still present to the, left of Fig. 2.</p>

The film of eutectic is fairly regular and runs up between the two layers of silver where they overlap; one might argue that silver solder had been used.</p>

            <p>At the lower right of the cross-section (enlarged × 4.6), distinct lapping of the silver can be seen, especially if a hand-glass is used, and this is also
<pb/>
visible in the enlargements of the reverse (3.6 and 5.7). The photographs which follow were taken to show this distinct lapping of the metal, but they are reversed in the microscope (Nos. 179-182). Patches of solder are quite prominent at both ends, but there is practically none in the lap. The core is very badly oxidized.</p>

               <hi rend="smallcaps">Conclusion</hi>. From an examination of the structure in the lap and the fact that the eutectic does not flow between the two layers of silver one must conclude that silver solder probably was not used in putting on this coating.</p>

            <p>The silver surface is spotted and resembles that of No. 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Conclusion</hi>. This coin shows a badly oxidized core. The silver coating consists of either the eutectic or the eutectic containing excess of copper now in the form of oxide. Such a structure would most easily be produced by sprinkling the copper core with powdered silver or copper-silver alloy and heating with a suitable flux until the powder melted and ran over the surface.</p>
