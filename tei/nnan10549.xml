            <p>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence of 1773 have the unique distinction of being the only fully authorized coins with legal tender status which were specifically minted for all or any part of the English colonies which became the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q166433">United States of America.</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>To justify such an assertion it must be realized that <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1191350">Massachusetts Bay Colony</placeName> had authorized and established a mint for its own silver coinage in 1652 when there was political confusion in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> as to colonial control, but subsequently the colony had years of controversy over the coinage because the action was taken and continued without the necessary approval of the English Crown;<ref target="#CH1-n1">

status was specifically denied. All other coinages made for American colonial use prior to the American Revolution appear to be unofficial token money.</p>
            <p>Curiously enough it was not until 1892 that <persName>Tatman</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> pointed out that the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpenny had any official authorization whatsoever, as <persName>Dickeson,</persName>
               <persName>Crosby,</persName>
               <persName>Atkins,</persName>
               <persName>Dye</persName> and other outstanding numismatic writers knew nothing about its background and in their publications had assumed that it was a token from a private source. <persName>Tatman's</persName> pamphlet was limited to its legal authorization. Extensive studies in the economic history of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> have included much material on the paper money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia,</placeName>

               </ref> but have not encompassed the history of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> copper coinage.</p>
            <p>The story of the procurement of copper halfpence for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> is a series of frustrations arising in spite of continued efforts of Colonial <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> to have an opportunity to try out the use of copper money for small change in an honest and dignified manner. It shows how delays in communication, political changes, protocol, misunderstandings and economic trends rendered ineffective one hundred and thirty years of careful effort to secure a copper coinage and by the time the coinage was finally obtained many Virginians must have had one more logical reason to believe in the need for an independent government.</p>

            </head>
            <p>In section 10 of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Charter of April 10, 1606, the patentees were authorized to "establish and cause to be made a coin, to pass current there (<placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>) between the people of those several colonies (in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>), for the more ease of traffick and bargaining between and amongst them and the natives there, of such metal, and in such manner and form, as the said several councils there shall limit and appoint." No use of this power was ever made.</p>
            <p>The introduction of royal farthing tokens in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> was recommended by <persName>Sir John Harvey,</persName> Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia,</placeName> in a letter dated June 26, 1636, to Secretary <persName corresp="#viaf_54945693">Sir Francis Windebank,</persName> so that there would be a means of paying labor during the period before the tobacco crop was picked. In due course <persName>Charles I</persName> proposed to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Assembly that the royal farthing tokens which were currently in circulation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> should pass in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> and that <persName>Henry Howard,</persName>
               <persName>Lord Maltravers,</persName> who owned a patent granted by the Crown to make and sell royal farthing tokens in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England,</placeName> should furnish such tokens in exchange for products of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> which were salable in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England.</placeName> The few existing records of the 1637‚Äì8 Assembly of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> show that the Colonists felt that "said farthings are very much under the value of them in copper", that they would be readily counterfeited and that tradesmen and others would be disheartened to accept coin which was not "somewhat neere the value" of its metal content. Actually the intrinsic value of royal farthing tokens was only 5% of their circulating value in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and counterfeiting them there was a common practice. Instead, the
<pb n="4"/>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Assembly requested ¬£5000 per year in an issue of silver coin which would allow 10% profit to those who furnished it. The Crown, nevertheless, in 1638, granted a license to <persName>Lord Maltravers</persName> to coin farthing tokens for the foreign plantations and on February 16, 1639 granted a license to export English, Irish and Welsh farthing tokens to all plantations except <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland.</placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Although the value of foreign gold and silver coin as used in commercial transactions was regulated by law, by decree or by the merchants from time to time, no copper coin of any kind circulated in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> prior to the distribution of 1773 <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence.<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> Beginning in the early part of the eighteenth century, English copper halfpence and farthings had been growing in use in the natural course of trade in the northern American colonies without royal objection, but <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> apparently felt that prior royal approval was necessary. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> therefore, from time to time officially sought the same privilege.</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>On November 20, 1645, the colony passed an act to permit the coinage of 10,000 pounds avoirdupois of copper in denominations of 2, 3, 6 and 9 pence in order to drive tobacco out of circulation as a medium of small change. One pound weight of copper was to circulate for ¬£1 currency even though the copper cost was only 18d and the coining cost was estimated at 12d. Copper coin therefore was to pass for 13‚Öì times its intrinsic value. The coins were to have two rings, one for a motto and the other for an annually changing figure to be counterstamped on the coins by appointees in each county. No such coins were issued.<ref target="#CH1-n8">

            </p>
            <p>Another difficulty in the introduction of copper coin was the risk of its unacceptability because of its lack of sufficient intrinsic value. Gold and silver coins always circulated for the full value of their metal content and so long as the value of current money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> was weak, gold and silver in the colony would tend to be used for payments outside <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia.</placeName> Copper coin, if in circulation, would not have a tendency to
<pb n="11"/>
be so withdrawn, because its circulating value would be fixed far above its intrinsic value.</p>
            <p>Sir <persName corresp="#viaf_22146457">Isaac Newton</persName> during his tenure as Master of the Royal Mint in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> promulgated the theory about 1713 that the value of copper metal in copper coin plus the cost of the manufacture and issue of such coin should equal the value at which copper coin passes in circulation.<ref target="#CH1-n22">
                  <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
               </ref> This theory was still being adhered to at the time circulation of copper coin in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> was being considered. Since the cost of manufacture and issue in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> was almost equal to the metal value of a copper coin the intrinsic metal value of the coin was about half of its circulating value. For that reason the acceptability of copper coin in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> was always questionable and reasonable limitations on the amount usable as legal tender were included in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> legislation.</p>
            <p>For the reasons above set forth, considerable thought was given in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> request.

               </ref> a tactful indication that standard English copper coinage was not proper for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> was expressed:

               <q>"The inclosed Papers will inform you of the Method which has been pursued for some Years for supplying the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> with Copper Coinage, and which has given Satisfaction &amp; been of great Service to the Inhabitants of that Country.

            <p>The papers enclosed, as explained by subsequent correspondence, apparently included one or both of the Royal Warrants of <persName>GeorgeII,</persName> dated January 26, 1732, and August 17, 1738, respectively, authorizing a special coinage of copper halfpence for <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> on the basis of 52 weighing one pound avoirdupois. The inference of the enclosures was that <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> should not circulate English copper coin but should have a copper coinage of its own.</p>
            <p>At that time Irish exchange was, like <placeName>Virginia's</placeName> exchange, depreciated with respect to sterling. However, it required 8‚Öì% more Irish currency to equal the value of a sterling unit. Irish halfpence had been coined weighing 52 to the pound since 1733 and English halfpence had weighed 46 to the pound since 1717. Decreases in the price of copper had not been deemed sufficient to adjust the weight of the coins in accordance with <persName>Newton's</persName> theory. Uniformity of coin was considered more important. The fixed percentage differential of almost 13% between the weights of English and Irish copper coins therefore was at variance with the exchange differential, as well as unrelated to the value of copper.</p>

                  <persName>Mr. Norton</persName> a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Merchant came to me this morning to lay before me some Directions which he has rec.d from the Treasurer of the Colony of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> concerning a Copper-Coinage to circulate in that Dominion. I take the Liberty to refer Your Lordship to certain Letters which have passed between the late Lord Bottetourt and me, and <persName>Mr. President Nelson</persName> &amp; me, on that subject: These will inform Your Lordship of the State of this‚Äîmatter, and you will find that the Directions now sent to <persName>Mr. Norton</persName> are in consequence of an Information rec.d by <persName>Mr. President Nelson</persName> from me of the manner in which the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName> is supplied with Copper-Coin. But the Treasurer explains the Ideas of the gentlemen who seem to approve of &amp; to adopt that Mode in such a manner as makes it necessary for me to trouble Your Lordship with some farther Explanation concerning it and observations upon it.</q>
               <q>
                  <persName>Mr. Norton</persName> and I considered the Treasurer's Letter with all the Attention we could give to it, and we both thought that there is some ambiguity in his Expressions which gave us room to suppose that the Proposition might be taken in two ways: The first, that 52 Halfpence being coined out of Copper equal to the Value of two English Shillings, each Halfpenny should still pass at 25 p Cent, more than an English Halfpenny does in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England,</placeName> although only 48 English Halfpence are coined out of the same Quantity of Copper. But we could scarcely suppose this to be the Intention, as it would be a manifest Fraud. The other Proposition is not attended with any Fraud, and, as we apprehend, is this, that the Change of two English Shillings shall be 52 Halfpence instead of 48. This might certainly be done, but it appears to me that the gentlemen had hastily adopted the Idea of the Irish Copper Coinage without considering the just &amp; useful Proportion which it bears to the nominal Value of the English Shilling and other English Silver Coins current in that Country; for, as the English Shilling there is denominated 13 Pence, 26 Halfpence divide it into equal Parts &amp; make the Change most easy and convenient, and therefore they have chose to coin the Avoirdupoise Pound of Copper into 52 Halfpence equal to two English Shillings. Now this may be with great Facility adapted to the Case of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia,</placeName> for the two English Shillings passing for 30 Pence <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Currency, the usefull Division in the Coinage of Copper would be to make 60 Halfpence out of the Avoirdupoise Pound of Copper equal to two English Shillings; and if
<pb n="15"/>
this Plan should be agreeable to His Majesty's Subjects in that Colony, there is no Objection to it that immediately occurs to my Mind, and I am of opinion that it would be of very essential Service especially to the poor. I shall however take no other step in this matter than to obtain all the Information that I can, with regard to a Measure of this sort, from those Departments of Government to whom it more particularly belongs; and in case no Objections arise from them and Your Lordship finds what I now mention is agreeable to the Gentlemen on your side of the water, I shall be ready to do my Part in carrying the Measure into Execution.</q>
               <q>I take the Liberty further to observe to Your Lordship, that in the Plans hitherto proposed the Colony has intended to lay out ¬£2500 in Copper Coinage, and I submit to Your Lordship's Consideration whether this be not too large a Sum for the first Experiment, and whether it might not be more prudent to make the Trial upon ¬£1000, which you will observe from the Account I sent over of the Irish Coinage will amount to five Tons of Copper. It will be necessary if the Colony adopt this Measure to employ Mr. <persName>Norton</persName> or some other Agent to execute their Commands in this matter, and the Person they employ shall have all the Assistance I can give him. I ought in Justice to Mr. <persName>Norton</persName> to inform Your Lordship, that I thought I observed great Disinterestedness in his Conversation upon this subject.</q>
               <q>I have troubled Your Lordship with a very long Letter, but the Matter I conceive is of real Importance to the Colony, and it will give me the greatest Satisfaction, if I can be the Promotor of any Measure that may conduce so essentially to its Interest and Advantage as I really think this will do.</q>

            <p>There is an interesting error in <persName>Hillsborough's</persName> letter when he states in two places that 48 English halfpence weighed one pound when officially and actually 46 weighed one pound. <persName>Hillsborough</persName> was apparently so anxious to justify the theory that the exchange ratio of 2 shillings English
<pb n="16"/>
currency equaling 2 shillings 2 pence Irish currency as well as 2 shillings 6 pence <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> currency should have an inverse ratio to the weight of the English, Irish and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence, namely, 48, 52 and 60 to the pound, that he inadvertently changed the facts to support the soundness of his presentation. An admission that 46 English halfpence then being coined weighed one pound would have entitled both Ireland and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> to heavier copper coinage than 52 and 60 to the pound respectively. His protest that what <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> requested "would be a Manifest Fraud" could have been used as an embarrassing boomerang. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> was, however, so anxious to obtain copper coinage that even if <persName>Hillsborough's</persName> misstatement was noticed it went unchallenged in the tragedy of errors.</p>
            <p>In addition to recommending a reduction in weight of the halfpence for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> to 60 to the pound avoirdupois to conform to the <persName corresp="#viaf_22146457">Newton</persName> theory, <persName>Lord Hillsborough</persName> asked that the quantity of coins be reduced from the value of ¬£2500 sterling to ¬£1000 sterling because he realized that they might not be acceptable for circulation because of their lack of intrinsic value.</p>

               <p>Two specimens are known of a brass shilling token privately issued in 1714 by someone named <persName>Dawson</persName> in <placeName>Gloucester</placeName> County, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia.</placeName> It is described as a pattern and illustrated in <persName>Sylvester S.

                  </hi> page 323 and Plate IX, No. 4. Although not fully readable, it has been tentatively attributed to Rie (hard) <persName>Dawson,</persName> whose existence has not been confirmed. It may be that the token was issued by a partnership having a name such as <persName>Richeson</persName> &amp; <persName>Dawson,</persName> since the names, <persName>Peter Richeson</persName> and <persName>Samuel Dawson,</persName> appear separately in <placeName>Gloucester</placeName> County records of the period. In the writer's opinion this coin is brass token money rather than a pattern to be struck in silver.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">30</hi>
               </ref> On April 8, 1772, an amendatory act<ref target="#CH1-n31">
                  <hi rend="sup">31</hi>
               </ref> covering copper coin was passed according to which the treasurer was authorized to import as many as may be bought for ¬£1000 sterling value of a special issue of coined copper in a denomination equivalent to a half penny in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> currency subject to the consent and regulations of the Crown. Applicable portions of this act are set forth in Appendix B hereof. The weight of the coin, however, was not provided for, probably in consequence of the previous confusion. No farthings were authorized as <persName>Lord Hillsborough</persName> left that choice to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia.</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>After studying the matter further <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Treasurer <persName>Nicholas</persName> wrote to Norton on June 16, 1772, "we all think that Currency halfpence would be best at sixty to the pound Averdupoise and that it would be advisable to make the first Experiment with no more than ¬£1000 stg value exclusive of Costs."<ref target="#CH1-n32">
                  <hi rend="sup">32</hi>
               </ref> The word "costs," as used in the letter, meant shipping charges.</p>
            <p>Suggestions for the motto on the coins were sent from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and drawings of the coins were submitted

to the colony for comment. A prophetic change in the motto was required by the English. In the above-mentioned June 16, 1772, letter <persName>Nicholas</persName> stated:</p>
            <p>"I have only an Opportunity at present of consulting with the Speaker (<persName corresp="#viaf_29968183">Peyton Randolph</persName>). We are both willing to give up the Word Peace, as it seems to be exceptionable &amp; I dare say the rest of the Gentlemen will concur in Opinion, so that it may be struck out. We highly approve either of the Designs for the back Front, but of ye two should prefer that which has the vine or branch running up the inner Edge as we think it fills up better &amp; makes the figure more compleat."</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1772 <persName>John Norton</persName> purchased copper for the proposed coinage to the amount of ¬£400 sterling, but since prompt approval of the coinage was not forthcoming Treasurer <persName>Nicholas</persName> instructed <persName>Norton</persName> "to charge my private &amp; give the Treasury Acct. credit for ¬£400 Stg in part of the Copper Money."<ref target="#CH1-n33">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>A new period of delay began when <persName>John Norton</persName> on August 6, 1772, wrote to <persName>John Hatley Norton</persName> about a contemplated political change and reported "t'is said if it is carried into execution, <persName>Lord Hillsborough</persName> goes out. I suppose this prevents my being able to get the Affair of Copper Currency fix'd, tho I have been promised by his Lordship it shou'd be done and have frequently attended him for that purpose." The postscript on this letter adds, "<persName>L. Hillsborough</persName> has resigned and <persName>Lord Dartmouth</persName> (<persName>William Legge</persName>) appointed in his stead so that I have a fresh application to make about the copper coin."<ref target="#CH1-n34">

            <p>The Crown finally authorized the coinage of not more than twenty-five tons of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence by Royal Warrant<ref target="#CH1-n37">
                  <hi rend="sup">37</hi>
               </ref> issued on May 20, 1773, for the benefit of <persName>John Norton,</persName> and provided that 60 halfpence weigh one pound avoirdupois and be made at the Tower Mint by the Royal Mintmaster who was to be paid 5 pence sterling per pound for striking and 20 shillings sterling per ton for bookkeeping. The dies were to be prepared at the mint, the obverse having the bust of <persName>George III</persName> surrounded with the inscription <persName>GEORGIUS</persName>¬∑III¬∑REX. and the reverse having a modified <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> coat of arms to which the word <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">VIRGINIA</placeName> and the date were to be added. Copper sheets of fine quality and proper thickness were to be furnished by <persName>Norton</persName> for the coinage and the mint was to lend him a planchet cutter to test the thickness of the sheets as a 3‚Öì% error<ref target="#CH1-n38">
                  <hi rend="sup">38</hi>
               </ref> in coin weight was the limit of permitted variation. The full text of the May 20, 1773, warrant is included in Appendix C hereof because of its full detail of eighteenth century coining procedures.</p>
            <p>The arrangement for the copper to be furnished by <persName>John Norton</persName> was to enable his firm to purchase the metal and have it drawn to proper thickness for as reasonable a price as possible so that the circulating value of the coin less the

aggregate of cost of material, minting, bookkeeping, transportation and insurance might give rise to a small profit which would accrue to the colonial government.</p>
            <p>The cost of drawn copper bars for coinage of English copper at the Tower Mint during this period was 15¬æ pence sterling per pound avoirdupois<ref target="#CH1-n39">
                  <hi rend="sup">39</hi>
               </ref> and could not have varied materially as to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> coinage. Adding the charges for coining, assaying and packing of 5 pence per pound weight and for bookkeeping of 20 shillings per ton, as provided in the Royal Warrant, the total cost aggregated 20.86 pence sterling for each pound avoirdupois of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> coppers or .344 pence sterling per halfpenny. Converting the cost to current money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> by adding a 25% differential, the cost of a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpenny was .43 pence current money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> or a profit of 16% to the colony before deducting the cost of transport and insurance to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> and compensation for <persName>John Norton</persName> for his years of service. In spite of the fact that the value of the content in metal was half of the proposed circulating value the people of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> were to receive the copper coinage close to its actual cost.</p>
            <p>In securing the authorization for copper halfpence, <persName>John Norton</persName> humorously alluded in his letter of May 29, 1773, to his methods of currying favor by commenting, "I have danced Attendance pretty often about it to the Treasury Office."<ref target="#CH1-n40">

            <p>The Royal Warrant authorized 25 tons of coin which was five times the amount the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> legislation had approved. The warrant only covered the manufacture of the coin, but did not specifically provide for its circulation. Since the warrant described the coins as "halfpennys," it is difficult to believe that a royal approval of the coining of such money pursuant to colonial legislation was insufficient authorization for it to be circulated, but such was the technical

               </ref> Apparently <persName>Nicholas</persName> was concerned about the attitude of the people toward copper coin and the general financial condition of the Colony and wished to use the halfpence in the most effective way to make it acceptable as current money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia.</placeName> He seemed to fear it might fall into the hands of other officials.</p>
            <p>Progress at the mint was slow and on July 31, 1773, <persName>John Norton</persName> reported:
<q>I have a large Quantity of Copper d'd at the Mint, which is cutting ready for Coinage, but the Engraver is so dilatory that he has not furnished all the Tools.

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Gazette</hi> that the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">VIRGINIA,</placeName> captained by <persName>Howard Esten,</persName> had arrived in York River from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> with 5 tons of halfpence on board the long hope for small change appeared to be fulfilled. Five long tons consisted of about 672,000 halfpence which could adequately supply the small change needs of the colony. <persName>Nicholas,</persName> however, in his sincere belief that additional royal instructions were legally necessary to authorize the circulation of the halfpence put them in storage and patiently awaited further official English action.</p>
            <p>A further delay of nine months resulted. By royal proclamation dated November 16, 1774,<ref target="#CH1-n44">
                  <hi rend="sup">44</hi>
               </ref> it was recited that five tons of such halfpence were coined and were "ready to be exported" and that "we do accordingly hereby ordain, declare and command that the said pieces of copper money, so coined, stamped, and impressed, as aforesaid, shall be current and lawful Money of and in our said colony of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> and of and within the districts and precincts of the same; and shall pass and be received therein after the rate following, that is to say, twenty-four of the said pieces shall pass and be received for the sum of one shilling, according to the currency of our said province of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> ***." The maximum to be received in one payment was limited to the same amounts stated in the previous acts of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> assembly, namely up to 60 halfpence in a payment of 20 shillings or more and up to 24 halfpence for smaller payments. The full text of the proclamation is set forth in Appendix D.</p>
            <p>The proclamation was so long delayed in issuance that the halfpence alleged to be <hi rend="italic">"ready to be exported"</hi> had already been delivered in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> over nine months beforehand.

            <p>The Treasurer of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> during the period the Colony was seeking copper coinage had a series of unpredictable difficulties with the paper currency which affected the exchange value of current money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia.</placeName> The unprecedented floods of 1771 in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> destroyed much of the privately owned tobacco stored in government warehouses, and the colony was obliged to issue 30,000 pounds in new paper currency, in July, 1771, to pay these losses. Slackening of business in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> began to be felt in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> by July, 1772, but the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> exchange held to 25% above sterling.<ref target="#CH1-n45">

            <p>In 1775, a few genuine and quantities of counterfeit English copper halfpence were circulating in New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> at ‚Öî pence New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> currency and in the central colonies at ‚Öò pence or more in their currencies.<ref target="#CH1-n54">
                  <hi rend="sup">54</hi>
               </ref> Paper currency of the New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> states had exactly the same exchange value as <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> paper currency. Counterfeit English halfpence in circulation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> usually did not contain more copper than <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence and often had less. The metal or intrinsic value of all the above-mentioned coppers was in any event less than half of their circulating value. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> merchants naturally were aware of all of these conditions. It is therefore logical to assume that those merchants who received <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence for the value of one-half pence in current money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> would not wish to spend them for that amount when coin of equivalent size and weight in neighboring colonies could be spent for a far greater value.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence were first distributed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> during the spring of 1775 when the disputes between <placeName corresp="#geonames_2648147">Great Britain</placeName> and the colonies had become aggravated and people felt the imminence of war. In the fall of 1774 the Continental Congress had met in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4560349">Philadelphia</placeName> and another meeting was scheduled for May 10, 1775. Governor <persName>Dunmore</persName> published a proclamation dated March 28, 1775, in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Gazette warning <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> delegates against attending that meeting.

Governor <persName>Dunmore</persName> promised only compensation in money for its value and on May 4,1775, after payment was accepted, <persName>Patrick Henry</persName> in charge of the assembled committee sent a dispatch to Treasurer <persName>Nicholas</persName> which stated:
<q>The people here have it in charge from <placeName>Hanover</placeName> Committee to tender their service to you, as a public officer, for the purpose of escorting the public treasury to any place in this colony, where the money would be judged more safe than in the City of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4793846">Williamsburg.</placeName>

               <persName>Nicholas</persName> assured the group that he had no apprehensions for the treasury and they disbanded.</p>
            <p>War began within 50 days after the first announcement of the availability of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence. This turmoil naturally created a desire in some of the people to secure and retain metallic money of all types. The fear of inflation and paper money depreciation could not be eliminated by law or patriotism. Although copper lacked the practicability of gold and silver in easily transported value and acceptability, yet it had commercial and war uses. The desire to retain rather
<pb n="29"/>
than circulate copper coin must have been furthered by the publication in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Gazette</hi> of August 10, 1775 (Pi) of a May, 1775, news bulletin from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> which provided:
<q>Orders are sent to all the out ports to prevent the exportation of copper coin to any port of the American colonies, except on government account.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As the Revolutionary War continued the scarcity of copper tended to prevent the free circulation of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence more than their value. An advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">

Although the weight of one pound of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence would constitute 30d. in circulating value the advertisement showed the need for copper in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> and the inability to obtain it through normal trade.</p>

This proposal indicates that the only effective means to induce those who held <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> coppers to spend them was to increase substantially the legal value of each coin.

            <p>When it was <persName>Jefferson</persName> himself who introduced legislation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> in 1776 to stimulate "more general circulation" of copper halfpence it is obvious that he knew that the coins were in the hands of the public, that they had been distributed by the treasury and were circulating to some extent. His statement, therefore, has been deceptive from a numismatic point of view. It served to support his argument in favor of the decimal system by asserting an unequivocal negative which from an economic point of view was generally not too misleading. If <persName>Jefferson</persName> had added the word "generally" or "virtually" or similar equivocal language the confusion as to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence would have been avoided.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Jefferson</persName> subsequently clarified some facts and distorted others when he stated in his "Supplementary Explanations" to his "Notes on Coinage:"<ref target="#CH1-n59">

               <q>Let us examine facts in countries where we are acquainted with them. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia,</placeName> where our towns are few, small, and of course their demand for necessaries very limited, we have never yet been able to introduce a copper coin at all. The smallest coin which any body will receive there is the half-bit, or 1/20 of a dollar. In those states where the towns are larger and more populous, a more habitual barter for small wants has called for a copper coin 1/90 or 1/96 or 1/108 of a dollar. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> where the towns are many and populous, and where ages of experience have matured the conveniences of intercourse they have found that some wants may be supplied for a farthing, or 1/208 of a dollar, and they have accomodated a coin to this want. This business is evidently progressive. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> we are far behind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Although admitting that an attempt was made to introduce copper into circulation and explaining reasons why the
<pb n="32"/>
use of coppers was not needed in rural <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia,</placeName>
               <persName>Jefferson</persName> makes it appear that coppers did not circulate because people refused to receive them. The proposed legislation he introduced in 1776 proved quite the contrary, as his effort then was to induce people to spend <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> coppers rather than to receive them. The sounder concept is that after people had time to adjust their thinking to the fears, shortages and inflation brought about by war the desirability of coppers reversed itself and halfpence became unacceptable because people were not accustomed enough to their use. <persName>Jefferson's</persName> statements as to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> copper coins may not have needed clarification in 1784, but their ambiguity was the principal factor in stimulating the research for this monograph because they confused the author.</p>

               <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence are readily obtainable today in bright red uncirculated condition chiefly because of the discovery over a century ago by the family of Colonel <persName>Mendes I</persName>. <persName>Cohen</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> of a hoard of halfpence in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4781708">Richmond</placeName> still in the original keg. Colonel <persName>Cohen</persName> was an antiquarian and a collector and on the sale of some of his coins in 1875 the existence and source of the hoard was kept somewhat secret. To prevent a collapse in the market price of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence (as collectors' items) the heirs of Colonel <persName>Cohen</persName> slowly sold halfpence to coin dealers until 1929 when 2200 pieces were sold at auction in one lot.<ref target="#CH1-n60">

            <p>During the Revolutionary War copper in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName> was available at normal prices and the only risk was shipping it to <placeName>America.</placeName> As the war continued shipment of metal and other commodities to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> became more reliable and thus as early as 1777 the Continental Congress was considering a mint for coining specie and copper.<ref target="#CH1-n62">
                  <hi rend="sup">62</hi>
               </ref> On November 19, 1779, <persName>Edward Bridgen</persName> of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> firm of medallists, <persName>Bridgen</persName> and <persName>Waller,</persName> wrote to <persName corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</persName> at <placeName corresp="#geonames_6443019">Passy,</placeName>

               <persName>Bridgen's</persName> figures do show at least that copper was plentiful in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName> and copper coin was obtainable there far cheaper than the circulating value of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence.</p>
            <p>After the Revolutionary War and before the Constitution was adopted coppers were minted by <placeName corresp="#geonames_5242283">Vermont,</placeName>

In addition large quantities of counterfeit English halfpence and various copper tokens were introduced into American circulation, but not in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia.</placeName> In 1789, there was a copper panic and the value of all copper coin circulating in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States</placeName> collapsed to its intrinsic value as metal.<ref target="#CH1-n64">

               <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence had the unique distinction of being considered at first too valuable to circulate freely and subsequently of being of too little value and popularity to circulate freely.</p>

            </head>
            <p>There are four known specimens of a 1774 <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> coinage in silver<ref target="#CH1-n65">
                  <hi rend="sup">65</hi>
               </ref> and all of them are brilliant proofs. The bust on the obverse is much larger than that on the 1773 halfpence, but the size of the die is not. The legend reads GEORGIVS¬∑III¬∑DEI¬∑GRATIA¬∑ instead of GEORGIVS¬∑III¬∑REX¬∑ as specified in the 1773 royal warrant and the 1774 proclamation. The text of the obverse legend of the pattern would require on the reverse a title at least with the word REX. The obverse die is identical to one used on the fourth style of the bust of <persName>George III</persName> found on the obverses of the English gold guineas dated from 1774 through 1786.</p>
            <p>The reverse however is exactly the same style and size as the reverse of the 1773 copper halfpence. It is different from all dies for copper halfpence as well as having the distinctive date of 1774. There are eight strings in the harp on the arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia.</placeName> No English shillings were minted between 1763 and 1787. The legal weight for the coinage of English shillings if they had been struck would have been 93.74 grains of silver 0.925 fine and it is interesting to note that the 84 to 86¬Ω grain weight of the 1774 <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> silver pattern is about 10% below the English standard. A further reduction in weight would have had to be made if consideration were to be given to a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> shilling which would stay in circulation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> and not be exported from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> for its silver value. The introduction of its own silver coinage would
<pb n="38"/>
have had a strong stabilizing effect on the differential between sterling exchange and current money of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia,</placeName> but there is no evidence of a desire for the coinage of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> shillings and no documentary support for any such coinage. Since <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> copper was being coined during the early part of 1774 with dies dated 1773, the 1774 die may have been prepared for copper coinage, but the quantity of coppers authorized was coined before the 1774 die was needed. In view of the fact that this coin has always been called a "<placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> Shilling" readers will have to determine whether to rename it a 1774 pattern <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence in silver. It is illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">CLASSIFICATION OF DIE VARIETIES OF HALFPENCE</hi>
            </head>
            <p>There are both major and minor die varieties of the 1773 <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence. The major difference in the obverses is the existence or lack of a period after GEORGIVS. The major difference in the reverses is the number of strings in the harp on the coat of arms, there being either 6, 7, 8 or 9. The bust of <persName>George III</persName> on all obverse dies was developed from reproductions of one master puncheon as was the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> coat of arms on all reverse dies. The process of making a hand-cut master puncheon with which to sink a matrix was used at that time to make as many production punches from the matrix as were needed. In making dies the production punches were used and the master puncheon was not in danger of breaking. Generally, the same number punches and letter punches were used for cutting the legends into all production dies, and the varying positions of the letters and figures in these legends gives rise to minor die varieties.</p>
            <p>A 1773 reverse die and both the puncheon and matrix for the bust on the obverse still remain in the Royal Mint Museum in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London.</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n66">
                  <hi rend="sup">66</hi>
               </ref> The 1773 reverse die has nine strings in the harp and is described in the accompanying table as reverse RM. (Royal Mint). As yet no halfpence have been found for which it was used. The illustration on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI is from a struck impression made from the die. On a recent examination of the die by the author it showed no wear from production coinage and the authorized issue may have been completed without this die being put into service. The puncheon has a raised head of <persName>George III</persName> in high relief and
<pb n="40"/>
the matrix produced from it does not fit perfectly, indicating that the matrix was used for production punches and had customary corrective recutting.</p>
            <p>The dies for the coinage of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence, being products of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> Mint, were sharply and carefully cut, probably by either <persName>Richard Yeo,</persName> chief engraver, or <persName>Thomas Pingo,</persName> second engraver. There is, however, one pair of dies which is unusually perfect and is designated as 1‚ÄìA and illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> I, II and IV. These dies are used on planchets weighing 135 grains or about 52 to the pound, whereas the weight of all other die varieties ranges between 105 and 128 grains with the great bulk weighing between 115 grains and 120 grains, the legal weight being 116.7 grains or 60 weighing one pound. Coins struck from the die combination, 1‚ÄìA, have a proof surface and are perfectly struck on planchets having a diameter of 1‚Öõ inches whereas all others range between 61/64 inches to 1 1/32 inches. These facts and the scarcity of the 1‚ÄìA variety lead to the conclusion that these are trial pieces struck from the first pair of dies made before the production dies. This is confirmed by the fact that <persName>John Norton</persName> gave Captain Barron a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence having the size of a <placeName>guinea</placeName> before all the tools were completed. (See page 21.) Neither of the dies in the 1‚ÄìA combination are found combined with any other dies or on any coins weighing 60 to the pound or less. It is therefore probable that the planchet cutter for Irish halfpence was used to make planchets for trial <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpence because the smaller planchet cutter was not ready and thus variety 1‚ÄìA weighs 52 to the pound as do the Irish halfpence of the period. After the confusion caused by <persName>Nicholas</persName> requesting halfpence weighing 52 to the pound, it is ironic that a few trial specimens of that weight exist by mere coincidence. This halfpence has qeen improperly referred to in the past as a "<placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> penny" but more correctly should be described as a trial <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> halfpenny on an Irish halfpenny planchet. Its principal
<pb n="41"/>
design features which distinguish it from all other varieties are the small 7's in the date. It is very scarce.</p>
            <p>In classifying varieties of the coinage the dies have been grouped so that the minor varieties are subdivisions of major varieties.</p>
            <p>As to the obverse dies with period after GEORGIVS it can be noted that the distance between the three periods varies on each die. I have measured in 64ths of an inch from the center of the period after GEORGIVS to the center of the period after III for the first length, from the center of the period after III to the center of the period after REX for the second length and from the center of the period after REX to the center of the period after GEORGIVS for the third length.</p>
            <p>As to obverses with no period after GEORGIVS the distance in 64ths of an inch between the center of the two existing periods has been measured. Decimal portions of an inch are not used because a simple scale can be readily used for the measurements.</p>
            <p>As to the reverses the dies are first grouped by the number of harp strings. There is one large leaf extending outward from the upper part of each side of the arms on the reverse. The leaf on the right ends opposite various portions of the first I and the leaf on the left ends opposite various portions of A. These differences are noted in describing the varieties.</p>
            <p>The horizontal member of <persName>St. George's</persName> cross in the arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> is referred to as the horizontal divider and in cutting the lettering into the various dies the upright of the third I in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">VIRGINIA</placeName> is sometimes parallel and sometimes not parallel to the line of the horizontal divider. This relationship is noted in describing the reverses.</p>
            <p>There is a period after 1773 and a period after <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">VIRGINIA.</placeName> These periods were intended to be placed midway between the circular base line and the circular top line of the lettering and numbering. Some of these periods are centered; others are higher than the center line ranging up to the top line and
<pb n="42"/>
these positions are noted. The shape of these periods is not always circular and some appear like flat lumps or dashes, but because of recutting these variations are not used as a basis for die distinction.</p>
            <p>As quantities of coins were struck, the wear on the dies produced some die breaks and also made it necessary to recut portions of the lettering. An attempt to point out these minute differences by creating die states or subvarieties does not seem of sufficient importance to be justified.</p>
            <p>The following table describes 17 obverse dies and 20 reverse dies which are found combined to constitute 22 varieties:</p>

            <p>I. WHEREAS by an act of the general assembly, passed in the first year of the reign of his late majesty king George the second, intituled An act for the better regulating and ascertaining the current rates of silver coin within this dominion, and for preventing the evil practice of cutting foreign gold into pieces, it is, amongst other things, enacted, that if his majesty, his heirs, or successors, should think fit, at any time thereafter, to permit copper coin to be brought in and pass in this colony, the same should pass and be current at the like rates it doth pass in <placeName>Great-Britain.</placeName> And whereas by one other act of assembly, passed in the tenth year of the reign of his present majesty, intituled An act for the better support of the contingent charges of government, it is, amongst other things, enacted that if his majesty should be graciously pleased to permit copper money to be brought in and pass in this colony, the treasurer should, at the public expence, cause so much of such copper to be purchased in <placeName>Great-Britain,</placeName> as at the rates at which it doth pass there would amount to two thousand five hundred pounds sterling. And whereas it is represented to this general assembly, that it will be more convenient for the purposes to which copper money is usually applied, to have the same coined into halfpenny pieces of the value of so much current money of <placeName>Virginia,</placeName> instead of sterling money of <placeName>Great-Britain,</placeName> and that the value of one thousand pounds sterling, in such currency halfpence, will be sufficient to answer the present occasions of the colony: Be it therefore enacted, by the Governor, Council, and Burgesses, of this present General Assembly, and it is hereby enacted, by the authority of the same, That so much of the last mentioned act as impowers the

treasurer to import copper money, to the amount of two thousand five hundred pounds sterling, is hereby repealed.</p>
            <p>II. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, That if his majesty should be graciously pleased to authorize the circulation of copper money in this colony, the treasurer for the time being shall, at the expence of the public, import so many halfpence of the value of the current money of <placeName>Virginia</placeName> as may be purchased for one thousand pounds sterling, exclusive of cost and charges, to be issued and exchanged, at the public treasury, for the purposes, and under the regulations, prescribed and directed by the said recited acts.</p>
            <p>III. Provided always, That nothing in this act contained shall be construed to restrain his majesty from regulating the currency of the said copper money within this colony, in such a manner as his majesty, by his royal proclamation, or by his royal instructions to his governor, or commander in chief of this colony, for the time being, shall, from time to time, judge proper and necessary.</p>

            <p>Whereas, it hath been humbly represented to us on the part and behalf of our colony of <placeName>Virginia</placeName> that a currency of copper money within the same colony would be highly beneficial to our good subjects, the inhabitants thereof, for the more easy and convenient making of small payments; and whereas the Treasurer of our said colony, being thereunto authorized by an Act of our Governor, Council, and Assembly of said colony, passed in the tenth year of our reign, hath delivered to the master and worker of our mint, in our tower of <placeName>London,</placeName> a sufficient quantity of fine copper in bars, nealed, for the coinage of five tons of the pieces hereinafter mentioned, after making the just and usual allowance to the officers of our mint; and whereas our said master and worker of our mint hath, in pursuance of our warrant for that purpose issued, coined thereout five tons of pieces of copper coin, of such weight that sixty pieces thereof are equal to one pound weight avoirdupois, without erring either in excess or defect above one thirtieth part, and are of the value of two shillings and sixpence, according to the currency of money in our said province of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>; and each piece is stamped on one side with our effigies, with the inscription '<persName>Georgius</persName> III. Rex.' and on the reverse with the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Arms, with the <persName>St. George's</persName> Cross, leaving out the escutcheon of crowns, except one crown at the top as on the Guinea, without crest, supporters, or motto, except the word '<placeName>Virginia</placeName>' round the arms, with the date of the year; which are now ready to be exported to our said colony of <placeName>Virginia.</placeName> We have therefore, with the advice of our Privy Council, thought fit to issue this our Royal Proclamation: and we do accordingly hereby ordain, declare, and command, that the said pieces of copper money, so coined, stamped, and impressed, as aforesaid, shall be current and lawful Money of and in our said colony of <placeName>Virginia,</placeName> and of and within the districts and precincts
