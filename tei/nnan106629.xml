            <p>This study began at the ANS Graduate Seminar in 1981. I am greatly indebted to the Society and in particular to <name type="pname">Nancy M. Waggoner</name> for generously allowing me to work on the material and for constant help and assistance. I would also like to express my gratitude to all the dealers without whose help the hoard never could have been reconstituted: <name type="pname">J. Aiello</name>, <name type="pname">H. Berk</name>, <name type="pname">H. A. Cahn</name> and his colleagues <name type="pname">P. Strauss</name> and <name type="pname">H. Vögtli</name> at MMAG, <name type="pname">S. Hurter</name> and <name type="pname">L. Mildenberg</name> of Bank Leu and <name type="pname">J. Spier</name>. My thanks for discussion and advice to <name type="pname">D. Bérend</name>, <name type="pname">C. Boehringer</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12349088">M. Caccamo Caltabiano</name>, <name type="pname">H. A. Cahn</name>, <name type="pname">E. E. Clain-Stefanelli</name>, <name type="pname">G. K. Jenkins</name>, <name type="pname">B. E. Levy</name>, <name type="pname">A. Moretti</name>, <name type="pname">M. Thompson</name> and <name type="pname">U. Westermark</name>. <name type="pname">M. J. Price</name> has most kindly permitted me to work on the records of the hoard at the British Museum. The research abroad was made possible by a grant from the Penrose Fund of the American Philosophical Society.</p>
            <p>Colin M. Kraay was scheduled to be the visiting scholar at the 1982 ANS seminar. His untimely death prevented any thorough discussion of the hoard with him to my deepest regret. The “Randazzo” Hoard 1980 confirms many of his views and if it revises some others, particularly his downdating of the early Syracusan decadrachm, it still is a tribute to his scholarly achievements. His stimulating mind opened a new approach to addressing the problems of Sicilian chronology.</p>

            <p>In the last months of 1980, a hoard of silver coins was found in Sicily<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> and immediately dispersed in commerce. The largest number came to the United States; 479 coins in several lots were deposited at the ANS by a dealer in February 1981 for study and the preparation of a plaster cast record. This group no doubt represented the bulk of the hoard but did not include the rarest and most valuable specimens, mainly from Katane and Naxos, some of which were sold immediately.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> So the hoard was picked over at least twice before being brought to<name type="place" corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York</name>. The ANS recorded the hoard coins but acquired none.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> At least 131 of the tetradrachms seen at the ANS returned to Europe and were sent for cleaning to the British Museum where they were recorded as well. They are now most likely in European collections. The remainder of the hoard has been identified with the help of colleagues, collectors and dealers.</p>
            <p>Nothing is known about the circumstances of discovery nor about the exact location of the find. It is said to be near Randazzo, in northeastern Sicily at the foot of Mount Etna (see frontispiece) and the mints represented, particularly Katane, support the hearsay.</p>
            <p>The legislative and political conditions that foster illegal excavations have been commented upon elsewhere.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> It is deplorable that the historical record so often must be reconstructed away from the original find context, to the detriment of scholarship. Coin hoards are no exception; on the contrary they are easier to take out of the country of origin than larger objects. It should be emphasized that the best preserved coins are very rarely found on excavation sites; rather, almost always as chance finds. Yet it remains a prime responsibility of the numismatist to record all that comes to light.</p>
            <p>One cannot be sure that the "Randazzo" Hoard 1980, as it is catalogued here, is compelete. It seems, however, reasonable to assume that the 539 tetradrachms described form the largest part. Sicilian hoards of the same period, with the exception of the Gela hoard (<hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2066) and the Avola hoard (<hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2085) are usually smaller in size. Moreover selections or divisions of hoards are made very soon after discovery. The "best" pieces can be taken out first for special collectors but it is highly improbable that, for instance, all of the latest specimens in the hoard or a whole mint would be sorted out completely by the first finders. Therefore the conclusions proposed here need not be impaired by doubts about whether the record is complete.</p>
            <p>All the coins that can be said with absolute certainty to come from the hoard are described here. May they encourage additions and supplements as necessary.</p>
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p>The hoard included only tetradrachms,<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> all from Sicilian mints, as Rhegion historically and numismatically is considered such:</p>

            </head>
            <p>The years covered by the hoard, ca. 510 to 450 B.C.,<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> saw the rise of western tyrannies,<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> their fall and immediate aftermath. From the end of the sixth century to the beginning of the fifth century B.C., the cities that interest us, Rhegion, Akragas, Gela, Katane, Leontinoi, Messana, Naxos and Syracuse, lost their autonomy and fell under the domination of three major families: the Anaxilades at the Straits, the Emmenids at Akragas, the Deinomenids at Gela and Syracuse. The rivalries and the ambitions of the strongest among these tyrants determined the history of this half century during which Sicily rose to the acme of its power and prosperity.</p>
            <p>The main ancient sources for this period are Herodotos, book 7.153–67, Diodoros, chiefly book 11 and Pindar through his Odes to the glory of the Sicilian tyrants. These writers vary in objectivity and truthfulness and from them alone it is almost impossible to obtain a clear picture of the events. The approach of Diodoros or Pindar may sometimes be as distorted as our own, the former living in Caesar’s time, more than four centuries later than the early tyrants, the latter being a poet called to the Syracusan court to sing Hieron's exploits.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">The Tyrants</hi>
               </head>
               <p>It was at Gela that the establishment of tyranny began.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> In 505 B.C., Kleandros, son of that Pantares who won the distinction of being the first Sicilian to gain a chariot victory at Olympia, replaced the oligarchy. Herodotos tells us that at Kleandros's death, the sovereignty passed to his brother Hippokrates,<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> who proceeded to expand his influence over other Sicilian cities, a development typical of western tyrannies. He conquered the Chalcidian cities of Euboia and Kallipolis, Naxos, Zankle and Leontinoi, establishing subordinate tyrants in the last two (Skythes and Ainesidemos). Hippokrates also fought the Syracusans; while he did not succeed in taking over the city, he received Kamarina as part of the peace settlement.</p>
               <pb n="14"/>
               <p>At the death of Hippokrates in 491 B.C., his most capable general, commander of the cavalry, Gelon,<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> son of Deinomenes, set himself up as tyrant thus averting the threat of a civil war. His reign inaugurated a period of prosperity and peace for Sicily in general and history records him as a just and benevolent despot, popular among his people. In 485 B.C. Gelon succeeded in what Hippokrates had attempted, the conquest of Syracuse, the wealthy and, thanks to its harbor, strategically important city on the western coast. The Gamoroi, or landowners of Syracuse, having been expelled to Kasmenai by the demos and the local serfs (the Killyrioi) asked Gelon for help. Although he returned the Gamoroi to the city, he installed himself as tyrant.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Gelon’s most remarkable exploit no doubt was the defeat of the Carthaginians at the battle of Himera in 480 B.C.,<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> with the help of his father-in-law, Theron, tyrant of Akragas. The interpretation of this conflict, however, has been rather tendentious, as historians have followed Diodoros’s emphatically nationalistic version.<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> Diodoros presented the war between Sicily and Carthage as an inevitable war between two races, the Greeks and the Barbarians, and in so doing identified it with the Persian wars in Greece.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> In fact the Carthaginian attack on Sicily was caused more by internal antagonism than by external imperialism. Terillos, tyrant of Himera, and his son-in-law, Anaxilas of Rhegion, trying to remain independent from Gelon and Theron, asked the Carthaginians for help. After the battle, Gelon showed himself magnanimous toward the Carthaginians, sparing their lives and demanding only war indemnities. It is on this occasion that Gelon’s wife Demarete was given one hundred gold talents in gratitude. We shall discuss this point in detail below.</p>
               <p>On Gelon’s death in 478/7 B.C., his brother Hieron succeeded him at Syracuse and in turn was succeeded at Gela by the third brother Polyzalos.<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> Apart from his naval expedition to help Kyme against the Etruscans, and the victory that ensued in 474 B.C.,<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> Hieron concentrated on the internal affairs of his Sicilian empire. Out of a desire to win the honors of a "heros ktistes" and so immortality, and also perhaps to secure himself a retreat in case of trouble in Syracuse, Hieron founded Aitna in 476/5 B.C.<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref> He moved the Chalcidian inhabitants of Naxos and Katane to Leontinoi<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> and refounded Katane with Peloponnesians and Syracusans. Under Hieron the Syracusan court became an intellectual center where not only Pindar, but also Aischylos, Simonides, and Bacchylides sojourned and praised the tyrants.</p>
               <p>The death of Hieron in 467/6 B.C. precipitated the fall of all Sicilian tyrannies. Akragas was already free; after the long and stable reign of Theron, who died in 473/2 B.C., his son Thrasy-daios was soon expelled. Selinus and Himera were also free and Polyzalos died at Gela probably before Hieron’s death. These cities quickly joined their land and sea forces to liberate Syracuse from Thrasyboulos, the last of the Deinomenids.<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Only the Anaxilades still survived. Anaxilas succeeded in providing both Rhegion and Zankle/Messana a stable government from 494 B.C., when he installed himself at Rhegion, and 490/89 B.C., when he expelled the Samians from Zankle, until his death in 476 B.C.<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> Despite his
<pb n="15"/>
 efforts to contest with the Deinomenids for power and maintain his independence, the victory of Gelon at Himera forced Anaxilas to recognize Syracuse's supremacy. Mikythos succeeded him until 467/6 B.C., when Anaxila’s sons were old enough to reign. In 461 B.C. they were expelled and democracy restored.<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref>

               <p>Little is known of the years following the end of the Sicilian tyrannies. Although Diodoros tells us that Sicily prospered in peace under democratic rule,<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> most of the cities must have been plunged into confusion. Several of them were restored, such as Naxos, Kamarina, Katane; lands were redistributed followed by claims from, among others, expelled settlers returned home and old mercenaries who had served the tyrants. However, the most serious threat to the Greek cities of Sicily in those years was the rise of the Sikel power under Douketios.<ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> This hellenized leader of the Sikels appears in the literature for the first time at the restoration of Katane.<ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> We then learn that he founded Menainon and Palike, which became his capital.<ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> Following the example of the tyrants, Douketios tried to extend his power to the west and attacked a stronghold of the Akragantines, Motyon. Eventually the Syracusans defeated him at Nomai in 451 B.C. and exiled him to Corinth.<ref target="#CH2-n26">26</ref> In 446 B.C. Douketios returned to Sicily, founded Kale Akte,<ref target="#CH2-n27">27</ref> and established himself as leader of the Sikles. But by the death of Douketios in 440 B.C., the Syracusans had mastered the rebellion.<ref target="#CH2-n28">28</ref>

               </head>
               <p>The tyranny in Sicily flourished at a time when it had been abolished in mainland Greece. It seems to differ from that of a Pisistratos or a Kypselos, by not necessarily being a movement of the demos against the oligarchs: Gelon took power at Syracuse with the support of the Gamoroi; Anaxilas came from a rich and aristocratic family. Most important, the Sicilian tyrants organized themselves into a military power able to resist foreign invaders such as the Carthaginians and the Etruscans, whereas their Greek counterparts usually commanded limited political strength. In spite of the ethical condemnation that, following Aristotle,<ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref> one is inclined to impose on such rulers, the early tyranny in Sicily brought prosperity, economic development, and geographic expansion to the Greek colonies. The tyrants can also take credit for fully developing the coinage, which in that period attained an artistic perfection, exceptional even for the Greek world.</p>
               <p>The coins represented in the hoard were minted in this historical context. Possibly, the upheaval of Douketios’s revolt—perhaps his defeat at Nomai in 451 B.C.—prevented the owner of the hoard from ever retrieving his buried treasure.</p>

               <p>There are 10 tetradrachms from Rhegion in the hoard, belonging to two different periods. Nos. 1 to 6 are all from different pairs of dies. Their types are the same as those of Messana of the same period (nos. 91 to 173): on the obverse a mule cart driven by a seated male charioteer and on the reverse a hare running to right. The mule cart is one of the few Greek coin types alluding to a contemporary historical event. Aristotle explains that Anaxilas of Rhegion introduced the hare in Sicily and after winning the mule cart race at Olympia, celebrated his victory on the coins.<ref target="#CH3-n30">30</ref> The interpretation of the reverse probably reflects a legend created a posteriori to fit an unusual type. More likely the hare refers to the rural god Pan with whom it appears on later coins of Messana inscribed ΓAN.<ref target="#CH3-n31">31</ref> The obverse, however, is an original and personal variation of the agonistic horse quadriga introduced first at Syracuse to celebrate the Sicilian victories at the Olympian games and adopted by many other Greek cities of Sicily during the fifth century B.C. Anaxilas, with his new coin types, thereby presented himself as the peer if not the rival of the other tyrants of Gela and Syracuse.</p>
               <p>The tetradrachms, nos. 7-10, all from the same pair of dies, present different types: a lion's head facing on the obverse, and on the reverse a bearded man seated, holding a staff, his legs wrapped in a himation. The lion is the sacred animal of Apollo, the god of the colonization, who enjoyed a special cult in the Chalcidian colonies such as Rhegion.<ref target="#CH3-n32">32</ref> Many interpretations have been suggested for the seated man on the reverse<ref target="#CH3-n33">33</ref> but Six’s hypohesisis—that he must represent the founding hero Iokastos, son of Aiolos whose kingdom the ancient mythographs place in the Lipari islands off the north coast of Sicily—has prevailed and is now generally accepted.<ref target="#CH3-n34">34</ref>

                     <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_51769105">E. S. G. Robinson</name> however, in his article on the Samians at Zankle, established the general chronological sequence of the issues of Rhegion and Messana to the end of the fifth century B.C. and his conclusions are still valid. As was noted above, Anaxilas took power at Rhegion in 494/3 B.C, and succeeded in expelling the Samians from Zankle in 489/8 B.C, thus becoming master of the Straits. He first struck coins on the Chalcidian standard with a lion's head on the obverse and a</p>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <p>Calf’s head on the reverse.<ref target="#CH3-n36">36</ref> After winning the mule cart race at Olympia, he introduced the new types which interest us here. The date of his victory provides the terminus post quem for the tetradrachms, nos. 1-6. We know from Diodoros that Anaxilas died in 476 B.C. after 18 years of reign.<ref target="#CH3-n37">37</ref> Five Olympiads fall within those years. The first two, in 492 B.C. and 488 B.C., are certainly too early as they would leave almost no time at all for the first lion/calf coins.<ref target="#CH3-n38">38</ref> The fifth, in 476 B.C., is too late for it would presuppose that Anaxilas's successors and not the tyrant himself inaugurated this coinage after his death. There remain those of 484 and 480 B.C. Barron preferred the earlier date on the basis of the Passo di Piazza hoard<ref target="#CH3-n39">39</ref> which contained one didrachm of the mule cart type of Rhegion and which he thought had been buried before 480 B.C., although now a somewhat later date, 480/78 B.C., is generally accepted. The hoard also included three didrachms of the beginning of Group IV of Akragas. As Westermark has shown in a recent study,<ref target="#CH3-n40">40</ref> they are contemporary with the didrachms of Himera of Akragantine type, dated historically between 483 and 472 B.C. No reason compels us to date Anaxilas’s victory in 484 B.C., and in fact 480 B.C., the date suggested by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_51769105">E. S. G. Robinson</name>, is preferable as it agrees better with the historical context. With the new types, Anaxilas also changed the standard of the coins from the Euboic-Chalcidian to the Euboic-Attic (four drachms to the tetradrachm instead of three to the stater, both of about 17 g). This is the standard used in Syracuse from the beginning of its coinage in the sixth century B.C. and after the battle of Himera in 480 B.C., which established the city’s supremacy and the Deinomenid’s hegemony over most of the island, it was adopted by all the other cities striking coins. It was also after the battle of Himera that Anaxilas had to renounce his rivalry with Gelon and submit to the Deinomenid authority in order to save his dominion over the Straits.</p>
                  <p>The terminus ante for the mule cart issues at Rhegion or the terminus post for the introduction of the new types, nos. 7-10, is generally thought to be the fall of the Anaxilades in 461 B.C. The hoard evidence supports this date. At that point Rhegion and Messana each resumed their own independent coinage with different types.<ref target="#CH3-n41">41</ref> The coinage of Rhegion, from the restoration of democracy in 461 B.C. to the middle of the fourth century B.C., has been studied in a corpus by <name type="pname">H. Herzfelder</name>. The lower limit for his first group, to which the tetradrachms, nos. 7-10 belong, is given by the Villabate hoard.<ref target="#CH3-n42">42</ref>
                     <name type="pname">A. Evans</name> in the initial publication of the hoard suggested a burial date around 450 B.C.,<ref target="#CH3-n43">43</ref> accepted by Herzfelder. On the basis of the coins of Gela represented in the hoard, Jenkins showed that a slightly lower date is preferable.<ref target="#CH3-n44">44</ref>
                     <name type="pname">C. M. Kraay</name>, noting that the hoard also contained one tetradrachm from Messana with the four-bar sigma, argued in favor of an even later date ca. 440 B.C.<ref target="#CH3-n45">45</ref> Since some interruption in the coinage between the change of regimes is likely, the tetradrachms, nos. 7-10, were probably minted around 450 B.C.</p>
                  <p>The tetradrachm, no. 1, with the ethnic reading from left to right is extremely rare. The only other published specimen, from the same pair of dies, is in the collection of King Gustav VI in

Stockholm (see catalogue). The same reverse die is also combined with a different obverse.<ref target="#CH3-n46">46</ref> All the other coins from the mule cart/hare series at Rhegion bear a retrograde legend. The "abnormal" reverse die of no. 1 probably belongs to the beginning of the series, close to 480 B.C. It is interesting to note that Messana does exactly the opposite—the retrograde ethnic is rare, and the legend from left to right normal. The tetradrachms, nos. 3-6, have wider flans which indicate a later date. Nos. 7-10 are all from the same pair of dies, Herzfelder 1 (Dl/Rl). The obverse has been recut<ref target="#CH3-n47">47</ref> and on the reverse, die breaks have developed on the wreath and on the foot and raised right arm of Iokastos. In other words the dies are worn but the coins need not have circulated long after 450 B.C.</p>

The main types—eagle and crab—are the same as those of the earlier didrachms and remain constant throughout the coinage of the city, including the bronzes. Only toward the end of the fifth century B.C. does a horse quadriga appear on the obverse.

On hoard evidence, these no doubt preceded the tetradrachms and do not overlap them. So the terminal date of the didrachms gives us the terminus post quem for the tetradrachms. Jenkins, in his monograph on Gela, established a preliminary arrangement of the didrachms in four groups, dated between 510 and 480 B.C.<ref target="#CH3-n54">54</ref>

The Monte Bubbonia and Casulla hoards, both buried perhaps ca. 470 B.C., contained only didrachms of Akragas and no tetradrachms.<ref target="#CH3-n57">57</ref> So the period between 464 or 461 and 450 B.C. where the dated issues of other mints in the Randazzo hoard belong, seems very suitable for the tetradrachms of Akragas as well.</p>
                  <p>The crab on the first tetradrachms has a rather small and triangular body (no. 11); symbols are added later as on the didrachms.<ref target="#CH3-n58">58</ref> All dies represented in the Randazzo hoard are well known in several specimens except for the pair of dies of no. 12, with the legs closely parallel on the left on the reverse, known only from a plated coin in Naples.</p>

               <p>There are 29 tetradrachms from Gela in the hoard, nos. 19-47, from 17 obverse dies and 21 reverse dies, including one die combination and one reverse die not known to Jenkins in his 1970 monograph.</p>
               <p>Obverse 32 (no. 19) inaugurates the regular series of tetradrachms,<ref target="#CH3-n59">59</ref> preceded only by a very short experimental issue at the end of Group 1. The Syracusan quadriga is adopted as obverse type and remains constant throughout the entire coinage of Gela for this denomination, with variations only in the adjunct symbols. As noted above, the four-horse racing chariot is an agonistic type and it is most likely that the first Sicilian to win the Olympian chariot race was a Geloan, Pantares,<ref target="#CH3-n60">60</ref> father of the tyrant Kleandros. The small Nike flying above the chariot, crowning the horses, symbolizes the victory. In the later group of tetradrachms (nos. 40-47), Jenkins Group 3, the Nike is replaced by an Ionic column shown behind the horses. In this context it must be interpreted as a terma, a turning post in the race.<ref target="#CH3-n61">61</ref> The man-faced bull of the reverse represents the characteristic Geloan type, already adopted in the earliest issues of didrachms. Only the forepart appears in the two groups of tetradrachms present in the hoard. He is always bearded, with taurine ears and horns. The bent legs are often interpreted as "swimming" but more likely they simply conform to the archaic "Knielauf" schema and indicate movement.</p>
               <p>In spite of <name type="pname">H. P. Isler’s</name> thesis, according to which the man-headed bull always represents the river god Acheloos,<ref target="#CH3-n62">62</ref> one must recognize here the local river god Gelas,<ref target="#CH3-n63">63</ref> just as other Sicilian and South Italian cities represent their local river gods on their coins. In this group of tetradrachms, symbols appear in the obverse exergue: a wheat ear (no. 40), or a ketos (no. 41-43). In the past such symbols have been interpreted in connection with contemporary historical evens,<ref target="#CH3-n64">64</ref>
                  <pb n="21"/>
a view which has since been decisively challenged.<ref target="#CH3-n65">65</ref> We simply do not know the precise meaning of such symbols; perhaps they were used primarily to mark the issue. It is interesting to note that for Sicily the same symbol occurs at the same time at different mints, according to the revised lower chronology; for example: the ketos at Gela, Katane and Syracuse; the palmette at Gela and Katane; the lion at Syracuse and Leontinoi.</p>

C. M. Kraay suggested that the tetradrachms with the new Syracusan obverse were introduced by Polyzalos, on his accession to power in Gela after Gelon’s death in 478/7 B.C. This possibility also occurred to Jenkins even though he did not stress the point.<ref target="#CH3-n71">71</ref> The lower limit of this first group of tetradrachms is given by the Monte Bubbonia hoard (<hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2071) buried ca. 475/70 B.C., as Jenkins established.<ref target="#CH3-n72">72</ref> The latest coins represented are didrachms from Akragas Group 4 and didrachms from Himera with the crab on the revese,<ref target="#CH3-n73">73</ref> both dated to the reign of Theron of Akragas over Himera 483/2-472 B.C.

                  <p>The tetradrachms, nos. 40-47, belong to Jenkins Group 3—an interval of some years separate them from the previous group.<ref target="#CH3-n75">75</ref> The style has changed and on the obverse an Ionic column and a symbol in exergue are introduced. There is no direct evidence for the dating of Group 3. Jenkins places it between 465 and 450 B.C. on the basis of the number of dies used and of the beginning of Group 4. The terminus post quem for Group 4 is given by an overstrike of Gela on a coin of Mende dated ca. 450 B.C.<ref target="#CH3-n76">76</ref> Group 3 belongs to the period of restored democracy.</p>
                  <p>Jenkins has described all the dies and their stylistic evolution in great detail and with great precision and I can only refer the reader to his book. Nos. 27-28 deserve special notice as they present a die combination not known to Jenkins—O 37 with R 77. Obverse 37 occurs with R 74, 75 and 76 and R 77 with O 36 and 38,<ref target="#CH3-n77">77</ref> so the new combination merely confirms the arrangement and reinforces the linkage of Jenkins Group 2b. The reverse die of nos. 45 and 46 is not in Jenkin’s corpus. In style it is very close to R 121 and 124 and probably cut by the same engraver. Characteristic are the fine features of the face with the pointed nose and well-shaped

mouth and the curly beard. The lettering of the ethnic is also fine and small. With O 62 we are almost at the end of Group 3 which includes O 65, the last obverse combined with the remarkable wreathed Gelas of R 130,<ref target="#CH3-n78">78</ref> and linked to the following Group 4.</p>

               <p>There are 29 tetradrachms from Katane in the hoard, nos. 48-76, from 8 obverses dies and 10 reverse dies.<ref target="#CH3-n79">79</ref> Two die combinations are new, as are one obverse die and two reverse dies.</p>
               <p>The obverse bears a man-faced bull, representing the local river god Amenanos to the right,<ref target="#CH3-n80">80</ref> usually with the right foreleg bent to indicate that he is "swimming" or simply in motion, or sometimes just standing (nos. 70-73). The fish under the river god and the lack of exergue line in the earlier dies (nos. 48-59) emphasize the idea of the water. The branch above seems to be a pine branch.<ref target="#CH3-n81">81</ref> The sea monster (nos. 60-69) can also be interpreted as a marine symbol although its precise meaning remains unclear as at Syracuse and Gela. The palmette is purely decorative. Other symbols on the obverse are the Satyr (nos. 60-69) or the Nike (nos. 70-73).</p>
               <p>On the reverse Nike appears, her hair rolled up, clad in a long, transparent chiton, showing the outline of the breasts and the legs. She runs or walks to the left, a fillet in her outstretched right hand, holding her drapery with her left (no. 48) or a branch (no. 70) or a wreath (no. 73). The type is quite common on coins and does not necessarily relate to a political victory such as that over the tyranny in this case. More likely it alludes to an agonistic victory. The later reverse dies, nos. 70-76, have a letter in field, <graphic url="NS18_sym1.jpg"/> or H. The ethnic is KATANE at first (nos. 48-58), then KATANAION (nos. 59-69, 74-76) or sometimes KATANAIO<graphic url="NS18_sym2.jpg"/> (nos. 70-73).</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>The Katane tetradrachms in the hoard represent the first emission of the city in its own name. Not much is known of the early history of Katane:<ref target="#CH3-n82">82</ref> it must have fallen under the domination of the tyrants with Kallipolis, Leontinoi and Naxos around 497 B.C. In 476 B.C., probably after an eruption of Mount Etna, Hieron of Syracuse evacuated the Kataneans to Leontinoi and refounded the city under the name of Aitna<ref target="#CH3-n83">83</ref> with new settlers from Syracuse and the Peloponnese. It became his capital. After the fall of the tyranny in 467 B.C., Hieron’s supporters were allowed to leave and settle at Inessa, which they renamed Aitna, and the original inhabitants of Katane could return home. It is at that time and not earlier as previously thought,<ref target="#CH3-n84">84</ref> that the first coins in the name of Katane were minted.<ref target="#CH3-n85">85</ref> Two issues in the name of Aitna survive—the first is known only by a unique tetradrachm in a private collection, bearing on the obverse a quadriga driven by Athena and on the reverse the seated figure of Zeus</p>
                  <pb n="23"/>
                  <p>Aitnaios, and by another unique drachm with a horseman and Zeus Aitnaos.<ref target="#CH3-n86">86</ref> The second consists of the unique tetradrachm in Brussels with the impressive Silenus head on the obverse and the seated Zeus on the reverse,<ref target="#CH3-n87">87</ref> accompanied by a series of obols. The issue with Athena as charioteer is certainly the earlier and dates from Hieron's Aitna, between 476 and 466 B.C. It was a special issue in honor of Hieron, while the regular money needed by the tyrant was supplied by the other mints under Deinomenid rule, such as Syracuse and Gela. The Brussels tetradrachm is generally thought to belong to Aitna-Ktanee and to be the work of the master of the Naxos tetradrachm, here nos. 227-31, struck just before 461 B.C. Kraay, however, pointed out that after the death of the last Deinomenid, Thrasyboulos, in 466 B.C. there was hardly an occasion for such a splendid coin and he suggested that the Brussels tetradrachm might be the first issue of Inessa rather than the last of Aitna.<ref target="#CH3-n88">88</ref> This is possible: the disappearance of the Syracusan quadriga from the obverse supports a date after the fall of the tyranny. The new settlement of Inessa/Aitna could be an appropriate occasion for the coin. The style is close to that of the Naxos tetradrachm and also to that of the first issue of Rhegion after 461 B.C. with the seated Iokastos, here nos. 7-10. However, Kraay’s argument is weakened by the fact that the litrai of Aitna also bear a Silenus head which continued in the litrai of Katane.</p>
                  <p>Katane then minted one special issue under Hieron in the name of Aitna and started its regular autonomous coinage only after the fall of the tyranny in 465 B.C. This is not surprising since the tyrants tended to monopolize the coinage and to prevent cities under their rule from striking autonomous coins as, for example, at Naxos and Kamarina.</p>
                  <p>The Amenanos/Nike tetradrachms from Katane are perhaps the most important and most interesting component of the hoard. These coins are quite rare, as a glance through the major collections and catalogues shows. The catalogue indicates the number of specimens known from each die pair before and after the discovery of the Randazzo hoard (e.g. 5/11), which on average has more than doubled their number. Very rarely do they appear in hoards (see chart, pp. 42-43) and never in any large number. To date only the Ognina hoard<ref target="#CH3-n89">89</ref> contained as many as 10 tetradrachms of Katane of the Amenanos/Nike type. Thus the Randazzo hoard with 29 examples is quite exceptional. The coins are not all in good condition; some are encrusted with a layer of dirt, as nos. 57 and 71. Many of them are poorly struck, off center, and often double struck (nos. 52, 56, 60, 62). Some might be overstruck if the flattened flan is an indication (nos. 51, 62, 75) but no traces of an undertype are discernable. The dies were used for a long time even after they began to crack (as the die of no. 48 at the right foreleg) or became corroded (nos. 56-57). It is interesting to note how closely die linked the group is. The whole relative sequence of the first issue of Katane with river god and Nike can be reconstituted practically on the basis of the specimens present in the Randazzo hoard. Few dies seem to be missing: the most conspicuous being the obverse die of Ognina 74 with the crane above the bull as symbol, which certainly belongs at the beginning, as shown by the reverse die linking to the obverse die with the branch (no. 48). Also not represented in the hoard is the later die with a similar water fowl as symbol in the British Museum<ref target="#CH3-n90">90</ref> or some with the Satyr as symbol. But the series is almost complete, as the latest dies with the Nike as symbol above the man-faced bull are present in the hoard. The die linkage indicates on the one hand that the coins must have been minted in a short span of time and also that they were struck not far from their burial site which strengthens the likelihood of Randazzo as the find spot.</p>
                  <pb n="24"/>
                  <p>With the conservative estimate of one die per year, the bull/Nike series fits very well between the years following the return of the Kataneans to their city after the death of Thrasyboulos and ca. 450-445 B.C.<ref target="#CH3-n91">91</ref> The more common quadriga/Apolo head tetradrachms which will replace this series are not represented in the hoard and cannot have started before 445/40 B.C. Nos. 59 and 73 present new die combinations. No. 69 stands out due to its very different, barbarous style: both the Nike and the man-faced bull are cut in shallow relief; the folds of Nike's chiton are very linear and stiff and so is the rendering of the feathers of the wings. No. 76 presents a new reverse die, certainly by the same hand as nos. 73 and 74, as can be seen in the rendering of the drapery and the wing. But the disposition of the letters of the legend is different, starting at the bottom of the wing and ending at the fillet. The H in field is smaller than on no. 71.</p>

               <p>There are 14 tetradachmss from Leontinoi in the hoard, nos. 77-90, from 9 obverse dies and 11 reverse dies. Nos. 77-87 belong to the first issue of the city and 88-90 to the second. Only one reverse die, no. 83, was hitherto unknown.</p>
               <p>The first group has on the obverse the typical four-horse chariot, the agonistic type first introduced at Syracuse. The reverse shows a lion’s head in profile, with jaws opened wide and the tongue protruding; all surrounded by four grains of barley. The lion is the sacred animal of Apollo whose cult was predominant in the Chalcidian colonies.<ref target="#CH3-n92">92</ref> The type also offers a pun on the name of the city. The grains of barley symbolize the fertility of the soil which brought wealth to the city and at the same time indicate the denomination, the four-drachma piece.</p>
               <p>In the second group, nos. 88-90, the Nike on the obverse crowns the charioteer rather than the horses. A lion appears in the exergue; again it must be interpreted as an allusion to the cult of Apollo, despite the different interpretations given this symbol, which will be discussed in greater detail below in relation to the parallel issue at Syracuse. On the reverse the head of Apollo himself replaces the lion; it is surrounded by three laurel leaves and a small lion like the one on the obverse.</p>

                  <p>The mint of Leontinoi awaits complete study by Christ of Boehringer. The arrangement of the coins in the catalogue follows that of the corpus in preparation. On hoard evidence, it is now generally accepted that coinage at Leontinoi did not start as early as previously thought. We know that the city was taken by Hippokrates of Gela around 490 B.C., as were Kallipolis, Naxos and Zankle.<ref target="#CH3-n93">93</ref> As Naxos, Katane, and Kamarina, Leontinoi did not strike its own coinage in that period. In 476 B.C., Hieron of Syracuse moved the inhabitants of Naxos and Katane to Leontinoi and enlarged the city.<ref target="#CH3-n94">94</ref> It must be at that time that the first coins were issued. There are no coins of Leontinoi in the Gela hoard buried ca. 490/485 B.C.,<ref target="#CH3-n95">95</ref> nor in the Passo di Piazza hoard
<pb n="25"/>
buried ca. 480/78 B.C., but two tetradrachms are present in the Monte Bubbonia hoard buried ca. 475/70 B.C.<ref target="#CH3-n96">96</ref> They are of the quadriga/lion's head type and struck from the very first die of this issue.<ref target="#CH3-n97">97</ref> Leontinoi, unlike Gela and Akragas, must have minted tetradrachms and didrachms at the same time; the Casulla hoard (<hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2075), buried ca. 470/65 B.C., contained two didrachms from Leontinoi. Also the lion's heads are very similar in style on both denominations. Exacty how long this first issue lasted can only be determinedd by the final die study but it seems reasonable to assume that it did not extend beyond Hieron s death in 466 B.C. Nos. 77-87 belong to this period. Few die links occur among the tetradrachms represented in the Ran-dazzo hoard and it can therefore be inferred that the total issue was much larger than the coins represented here. Style variations among the issues confirm this: there is a great differenee between the lion s heads of nos. 77-81, with a very fine and stylized mane, and the more realistic version of nos. 83-85, certainly of later date. No. 87 introduess the ethnic ?EONTINON in exergue on the obverse and a dotted truncation of the lion’s head on the reverse.</p>
                  <p>The dating of the second group, nos. 88-90 poses a problem which will only be solved satisfactorily by the compette die study and by the detailed publication of other hoards. The similarity between the tetradachmss of Leontinoi with the early Apollo head and the Syracuann Demareteia is obvious: they both bear the same lion in exergue on the obverse, repeated on the reverse as well at Leontinoi; both the Arethusa and the Apollo heads are wreathed with laurel and present a close similarity of stye.<ref target="#CH3-n98">98</ref> No doubt the Leontinoi tetradrachms were influenced by the Demareteion. But there are also differeness such as the rendering of the eye, clearly in profile on no. 90, whereas the Demaeteiaa still show a frontal eye.<ref target="#CH3-n99">99</ref> Also the quadigaa at Leontinoi, with the more realistic and fleshy charoteer,, compared to the wiry, stylized one of the Demareteia, is more advanced in style. So the Leontinoi tetradrachms are somewhat later but how much later remains open. If we accept a dating of the Syracuann decadrachm in the last years of Hieron s reign, there is not sufficient time for the early Apollo head tetradrachms of Leontinoi; this type so strongly associated with the Deinomenids must have been minted before their fall. On the other hand since the mint opened around 476 B.C., both issues of tetradrachms represented here must be compressed within ten years at the most. The early Apollo head issue at Leontinoi was no doubt a very limited one as there seem to be only two obverse and two reverse dies known.<ref target="#CH3-n100">100</ref> It is of course possible that the lion's head tetradrachms were paralell to this issue in the early 60s of the fifth century B.C. instead of strictly sequentall and also that the output of the mint of Leontinoi in Hieron's days was much more important than the conservaivee estimate of one die per year used for the coinages of Katane and Messana in the same period. One can also question whether in this early period a change of political regime was necessarlly reflected in the coin types. At any rate we must assume that the two Leontinoi series present in the Randazzo hoard belong to Hieron's reign.</p>
                  <p>The new reverse die, no. 83, with the fine lettering of the ethnic, the high relief of the lion's head, and the rendering of the contour of the jaw in a half circe,, is very similar to that of the tetradrachm in Naples from the same obverse die and most likely by the same hand.</p>

                     <p>The number of dies is by no means an absolute criterion for calculating the duration of an issue and for establishing a chronology. We know very well from Athens and Syracuse, for example, that a mint could produce many dies in a single year. Nevertheless when a series of coins is tightly die linked and exhibits some stylistic development as we have here with nos. 48-76 and below, p. 27, nos. 174-226, the beginning of the Nike series at Messana—the length of the issue can be estimated roughly on the basis of one die per year, to be checked of course against other arguments.</p>

               <p>There are 136 tetradrachms from Messana in the hoard, nos. 91-226, from 70 obverse dies and 67 reverse dies. Like the coins of Rhegion, nos. 1-10, they can be divided into two different groups; nos. 91-173 bear on the obverse a mule cart and nos. 174-226 have the addition of a small Nike flying above the mules.</p>
               <p>The types of the mule cart and the hare are identical to those of the first group at Rhegion, nos. 1-6, except for the ethnic, and have been explaneed above. They are the original badge of the tyrant Anaxilas. In the second group, the basic type is maintained but altered slightly by the adjunct of the small Nike crowning the mules on the obverse and of symboss or letters on the reverse above or below the hare's body, whereas at Rhegion, as we have seen, the types change to a lion s head and seated oecist at that time. The Nike is an agonisicc symbol and refers to the victory at the Olympian games; she does not symbolize the victory over the tyranny as has been postuated.<ref target="#CH3-n101">101</ref>

                  </head>
                  <p>The absolue chronology of the two groups of tetradrachms of Messana in the hoard is the same as that of Rhegion as Robinson has already demonsrated.<ref target="#CH3-n102">102</ref> The new types of Anaxilas struck on the Attic standad,, replacing the lion's head/calf's head types on the Euboic-Chaci--dian standard, were introduced in 480 B.C. after the tyrant's victory at Olympia, and lasted until the fall of the Anaxilades in 461 B.C. Since the issue without the Nike is a fairly large one, it seems reasonable to assume that the one with the Nike starts when Rhegion introduced the lion s head/oecstt issue. From then on the two cities resumed their independntt coinages. To date there are no known reverse die links between the two groups of Messana; an interruption in the coinage must have occurred with the change of regime. The lower limit of the second group of tetradrachms of Messana in the Randazzo hoard is given in relative terms<ref target="#CH3-n103">103</ref> by a change in the lettering of the ethnic: all the coins bear the curved sigma <graphic url="NS18_sym3.jpg"/>. The four-bar sigma <graphic url="NS18_sym2.jpg"/> was introduced soon after the burial date of the hoard and gives a terminus ante quem for the tetradrachms, nos. 174-226.</p>
                  <p>The hoard evidence for the introduction of the four-bar sigma is scanty as so few hoards have been published in detail. Also the coins of Messana were once regarded as less interesting or less important than those of other Sicilian mints such as Syracuse or Gela and are often not described at all in hoard reports dating to the end of the nineteenth or the beginning of the twentieth century. Three hoards in particular would be important: Calabria 1833, Villabate 1893 and Selinunte 1923.<ref target="#CH3-n104">104</ref> All contaneed tetradrachms of Messana but the details of the lettering are known only for the Villabate hoard: it contained 13 tetradrachms of the mule cart type, 10 of which had the four-bar sigma <graphic url="NS18_sym2.jpg"/>.<ref target="#CH3-n105">105</ref> A burial date ca. 445 B.C. is generaly accepted.<ref target="#CH3-n106">106</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other factors can be considered in trying to establish the duration of the Nike group with the curved sigma, such as the number of dies represented, as Kraay has suggested,<ref target="#CH3-n107">107</ref> and over-

strikes. There are 14 obverse dies and 12 reverse dies in this issue; a duration of about 10 years seems plausible. So the absolute dates for the two groups can be established as 480-461 B.C. for the first group and 461-450 B.C. for the second group.</p>
                  <p>The relative sequence within the issues, however, remanis more difficult to reconstitute. Until a compette corpus of the coinage of Messana is compiled,<ref target="#CH3-n108">108</ref> only a working hypothesis can be suggested.</p>
                  <p>The first group is particularly difficult to order because of the absence of symbols which could help to reconstuctt the sequence. Style is not really helpful either. There is very little evolution in the treatment of the mules, the charioteer, and the hare. There are differeness between the rather stylized and elongated charioteer of nos. 91 and 93 for instance, where both are of about the same size, and the more fleshy, squat and realistic version of nos. 165 and 168. Changes also occur in the leaf in the exergue, small and bulky on nos. 91 and 93 or small and flat on nos. 99-100, or larger and more naturalistic, with a rendering of the veins on nos. 146 and 156. The hare on the reverse develops from the skinny animal with a small head and short ears of nos. 91, 93, 98 into a more muscular and well-proportioned rendering in nos. 156 and 167. The basic position however remains the same throughout: the hare is running to right with outstretched parallel paws. On the whole these details are not sufficient to permit a refined stylistic classification, as for instance can be determined by the numerous variations in the rendering of the head of Arethusa at Syracuse in the same period.</p>
                  <p>Many die links have already been observed (see catalogue) and eventually they will assure the reconstitution of the series without the Nike. Meanwhile the most reliable criterion seems to be the lettering of the ethnic on the reverse. It is always MESSENION in the group without the small Nike, in the Ionian form, usually written from left to right around the hare, starting at the hind paws and ending at the tail, except for the dies of nos. 91-92 and 93-94 where the inscription is retrograde. At Rhegion, as we have seen, the opposite occurs and the "normal" form from left to right constitutes the exception. Such short-lived variations are usually thought to be experimental and placed therefore at the beginning of a series. At Messana this arrangement also agrees with the style: the stylized mule cart and hare of no. 91 are certainly earlier than those on no. 159 for example. The curved sigma is a local variation found at Rhegion and Zankle-Messana.<ref target="#CH3-n109">109</ref> On most dies in both groups the sigma is reversed, pointing to the left. Only the dies of nos. 99, 105-6, 107, 108, 114-15 and 126 in the first group and of nos. 177-78, 179-80 and 226 in the second group have the right-pointing sigma.<ref target="#CH3-n110">110</ref> Obverse die links connect the two forms: no. 99 is linked to no. 100 by the same obverse die and nos. 176 and 177 also share the same obverse die. The sigma pointing to the left and the one pointing to the right, or the reversed and the normal sigma, alternate rather than follow or supplant each other, as they both occur in the two groups. In the second group, whose sequence is certain, the sigma pointing to the right <graphic url="NS18_sym3.jpg"/> appears at the beginning with the letter A and is replaced by <graphic url="NS18_sym4.jpg"/> with B, C, and D but reappears later, if indeed no. 226 belongs where I have put it.</p>
                  <p>The shape and size of the letters vary: sometimes they are small and regular, as on nos. 91, 100, 108, or large and thicker as on nos. 137 and 147. Nos. 123, 125, and 129 show particularly small letters in the ethnic but it is possible that these dies were intended for didrachms rather than for tetradrachms.</p>
                  <p>The Nike group (nos. 174-226) is easier to classify: numerous die links, as well as symbols and letters on the reverse, assure the correct sequence. The letters A, B, C, and D appear below the hare. Coins with B and C share the same obverse die (nos. 184-194) and the wear of the die
<pb n="28"/>
confirms the alphabetical order. Moreover the change in the ethnic from the Ionian MESSENION of the first group without Nike to the Doric MESSANION occurs at the beginning of the Nike group, more precisely between the letter A and the letter B issues: nos. 179-80 still have MESSENION but nos. 181-184 have MESSANION. The obverse die of no. 178, in more worn condition, is also used in combination with the reverse of 179, to strike coins with the letter A,<ref target="#CH3-n111">111</ref> proving that nos. 176 and 177 with the olive twig as a symbol below the hare must be placed before the series with letters (nos. 179ff.).</p>
                  <p>Nos. 174 and 175 with the olive twig and the olive as symbol, very likely belong at the beginning of the group. The round C for gamma and D for delta are typical archaic forms of the Euboean-Chalcidian alphabet. Letters were used on the coinage of the Samians at Zankle, where A, <graphic url="NS18_sym5.jpg"/>, ┐, △ ∃ and Z marked the yearly issues.<ref target="#CH3-n112">112</ref> The meaning of the letters in the Nike group at Messana is probably the same although they cannot be interpreted strictly as dates, rather they served to distinguish the issues. They cannot be meant to mark the dies since different dies share the same letter as on the coins of the Samians. The four issues vary in size and importance, it seems: there are many more coins with B and C than with A even though the number of dies used is approximately the same (perhaps 3). It is interesingg to note that dies in this period were used until badly deteriorated: the dies of nos. 184 and 217 in particular continudd to be used even after corrosion had made them almost unrecognizable. Also in this period dies were often recut: the B of nos. 185-87 is recut into a C on no. 188 and it confirms the practice of keeping the dies in use as long as possible. The reason might have been a shortage of die cutters after the fall of the Anaxilades when Rhegion and Messana resumed their independent coinage. A comparison of the coins struck after the restoration of democracy in 461 B.C. at Rhegion (nos. 7-10) and at Messana (Nike group nos. 174-226) is striking: at Rhegion the quality of the engraving is far superior, with the beautiful and plastic lion’s head facing and the seated oecist on the reverse, which successfully realizes an attempt at perspective. The coins are also carefully struck. At Messana, in contrast, the same mule cart and hare continue with practically no stylistic development. Only with the die of no. 203 do we encounter a representation in three-quarter view of the charioteer on the obverse. Otherwise the dies seem to have been made and cut poorly: not only do they rust but they also break very easily (nos. 174-75 and nos. 177-78 each have a large flaw behind the hare's neck). The coins of this series were struck hastily and carelessly. Many of them show signs of double striking (nos. 185-87, 193-99, 212-13, 217, 223). Obviously Messana needed coins quickly and in large quantities in that period. The small gold issue which, as I have suggested elsewhere, most likely belongs to this same period,<ref target="#CH3-n113">113</ref> reinforces the idea of an emergency coinage, struck perhaps to pay the soldiers or mercenaries who helped in the expulsion of the tyrants. As discussed earlier, the ancient sources for the history of Messana are scanty so we do not know in any detail what happened in that decade. At any rate, the change and the differeness between the issues of Rhegion and Messana after 461 B.C., where previously the two coinages had been identical under the Anaxilades, might indicate that Anaxilas had installed a single mint<ref target="#CH3-n114">114</ref> for the two cities under his rule, probably at</p>
                  <pb n="29"/>
                  <p>Rhegion, his capital. After the fall of the tyrants, Messana practically had to open a new mint, inoperative since the period of the incuse coinage preceding the Samians at Zankle. This would explain the difficulty in finding good engravers and good craftsmen to strike the coins.</p>

                  <p>According to Thucydides, Naxos was the first colony in Sicily, founded in 734/3 B.C. by settlers from Naxos and Chalkis. <name type="pname">H. A. Cahn</name> studied the coinage of the city in a corpus and believed that it was also the first mint to issue coins in Sicily.<ref target="#CH3-n118">118</ref> After a detailed stylistic analysis, Cahn dated the beginning of the coinage ca. 550 B.C. This is now considered too early and Kraay tentatively suggests 530 BC.<ref target="#CH3-n119">119</ref> Moreover Selinus and Himera were the two major mints of sixth century Sicily, judging by the surviving number of coins and dies, and they must also have been the first to strike coins, not before 540/30 B.C., followed by Zankle and Naxos. The amazing feature of the coinage of Naxos is that from the beginnngg it displays a fully developed reverse type, the attribute of the deity on the obverse.</p>
                  <p>As noted, the city was taken by Hippokrates of Gela ca. 490 B.C. and stopped minting coins in its own name. Coinage was resumed only after the fall of the tyranny in Sicily in 461 B.C. with this remarkable issue,<ref target="#CH3-n120">120</ref> one of the greatest masterpieces of Greek coinage and Greek art in general. The head of the obverse reflects the monumentality of early classical art and the reverse is a daring representation, both in subject and in technique, of the human body in a complicated position, beautifully contained within the narrow circumference of the flan. The artist is thought to be the same as that of the later tetradrachms of Aitna that have survived only in the unique example with the Silenos head in Bussels.<ref target="#CH3-n121">121</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no doubt about the date of this issue:<ref target="#CH3-n122">122</ref> the Naxians had been moved to Leontinoi by Hieron in 476 B.C. and returned home in 461 B.C. They celebrated their recovered freedom with this new coinage.</p>
                  <p>With this issue the Naxians achieved the highest quality not only artistically but also in the manufacture of the dies: the five tetradrachms in the hoard are all from the same pair of dies

(Cahn no. 54) which is the only one known for this issue. Cahn, in 1944, listed 56 known specimens, all from the same pair of dies. The number has since increased by at least 50%, some 20 new specimens having surfaced. Drachms of the same issue (Cahn no. 56) are known in more than 78 specimens. Rarely do Greek coinages present such a high number of surviving specimens from a single pair of dies (Knidos and some Cretan mints offer an even greater frequency). The condition of the dies is equally remarkable: there are die breaks, on the reverse between the hand holding the kantharos and the border of the coin, which Cahn thinks existed almost from the beginning of the emission sequence, and also on the obverse under the truncation of the neck, in front of the mouth, and at the beard, but there is apparently very little die deterioration.<ref target="#CH3-n123">123</ref> No. 227 is in very fresh condition and shows no traces of die breaks at the neck nor in front of the mouth on the obverse. The break in front of the mouth starts faintly on no. 228, develops into a small stroke on no. 229 and becomes larger on nos. 230 and 231 where the die break at the neck is also present, filling the border of dots.</p>

               <p>The coins from Syracuse form the major part of the Randazzo hoard with 308 tetradrachms (nos. 232-539) or 57%, struck from 127 obverse dies and 166 reverse dies. There are three obverse and eight reverse dies that were not known to <name type="pname">E. Boehringer</name>,<ref target="#CH3-n124">124</ref> as well as 25 new die combinations (including those with the new dies). Of these nos. 247, 257, 265-66, 393-96, 418, 421, 447, and 459 have been published in different sale catalogues since 1929 and nos. 307-9 are probably Boehringer's no. 271E. But nos. 232, 328-29, 333, 358, 398-99, 400, 422-23, 424, 427-29, 432, 445, 448, 469, 475, 481, and 510 are hitherto unpublished. The very limited number of new dies in such a large hoard shows once again how remarkably precise and reliable Boehringer's corpus remains even more than 50 years after its publication. We have an almost complete record of the dies.</p>
               <div3 xml:id="d1e2410" type="subsection">
                  <head>
                     <hi rend="italic">Types of the Syracuse Issues</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The types remain the same throughout the tetradrachm issues represented in the hoard with some variation in details and symbols. The obverse bears a four-hosee chariot at the walk, driven by a male charioteer; the reverse shows a female head. In the first group (nos. 232-35), the ethnic <graphic url="NS18_sym6.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NS18_sym7.jpg"/> is placed above the horses on the obverse in a rather heavy and static composition. From the second group on (nos. 236ff),, a small Nike is added crowning either the horses or the charioteer, and the ethnic is moved to the reverse. The quadriga, which we already encountered at Rhegion, Gela, Leontinoi, and Messana, was originally a Syracusan type, first introduced there at the end of the sixth century B.C., inspired by northern Greek types.<ref target="#CH3-n125">125</ref> The Deinomenids adopted it and developed it to celebrate their exploits at the Olympian games as a symbol of their power. As the tyrants expanded their rule over cities, the quadriga appeared on those coinages and became a truly Sicilian type. Its meaning however is purely agonistic, we must assume, and not political, or the type would have disappeared with the tyranny.</p>
                  <p>The head on the reverse is at first very small, centered on an incuse swastika, but soon develops into a fully modeled head (nos. 236ff) surrounded by four dolphins and the ethnic. The hair style and the jewelry are rendered in an amazing variety of detail and attest to the level of
<pb n="31"/>
sophistication of the time. The dolphins allude to the geographical location of Syracuse by the sea. The pearled diadem is purely decorative. In these early series no specific attributes characterize the female head further.<ref target="#CH3-n126">126</ref> Therefore, following Imhoof-Blumer,<ref target="#CH3-n127">127</ref> most scholars have recognized the local nymph on the coins<ref target="#CH3-n128">128</ref> as in many other Sicilian or South Italian mints. She is Arethusa: Pausanias tells us that she crossed the sea from Elis to the island of Ortygia in Syracuse, trying to escape Alpheios who was in love with her.<ref target="#CH3-n129">129</ref> She was turned into a spring sacred to the goddess Artemis.<ref target="#CH3-n130">130</ref>
                     <name type="pname">E. Boehringer</name> preferred to recognize Artemis herself on the coins<ref target="#CH3-n131">131</ref> and his discussion created some confusion which has carried forward to the preset.<ref target="#CH3-n132">132</ref> The earliest literary sources, such as Pindar, don't mention Arethusa, but the iconography of the nymph can best be attested by the coins themselves.</p>
                  <p>The interpretation of two symbols is also important: the lion which appears on Boehringer's Group 3, 12e, the Demareterion series, (no. 524 has no lion in exergue but belongs to the same group) and the ketos, the sea monster of Boehringer's Group 4 (here nos. 525-39). The lion, as we have seen, also occurs on coins of Leontinoi (nos. 88-90) in the exergue on the obverse and under the truncation of Apollo’s neck on the reverse. Several interpretations have been suggested: for Holm<ref target="#CH3-n133">133</ref> and Head<ref target="#CH3-n134">134</ref> it symbolized the defeated Carthaginians. Holloway<ref target="#CH3-n135">135</ref> sees in the lion the seal of the Emmenids, the family of Demarete. Evans<ref target="#CH3-n136">136</ref> related it to the games in honor of the Delphic Apollo. The first two interpretations give the lion a political and historical meaning for which there is no parallel in Greek coinage.</p>
                  <p>Coin types do not refer directly to historical events or personal exploits in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., with the notable exception of Anaxilas s mule cart at Rhegion (nos. 1-6) and Messana (nos. 91ff.). The hellenistic rulers introduced allusions to their victories on their coinages (Demetrios Poliorketes, Antigonos Gonatas, Agathokles) but only the Roman emperors will become masters of political propaganda and use the coinage for that purpose. Only then does every symbol and image on the coin relate to the person of the emperor and must be interpreted as such.<ref target="#CH3-n137">137</ref> Evan's hypothesis seems the most likely. The mythological significance of the lion is as the sacred animal of Apollo. As Boehringer pointed out, the ketos does not have any precise mythological meaning.<ref target="#CH3-n138">138</ref> He saw in it a reference to the naval victory of the Syracusans over the Etruscans at the battle of Kyme in 474 B.C. Again this seems a doubtful interpretation as will become clear in the discussion of the chronology.</p>

                  <p>The cornerstone of this chronoogyy is the Demareteion,<ref target="#CH3-n140">140</ref> the early Syracusan silver decadrachm, which Boehringer thought was struck to commemorate the battle of Himera in 480 B.C. The second fixed point is given by the battle of Kyme in 474 B.C. to which the ketos is supposed to allude. The date of 530 B.C. for the beginning of the coinage at Syracuse is based on stylistic comparisons with works of sculpture of the second half of the sixth century BC.<ref target="#CH3-n141">141</ref> The date of 450 B.C. is tentatively suggested based on the victory of Syracuse over Douketios. The end date of 435 B.C. is calculated back from the destruction dates of Selinus, Akragas, Gela, and Kamarina by the Carthaginians between 408 and 405 B.C. In their last issues these cities had already adopted the galloping quadriga introduced by the signing engravers and Boehringer allowed ca. 20 years for this development.</p>
                  <p>If the relative chronology seems unassailable, the absolue chronology met with some criticism from the beginning. Regling in his review of Boehringer<ref target="#CH3-n142">142</ref> argued that the starting date of 530 B.C. is too high; at present the date generally recognized is ca. 510 BC.<ref target="#CH3-n143">143</ref> The most unlikely aspect of Boehringer's chronology is the postulated gap in the coinage between 479 and 474 BC.<ref target="#CH3-n144">144</ref> Coinage is always intermittent but after the battle of Himera, Gelon received not only the spoils of the war but 2,000 talents of silver from the Carthaginians to cover the war expenses he incurred.<ref target="#CH3-n145">145</ref> Moreover Hieron, succeeding his brother Gelon at his death in 478 B.C., must have needed coins for his numerous activities and in preparation for the war against the Etruscans. In this particular historical context, an interruption in the coinage would be illogical. Two solutions have been offered to fill the gap: either to continue Group 3, the "Massenpragung" until 474 B.C.,<ref target="#CH3-n146">146</ref> putting some of the issues after the Demareteion; or to begin the ketos group immediately after the Demareteion issue, abandoning the association of the sea monster with the battle of Kyme.<ref target="#CH3-n147">147</ref> The discussion of the hoard evidence and of the consequences of the Randazzo hoard for Sicilian chronology, will make clear which of these alternatives is preferable. The interval between 435 and 425 B.C. was also questioned but it does not concern us here.<ref target="#CH3-n148">148</ref>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="33"/>
                  <p>No doubt the most serious attack on Boehringer's dating and consequently on the very foundation of Sicilian chronology was made by <name type="pname">Colin M. Kraay</name> more than 20 years ago.<ref target="#CH3-n149">149</ref> In the 1830s two scholars, Karl Otfried M?ller<ref target="#CH3-n150">150</ref> and <name type="pname">H. Duc de Luynes</name>
                     <ref target="#CH3-n151">151</ref> independently identified the early Syracusan decadrachm with the coin of Demarete, wife of Gelon, mentioned by the ancient sources.<ref target="#CH3-n152">152</ref> Its commemorative character was readily accepted and thus the date of 480/79 B.C. for its issue, immediately after the battle of Himera. Since then the Demareteion has served as the cornerstone for the chronology not only for numismatists but for historians and archaeologists as well.<ref target="#CH3-n153">153</ref> Kraay argued that the date of 480/79 B.C. was too early for the decadrachm; therefore the coin could not be the Demareteion described by the ancient historians. In his opinion, the decadrachm was issued after the fall of the Deinomenids, possibly in 461 B.C., to pay a special donative to the elite army that was able to control the mercenaries' revolt.<ref target="#CH3-n154">154</ref> The Demarateion referred to in the sources must therefore be an as yet unknown gold coin. It seems superfluoss to repeat here the arguments that during the past two decades have gone back and forth between Kraay and those scholars who did not accept his "destruction" of the Demareteion.<ref target="#CH3-n155">155</ref> Suffice it to point out that Kraay's main objection to the traditional chronology relies on the assumption that it is not plausible to postulate, as Boehringer did, the concentration of dies for his Group 3, a massive coinage of about 150 dies (with the new additions of recent years), issued over a period of just seven years. Kraay also uses several hoards, notably Gela, Passo di Piazza, Monte Bubbonia, Seltmann, Villabate, and Selinunte (<hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2066, 2068, 2071, 2076, 2082, and 2084) to support his arguments. The undermining of the Demareteion received some reinforcement from Christof Boehringer who in 1968 published a new tetradrachm from Aitna in a private Swiss collection.<ref target="#CH3-n156">156</ref> This remarkable piece bears on the obverse the usual horse quadriga driven not by a male charioteer but by the goddess Athena. The reverse has a seated Zeus. If we compare the Aitna quadriga to those on Syracusan coins, we find strong similarities in Group 3, 9-11 as Boehringer showed, as early as V86.<ref target="#CH3-n157">157</ref> For the new tetradrachm we have an absolute date or at least a terminus post quem: we know that the city of Aitna was founded after the inhabitants of Katane and Naxos were moved to Leontinoi after 476 BC.<ref target="#CH3-n158">158</ref> On the other hand this issue must be earlier than the famous Brussels tetradrachm with the head of Silenus. Stylistically then, the Demareteion is later than the Aitna tetradrachm with Athena and <name type="pname">C. Boehringer's</name> conclusion at the time was that the early decadrachm of Syracuse was not the Demareteion mentioned by Diodoros and other ancient sources but a "Hieroneion," a coin
<pb n="34"/>
struck by Hieron around 470 B.C. to celebrate his exploits. He held to the commemorative character of the issue, considering the literary evidence about the Demareteion too detailed and formidable to be dismissed, but found it difficult to accept the idea of a gold Demareteion. More recently <name type="pname">C. Boehringer</name> has revised his opinion, following <name type="pname">Maria R. Alöldi</name>:<ref target="#CH3-n159">159</ref> the decadrachm is the Demareteion but it was not struck immediately after the battle of Himera; rather ca. 470 B.C., essentially for economic reasons not primarily as a commemorative issue.<ref target="#CH3-n160">160</ref>

                     <ref target="#CH3-n161">161</ref> agreed with Kraay's downdating of the decadrachm but his arguments are mainly historical and philological; he prefers the date of 463 B.C. for the issue and thinks it was related to the distribution of <graphic url="NS18_sym9.jpg"/> to the army, described by Diodorus.<ref target="#CH3-n162">162</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Looking at the Syracusan tetradrachms represented in the hoard (nos. 232-539), it is immediately apparent how closely they follow and reflect <name type="pname">E. Boehringer's</name> arrangement: 4 coins belong to Group 1, nos. 232-35; 8 to Group 2, nos. 236-43; 281 to Group 3, nos. 244-524, and 5 to the beginning of Group 4; the ketos group, nos. 525-39. While the specimens of Group 2 in the hoard already display close die linkage, with three obverse dies used for eight coins (a ratio of 2.66); it is in Group 3 that the linkage is truly amazing, especialy for Series 8, 9, and 11. There are 114 obverse dies for 281 tetradrachms. The pattern of the hoard supports strongly <name type="pname">E. Boehringer's</name> view: Group 3 represents a massive and intensive coinage which most likely was struck over a relatively short period of time. The 15 tetradrachms of Group 4 stretch over Series 13a-b and 14a with very little die linkage. The output here must have been much more limited. Nos. 525-31 (Group 4, 13a) present a somewhat staring and expressionless archaistic stye,, particularly the heads on the reverses, and constitute as Boehringer rightly remarked, a transitional group between the still archaic massive coinage and the Demareteion group, and the severe style which follows. With no. 532 of Group 4, 14a, clearly a new phase begins: the head is much larger, the chin full and heavy and the flans more spread. The eye is fully in profile with for the first time a rendering of all the detals:: the iris, the pupil, and eyelashes on upper and lower lids. The archaic smile has disappeared. The hairstyle still shows the influenee of the archaic fashion but it falls in a more natural way and the krobylos is minimized. Soon it will be rolled up and developed into more complicated and innovative compositions as on R353 or R374 bound by a kekryphalos and then covered completely by a sakkos on R435. The quadriga does not show the stylistic development quite as clearly but the charioteer is now more articulated and muscular, the proportions and rendering of the horses more realistic. The latest tetradrachm of Syracuse in the hoard is no. 539, Boehringer 483 (V257/R346), the latest in his Group 4, 14a. Boehringer's Group 4, the ketos group, his nos. 408-627, includes 108 obverse dies (V211-V318) and 145 reverse dies (R288-R431) presumably evenly spread between 474 and 450 B.C. Die V257 stylistically still belongs in the first group of the heads, the 15 tetradrachms of our hoard cover a span of 46 dies and would thus be dated around 465 B.C. according to the traditional chronology. However this date will have to be lowered by about 10 to 15 years as will be seen from the discussion of the burial date and of the evidence of other hoards.</p>
                  <p>From the latest Syracusan issue in the hoard, one can return to the other groups and see what specific information can be drawn from the run of 308 tetradrachms. The four tetradrachms of Group 1 (nos. 232-35) represent the oldest coins in the hoard; as we have seen they most likely</p>
                  <pb n="35"/>
                  <p>date between 510 and 500 B.C. Their condition however is excellent,<ref target="#CH3-n163">163</ref> with hardly any more signs of wear than some of the latest specimens of Syracuse (nos. 525-39) or of Gela or Messana. We must therefore conclude that the Randazzo hoard is in all probability a savings hoard, representing the accumulation of wealth of one individual or one family over many years, and not a currency hoard or an example of coins taken from circulation at the specific time of burial.</p>
                  <p>Group 2 (nos. 236-43) introdcess the dolphins around the head together with a larger Arethusa head. These coins again are in quite good condition.</p>
                  <p>Group 3 comprises a large and closely die-linked component of the hoard, as tabulated in Table 2 (below, p. 36).<ref target="#CH3-n164">164</ref> Dotted lines indicate new links not known to <name type="pname">E. Boehringer</name> in 1929. A comparsonn of this chart to Maria Alföld's demonstrates that the hoard contents match exactly the arrangement of Boehringer’s corpus. At the same time some minor revisions can be suggested: the new die combinations of nos. 247 (V37/R47) and 248 (V37/R49) show that Series 6a ends with V37 (Boehringer 80), and Series 6b starts with Boehringer 81 (V38/R53). More important is the die combination of nos. 307-9 (V64/R187E). Boehringer did not know the obverse die for his no. 271E and placed his R187E in Series 11 because of its similarity with R179 (nos. 436-38) and R188 (nos. 449-52). This new combination places R187E in Series 8b; it is in style very close to R96 or R97 and R99 (nos. 299, 300, and 305); compare especially the rendering of the eye and the mouth. So in fact R187E is 99E; of importance is that if 187E can be compared to reverses in both Series 8b and 11, the two issues are very close in style and therefore in time. Boehringer<ref target="#CH3-n165">165</ref> has already emphasized that with Group 3, 8 and in particular Series 8b, we encounter such monotony and mediocrity in the style of the Arethusa heads that it becomes difficult to find an individualized head, let alone a masterpiece. There is no real stylistic development between Series 8 (nos. 258ff) and Series 12, rather just different types of heads and hair styles. The long tail falling on the neck and shoulder of no. 258 occurs again in Series 8b, nos. 274-75, or 301-5 on a larger type of head, Series 9a, nos. 366-67. Other heads are smaller, as on no. 270, 290-91, 319, 348-49. Others are of a definitely ugly, almost barbarous style, like the works of the artist of nos. 389-92, 393-96, 397, or those of the engravers of nos. 423, 425, 431, 455, etc. It is not the place here to divide the dies of the massive coinage into groups and attribute them to different engravers, which can be done in spite of the low artistic quality. But these few examples suffice to show that the differeness between Boehringer’s Series are due to individual styles and not to a chronological progression. Only Series 12e, the Demareteion issue, introduces significant innovations. There is only one tetradrachm of this group in the Randazzo hoard, no. 524;<ref target="#CH3-n166">166</ref> the obverse is in poor condition, the die however is worn and not the coin.<ref target="#CH3-n167">167</ref> The lion in exergue has disappeared from this die, the last of the group of tetradrachms of Series 12e. The reverse is by comparison a better preserved die in spite of the break above the upper lip. The head is wreathed, the expression of the face is softer, the eye is now for the first time in profile. Series 12a-d form a stylistically homogeneous group and belong together. Jenkins<ref target="#CH3-n168">168</ref> proposed to move these issues after the Demareteion issue 12e in order to fill the gap between 479 and 474 B.C. The last two tetradrachms of Series 12e, R276 and R276E are very similar to</p>

Williams</name>,<ref target="#CH3-n169">169</ref> among others, has readily accepted Jenkins's suggestion but Kraay rejected it;<ref target="#CH3-n170">170</ref> for him it is unthinkable that the "new style" of the Demareteion issue should not have influenced the following Series 12a-d. Table 2 (above, p. 36) illustrates the die linkage of Boehringer Group 3 as represented in the Randazzo hoard. It shows that the massive coinage can be divided into three groups or phases: 1) Series 6-8a; 2) Series 8b-11; 3) Series 12a-d.</p>
               <p>These three phases probably developed in a chronological sequence, but within the phases the issues can be considered parallel and contemporary. I believe that phase 1 represents the beginning of Gelon’s coinage at Syracuse, phase 2 the coinage after the battle of Himera and phase 3, Hieron's coinage. The Demareteion issue belongs either at the end of phase 2 or with phase 3. But before deciding we need to discuss the burial date and the hoard evidence.</p>

            <p>Table 3 (below, p. 40) summarizes the latest issues in the Randazzo hoard. The dates for the different mints, as we have seen, are to a great extent independent in this period and based on historical events: Rhegion and Messana resume their individual coinages after the fall of the Anaxilades in 461 B.C.; so does Naxos after an interruption of almost 30 years when its inhabitants, displaced by Hieron, were able to return home. Katane, under similar circumstances, at last was free to inaugurate its own coinage. Jenkins’s reasons for dating the end of his Group 3 to 450 B.C. are sound and generally accepted. <name type="pname">U. Westermark</name> in her as yet unpublished corpus of the coinage of Akragas agrees to a date between 461 and 450 for the beginning of the tetradrachms. It is important to emphasize that these dates are not contingent on the chronology of Syracuse. The latest issues from these six mints are clearly contemporary and terminate at the same time.</p>
            <p>If the Randazzo hoard is indeed a savings hoard, as was suggested abov,<ref target="#CH4-n171">171</ref> the condition or wear of the coins in this deposit is not a determining chronological factor. The earliest tetradrachms from Syracuse (nos. 232-35) are as fresh as some of the latest tetradrachms from Gela (e.g. nos. 38-39) or Leontinoi (no. 87). On the whole the coins are in very good condition. They did not circulate long but were saved within a few years after their issue. Many of the coins were struck from worn dies, in particular at Katane and Messana (nos. 218-26) and Syracuse (no. 524 from the Demareteion group but this has no bearing on its date). The two kinds of wear must not be confused.</p>
            <p>Only the date for the latest tetradrachms of Syracuse, and consequently of Leontinoi, does not seem to coincide with the rest of the hoard. If we accept the traditional chronology there is a discrepancy of some 15 years between the last tetradrachms of Syracuse and those from the other mints. Syracuse is the most important mint in the hoard and the most productive in Sicily at that time. The hoard was deposited near ancient Katane, at or in the vicinity of Randazzo, only some 70 miles from Syracuse. This is certain even though little is known of the actual circumstances of discovery; otherwise one cannot explain the presence of so many tetradrachms of Katane. It is logical to assume that all the issues in the hoard must terminate at about the same time and that the latest coins of Syracuse are as late as the burial date.<ref target="#CH4-n172">172</ref> The hoard was probably interred around 450 B.C. It cannot have been buried before 455 B.C. due to the inclusion of the restoration issues of Naxos, Katane, Messana, and Rhegion. A date after 445 B.C. is implausible as well since the four-bar sigma <graphic url="NS18_sym2.jpg"/> at Messana is not represented in the hoard nor the later Apollo head tetradrachms of Katane and Leontinoi. Historically, 450 B.C. corresponds to the upheaval of the Sikel power under Douketios but we cannot be certain that there was any direct relation between the victory of Syracuse over Douketios and the close of the deposit.<ref target="#CH4-n173">173</ref>

                  <name type="pname">R. T. Williams</name> (above, n. 155), p. 3, in his criticism of Kraay's revised Sicilian chronology and of his dating of the Gela hoard in particular, argues that in a hoard buried away from Syracuse, the latest Syracusan coins included in the deposit may be considerably earlier than the burial date of the hoard. The distances within Sicily, however, are not great and we have ample evidence from many hoards that coins circulated among the main western Sicilian mints, perhaps less so among those of the northeastern coast.</p>

               <p>The term "burial date" is used by numismatists for convenience but actually "termination date" would be more accurate. We should not assume that exceptional circumstances such as political conditions or wars prompted individuals to bury their treasures. It is more likely that coins and other savings were set aside in a secure place much as people use banks today. Sometimes the treasures could not be recovered, either because the owner died, or had to leave the country, or for other reasons, including war or strife. Therefore we must be careful in trying to connect all deposits with known historical events. I thank <name type="pname">C. Boehringer</name> for making this point clear to me.</p>

            </head>
            <p>No matter how important a single hoard might be, the conclusions drawn are convincing only when the hoard’s evidence relates positively to that of other similar hoards, and is in agreement with the historical context of the period under consideration. Let us then compare the Randazzo hoard to other fifth century hoards with a similar distribution of mints and denominations (i.e. tetradrachms and didrachms of Sicily).</p>
            <p>Table 4 (below, pp. 42-43), which graphs Randazzo and related hoards, is based on <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>. Excluded are hoards whose contents appear too small to be relevant to the discussion of the chronology, such as <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2069-70, 2073, 2080-81, 2083. The Avola hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2085, is not included since only 21 coins are known today from the original content of ca. 2,000 coins.<ref target="#CH5-n174">174</ref> Table 4 lists the total number of coins in each hoard (contents), the breakdown of specimens of each mint, together with an indication of the latest coins represented per mint, when known and datable. I have not been able to examine these hoards myself and have relied on published descriptions.<ref target="#CH5-n175">175</ref> The burial dates are those generally accepted in the works cited with the exception of the Lentini hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2077.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Burial Dates of Related Hoards</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The burial dates are here discussed independent of Syracuse when possible to strengthen the objectivity of the chronological conclusions.</p>
               <p>The Gela hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2066, will soon be published in detail and hopefully whatever doubts and problems now remain will be solved.<ref target="#CH5-n176">176</ref> The burial date of 485 B.C. suggested by Jenkins certainly seems the most acceptable and objective one.<ref target="#CH5-n177">177</ref> As he pointed out, the Gela hoard must be dated by its Sicilian contents rather than by the Athenian.<ref target="#CH5-n178">178</ref> Among its latest datable coins are a tetradrachm of the Samians at Zankle with the letter A, in fresh condition, and one tetradrachm of Anaxilas's first coinage from Rhegion. The hoard also contained over 400 didrachms from Akragas, including 230 from Group 3. The group, however, was not represented in its entirety; the latest issues are absent. Group 4 of Akragas, as <name type="pname">U. Westermark</name> has demonstrated, belongs to the period 482-472 B.C.,<ref target="#CH5-n179">179</ref> which means that the latest issues of Group 3 must have been minted between the burial date of the Gela hoard and 482 B.C. The years 490-485 B.C., therefore, seem a reasonable span for the closing of the deposit. I see no reason to date the Gela hoard any later than 485 B.C.</p>
               <p>The Passo di Piazza hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2068, was discussed above in determining the chronology of the tetradrachms of Rhegion and Messana.<ref target="#CH5-n180">180</ref> It contained three early didrachms of Group 4 of Akragas and one didrachm of the new Anaxilas type from Messana with the mule cart and hare and must have been buried shortly after 480 B.C.</p>

               <p>The Monte Bubbonia or Mazzarino hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2071, has been much discussed.<ref target="#CH5-n181">181</ref> Kraay wanted to lower its burial date to about 465/60 B.C. in accordance with the Sicily, 1890 hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2076, and his downdating of the earlier Syracusan decadrachm. The one didrachm of Kamarina in this hoard, as shown by Westermark and Jenkins,<ref target="#CH5-n182">182</ref> belongs to the first period of the city, 492-485 B.C., and not to the time of its refoundation in 461 B.C. It cannot therefore be used as an argument in favor of a late burial date. Only the earlier half of the didrachms of Akragas Group 4 is represented.<ref target="#CH5-n183">183</ref> The latest tetradrachms of Gela extend almost to the end of Jenkins Group 2. The two tetradrachms of Leontinoi are of the quadriga/lion’s head type and belong to the first issue of the city struck between 478 and 470 B.C. at the latest, as noted above.<ref target="#CH5-n184">184</ref> The Himera didrachms with the crab on the reverse are those of the period of Akragantine dominion, 482-472 B.C., studied by Jenkins.<ref target="#CH5-n185">185</ref> The last specimen in this hoard is from obverse die O13, from a group ending with O15. So unless we want to "press" the chronology of the Syracusan coins down, there is no reason to date the Monte Bubbonia hoard much later than 475/70 B.C.</p>
               <p>The Casulla hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2075, is a very similar though smaller hoard of somewhat later date since it contained didrachms of Akragas through the end of Group 4 and Himera didrachms of the Akragantine type to obverse O15, the latest die in the group, in excellent condition.<ref target="#CH5-n186">186</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The next hoard listed in the <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> is no. 2076, the Sicily, 1890 or Seltmann hoard. This is a very controversial find: it is "the crucial document" in Kraay's argument against the decadrachm being the Demareteion and therefore, of course, the most attacked by his opponents.<ref target="#CH5-n187">187</ref> The hoard was first acquired by <name type="pname">E. J. Seltmann</name> who published the most important pieces.<ref target="#CH5-n188">188</ref> He saw some 200 didrachms and tetradrachms of Akragas, Gela, Leontinoi, Messana, Segesta, Syracuse, and Himera. He described in detail only the Himera coins which he found most interesting. He further illustrated two tetradrachms and one didrachm from Leontinoi, two didrachms from Segesta, one early didrachm of Syracuse, Boehringer 99 (Group 3, 7) and one tetradrachm, Boehringer 321 (Series 12b, V156/R224) and one reverse R246 (Series 12d). For the other mints we have no details and it appears that it is no longer possible to reconstruct the hoard. Seltmann also remarked that the coins were in extremely fine condition. The latest Himera didrachm in the hoard is Gutmann and Schwabacher no. la; the latest tetradrachms are Gutmann and Schwabacher nos. 7a and 12.<ref target="#CH5-n189">189</ref> The latter is the rare issue with <graphic url="NS18_sym11.jpg"/> on the obverse above the quadriga which most likely is the first of the city after 472 B.C.<ref target="#CH5-n190">190</ref> So the latest tetradrachms would be Gutmann and Schwabacher no. 7, represented by six specimens in very good condition. The Leontinoi tetradrachm illustrated is from the same obverse die as our nos. 77-78 and represents the first issue of the city. The same is true of the Segesta didrachms.<ref target="#CH5-n191">191</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="45"/>
               <p>Unfortunately nothing is known of the Akragas, the Gela, or the Messana coins. Obviously the hoard must be dated by its latest coins: the Himera tetradrachms which cannot date before 472 or even 466 B.C.<ref target="#CH5-n192">192</ref> Possibly the first Pelops issue was minted between 466 and 460 B.C. and the second issue, including Gutmann and Schwabacher no. 7, only after 450 B.C. The coins from Leontinoi, Segesta and Syracuse in the hoard, on the other hand, date in the 470s. Clearly there is a discrepancy here that cannot simply be solved by downdating the Syracusan issues as Kraay tried to do.</p>
               <p>We don't known where the hoard was discovered; because of the presence of a large number of coins of Himera, it is assumed to have been in the vicinity of the city. Table 4 (above, pp. 42-43) shows that the Sicily, 1890 hoard constitutes the exception and does not correspond to the general pattern of the other fifth century hoards. Its burial date is approximately that of the Villabate hoard. Why the Syracusan issues with the ketos are not represented remains unexplained but it is certainly not a reason to make Series 12d contemporary with the Himera tetradrachms of the 450s and put the other hoards at odds.</p>
               <p>The Villabate hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2082,<ref target="#CH5-n193">193</ref> as can be seen from the Table 4 summary, must have been buried a few years after the Randazzo hoard. It was discovered near Palermo, some 20 miles west of Himera, in 1893. Among the latest datable coins is a tetradrachm from Rhegion, Herzfelder 5 (D2/R4) from the same group as Herzfelder 1 (Dl/Rl) in the Randazzo hoard. The latest tetradrachms from Akragas have an eight-rayed star as a symbol and are probably slightly later than our nos. 11-18.<ref target="#CH5-n194">194</ref> The Gela tetradrachms are represented to the beginning of Group 4, Jenkins 350 (O67/R135) which was minted after 450 B.C. The latest Himera tetradachms, Gutmann and Schwabacher no. 6, must have been minted after 450 B.C., as suggested above. As in the Sicily, 1890 hoard, their presence is the determining factor for the burial date, since these tetradrachms come from the mint closest to the findspot. The Leontinoi tetradrachms are of the quadriga/lion’s head type, the first issue of the city (as our nos. 77-87). No Apollo heads of the Demareteion type were present but since these were a rather limited issue, it should not be too surprising that they did not reach the northern part of the island. It is also possible that the more rare and valuable specimens were picked out before the hoard was shown to Evans. The Messana tetradrachms included types with the four-bar sigma <graphic url="NS18_sym2.jpg"/>, the relative terminus ante quem for the Randazzo hoard. The burial date around 445 B.C. suggested by Jenkins is in perfect agreement with the chronology of the different mints.</p>
               <p>For the date of the Lentini, 1921 hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2077, one must look to the Syracusan issues. Very little is known of the hoard.<ref target="#CH5-n195">195</ref> Of the 11 Gela coins, only three could be identified by Jenkins; the rest were not available. No details are known of the Akragas and the Messana coins included. The latest Syracusan coins represented, according to Jenkins, belong to Series 16a and are later than Gela Group 3. One must therefore rely on the known Syracusan tetradrachm and propose a burial date some years later than the Villabate and Sicily, 1890 hoards.</p>
               <p>The last hoard relevant to the dating of the issues represented in the Randazzo hoard is the Selinunte, 1923 hoard, <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2084.<ref target="#CH5-n196">196</ref> It is the first hoard containing tetradrachms from Group 5 of Gela, dated by Jenkins between 440 and 430 B.C. The latest Himera tetradrachm included is Gutmann and Schwabacher no. 15 in mint condition. Two tetradrachms from Katane with the Apollo head on the reverse were also present. The Randazzo hoard shows that they must have
<pb n="46"/>
been struck after 450 B.C. There were several Leontinoi tetradrachms of the ugly, severe, transitional style and one of the finer classical style.<ref target="#CH5-n197">197</ref> The Selinus tetradrachms included all belong to Schwabacher's Group 1.<ref target="#CH5-n198">198</ref> Unfortunately, once again the Messana tetradrachms were considered "too poor" to be described or illustrated. At any rate, as Herzfelder has demonstrated, the Selinunte hoard must have been buried some five to ten years after the Villabate hoard and on Jenkins’s revised chronology, this dates it to ca. 435 B.C.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">The Syracusan Chronology</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>To summarize: a comparison between the Randazzo hoard and other fifth century Sicilian hoards confirms its suggested burial date of about 455/50 B.C., five to ten years earlier than the Villabate hoard and definitely later than the Monte Bubbonia and Casulla hoards.</p>
                  <p>More important perhaps are the conclusions for the chronology of Syracuse. As indicated, the burial dates of eight of the nine related hoards (excluding Lentini, 1921) can be estimated independent of the Syracusan context. Looking at the distribution of the Syracusan issues in Table 4 (above, pp. 42-43), one observes a very cogent and regular sequence from Boehringer 46 (V27/R30) Series 4, practically the beginnngg of Group 2, through Boehringer 604 (V296/R410) Series 18, almost the end of Group 4, the ketos group. The only hoard which does not seem to follow the general pattern is the Sicily, 1890 hoard as was noted.<ref target="#CH5-n199">199</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must then conclude that Group 2 at Syracuse—what Kraay calls the earliest dolphins— must have started <hi rend="italic">before</hi> 485 B.C., i.e. before Gelon took power in Syracuse. As tempting as it might be to associate coinage with political events, as Kraay has done, too little is known about the earliest tyrannies in Sicily and the hoard evidence does not support Kraay’s idea that the new Arethusa heads constitute Gelons’s imperial coinage. The beginning of Gelon's coinage, I believe, is represented by Group 3, Series 6-8a. The interruption in the coinage following the battle of Himera in 480 B.C. supposed by <name type="pname">E. Boehringer</name> has rightly been criticized and must be rejected. The Passo di Piazza hoard shows that the real "massive coinage" of Series 8b-11 (or phase 2),<ref target="#CH5-n200">200</ref> must have started after 480/78 B.C., therefore after the battle of Himera. I would be inclined to see in this tightly linked group the result of the Carthaginian war indemnities of 2,000 talents paid as reparation. It was an intensive coinage, struck within a short period of time, and could possibly have started before Gelon's death.</p>
                  <p>The Monte Bubbonia and Casulla hoards show that Series 12 or the end of Group 3 extended into the 470s and represents in fact Hieron’s coinage. This is supporedd by the later hoards of Randazzo and Villabate where the "massvee coinage" is also the most important. As we have seen, Series 12e, the Demareteion issue, is not die linked to any other series, except for the stylistic similarity of die R276 and Series 12d.</p>
                  <p>Jendkins has suggested reversing the sequence and putting Series 12e before Series 12a-d. If we accept this solution, the Demareteion could be dated as early as 478 B.C., perhaps even before Gelon’s death, since, as <name type="pname">E. Boehringer</name> suggested, the "massive coinage" most likely comprised parallel issues that did not strictly follow each other in a chronological sequence.</p>
                  <p>This date would agree with Diodorus’s account but does not fit well with the hoard evidence or with stylistic considerations for if the Demareteion was issued at the beginning of Series 12, how does one explain that its new progressive style did not really influence the parallel and later issues a-d? There is also the difficulty with regard to the unique Aitna tetradrachm with Athena
<pb n="47"/>
in the quadriga, which <name type="pname">C. Boehringer</name> is right in considering earlier or at least more conservative stylistically than the Demareteion. Of course the coinage of Aitna was a very limited and shortlived phenomenon and it is possible that the engraver of the first die had not been influenced by the progressive new style. Obviously Hieron did not use the coinage of his new city as an important carrier of his personal political propaganda or the issues would have been far more considerable.</p>
                  <p>The alternative is to leave Series 12e at the end of Group 2, where <name type="pname">E. Boehringer</name> had placed it and date it to ca. 475/70 B.C. according to the hoard evidence. This date would allow enough time for the first quadriga/lion’s head issues of Leontinoi to start before the Demareteion and for the second issue with the Apollo head to follow some years later.</p>
                  <p>This somewhat later date does not quite fit with the traditional interpretation of the literary sources; it means that the coin that Diodorus tells us was struck for Demarete, after the battle of Himera, in fact was issued at least five years after Himera, when Gelon’s widow had returned to Gela and married Polyzalos. This is not impossible. I tend to agree with Maria <name type="pname">R. Alföldi</name> that the Syracusan decadrachm is not primarily a commemorative issue but was struck for economic reasons—to pay the mercenaries after the war against the Carthaginians once the silver was available, perhaps as a special gift. At this point, we can be reasonably sure that the earlier silver decadrachm is the Demareteion mentioned by the ancient authors but we need more evidence than the Randazzo hoard to decide exactly when it was minted: at present the years 475/70 B.C., during Hieron’s reign, seem the most plausible date.</p>
                  <p>The hoard evidence also shows that at Syracuse the ketos group, Group 4, did not begin in 474 B.C. but some 10 to 15 years later. The Randazzo hoard points strongly to this conclusion. I consider Series 14 and following as the coinage of the restored democrayy after the fall of the Deinomenids in 466 B.C. Series 13, which Boehringer considered as the beginning of the group, is perhaps rather to be seen as a transitional phase at the end of Hieron’s reign. The style of the Arethusa heads, such as R288 or R289 (nos. 525-26) is still very close to that of Series 12 and heads like R311 (no. 528) of Series 13b are almost a stereotyped, lifeless, rendering of the severe style of the Demareteion. In contrast R338 through R346 (nos. 532-39) represent a new beginning that can be associated with the restoration of the democracy.</p>
                  <p>The end of Group 4 must also be lowered about 15 years beyond Boehringer s date of 450 B.C. as shown by the Selinunte hoard and also by the Randazzo hoard where only the very beginning of the group, Group 14a, is present just before 450 B.C.</p>
                  <p>Based on the foregoing, the following revised chronology is the most probable for Syracuse:</p>
