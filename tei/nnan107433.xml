            <p>"The making of medals has, through the reducing machine, gradually during the past fifty years changed from an art apart to a branch of
               sculpture. They now can be produced by any sculptor who has a sentiment of relief. Although I am not very old, I can remember the time when there
               were practically no medalists in this country, certainly no artists who made medals." In these words from his 1921 address accepting the American
               Numismatic Society's Saltus Medal for achievement in medallic art, <persName>John Flanagan</persName> summed up an extraordinarily fertile
               period for an artistic medium which, at least in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, had earlier been viewed chiefly
               as a carrier of messages.</p>
            <p>In its earliest phase, in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, the medal was a small cast sculpture, distinctive in its form and iconography,
               within the technical capabilities of any sculptor. It was a medium employed by painters such as <persName>Pisanello</persName>, sculptors
               such as <persName>Leone Leoni</persName>, and carvers such as <persName>Peter Flötner</persName>. With the ascendency of the struck
               medal in the seventeenth century, medal making required proficiency in die engraving, a skill developed chiefly by gem cutters and, especially,
               coin makers. It was only with the development in the nineteenth century of the <persName>Janvier lathe</persName>, which transferred modeled
               reliefs into dies, that sculptors could again include medals among their works.</p>
            <p>Parallel to the concentration of medallic art in the hands of coin makers has been a concentration of its collection and study among
               numismatists. The American Numismatic Society has by far the largest holdings of American medals of the Beaux-Arts period, and the standard
               reference in this area has been the catalogue of its 1910 International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals. In recent years, as interest has
               increased in the work of American sculptors of the Beaux-Arts tradition, their medals have been considered in the context of their entire oeuvre
               and have been included in exhibitions and catalogues often devoted to the work of a single artist.</p>
            <p>The goal of this exhibition is to situate the American Beaux-Arts medal in its historical and artistic context. To this end we have been very
               fortunate to have secured the services of <persName>Barbara</persName>
               <persName>A. Baxter</persName> as Guest Curator for the exhibition. <persName>Ms Baxter</persName>, whose background includes strong
               qualifications in numismatics and art history, has taken full responsibility for the organization of the exhibit. She has selected material from
               our extensive holdings and has surveyed public and private collections for loan material. She has written the catalogue entries and the
               interpretive essays in this catalogue and has supervised the design and mounting of the exhibition. This exhibit would not have been possible
               without her sure judgement and untiring dedication.</p>
            <p>Colleagues from many institutions have been most generous in sharing with us information on their holdings and arranging loans for this show. The
               Council, the Committee on Medals, and the staff of the American Numismatic Society have been a consistent source of encouragement and assistance.
               A loyal group of patrons has provided financial as well as moral support for the mounting of the exhibition and the publication of the catalogue.

            <p>The initial idea for this exhibition was proposed by <persName>Alan Stahl</persName>, Curator of Medieval Coins and of Medals at the ANS.
               The biennial congress of the Federation Internationale de la Médaille, which will be held in the United States for the first time this September,
               provided the occasion for the mounting of this exhibition of medallic sculpture from the period of the medium's greatest flourishing in America.
               "The Beaux-Arts Medal in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>" is designed to offer an historical complement to the
               major exhibit of contemporary medals which will be shown at the FIDEM Congress in Colorado.</p>
            <p>In the course of organizing this exhibition, I have been greatly assisted by a number of museum colleagues and private collectors, who have
               generously shared their knowledge and responded to my requests for loans. I would like especially to thank <persName>Lauretta

               and made helpful suggestions on sections of the catalogue text.</p>
            <p>I also wish to gratefully acknowledge the assistance provided by my colleagues at the ANS. This project would not have been possible without the
               support of Director <persName>Leslie Elam</persName>. <persName>William Bischoff</persName>, Assistant Curator of Modern Coins, and
               Curator <persName>Alan Stahl</persName> contributed insightful essays to this catalogue. ANS Photographer <persName>Frank
                  Deak</persName> and <persName>Darkroom Technician Charles Badal</persName> produced the excellent photographs for the catalogue. <persName>George Cuhaj</persName> has loaned a colorful souvenir postcard from the 1909 <persName>Hudson-Fulton</persName> Celebration for
               the exhibition, and <persName>Lori Rubens</persName> has provided technical assistance with the mounting of the exhibit. <persName>Alan Stahl</persName> and <persName>Marie Martin</persName> deserve special thanks for their careful editing of my manuscript. <persName>Marie</persName> is responsible for the thoughtful, creative design of the catalogue. <persName>Alan</persName> has guided my
               work with unflagging enthusiasm and good humor.</p>
            <p>A particular debt of gratitude is owed the Department of American Paintings and Sculpture of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for their loan of the
               reduced-scale version of the Victory figure from Augustus Saint-Gaudens' <persName>Sherman</persName> Monument. We could not have found a
               more fitting centerpiece for this exhibition than the work which inspired Saint-Gaudens' beautiful design for the U.S. twenty-dollar gold piece,
               the epitome of the artistic quality and elegance of the Beaux-Arts medal in America.</p>
            <p>Finally, I would like to thank my husband Marc Postman and my sister <persName>Nancy Baxter</persName> for the personal support which they
               have given me while was working on this project.</p>

            <p>In the decades between 1880 and the First World War, the art of the medal experienced a remarkable flowering in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. Neither before nor since that time has medallic sculpture enjoyed such popularity in this country.
               With its emphasis on the glorification of public events and private achievements, the medal was an especially powerful art form for transmitting
               the self-image of turn-of- the-century <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. The barons of industry, the great
               Expositions celebrating technology and progress, the politicians, the artists, and the socialites of the "Gilded Age" are all chronicled by the
               medals of the period.</p>
            <p>Before the 1880s, the production of medals in this country had been in the hands of a few specialists trained in engraving and die cutting. With
               advances in the technology of the reducing machine, however, the medium became accessible to any artist schooled in modeling, liberating medallic
               art from its strictly commemorative function and allowing it to develop as a branch of sculpture. For the first time professional sculptors
               assumed a leading role in the designing of medals, and almost every major American sculptor of the Beaux-Arts era created medals or medallic
               portraits. While the term "Beaux-Arts," commonly used to describe the style of sculpture produced in America between the 1876 Centennial
               Exposition and World War I, is a somewhat unsatisfactory label for a considerable range of individual styles, it broadly defines certain general
               features of the sculpture of this period: "an academic emphasis on the human form," a reliance on classical, Renaissance and Baroque models, and
               a technical facility learned in France.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Above all, the shift from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, the source of the neoclassical style which had prevailed in
               American sculpture in the decades before the Civil War, to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, the new center for training
               in sculpture, was central to the flourishing of sculptural and medallic art in late nineteenth-century <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. Earlier in the century, <placeName>French</placeName> sculpture had undergone a revolution in
               style and technique. A new manner of lively rich modeling suitable to casting in bronze replaced the smoothly carved marble surfaces of
               neoclassical sculpture. The growing desire of American sculptors to work in bronze led them to seek the instruction in modeling offered by the
               Paris art schools. The <persName>Petite Ecole</persName> (renamed the <persName>Ecole des Arts Décoratifs</persName> in 1877), the
                  <persName>Ecole des Beaux-Arts</persName>, and the private art academies of Paris provided them with a systematic education in sculptural
               technique. After completing preliminary courses in drawing and modeling at one of the other art schools, many of the Americans were accepted to
               the <persName>Ecole des Beaux-Arts</persName>, where they worked primarily in the ateliers of <persName>François Jouffroy</persName>
               and his younger followers, <persName>Jean Falguière</persName> and <persName>Antonin Mercié</persName>, all exponents of a naturalistic
               style of academic bronze sculpture.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>The revolution in modeled sculpture, initiated by the great sculptor <persName>David d'Angers</persName>, spawned a "Renaissance of the
               medal" in France, which also commenced with <persName>David</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> In his extraordinary series of portrait
               medallions, begun in 1827, <persName>David</persName> revived the cast technique of Italian Renaissance medals, rescuing the art of the
               medal from the banality to which it had descended in the hands of neoclassical engravers. His boldly modeled, intensely Romantic medallic
               portraits have the immediacy of sketches, but they are in fact carefully studied. Following <persName>David's</persName> example, virtually
               every French <pb n="4"/> sculptor after 1830 produced portrait medallions as a supplement to the normal range of sculptural commissions. By the
               1850s, medals were no longer exhibited with prints and engravings at the Paris Salons, as they had been earlier in the century, but were included
               in the sculpture section.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> The advent of the reducing machine in the 1830s facilitated this development. The reducing
               machine, which is depicted on a medal created by J. Edouard Roiné for the Joseph K. Davison firm of Philadelphia (<ref target="#fig-1">fig. 1,
                     <hi rend="italic">296</hi>
               </ref>), gave sculptors the freedom to model the design for a medal or portrait medallion on a large scale and then have it mechanically
                  reduced.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> For struck pieces, a specialized machine was used to engrave a reduced copy of the model directly into a
               steel die, eliminating the need for laborious hand cutting of dies.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref>

            <p>An important figure in the French revival of medallic art, who also played a key role in inspiring the American Beaux-Arts sculptors to model
               portrait medallions, was <persName>Henri Chapu</persName>. In his cast portrait medallions, patterned after the work of <persName>David</persName>, <persName>Chapu</persName> developed a new style of refined, low relief modeling (<ref target="#fig-2">fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">3</hi>
               </ref>), which Louis Oscar Roty later credited with affecting the entire subsequent "evolution of glyptic art" in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> Chapu trained many pupils in this style of modeling at the <persName>Académie Julian</persName>, where <persName>John Flanagan</persName>, <persName>Hermon MacNeil</persName> and <persName>Bela Pratt</persName>, among other Americans, studied with him.</p>

            <p>While the acknowledged leaders of the late nineteenth-century renaissance of the medal in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, <persName>Jules-Clément Chaplain</persName> and <persName>Louis Oscar Roty</persName>, did not influence the course
               of American medallic art as strongly as did <persName>Chapu</persName>, they were instrumental in popularizing the art of the medal in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> and abroad. <persName>Chaplain</persName>, whom <persName>Mark Jones</persName>
               has called "the first great artist to make use of the flexibility offered by the reducing machine," demonstrated, with his masterful portrait
               medallions, "that a single model, properly conceived, could be successful both as a cast plaque on a large scale and as a struck medal or

               draftsmanship of <persName>Chaplain's</persName> medals, the works of his pupil <persName>Roty</persName> feature a more delicate,
               painterly approach to low relief modeling, derived from <persName>Chapu</persName>. <persName>Roty's</persName> revival of the
               rectangular plaquette format, which had not been used since the Renaissance, allowed him to give the medal a more frankly pictorial treatment.
               His lyrical, allegorial figure-compositions and soft-edged style were imitated by a host of medalists in France and elsewhere in Europe, and the
               sand-blasting process which he employed to give his medals an even softer tone became standard practice in the production of medals.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref>

               sculptors to take up medallic portraiture, arrived in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in the late 1860s, and in 1870
               both worked in <persName>Jouffroy's</persName> atelier at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref>
               <persName>Warner</persName> began making portrait medallions before Saint-Gaudens, exhibiting a "colossal medallion" in plaster of the actor
                  <persName>Edwin</persName> Forrest at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. <persName>Charles de Kay's</persName> later
               criticism of this piece for its "peculiar broadness and boldness in relief" and "almost brutal" effect explains why <persName>Warner's</persName> vigorously modeled portrait medallions did not achieve the immediate success of Saint-Gaudens' more refined portrait
                  reliefs.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref>
               <persName>Warner's</persName> striking medallic portraits of the 1870s and '80s (68 and 69, for example), which recall the works of <persName>David d'Angers</persName> and <persName>Chapu</persName> in format and modeling technique, deserve greater recognition than they
               have received both for their artistic quality and for their position as the earliest works of medallic art in this country to reflect the
               resurgence of the cast medal in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Saint-Gaudens' tremendously successful portrait reliefs, which he referred to as "medallions" despite their generally rectangular format, created
               a taste for portrait plaques and medallions among the nation's elite. In Rome, where he went after Paris, Saint-Gaudens fell under the spell of
               the early Renaissance sculptors Pisanello and Donatello, and he brought with him casts of their bas-reliefs when he returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in 1875. Although his friend the painter <persName>John
                  LaFarge</persName> encouraged him at that time to model in low relief in emulation of the fifteenth-century masters, it was not until he returned
               to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1877 that Saint-Gaudens, "upon seeing the portrait of 'A Man with a Hat' by the
               French sculptor, <persName>Chapu</persName>...promptly set out to model bas-reliefs of the group of artists about him..."<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> In the remarkable series of portrait reliefs which he created in the late 1870s and early 1880s (73 and <hi rend="italic">74</hi>, for example), Saint-Gaudens developed a new style of exquisite low relief modeling, notable for its lively, irregular
               surfaces. With only the slightest variation in the relief, the sculptor was able to produce a bravura effect, manipulating the play of light and
               shade across the surface of the bronze in an "impressionistic" manner.<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> His reliefs are also unique for the way in
               which he incorporated the portrait into a larger design, devoting as much attention to the background, molding, lettering and other decorative
               details as to the subject.</p>

            <p>Saint-Gaudens' medals, like his portrait reliefs, had a great impact on the progress of American <pb n="6"/> medallic art. His first and most
               important official medal is the piece which he designed for the New York celebration of the centennial of George Washington's inauguration in
               1889 (<ref target="#fig-4">fig. 4, <hi rend="italic">77</hi>
               </ref>). The sculptor's elegant design for the obverse of this medal, based on a composition frequently employed by Pisanello, the greatest of
               the Italian Renaissance medalists, established a format that would be repeatedly exploited by his followers and their students for two
               generations to come.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> In technique, as well as in format and lettering, Saint-Gaudens' <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> medal, which <persName>Victor Brenner</persName> later singled out as a notable "stepping
               stone toward the development of our modern [American] medallic art," is faithful to its Quattrocento sources.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref>
               Significantly, the piece was cast, in the Renaissance tradition, preserving the lively texture of the relief.</p>
            <p>After the French academic tradition, the Renaissance models introduced by Saint-Gaudens provided the second important source of inspiration for
               the flowering of medallic art in America. While the French nineteenth-century medalists looked to the Quattrocento for only general inspiration,
               their American contemporaries were more literal in their following of Renaissance prototypes. This reliance on fifteenth-century artistic sources
               was one aspect of a growing tendency among Americans in the 1880s and 1890s to identify with the period of the Italian Renaissance.<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> An art form which had been developed in the fifteenth century to glorify the individual was uniquely suited to the
               portrayal of America's new "merchant princes." As artist and critic <persName>Kenyon Cox</persName> wrote in an 1887 article extolling
               Saint-Gaudens and his revival of bas-relief sculpture: "There only [in the sculpture of the Renaissance] could they [Saint-Gaudens and his
               contemporaries] find the modern man with his pronounced individuality and his special development of character, and there only could they find
               the means of representing him in their art."<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The professionalization of American sculpture in this period also helped to encourage the patronage of medallic sculpture. The Constitution of
               the National Sculpture Society, founded in May 1893 by Saint-Gaudens and his <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> trained
               colleagues as "the American center for the promulgation of the Beaux-Arts style," stated that one of the goals of the organization was to "foster
               the taste for, and encourage the production of, ideal sculpture for the household."<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> The reproductions of
               Saint-Gaudens' portrait reliefs furnished a model for the successful marketing of small-scale sculpture. For both commercial and aesthetic
               reasons, he continually reworked his most popular pieces to create a series of limited editions.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The spectacular Expositions and Celebrations of the "American Renaissance," which showcased the Beaux-Arts style in their grandiose programs of
               decorative sculpture, provided a unique occasion for the production of huge numbers of commemorative medals and tokens.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> America's foremost medallic sculptors were commissioned to design the official medals for the World's Fairs of 1893, 1901, 1904, and
               1915, as well as the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Hudson-Fulton Celebration of 1909. Saint-Gaudens
               once more set the precedent with his award medal for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (cover, 86, and 87). The naturalism and vitality of
               his pictorial composition for the obverse of this piece, again reminiscent of Renaissance relief sculpture, are in marked contrast to the more
               decorative, academic style of the medals created by European artists for the Exposition.</p>

            <p>The Columbian Exposition and the World's Fairs that followed it stimulated American artists to develop a distinctively American subject matter in
               order to represent "the pageant of their country." <persName>Hermon MacNeil's</persName> award medal for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition is
               indicative of this trend (<ref target="#fig-5">fig. 5, <hi rend="italic">106</hi>
               </ref>). <persName>MacNeil</persName> himself said of this piece that he aimed "to produce a design that could be mistaken for nothing not
                  American."<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> Fascinated by the Indians whom he had met in the sideshows at the Columbian Exposition, <persName>MacNeil</persName> traveled to the Southwest to visit their reservations, and his firsthand observation of native Americans is
               evident in his unidealized treatment of the Indian figures on the reverse of the Pan-American Exposition medal. The imagery of the buffalo and
               the Indian which <persName>MacNeil</persName> employed for this medal, as well as his naturalistic style, anticipate <persName>James Earle Fraser's</persName> 1913 "buffalo" nickel (<hi rend="italic">194</hi>), the first U.S. coin to make use of this type of American
               symbolism.</p>
            <p>Truly international in scope, the World's Expositions catered to a new cosmopolitan spirit in turn-of-the-century <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. At the Expositions, the American public had a chance to view the latest in European art, including
               medallic art, and as a result the demand for things European in this country increased. American patrons commissioned medals from European
               artists, most notably <persName>Roty</persName> and the Austrian medalist <persName>Scharff</persName>, who worked in a similarly
               elegant manner.<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> Through <persName>George Lucas</persName>, an American art agent in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> philanthropist and art
               dealer <persName>Samuel P. Avery</persName> assembled a substantial collection of the works of <persName>David d'Angers</persName>,
                  <persName>Chaplain</persName> and <persName>Roty</persName>, which he presented to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1897. An active
               member of the American Numismatic Society and advocate of medallic art, <persName>Avery</persName> also took an interest in the career of
                  <persName>Victor Brenner</persName> and gave the young medalist a letter of introduction to Lucas when he left for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1898. Through <persName>Lucas</persName>, <persName>Brenner</persName> obtained an
               introduction to <persName>Roty</persName>, with whom he subsequently studied and worked as an assistant.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref>
               Although <persName>Roty's</persName> medals were very popular in the United States, his work had little direct influence on the indigenous
               school of medalists, with the exception of <persName>Brenner</persName>, whose style bears the strong imprint of his mentor. Statements
               gathered from a number of prominent American sculptors by <persName>George Kunz</persName> for a tribute to the French medalist imply that
               while they admired <persName>Roty's</persName> work, the medals of the Renaissance held a greater attraction for them.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref>

            <p>At the same time that <persName>Brenner</persName> was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, many other American

               sculptors as assistants in his studio.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> Following the lead of Saint-Gaudens, many of these sculptors produced small
               portrait reliefs to supplement their income from other commissions. It had become fashionable for cosmopolitan Americans to sit for a portrait
               medallion in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, just as they posed for portraits by expatriate painter <persName>John Singer Sargent</persName>. Works by <persName>Scudder</persName> (<ref target="#fig-6">fig. 6, <hi rend="italic">191</hi>
               </ref>) and <persName>John Flanagan</persName>

               for twelve years, illustrate the elegant style of medallic portraiture crafted by American artists in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. Scudder's portrait plaquette of a Woman with a <placeName corresp="#geonames_1861060">Japan</placeName>ese Fan is typical of
               her work in its exquisite detail and her incorporation of an elaborate decorative frame into the design of the piece. The medallic work of
               Saint-Gaudens, <persName>Flanagan</persName>, and <persName>Scudder</persName> received favorable <pb n="8"/> notice from <persName>Leonce Benedite</persName> in his review of the medals exhibited at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>
               Salon of 1899.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> In a survey of the medals exhibited a year later at the Universal Exposition in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, the French critic <persName>Roger Marx</persName> singled out the works by medalists from the
                  <placeName>United States, Austria</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2750405">Netherlands</placeName> for their

            <p>While American medallic art was winning praise abroad, appreciation for the medium was steadily increasing at home. The campaign to improve the

               the National Sculpture Society, reinforced the growth of interest in medals.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> Those who demanded the redesign of
               the coinage found in President <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName> a willing champion. <persName>Victor Brenner</persName> said of
                  <persName>Roosevelt</persName> in 1910 that "His efforts to introduce a change in our coinage have done more towards popularizing the art
               of the medalist than has any previous movement."<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> In 1905 <persName>Roosevelt</persName> commissioned
               Saint-Gaudens to undertake new designs for the ten-dollar and twenty-dollar gold pieces, the first time that an artist outside of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName>
               <persName>Mint</persName> had been entrusted with the design of a regular issue of this country's coinage. The success of Saint-Gaudens'

               sculptors. The most lasting of the new designs, also chosen by <persName>Roosevelt</persName>, was <persName>Brenner's

               coinage to feature the image of a historical figure. It is to <persName>Roosevelt's</persName> credit that he recognized the merit of <persName>Brenner's</persName> superbly modeled portrait of <persName>Lincoln</persName>, which the medalist had originally created for a

            <p>Enthusiasm for the art of the medal was at its height in the period between 1900 and the First World War. In 1894, it had been reported in the

               <persName>Mint</persName>. At Tiffany &amp; Company in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, dies for
               medals were still being cut by hand.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> By 1905, several new medal manufacturing firms equipped with the <persName>Janvier lathe</persName>, the latest in die cutting machines, were in competition with <persName>Tiffany</persName> and <persName>Gorham</persName>. The most important of these firms for the production of art medals were <persName>Joseph K. Davison's
                  Sons</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> and the Medallic Art Company in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. When <persName>Henry Hering</persName>, Saint-Gaudens' assistant

               <persName>Mint</persName> was hopelessly out of date, the President promptly had a <persName>Janvier</persName> machine brought from

            </p>
            <p>The increase in facilities and improved technology for medal production supported a <pb n="9"/> tremendous rise in demand for medals from
               individuals, businesses, and organizations. From 1905 through the First World War, the American Numismatic Society issued a series of medals of
               high artistic quality, commissioned from the foremost medalists and sculptors of the day, and the Society also lent its support to other
               organizations that wished to issue medals. Another society dedicated to the promotion of medallic art in America, the Circle of Friends of the
               Medallion, was formed in 1909. Patterned after similar groups in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2802361">Belgium</placeName>, the Circle of Friends already
               had about five hundred members in 1910.<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> In the six years of its existence the group issued a dozen medals, which
               were sold in unique book-shaped holders with an accompanying text on the artist and the subject of the piece. The majority of these medals
               feature softly modeled allegorical compositions in the continental style transmitted to this country by immigrant European artists.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref>

               successful by the Committee of Award for the Exhibition, and <persName>Devreese</persName> received the commission for a commemorative
               medal. The plaquette which he produced, with its bland allegorical compositions and fussy modeling, illustrates the weaknesses of the European
               academic tradition, and the piece was considered so unacceptable that only three examples of it were ever struck (<ref target="#fig-8">fig. 8,

            <p>American medallic art flourished in the decade following the International Exhibition, and a list of the best medals ever produced in this
               country would comprise mainly works issued in those years. Significantly, it is not the works of immigrant medalists that would dominate such a
               list, but the medals by American artists trained in the Saint-Gaudens studio and the art schools of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. The importance of Saint-Gaudens as a mentor for younger American sculptors cannot be over-estimated. Of the artists discussed
               in this catalogue, <persName corresp="#viaf_1573083">Philip Martiny</persName>, <persName>Frederick MacMonnies</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph A. Weinman</persName>, <persName>Bela Lyon Pratt</persName>, <persName>John
                  Flanagan</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName>, <persName>Helen Mears</persName>, <persName>Henry Hering</persName>
               <persName>and Francis Grimes</persName> all worked as assistants to the master sculptor.</p>
            <p>Of the group of sculptors who worked with Saint-Gaudens, <persName>John Flanagan</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName> were the most talented medalists. Cornelius Vermeule perceptively summarizes their <pb n="10"/> contribution to
               medallic art when he says that <persName>Flanagan</persName> and <persName>Fraser</persName> "achieved a perfect synthesis of the
               ideal, the real and the traditional in medallic design."<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> The works of both men stand out for their strong designs
               and skillful modeling. <persName>Fraser's</persName> medals are more closely indebted to Saint-Gaudens and to <persName>Renaissance</persName> sources than are <persName>Flanagan's</persName>, which are generally more original in composition and subject
               matter. <persName>Fraser's</persName> superb <persName>Harriman</persName> Memorial Medal for the American Museum of Safety (<ref target="#fig-9">fig. 9, <hi rend="italic">233</hi>
               </ref>), issued in 1914, successfully blends "photographic naturalism" and <persName>Renaissance</persName> tradition. The obverse of this
               medal follows the Quattrocento format of Saint-Gaudens' <persName>George</persName>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> medal (fig. 4, <hi rend="italic">77</hi>), but <persName>Fraser's</persName> design is more tightly constructed and the portrait bust is given a more realistic treatment. The reverse of the <persName>Harriman</persName> medal is a masterpiece of medallic composition. The track walker who strides vigorously along the rails, as if
               ready to break free of the confines of the tondo, has a commanding presence, made tangible by <persName>Fraser's</persName> textured
               modeling.</p>

               <persName>Flanagan's</persName> medal for the Essex Agricultural Society of Massachusetts (<ref target="#fig-10">fig. 10, <hi rend="italic">152</hi>
               </ref>) is much different in spirit from <persName>Fraser's Harriman</persName>. The two sides of the Essex medal depict opposing aspects of
               rural life. A scene of a mother and her children in the farmyard occupies the obverse of the medal, while the image of a man laboring with a
               shovel fills the reverse. <persName>Flanagan</persName> emphasizes the contrast between the idyllic, classicizing imagery of the obverse and
               the realistic subject matter of the reverse by executing the two sides of the piece in different styles. The obverse composition is modeled in a
               series of delicately rendered planes, whereas the powerful, muscular figure on the reverse rises boldly from the plain surface of the piece. In
               compositions such as the one created for the reverse of the <persName>Essex</persName> medal, <persName>Flanagan</persName> brought a
               new realism to medallic art.</p>
            <p>Although World War I marked the end of the <pb n="11"/> renaissance of the American medal, the entrance of the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> into the war provoked one last outburst of interest in medallic art. Medals and decorations were produced to honor deeds of
               bravery, recognize service, and commemorate specific events in the war. As <persName>Mark Jones</persName> has shown, the classical
               tradition of medallic art in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> "allowed only the most inadequate of responses" to an ugly and cruel war.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> While German
               medalists developed a new, expressionist idiom that enabled them to represent the brutality of the war, American artists continued to utilize the
               allegorical vocabulary of the continental tradition, or to work in a more naturalistic vein, tempered by idealism. Artistically one of the finest
               American war medals is the <persName>Mt. Sinai</persName> Hospital War Service Medal (<ref target="#fig-12">fig. 12, <hi rend="italic">328</hi>
               </ref>) by <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph A. Weinman</persName>, another of Saint-Gaudens' students. <persName>Weinman's</persName> classicizing style and his mastery of medallic design are apparent in this piece, which features an allegorical design based
               on <persName>Greco-Roman</persName> sources. The pathos of the wounded warrior, the heroic gesture of the woman who protects him, and the
               menacing demeanor of the <placeName>German</placeName> soldier are faithful to the classical tradition, but they create an impression almost
               of parody when considered in terms of the reality of the war.</p>

            <p>A <persName>Victory</persName> medal for the Art War Relief created by <persName corresp="#viaf_13127761">Paul Manship</persName> (<ref target="#fig-11">fig. 11, <hi rend="italic">368</hi>
               </ref>) illustrates the new mode of sculpture that came into favor in the early 1920s, supplanting the Beaux-Arts style. In Manship's work bold,
               linear stylizations replace the naturalistic modeling of the Saint-Gaudens school. The subject matter of this medal is, however, not at all new.
               The militant figure of Liberty, the American eagle and the rising sun are all familiar from the Beaux-Arts designs for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> coinage. Despite his radically different style, Manship was essentially conservative in retention of a
               classical, allegorical vocabulary. In the succeeding decades, neither the artists who followed Manship nor those who continued to work in the
               Beaux-Arts tradition would take American medallic art in significantly new directions.</p>

                  <p>The <persName>Roiné</persName> medal actually depicts both types of machines: the pantograph, used for reducing sculpture, and the
                        <persName>Janvier lathe</persName>, a die cutting machine. If the sculptor's model, executed in a soft material such as wax or
                     clay, was too large to fit on the lathe, it first had to be reduced on the pantograph. A replica of the model, produced by the electrotype
                     process, was mounted on the lathe, and the machine then cut or engraved a reduced copy of the model in positive or negative into a softened
                     steel die. After hand retouching, the metal was hardened, and the finished die was used for striking the medal. If the machine had produced
                     a positive die, or "hub," as was most often the case, a negative die had to be made from it before striking. For a full discussion of the

               </hi>
            </head>
            <p>Each catalogue entry gives the following information: title of the work and date of issue, if known; issuing organization and/or purpose of the
               medal; artist (only in sections where works by more than one artist are catalogued); technique, metal, dimensions and firm responsible for
               production of the piece, if known; credit line; bibliographical references.</p>
            <p>The terminology used here generally follows the 1911 ANS <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals</hi>
               (IECM). In this catalogue, the term uniface denotes either a one-sided cast or a struck piece with a plain reverse. Any struck or cast piece not
               designated as uniface is understood to have both obverse and reverse designs. The term galvano refers to a uniface piece produced by the
               electrotype process, whereby a replica of the artist's model is created by electrodepositing a thin metal shell on the surface of the model or a
               plaster mold taken from the model. A cliché is a struck piece made from either the obverse or the reverse die for a two-sided piece. Clichés are
               made for the artist's own collection or for museums, for the purpose of display. The term gilt is used here to describe pieces which are either
               gold-plated or gilded. A single dimension indicates the diameter for a round piece. For rectangular pieces, the measurement of the height is
               given before the width. For irregular pieces, the same order is followed, with the maximum dimensions for the piece being given.</p>
            <p>All pieces in the catalogue are understood to be from the ANS collection except where otherwise specified. Two credit lines for ANS pieces
               require explanation: "<persName>Eidlitz</persName> bequest" is abbreviated from "bequest of <persName>Mr. R. J. Eidlitz</persName> and
               gift of <persName>Mrs. R. J. Eidlitz</persName>; "<persName>J. Coolidge Hills</persName> collection bequest" refers to a collection of
               medals transferred to the ANS from the <persName>Wadsworth Atheneum</persName> (<placeName>Hartford</placeName>, Connecticut) by bequest
               of <persName>J. Coolidge Hills</persName>. All pieces illustrated in the catalogue are from the ANS collection, with the exception of <persName>John Flanagan's Rostron</persName>/<hi rend="italic">Titanic</hi> Lifesaving Medal (<hi rend="italic">154</hi>), which was
               photographed by permission of The <placeName>Newark</placeName> Museum. In the text and catalogue entries, italicized numbers indicate the
               pieces that are illustrated. Wherever possible medals are illustrated at full scale. Dimensions for medals illustrated at a reduced scale are
               given in the catalogue.</p>
            <p>For the abbreviated bibliographical references that appear in the catalogue entries, the reader is referred to either the specific bibliography
               listed in that section of the catalogue or the general bibliography at the end of the catalogue.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The son of a sculptor, <persName>Pierre-Jean David d'Angers</persName> began his art studies at the drawing school in Angers, his
                  birthplace. He also studied painting with a local <persName>Angevin</persName> artist before moving to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1808. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, he studied with the sculptor
                     <persName>Roland</persName>. <persName>David</persName> won the <persName>Grand Prix de Rome</persName> for sculpture in
                  1811 and spent three years at the French Academy in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. After his return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, he pursued a standard academic career as a sculptor and was rewarded with a
                  professorship at the <persName>Ecole des Beaux-Arts</persName> in 1826.</p>
               <p>Beginning in 1827, <persName>David d'Angers</persName> embarked on a vast new project, the creation of the hundreds of portrait
                  medallions that were to make up his "Gallery of Famous Men," planned as an "enduring didactic encyclopedia." Departing from the neo-Classical
                  style of his earlier sculpture, <persName>David</persName> applied the tenets of the Romantic writers and painters to medallic
                  portraiture, replacing the traditional engraved medal with direct, vigorously modeled "sketches in bronze." His posthumous portraits of the
                  Romantic heroes <persName>Géricault</persName> (1) and <persName>Byron</persName> (<ref target="#fig-13">2</ref>) demonstrate the
                  expressive potential of his new style. The deliberately distorted features of the Byron portrait—the elongated skull, lofty brow, deep-set,
                  dreamy eyes, and tousled hair—are typical of <persName>David's</persName> portraiture and show his interest in the correlation between
                  physiognomy and genius.</p>

                     <persName>Henri Chapu</persName> (1833-1891)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Born in <persName>Le Mée</persName>, <persName>Henri Chapu</persName> moved with his family to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> at the age of ten and was apprenticed two years later to an interior designer. Having completed the
                  drawing course at the <persName>Petite Ecole</persName>, he was accepted in 1849 at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with the
                  sculptors <persName>Pradier</persName> and <persName>Duret</persName>. In 1855 he was awarded the <persName>Grand Prix de
                     Rome</persName> for sculpture, and he worked in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> for five years before returning to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1861. <persName>Chapu</persName> was a professor at the <persName>Académie Julian</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> for many years and also taught a modeling class in the
                  night school at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, although he never headed one of the ateliers there.</p>
               <p>While he was primarily a sculptor of statues and monuments, <persName>Chapu</persName>, like many of the sculptors of his generation,
                  also produced cast portrait medallions in the tradition of <persName>David</persName>. In comparison with <persName>David's</persName> forceful, Romantic portraits, <persName>Chapu's</persName> medallic portraiture, illustrated here by his portrait of
                  the architect <persName>Guillaume</persName> (3), is more restrained and academic. The refined, low relief modeling of <pb n="16"/> the
                     <persName>Guillaume</persName> portrait marks a major change from both the hard-edged neo-Classical style and the bold relief of <persName>David's</persName> medallic portraits. Although the portrait of <persName>Guillaume</persName> is classical in format, the
                  head, softly shaped by the play of light and shade across the subtly varied surface of the relief, is far from the cold, lifeless profiles of
                  official neo-Classical portraiture.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Jules-Clement Chaplain</persName> was born in <placeName>Mortagne</placeName> and, after preparatory training, was admitted
                  to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1857. At the <persName>Ecole</persName>, he
                  studied medal engraving under <persName>Oudiné</persName> and sculpture with <persName>Jouffroy</persName> and, in 1863, won the
                     <persName>Grand Prix de Rome</persName> for medal engraving. After further study in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> from 1864 to 1868, he returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, where he pursued an extremely
                  successful career as a medalist, receiving numerous awards for his work at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Salons
                  and Universal Expositions. In 1877 <persName>Chaplain</persName> became the official medalist of the French government and, four years
                  later, was elected to the prestigious Académie des Beaux-Arts.</p>

               <p>As his biography suggests, <persName>Chaplain's</persName> work bridges the neo-Classical and Beaux-Arts traditions. In his cast portrait
                  medals, such as those of <persName>Jeanne Mathilde Claude</persName> (<hi rend="italic">9</hi>) and the painter <persName>Ernest
                     Meissonier</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-14">14</ref>)</hi>, the balance of bold linear definition and lively surface modeling creates a
                  powerfully immediate, yet restrained, image of the sitter. The strong, simple outline of <persName>Madame Claude's</persName> profile
                  gives the portrait an air of classical nobility, offset by the vigorously modeled drapery folds and the realistic treatment of her ample
                  figure and garment.</p>
               <p>The <persName>Meissonier</persName> medal belongs to a great series of portrait medals by <persName>Chaplain</persName> of the
                  prominent French artists of his day. Inspired by the Romantic image of the artist, these portraits share some of the visionary intensity of
                  David's medallic portraits, tempered by the sober draftsmanship and carefully finished modeling characteristic of <persName>Chaplain's</persName> work. In contrast to the dynamic obverse portraits, the reverses of most of these medals are disappointingly lifeless
                  and academic.</p>
               <p>Some of <persName>Chaplain's</persName> later medals are closer in style to the soft, pictorial work of his student Roty, although they
                  retain the clear linear definition typical of the master's work. The reverse of <persName>Chaplain's</persName> beautiful medal
                  commemorating the visit of the <placeName>Russian</placeName> fleet to Toulon in 1893 <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-15">11</ref>)</hi>, with its pictorial treatment of the theme of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> welcoming the
                  Russian fleet, shows the influence of Roty, while the obverse, with its simple, refined jugate busts personifying <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and <placeName>Russia</placeName>, is more classical in spirit. Chaplain's use of the
                  rectangular format for some of his later portrait medals is likewise borrowed from <persName>Roty</persName>, although the style of
                  portraiture in works like his 1899 plaquette honoring <persName>Louis Liard</persName>, the Director of Higher Education in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> (15), is clearly his own.</p>

                     <persName>Alexandre Louis Marie Charpentier</persName> (1856-1909)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Born in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, <persName>Alexandre Charpentier</persName> began his career by serving
                  an apprenticeship to an engraver. He later worked as an assistant to the medalist Ponscarme and then entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where
                  he competed unsuccessfully for the <persName>Prix de Rome</persName> in medal engraving. <persName>Charpentier</persName> was active
                  also in the decorative arts, collaborating with artisans to produce clocks, boxes, furniture and <pb n="18"/> other objects ornamented with
                  sculptural relief. In 1892-93 he joined other artists in founding the group "Les Cinq," dedicated to fostering the integration of the fine and
                  applied arts.</p>
               <p>Charpentier's work is unique among the <placeName>French</placeName> school of medalists for its naturalism and sculptural technique. His
                  direct, roughly modeled portrait "sketches" (17) and more finished decorative plaques represent an adaptation of the sculptural idiom of Rodin
                  to the art of the medal. The unidealized, dancing nude figure of Danseuse I <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-16">21</ref>)</hi> from 1907,
                  captured in a fleeting, contorted pose, is a far cry from the timeless, elegant, allegorical nudes of the academic tradition.</p>
               <p>As <persName>Mark Jones</persName> has pointed out, Charpentier's commissioned medals are more conventionally modeled in soft, low
                  relief, but the social realism of some of these works marks a further departure from the Beaux-Arts school. His medal for the firm of <persName>Janvier</persName> and <persName>Duval</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-17">23</ref>)</hi> and his Stonemasons medal (26), for example, depict contemporary laborers in carefully
                  observed detail, highlighting their physical strength and skill.</p>

                     <persName>Louis Oscar Roty</persName> (1846-1911)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <persName>Louis Oscar Roty</persName>, a native Parisian, was apprenticed as a youth to an engraver and chaser. After preliminary study
                  at the <persName>Petite Ecole</persName>, he was admitted to the <persName>Ecole</persName> des Beaux-Arts in 1864. He initially
                  studied painting, but later took up sculpture in the the atelier of <persName>Augustin Dumont</persName>. He also studied independently
                  with the sculptor <persName>Henri Chapu</persName> and the medalists <persName>Ponscarme</persName> and <persName>Chaplain</persName>. In 1875 <persName>Roty</persName> won the <persName>Grand Prix de Rome</persName> for medal engraving and spent
                  three years in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> before returning to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. From that time on he did much to promote the art of the medal, and his work, exhibited regularly in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Salons and Universal Expositions, was awarded the highest honors. <persName>Roty</persName>
                  joined <persName>Chaplain</persName> as a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1888, after his former teacher urged his election in
                  exception to the rule that only one medalist might hold a chair in the Académie.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Roty's</persName> training in drawing and painting is evident in his medallic work which displays a unique pictorial
                  sensibility. His revival of the rectangular plaquette format in 1880 facilitated the innovative blending of sculpture and painting in his
                  medals, allowing him to treat the medal essentially as a miniature picture in relief. For a portrait plaquette of his parents sculpted in 1886
                     <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-18">28</ref>)</hi>, <persName>Roty</persName> employed a standard Renaissance composition, the
                  double portrait with facing busts, but the contemporary dress and down-to-earth realism of his portrayal of the elderly <persName>Rotys</persName> make it clear that they are not Renaissance nobles. The candid detail and soft, painterly style of the relief gives the
                  portraits an intimate, affectionate quality previously associated more with painting than with the public, official art of the medal.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Roty's</persName> famous plaquette commemorating the death and funeral of French President <persName>Sadi
                     Carnot</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-19">35</ref>
                  </hi>) shows the full potential of his style. Through the masterful handling of the devices of pictorial perspective, including the subtle
                  gradation of the low relief so that objects meant to seem far away are in extremely low relief with finely incised details, <persName>Roty</persName> creates the illusion of a vast expanse. On the obverse, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> is depicted
                  mourning the dead <persName>Carnot</persName>, whose home appears far off in the distance. On the reverse, a group of veiled female
                  figures carries the President's body towards its final resting place in the <placeName>Pantheon</placeName>. The empty space which
                  surrounds the austere, solemn, allegorical figures heightens the powerful emotion of the scenes. The figures themselves, with their classical
                  restraint, have been compared to Greek statuary, and the careful drapery studies in the tradition of Ingres (which exist for this piece and
                  many of <persName>Roty's</persName> other medals) bear out this analogy.</p>

               <p>The popularity of his medals brought <persName>Roty</persName> a number of commissions for portrait medals of prominent Americans. His
                  commemorative medal of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> financier <persName>William Thompson
                     Walters</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-20">34</ref>
                  </hi>) presents further evidence of the artist's talent as a portraitist. The reverse of this medal, however, illustrates the complaint
                  sometimes leveled against <persName>Roty's</persName> work that his pictorial compositions are too fussy and inappropriate to the scale
                  of the medium. Here <persName>Roty</persName> uses a characteristic landscape vista to give an artificial sense of cohesion to the wealth
                  of information about <persName>Walters</persName> which he provides, but the meaning of the imagery is somewhat obscure. In the
                  foreground, a caduceus, perhaps intended to symbolize the railroad which formed the basis of <persName>Walters</persName>' fortune, rests
                  against a large tree, the illogical focal point of the composition. Behind the tree is a sculpture of a lion inscribed with the name <hi rend="italic">BARYE</hi>, a reference to <persName>Walters</persName>' role in providing for a monument in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> to the French sculptor <persName>Barye</persName>, whose work he avidly collected. The cities of
                     <placeName>Harrisburg</placeName>, <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> (<persName>Walters'</persName> birthplace), and <persName>Baltimore</persName> (his place of residence) appear in the distant background.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Louis Alexandre Bottée</persName> was born in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> and apprenticed at age
                  thirteen to a button maker, where he learned the art of engraving. He began his art studies in the evening classes of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> drawing schools and later attended the <persName>Petite Ecole</persName>. In 1869 he entered the
                  atelier of the chief Parisian medal engraver, <persName>Tasset</persName>, and in 1871 he was accepted to study with the medalist
                  Ponscarme at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. After winning the <persName>Grand Prix de Rome</persName> for medal engraving in 1878, <persName>Bottée</persName> spent three years at the French Academy in Rome. When he returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, his work was well received, and he was awarded honors at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>
                  Salons.</p>
               <p>As his training suggests, <persName>Bottée's</persName> work epitomizes the French academic tradition of his day. His medals, such as the
                  one commemorating the opening of the Port of Tunis in 1893 <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-21">43</ref>)</hi>, generally feature
                  elaborate allegorical compositions, modeled in the soft style developed by <persName>Roty</persName>. In comparison with similar
                  compositions by <persName>Roty</persName> (31, for example), the greater flamboyance of Bottée's style is apparent. On the exuberant
                  reverse of the Tunis medal, a nude woman bearing a cornucopia and a sprig of laurel is depicted rising from the waves on the back of a hybrid
                  sea monster, with the port dimly visible in the distance. The entire composition is filled with dynamic movement, generated by the swirling
                  line and the active poses of the figures.</p>

                     <persName>Charles Cushing Wright</persName> (1796-1854)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Born in <placeName>Damariscotta</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4971068">Maine</placeName>, C. C. Wright taught himself
                  engraving as an apprentice to <persName>John Osburn</persName>, a jeweler and watchmaker in <placeName>Utica</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. After working for a number of years as an itinerant engraver, Wright
                  settled in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, where he established a die engraving firm in
                  partnership with <persName>James Bale</persName>. In 1840 he went into the bank note engraving business with the artist <persName>Asher B. Durand</persName> and later became one of the founding members of the National Academy of Design and lectured there on
                  the art of the medal.</p>
               <p>Although executed in the prevailing neo-classical style of the period, Wright's strongly individualized portraits of the prominent civic
                  leaders and artists of America's early years rise above the bland idealism often associated with that style. His skill as a die engraver is
                  apparent in the detail of his portraits of <persName corresp="#viaf_4944460">Daniel Webster</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-22">53</ref>)</hi> and <persName>Henry Clay</persName> (54), which follow Roman models in the
                  exaggerated realism of their boldly indicated wrinkles and veins. Working within the established format of official, neo-Classical medals,
                  Wright adds visual interest to the Clay and Webster medals through his careful attention to inscriptions and decorative borders. While he
                  often engraved his medals from reliefs modeled by other artists, the noble portrait of <persName>Webster</persName> is his own design, as
                  are the innovative pictorial reverses of the <persName>Webster</persName> and <persName>Clay</persName> medals. The reverse of the
                     <persName>Webster</persName> medal, which features an imaginary monument to the statesman with the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Capitol as it appeared at the time in the distance, is particularly noteworthy for its balanced
                  composition and fine detail.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A native of Hamburg, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, <persName>Anthony C. Paquet</persName> came to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in 1848 and settled in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>. From 1857 until 1864, he was assistant engraver at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, where
                  he designed a number of the official medals awarded for acts of bravery by authorization of Congress (56 and <hi rend="italic">59</hi>, for
                  example). In his re- evaluation of these medals, <persName>Cornelius Vermeule</persName> has stressed the "Victorian grandeur" of
                  Paquet's figural compositions, resulting from the artist's investment of neo-Classical forms with the "lofty sentiment" characteristic of his
                  era. <persName>Vermeule</persName> draws a convincing parallel between the tableaux-like compositions of Paquet's medals, such as the one
                  honoring the rescuers of victims from the wreck of the steamship <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-23">59</ref>)</hi>,and the popular re-enactments of such events on the stage or in the patriotic parades
                  of the day. The dramatic vignette on the obverse of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> Lifesaving
                  Medal, which depicts a man and woman adrift on a raft threatened by churning waves, with a rescue ship appearing far off in the distance, is
                  the epitome of Victorian sentiment.</p>

                  classicizing heads similar to those by <persName>C. C. Wright</persName>, but of a more generalized nature. <persName>Vermeule</persName> singles out for criticism the <persName>Barbers'</persName> idealized, <persName>Greco-Roman</persName> portrait
                  of <persName corresp="#viaf_66505625">Ulysses S. Grant</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-24">62</ref>
                  </hi>) on the medal issued in 1879 to commemorate his presidency. No sense of the General's personality is conveyed by this portrait, and the
                  inappropriate, heavy "Pseudo-Gothic" lettering of the inscription which surrounds the head further weakens the design. <persName>Charles Barber's Benjamin Harrison</persName> inaugural medal <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-25">65</ref>)</hi>, issued a decade after
                  the Grant medal, features the same archaizing Gothic lettering and a similar unimaginative foliate wreath on the reverse, but the more
                  realistic bust portrait of <persName>Harrison</persName> in civilian dress on the obverse of this medal marks an improvement over the
                     <persName>Barbers'</persName> classicizing portrayal of Grant. The deeply undercut high relief of the <persName>Harrison</persName> portrait gives this image a forcefulness which was lacking in the Grant portrait.</p>

               <p>Born in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, <persName>Louis Saint-Gaudens</persName> worked as a
                  studio assistant to his famous older brother from 1872 until Augustus' death in 1907. Although he is credited with few independent works,
                  Louis played a major role in the execution of his brother's sculptures. The Congressional medal presented to <persName>Joseph
                     Francis</persName> in 1890 (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-26">67</ref>
                  </hi>) for his contributions to the technology and organization of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Lifesaving
                  Service is attributed to <persName>Louis Saint-Gaudens</persName>. Although the literature on this piece is unclear, it seems that he was
                  responsible for preparing the models for the medal, perhaps from a design by <persName>Zeleima Jackson</persName>. His use of a
                  composition in the tradition of earlier American lifesaving medals for the reverse, while relying on more contemporary sources for the design
                  of the obverse, would best explain the jarring difference in style between the two sides of the medal. The obverse of the Francis medal, with
                  its vigorously modeled, naturalistic bust portrait, Renaissance format, and border of stars, closely resembles the obverse of Augustus <persName>Saint-Gaudens'</persName> important medal for the <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</persName> Inaugural
                  Centennial of 1889 (77). Executed in a more wooden, two-dimensional style, the vignette of a sea rescue on the reverse of the Francis medal,
                  typical of nineteenth century American lifesaving medals, has the character of a folk-art painting.</p>

                     <persName>Olin Levi Warner</persName> (1844-1896)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <persName>Olin Levi Warner</persName> was born in <placeName>West Suffield</placeName>, Connecticut, and grew up in <persName>Amsterdam</persName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. At the age of fifteen he received his first
                  art instruction at a private school in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</placeName> which he attended for two years. After he
                  returned to live with his family in Vermont, <persName>Warner</persName> pursued his interest in sculpture on his own and worked for six
                  years as a telegrapher to save enough money for study in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. He left for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1869 and was admitted to the atelier of Jouffroy at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in the
                  spring of 1870, following preliminary study at the Petite Ecole. Before his return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in 1872, he also worked for several months as an assistant in the studio of <persName>Jean-Baptiste
                     Carpeaux</persName>, the foremost French decorative sculptor at the time.</p>
               <p>After he came back to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, <persName>Warner</persName> struggled for
                  a number of years to establish his career, but finally achieved some critical success with <pb n="27"/> his portrait busts and medallions. His
                  numerous portrait medallions, which should be recognized as the earliest works of American medallic art to reflect the development of the cast
                  medal in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, bear a resemblance to the medallions of <persName>David
                     d'Angers</persName> in both format and technique. According to <persName>George Gurney</persName>, Warner's regard for David's work is
                  also attested by his <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> sketchbook, where several pages are filled with a list of the
                  portrait medals by David which he must have seen at the Louvre. Warner's medallions of his friend <persName>Thomas Fenton</persName> (68)
                  and his parents (69), executed in 1878 and 1879 respectively, are comparable to medallions by <persName>David</persName> in their bold
                  relief, vigorous modeling and hastily scrawled inscriptions, but a simple naturalism replaces the Romantic distortions of David's portraiture.
                  The Fenton medallion, with its classical air and softly textured modeling, might in fact more aptly be compared with Chapu's medallic
                  portraiture (<hi rend="italic">3</hi>).</p>
               <p>Among the finest of Warner's medallions are the series of eight portraits of Northwest Indians which he modeled from life on three trips to
                     <placeName>Oregon</placeName> and <placeName>Idaho</placeName> between 1889 and 1891, arranged by his friend Col. <persName>C. E. S. Wood</persName>. The portraits of Chief <persName>Joseph</persName> (70), "Young Chief" <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-27">71</ref>)</hi>, and <persName>Sabina</persName> (72) all share the spare format of a profile bust flanked by simple, vertical
                  inscriptions, which focuses attention on the artist's masterful modeling. Warner's realistic treatment of these portraits, which exhibit a
                  wide range of ages and facial types, shows his interest in providing an accurate ethnological record of the Northwest tribes, rather than
                  creating the kind of generalized, symbolic Indian sculpted by many of his contemporaries. The "Young Chief" medallion, with its variety of
                  textures and softly modulated relief, illustrates the sculptor's skillful use of light and shade to shape a strong likeness of the sitter.
                     <persName>Warner's</persName> talent as a medalist was recognized a few years before his untimely death in the commission for the
                  first <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> commemorative coin, the Columbian half dollar (82), which will be discussed
                  in a later section of this catalogue.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>, the son of a French shoemaker and his Irish wife, was born in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q436994">Dublin</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>. When he was six months old, the
                  family immigrated to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> and settled in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. At the age of thirteen, he was apprenticed to a cameo cutter, a trade which he
                  continued to practice while pursuing his formal art training in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>,
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. Around 1864, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> began studying drawing and modeling in evening classes at the Cooper Union and the National Academy of
                  Design in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. In 1867 he left for further studies in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, where he completed a preliminary course at the Petite Ecole before being accepted to the atelier of
                  Jouffroy at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Forced to leave <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1870 by the Franco-Prussian
                  War, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> went to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and set up his own studio there.
                  During a visit to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in 1875, he received several major commissions
                  which he worked on in Paris between 1877 and 1880. In the 1880s, he was again in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName>, and from 1885 on he spent his summers in Cornish, New Hampshire. He worked in Paris once again from until 1900, when he
                  returned to the United States for the last time, settling in Cornish for the remaining years of his life. Saint-Gaudens taught for many years
                  at the Art Students League in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and trained a whole generation of
                  younger sculptors as assistants in his busy studios.</p>
               <p>Saint-Gaudens' training as a cameo cutter, his Parisian schooling in modeling, and his discovery of early Renaissance art in Italy laid the
                  foundations for his innovations in relief sculpture, which in turn gave rise to the flowering of American medallic art in the first decades of
                  the twentieth century. According to Homer <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, his father's interest in working in low relief was sparked
                  by a suggestion by his friend <persName>John LaFarge</persName> that he "paint a bas-relief," following the examples of the Quattrocento
                  masters whom he greatly admired. Further inspired by Chapu's portrait medallions which he encountered on his return to Paris, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> set about developing a new, vital style of relief modeling in a remarkable series of portrait reliefs
                  that includes the 1879 portrait of the cosmopolitan American painter <persName>Francis Davis Millet</persName> (73) and the 1880 relief
                  of French painter <persName>Jules Bastien-Lepage</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-28">74</ref>).</hi>
               </p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-28">

               </figure>
               <p>The portraits of Millet and <persName>Bastien-Lepage,</persName> modeled in the exquisite low relief which became a hallmark of
                  Saint-Gaudens' style, demonstrate the artist's ability to "draw by means of light and shade...getting with an infinitesimal projection [of the
                  relief] enough variety of shadow to convey a complete impression of nature" (Kenyon Cox). Both reliefs masterfully illustrate the sculptor's
                  "chief maxim" of relief modeling, reported by his son Homer in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, "that the perfect relief texture,
                  lettering, molding, background, and all, should interest by its color and light from edge to edge." In the Bastien-Lepage and Millet
                  portraits, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> characteristically works the identi- <pb n="29"/> fying inscription into the composition as
                  a decorative feature. The background, textured by fine linear striations which <persName>Kathryn Greenthal</persName> has compared with
                  the lines of a print, also becomes part of the design, producing the effect of a soft atmosphere surrounding the figure.</p>
               <p>Like a number of <placeName>Saint-Gaudens</placeName>' other portrait reliefs, including his famous portrait of <persName>Robert
                     Louis Stevenson</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-31">76</ref>)</hi>, the relief of Bastien-Lepage <hi rend="italic">(74)</hi> was produced in many
                  different versions, varied in size and detail to create a commercially successful series of limited editions. The Bastien-Lepage relief from
                  the collection of the Boston Museum, probably an example of the first version of the piece, is a particularly fine cast, distinguished from
                  later versions by the whimsical decorative motif at the upper left and the inclusion of <persName>Louis Saint-Gaudens</persName>' name in
                  the inscription. The plaster mold from the collection of the <placeName>Saint-Gaudens</placeName> National Historic Site and the gilt
                  bronze cast in the ANS collection represent a later reduced-scale edition of the <persName>Bastien-Lepage</persName> relief. Both the
                  decrease in scale and the gold plating of the ANS piece somewhat obscure the subtle modeling of the relief, which <placeName>Saint-Gaudens</placeName> considered to be "as near perfection as he ever came."</p>

               <p>Despite their relatively small number, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' medals, like his bas-reliefs, had an enormous impact on the
                  development of American medallic art. His first official medal, for the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> celebration of the centennial of <persName>George Washington's</persName> inauguration (<hi rend="italic">77</hi>), is
                  also his most influential medallic work. Cornelius Vermeule has pointed out the many similarities between this piece and portrait medallions
                  by the Quattrocento artist <persName>Pisanello</persName>, both in the balanced composition of the obverse and in the technique and the
                  handling of lettering. Executed by <persName corresp="#viaf_1573083">Philip Martiny</persName> under Saint-Gaudens' close supervision,
                  the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> medal, with its lively modeled surfaces and elegant bust, was produced by
                  casting in the tradition of Italian Renaissance medals, rather than by striking.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> received several other important commissions for medals in the course of his career, including the
                  controversial award medal for the World's Columbian Exposition (<hi rend="italic">86</hi> and <hi rend="italic">87</hi>) and a special
                  inaugural medal for President <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-29">78</ref>
                  </hi>). The obverse of the <persName>Roosevelt</persName> medal is comparable in format to the obverse of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> medal, but the portrayal of the president in the later piece is less successful. The noble
                  eagle on the reverse of the <persName>Roosevelt</persName> inaugural medal, skillfully modeled by <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph A. Weinman</persName>, had been used earlier as part of the rejected design for the reverse of the Columbian
                  Exposition medal and would be used again for the reverse of the new U.S. ten-dollar gold piece (<hi rend="italic">201</hi>) at the request of
                  President <persName>Roosevelt</persName>. Saint-Gaudens' design for the 1907 twenty-dollar gold piece <hi rend="italic">(202)</hi>,
                  initially struck in high relief on a medal press, was his final and most beautiful medallic work.</p>
               <p>Other less formal medals by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>
                  <pb n="30"/> attest to his sense of humor. He delighted in creating quick sketches or caricatures of his artist friends, such as the cast
                  medallion of painter <persName>John</persName> Singer Sargent (75), with its Italian inscription BRUTTO RITRATTO ("bad" or "brutal"
                  portrait), which may be a double entendre referring to the Roman Republican coins of Marcus Junius Brutus, as Vermeule suggests. In 1905/6
                     <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> modeled a charming plaquette (<ref target="#fig-30">79</ref>) in low relief as a remembrance for
                  his friends and neighbors who had staged an outdoor entertainment to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of his residence in Cornish. The
                  theater curtains hung with ancient comic masks, the Roman temple, and the ancient bowl featured in the design all refer to the masque "The
                  Gods and the Golden Bowl" which had been performed in honor of Augusta and Augustus <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The World's Columbian Exposition heralded not only the coming of age of the Beaux-Arts style in American sculpture, but a major turning point
                  in the history of American medallic and numismatic art as well. Hundreds of medals and tokens were issued by European and American firms as
                  souvenirs of the World's Fair, and the first U.S. commemorative coins were minted and sold to help defray the cost of the Exposition. Olin
                  Levi Warner and <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>, two of the premier American sculptors of the period, were engaged to design
                  the commemorative half dollar (82) and the award medal for the Exposition <hi rend="italic">(86</hi> and <hi rend="italic">87).</hi> The
                  choice of Warner to design the Columbian half dollar by the Board of Managers of the World's Columbian Commission marked the first time that
                  an artist outside of the U.S. Mint had become involved in the production of an American coin. This coin and the Columbian quarter-dollar piece
                  issued along with it also share the distinction of being the first American coins to feature portraits of historical figures.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-32">

               <p>As <persName>George Gurney</persName> has reconstructed it, the story of Warner's role in designing the Columbian half dollar illustrates
                  the "fundamental difference in aesthetic approach" between the Mint engravers and the new generation of American sculptors trained in
                  modeling, which caused increasing tension between the two groups. Because of a dispute between the Columbian Commission and the Mint over the
                  portrait of Columbus that Warner had created for the coin, another portrait of the explorer, originally modeled by the sculptor for the medal
                  commemorating the dedication of the Exposition <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-32">83</ref>)</hi>, was adopted for the obverse of the
                  half-dollar piece. A comparison of the obverses of the medal and the coin reveals the extent to which Mint engravers <persName>Charles E</persName>. Barber and <persName>George T</persName>. Morgan, who executed the dies for the coin from Warner's models, weakened
                  the effect of the sculptor's subtle, plastic modeling. Having removed Warner's initials from the design, Barber and Morgan took full credit
                  for the Columbian half dollar, and subsequent numismatic literature has omitted any mention of Warner as the designer of the coin, since his
                  role in the project was not documented in Mint records.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' design for the official award medal of the Columbian Exposition <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-33">86</ref>)</hi> also embroiled him in a controversy with the U.S. Mint <pb n="33"/> and officials of the Treasury
                  Department. The sculptor's original design for the reverse of the medal, which featured an ideal nude youth representing the "<placeName>Spirit of America</placeName>," was rejected by the United States Senate Quadro-Centennial Committee because of the "impropriety"
                  of the figure. When the Secretary of the Treasury requested that <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> redesign the piece, "covering the
                  objectionable part of the figure," he initially refused to do so on aesthetic grounds. Eventually, however, he submitted two slightly modified
                  versions of the reverse and a third version without the figure, but all three of these designs were rejected. Upon learning that the medal
                  would be struck with a reverse by Mint engraver <persName>Charles E</persName>. Barber, adapted from his last design, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> became incensed and took his case to the press, rallying his fellow artists to his defense.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-34">

               </figure>
               <p>While the nude figure in the initial version of the reverse of the Columbian award medal (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-33">86</ref>
                  </hi>), modeled by <persName>Louis Saint-Gaudens</persName>, is somewhat awkwardly posed, the design is far superior to the banal reverse
                  by Barber that was later struck (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-34">87</ref>
                  </hi>). The contrast between the fluid, modeled surfaces of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' masterfully composed obverse and the
                  precisely defined forms of Barber's busy reverse is immediately apparent. Among the many portrayals of Columbus on American and European
                  medals commemorating the Exposition (85, 90, and 91, for example), <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' obverse design stands out for its
                  heroic treatment of the figure of the explorer, represented at the dramatic moment when he first stepped ashore in the New World. In
                  comparison with Roty's delicate, allegorical design for the award medal of the French section of the Exposition (88), <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' composition, with its vigorous naturalism, is closer in spirit to Quattrocento medals.</p>

               <p>The award medal of the 1895 Atlanta Exposition <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-35">92</ref>)</hi> is worthy of note as the sole work of
                  medallic art by Philip Martiny (1858-1927), the talented architectural sculptor from Strasbourg who "brought the full range of ornamental work
                  of the Beaux-Arts style to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>" (Craven). After he came to this country in the
                  1880s, Martiny worked with <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, for whom he modeled the <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George
                     Washington</persName> centennial medal (77), and he had a major hand in the sculptural decorations for the World's Columbian Exposition. With
                  its exuberant allegorical design and lively modeling, Martiny's Cotton States Exposition medal exemplifies the high Beaux-Arts style of
                  decorative sculpture.</p>

               <p>The official medals for the Universal Expositions held in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1878, 1889 and 1900 are
                  important as precedents for the American Exposition medals. As <persName>Mark Jones</persName> has shown, the earliest of these pieces,
                  Chaplain's medal for the 1878 Exposition (93), was innovative in its rejection of "the convention of a composition in fairly high relief which
                  rises abruptly from a completely flat and polished field." The format of a pair of allegorical figures hovering above a bird's eye view of the
                  Fair was repeated by Bottée in his medal for the 1889 Exposition (94) and again by Chaplain in his elegant design for the award medal of the
                  1900 Exposition <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-36">95</ref>).</hi> The American medalist Victor D. Brenner also created a commemorative
                  badge for the 1900 Exposition (97), the first of the Paris Fairs at which the United States was significantly represented. A comparison of the
                  refined pictorial compositions on the tiny piece by Brenner, which illustrate the American Pavilion at the Exposition and a monument to
                  Lafayette given by the American people to the French, with the allegorical images on Roty's small commemorative plaquette for the 1900 World's
                  Fair (96) reveals Brenner's stylistic debt to his teacher.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Hudson-Fulton Celebration, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, 1909</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration, like the World's Fairs of 1893, 1901, 1904, and 1915, was an occasion for celebrating the achievements of
                  America. Two weeks of naval parades, historical pageants, aquatic sports, aeronautical exhibitions, and pyrotechnics, among other events,
                  celebrated the three-hundredth anniversary of Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River in 1609 and the one- hundredth anniversary of
                  Robert Fulton's first use of steam to navigate the same river in 1807. A huge outpouring of medals and tokens in all shapes and sizes
                  accompanied the festivities held in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City and the towns along the
                  Hudson River. Medals for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration were commissioned from a number of the leading medallic sculptors of the day, including
                  Chester Beach <hi rend="italic">(100),</hi> John Flanagan (101), Emil Fuchs (<ref target="#fig-37">99</ref>), and J. Edouard Roine (102). It
                  is interesting to note that Fuchs and Roiné were among the European immigrants who transmitted the continental style of medallic art to this
                  country, while Flanagan and Beach were American sculptors trained in Paris.</p>

                  </p>
               </figure>
               <p>The American Numismatic Society's Committee on the Publication of Medals made preliminary studies in the spring of 1908 for a medal
                  commemorating the Hudson-Fulton Celebration and selected Emil Fuchs to design and model the piece according to their specifications. In an
                  effort to make the details of the design as historically accurate as possible, the ANS Committee examined historical navigational tools,
                  consulted authorities in various fields, and sent Fuchs to Holland to research Henry Hudson and Dutch ships of the early seventeenth century.
                  Upon completion, the models for the medal were submitted to the Medal Committee of the Hudson-Fulton Commission, which decided to issue the
                  piece jointly with the ANS as the official medal of the Celebration. A total of 124,698 examples of the medal <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-37">99</ref>)</hi>, in a variety of sizes and metals, were struck before the dies were retired, making this one of the
                  largest issues of a single medal ever produced.</p>
               <p>According to <persName>Edward D. Adams</persName>, a member of both the ANS Medals Committee and the Hudson- Fulton Medal Committee,
                  Fuchs introduced a deliberate contrast in the designs for the two sides of the medal. The reverse "was treated in a classical manner befitting
                  the education and character of the engineer [Fulton], while the other side was given an aspect of dramatic action, as appropriate to the
                  daring navigator and discoverer [Hudson] whose career ended in a tragedy of mutiny and mysterious death." Fuchs' distinctive soft style
                  unifies the lively vignette of Henry Hudson and his sailors on the obverse of the medal and the calm, symmetrically balanced allegory of steam
                  navigation on the reverse. Summarizing the merits of the piece, Adams wrote that this medal, with "the accuracy of its historical detail, the
                  balance and grace of its composition, and the delicate refinement of its low relief," set a standard for the level of medallic and numismatic
                  art that the ANS wished to foster.</p>
               <p>None of the other medals for the Hudson- Fulton Celebration equals Fuchs' work in artistic quality or intricacy of design. For the obverse of
                  the Official Badge, sanctioned by the Committee on Badges, Flags and Poster of the Hudson-Fulton Commission <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-38">100</ref>)</hi>, Chester Beach employed the <pb n="37"/> simple formula of jugate bust portraits of <persName>Henry Hudson</persName> and <persName>Robert Fulton</persName>. His design for the reverse features an allegorical figure representing
                  the "Spirit of Progress," based on the central figure in the Official Poster for the Celebration, with the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City skyline as a backdrop. Beach, like Fuchs, shapes his figures in soft, low
                  relief, but his modeling is less varied. <persName>John Flanagan's</persName> design for the Hudson-Fulton medal issued by the Circle of
                  Friends of the Medallion (101) is also disappointing, especially in contrast to the originality of many of his other medallic compositions.
                  Jugate busts of Hudson and Fulton again comprise the obverse of the medal, while the reverse is occupied by a draped female figure who holds a
                  light bulb, symbolizing the age of electricity, with the Hudson River and the skyline of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in the background.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The award medal created by Hermon MacNeil for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition <hi rend="italic">(106</hi>) is notable for its inventiveness.
                  It is clear that the sculptor intended to produce a design that would be unmistakably American, as he stated at the time. While the motif of a
                  woman with a butting animal featured on the obverse of the Pan-American medal goes back to Greco-Roman sources, as Cornelius Vermeule has
                  noted, MacNeil recasts the female figure as a powerful nude, embodying the concept of Liberty, and the animal as a buffalo, a symbol both of
                  America and of the city hosting the Exposition. His innovative composition for the reverse of this medal uses the image of a North American
                  and a South American Indian sharing a peace pipe to symbolize Pan-American friendship. This geographical allegory would serve as an important
                  model for subsequent American medals and coins.</p>
               <p>Another noteworthy medal associated with the Pan-American Exposition is the special medal designed by James Earle Fraser in honor of <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(<ref target="#fig-39">107</ref>).</hi> The Saint-Gaudens medal, with its obvious borrowings from Quattrocento and classical
                  sources, makes an instructive comparison with MacNeil's medal for the Buffalo Exposition. There is nothing in Fraser's design that marks it as
                  specifically American, although his naturalistic treatment of the portrait of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> is somewhat comparable
                  to MacNeil's handling of the Indian figures on the reverse of his Pan-American medal.</p>

               <p>For the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904, <persName>Adolph A</persName>. Weinman created a unique series of medals (108, <hi rend="italic">

                  </hi>, 110-11) struck in varying metals and shapes, depending on the class of the award. All of these medals share the same central obverse
                  and reverse designs, set off by circular fields, but the motifs around the edges of the different pieces vary. On the obverse, the central
                  medallion features an image of Liberty cloaking herself and a younger figure beside her in the American flag, an important precedent for
                  Weinman's "Walking Liberty" half <pb n="39"/> dollar <hi rend="italic">(197).</hi> The corresponding field on the reverse is filled by an
                  American eagle with outstretched wings framing a cartouche for the inscription, with a pair of opposed dolphins flanking a scallop shell
                  below. The smooth surfaces and elegant linear outlines which complement these restrained compositions are typical of the sculptor's style. A
                  brief comparison of Weinman's medals for the St. Louis Fair with an elaborate plaquette by Bottée for the French section of the Exposition
                  (112) underscores the clarity and balance of Weinman's designs.</p>

                     <persName>Victor David Brenner</persName> (1871-1924)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <persName>Victor David Brenner</persName> was born in Shavly, <placeName>Lithuania</placeName> in 1871. As a youth, he learned the
                  engraving trade from his father, and he worked as a jewelry engraver and seal cutter in <placeName>Russia</placeName> before immigrating to
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in 1890. Within a few years he had established himself as a die
                  cutter and engraver working for jewelers and silversmiths in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. <persName>Brenner</persName> began his formal art studies in night classes at the National Academy of Design in 1896, and in 1898 he left
                  for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> for three years of further study. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, he studied modeling at the Académie Julian and medallic art with <persName>Charpentier</persName> and <persName>Roty</persName>, in whose studio he worked also as an assistant.</p>
               <p>Unlike many of the other American artists represented in this exhibition, whose medallic work was supplemental to major sculptural
                  commissions, <persName>Brenner</persName> was a professional medalist. In fact, only a few works of sculpture by him are known. His
                  choice of studying with Roty, the premier French medalist of the day, rather than entering the sculpture course at the <persName>Ecole des</persName> Beaux-Arts is significant in this respect. On his return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1901, <persName>Brenner</persName> was hired to teach a
                  new course in coin and medal design jointly sponsored by the ANS and the National Academy of Design. Although he resigned from teaching after
                  one year, he continued to promote the cause of medallic art with great zeal throughout his career. He was an active member of the ANS and
                  published a brief pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">The Art of the Medal</hi>, in which he described the various historical methods of medal
                  production.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Brenner's</persName> earliest medals executed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>
                  before his departure for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> already reveal his admiration for the contemporary French
                  school of medalists. Two medals issued by the ANS, the Muhlenberg medal of 1896 (116) and the Charities and Corrections medal of 1898 (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-42">118</ref>
                  </hi>) show a combination of the traditional hand engraving and modern reducing machine techniques of die cutting. The obverse of the
                  Charities and Corrections medal features an attempt to render a group of classically inspired allegorical figures in the soft, decorative
                  Parisian manner, but the composition is routine and the figures somewhat stiff and awkward. By contrast, <persName>Brenner's</persName>
                  mastery as a portraitist is apparent even before his first trip to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, particularly in
                  his 1897 plaquette (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-41">117</ref>
                  </hi>) honoring Danish explorer Fridtjof Nansen. The force of personality and feeling of three-dimensional presence conveyed in this small
                  piece are remarkable. With its daring frontal gaze, strong contrasts of light and shadow produced by the variation of the depth of relief, and
                  dramatic sense of texture, the portrait of Nansen is a tour-de-force.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-41">

               <p>Portraiture continued to be the focus of <persName>Brenner's</persName> work during his <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> years. His plaquettes and medals from this period, represented here by the portraits of <persName>George Aloysius
                     Lucas</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-43">119</ref>
                  </hi>), <persName>Anita Stuart</persName> (120) and <persName corresp="#numismatics_saltus">J. Sanford Saltus</persName> (121), show the direct influence of
                  Roty's soft, painterly style. Light flickers across the surface of the extremely low relief, fusing figure and background in a delicate tonal
                  study. <persName>Brenner's</persName> frequent choice of the plaquette format and his use of decorative foliage in these portrait
                  compositions also show his debt to Roty.</p>
               <p>While he continued to work in the manner of Roty, many of <persName>Brenner's</persName> portrait medals from the period after his return
                  to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> evidence a renewed interest in the naturalistic portrayal of his subjects. As
                  always, <persName>Brenner</persName> is at his best as a portraitist, while the reverse designs for his medals are generally somewhat
                  weak and highly derivative of Roty, with certain notable exceptions (<hi rend="italic">127</hi> and <hi rend="italic">137</hi>, for example).
                  His finest portraits from this period, such as those of <persName>James McNeill Whistler</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-45">127</ref>
                  </hi>), sculpted on a return trip to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, and Senator <persName>William Maxwell
                     Evarts</persName> (122), combine a strong characterization of the individual, akin to the earlier Nansen portrait, with the pictorial concerns
                  of the <pb n="41"/> Beaux-Arts style. In comparison with the Lucas portrait of 1899, the low relief modeling of the Whistler and Evarts
                  portraits is more varied, giving the figures a greater sense of plasticity. The commemorative portrait of Whistler is particularly convincing,
                  brilliantly evoking the cocky personality of the artist through the jaunty pose of the figure, the lively surface modeling, and the analogy
                  with the splendid peacock which mirrors the figure of the artist on the reverse. The culmination of Brenner's medallic portraiture came a few
                  years later with his famous portrait of Abraham Lincoln (136 and <hi rend="italic">137</hi>), which has graced the obverse of the U.S.
                  one-cent piece since 1909 (<hi rend="italic">193</hi>).</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>John Flanagan</persName> grew up in <placeName>Newark</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New
                     Jersey</placeName>, and began his art studies at the Cooper Union in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>
                  City. He worked for a time as a modeler of architectural ornaments, and then entered the studio of Augustus Saint-Gaudens. During his three
                  years as assistant to Saint-Gaudens, <persName>Flanagan</persName> continued his studies in night classes at the Art Students League. In
                  1890 he went to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, where he remained for twelve years, studying at the Académie
                  Colarossi, at the Académie Julian with Chapu, and at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in the atelier of Falguière. He also assisted <persName>Frederick MacMonnies</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> with the colossal fountain group for the 1893
                  Columbian Exposition.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Although he sculpted a number of portrait busts and large-scale reliefs, Flanagan was chiefly a medalist throughout his career. One of his
                  earliest surviving medallic portraits, the medallion of Mabel Clarke (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-46">143</ref>
                  </hi>), executed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> between 1895 and 1898, is an elegant, masterful portrait in the
                  Beaux- Arts tradition. The play of light across the softly modulated surface gives a sense of life to the figure, and the carefully rendered
                  period details of her dress and hairstyle further the realistic impression of the piece. Like <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, <persName>Flanagan</persName> incorporates the date and his monogram, with the trademark palmette motif, into the design of the medallion as
                  a decorative feature, complemented here by a delicate rose which alludes to the woman's beauty.</p>
               <p>After his return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, <persName>Flanagan</persName> produced a series of
                  distinctive portrait reliefs of literary figures and artist friends, employing both the medallion and plaquette formats. These portraits are
                  again notable for the artist's skillful handling of light and shade, which conveys a sense of plasticity to the figures, despite the low
                  relief. Flanagan's 1919 portrait of <persName>Walt Whitman</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-49">156</ref>
                  </hi>), for example, with its strong modeling and the rippling lines of the hair and beard, gives a vivid impression of the poet's larger-
                  than-life character. An earlier profile version of the <persName>Whitman</persName> portrait (145) in softer, lower relief is more
                  meditative in tone, demonstrating Flanagan's facility at exploiting the technique of low relief modeling to achieve a wide range of
                  effects.</p>

               <p>Flanagan's commissioned medals are among the best American medallic work of this period. A number of his medals are particularly noteworthy
                  for the realistic treatment of their subject matter. His 1915 award medal for the School Art League of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-50">155</ref>
                  </hi>) depicts a female art student sketching from a model in the surroundings of a sculpture studio. A comparison with Chester Beach's medal
                  for the Art Students League (<hi rend="italic">242</hi>), which shows a lithe female figure holding a drawing pen and sketch pad in front of
                  the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City skyline, or James Earle Fraser's medals (<hi rend="italic">107</hi>, 230, and 234) which represent the artist as a heroic male nude and Pegasus as a symbol of the Muses' inspiration, reveals the
                  refreshing originality of Flanagan's design. The obverse of his medal for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Horticultural Society (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-47">150</ref>
                  </hi>) and the reverse of his Essex Agricultural Society medal (<hi rend="italic">152)</hi> likewise depict contemporary figures engaged in
                  everyday gardening activities.</p>
               <p>As <persName>Cornelius Vermeule</persName> has observed, other medals by <persName>Flanagan</persName>, such as the <hi rend="italic">Titanic</hi> lifesaving medal (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-48">154</ref>
                  </hi>), feature heroic Michelangelesque nudes, where a detailed, realistic presentation of the subject would be impossible in the space of the
                  tondo. Flanagan's concern with the clarity of the image is evident also in his handling of inscriptions, which are kept simple and
                  unobtrusive. The variety <pb n="45"/> of patinas used to color the surfaces of his reliefs and medals shows the artist's interest in the
                  technical aspects of medallic production as well. His technical knowledge and skill earned him the praises of his contemporaries, including
                     <persName>Frederick MacMonnies</persName>, who is reported to have said, "I consider him the leading medalist of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, an artist of high rank and a craftsman of infinite sincerity and devotion to his work."</p>

                  apprenticed to a wood and ivory carver in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> at age fifteen. The
                  following year he began studying <pb n="47"/> drawing and modeling in evening classes at the Cooper Union, and in 1890 he became an assistant
                  to the sculptor <persName corresp="#viaf_1573083">Philip Martiny</persName>, a former pupil and assistant of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>. While working with <persName>Martiny</persName>, <persName>Weinman</persName> continued his studies at the
                  Art Students League under <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>. In 1895, after a brief period as assistant to <persName>Olin Levi
                     Warner</persName>, <persName>Weinman</persName> entered Saint-Gaudens' studio, where he worked for several years. He subsequently assisted
                  Charles Niehaus and Daniel Chester French, before setting up his own studio in 1904.</p>

                  executed in 1886. In contrast to Roty's precise, realistic rendering of the wrinkles and hollows of his aging mother's face, however,
                  Weinman's treatment of his mother's features is softer and more generalized.</p>
               <p>In his mature medallic work, <persName>Weinman</persName> moves further away from Roty's pictorialism, favoring instead a more severe,
                  classicizing style, employed also in the architectural relief sculptures for which he is best known. His compositions focus in general on bold
                  figural groups, with little, if any, background detail. His designs for the medals of the American Institute of Architects (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-53">174</ref>
                  </hi>) and the National Institute of Arts and Letters (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-55">176</ref>
                  </hi>), for example, feature classical themes—the Greek artists Polygnotos, Ictinos, and Pheidias appear on the AIA medal and the god Apollo
                  on the NIAL medal—in simple, powerfully delineated compositions.</p>
               <p>Studies from Weinman's collection which came to the ANS after his death show his method of working out the design for a medal. For the United
                  States Medal for Lifesaving on Railroads, <persName>Weinman</persName> began with a two-figure composition (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-52">172</ref>
                  </hi>) showing a rescue in action, but later reduced the design to a single nude figure symbolizing railroad heroism (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-54">173</ref>
                  </hi>), more appropriate to the scale of the piece. In the simplified version, there is still a sense of urgent drama, conveyed primarily by
                  the diagonal posture of the figure and the swirling linear movement of the composition, which beautifully complements the circular shape of
                  the medal. Weinman's mastery of medallic composition and the balance of linear pattern and sculptural form in his work are epitomized in his
                  design for the U.S. "Walking Liberty" half dollar (<hi rend="italic">197</hi>), where he once again uses the elegant, sweeping curves of the
                  drapery folds to create a sense of flowing movement.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Janet Scudder</persName> grew up in <placeName>Terre Haute</placeName>, <placeName>Indiana</placeName>, and first studied
                  sculpture with <persName>Louis Rebisso</persName> at the Cincinnati Art Academy. In 1891 she moved to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>, where she worked briefly as a wood carver and then became one of Lorado Taft's assistants on
                  the sculptures for the World's Columbian Exposition. When the Exposition ended, she went to Paris to study with <persName>Frederick
                     MacMonnies</persName>, whose Columbian fountain she had particularly admired. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, she
                  studied at the Académies Vitti and Colarossi before being admitted to <persName>MacMonnies</persName>' studio as a pupil and assistant.
                  She returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> for a short time in 1896, securing enough commissions
                  to go back to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> and set up her own studio. A trip to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> led her to produce the first of the charming Renaissance- inspired fountain sculptures which were
                  to become <pb n="50"/> her specialty. She lived near <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> for many years, making periodic
                  trips to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> to exhibit and market her works.</p>
               <p>Like many of her contemporaries, Scudder supplemented her income in the early years of her career with commissions for portrait plaquettes and
                  medallions. Her accomplished low relief portraits, with their wealth of decorative detail, beautifully capture the elegant world of her
                  cosmopolitan patrons. Of particular interest are the elaborate decorative frames which she incorporates into the compositions of her portrait
                  plaquettes, such as those of Arthur Middleton Reeves (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-56">187</ref>
                  </hi>) and a Woman with a <placeName corresp="#geonames_1861060">Japan</placeName>ese Fan (<hi rend="italic">191).</hi> The Reeves
                  portrait, illustrated here in an untrimmed cast, is almost overwhelmed by its fanciful medievalizing frame. An exquisitely detailed period
                  frame, draped with tassels, complements the portrait of a fashionable woman holding a <placeName corresp="#geonames_1861060">Japan</placeName>ese fan, a sign of her refined taste.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A century ago, <persName>James Kimball</persName>, director of the <placeName>United States Mint</placeName>, complained that the
                  nation's coinage was inferior in design "to the same kind of work by almost every other advanced nation of the earth." Our coins, he added,
                  were "keenly felt by many as unworthy of the development which the arts of sculpture and design here have attained." In 1891, fortified with
                  Congressional sanction to change any coin design in use for twenty-five years or more, the Treasury organized a public competition for
                  appropriate new designs. The result was by all accounts a fiasco: the jury found none of the 300 proposals suitable for adoption, and only two
                  were deemed worthy of honorable mention. The mint director was unwilling to concede defeat, however, for "the money of a nation is expressive
                  of its art culture....Lest posterity imagine the present generation to have been barbarous, it is desirable that our silver pieces should be
                  as handsome as may be." Though he recognized French coinage as the best currently produced, <persName>Kimball</persName> sought to avoid
                  "foreign" designs by entrusting the renovation of the U.S. coinage to the British-born chief engraver of the Mint, <persName corresp="#viaf_24873594">Charles E. Barber</persName>.</p>
               <p>Barber's designs for the 1892 dime, quarter, and half dollar were competent but almost identical to each other, and they were judged visually
                  unexciting. Two years later, the National Sculpture Society admonished the Secretary of the Treasury to "consider the unsatisfactory coinage
                  of the United States.... The whole body of our numismatic art compares badly with that of any one of the great nations of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>." Not only would artistic coins support "the nation's claim to be a cultivated and enlightened
                  one," but they would also afford regular lessons in artistic design "for the more discriminating members of the populace." Soon the American
                  Numismatic Society joined with the Sculpture Society, as did six additional prestigious organizations, in the battle for new coin designs.</p>
               <p>Neither public outcry nor organized lobbying, however, was sufficient to effect the desired changes. Skilled sculptors with a shared
                  sensibility, a vital advance in technology, and political initiative at the highest level—all would contribute to the issue of the most
                  artistically successful series of coins in this country's history. By 1900 the Beaux-Arts aesthetic had profoundly shaped a generation of
                  sculptors and medalists, foremost among whom was <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>. The Janvier reducing lathe had made it
                  possible for relief sculptors to create coin images without special training in die sinking. And then there was President <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName>.</p>

                  <persName>Roosevelt</persName> had shown his distaste for the style prevailing at the <placeName>U.S. Mint</placeName> by designating
                  Saint- Gaudens to sculpt a special medal for his second inaugural (<hi rend="italic">78).</hi> Not only did the president admire the result,
                  he found a kindred soul in <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> and entrusted to him the project of redesigning the country's circulating
                  coinage. There followed an informal personal correspondence, in which <persName>Roosevelt</persName> joked that his actions could lead to
                  impeachment or fatalities among the Mint staff, and <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> responded that if the mortality rate rose there,
                  it would at least be for a good cause. <persName>Roosevelt</persName> suggested that even if impractical for modern needs, the high
                  relief characteristic of the gold coins of <persName corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</persName> the Great might serve as an
                  ideal for the new issues. Sculptor and president agreed that a compromise—lower-than-ancient relief and raised rims to allow stacking—would be
                  necessary to "avoid too heavy an outbreak in the mercantile classes." The president's suggestions for design elements were also heard
                  sympathetically: the Ptolemaic eagle on his inaugural medal would appear not only on the reverse of Saint-Gaudens's ten-dollar gold piece (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-58">201</ref>
                  </hi>), but also on the Pratt five-dollar and two-and-a-half-dollar gold pieces (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-57">200</ref>
                  </hi> and <hi rend="italic">199</hi>), as well as on de Francisci's 1921 silver Peace Dollar (198). Even <persName>Roosevelt's</persName>
                  idea that an <pb n="52"/> Indian war bonnet should replace Liberty's traditional Phrygian cap was adopted for the ten-dollar coin. This
                  indigenous headdress has often been seen as an incongruous addition to the classical profile of Liberty, derived from the Victory on
                  Saint-Gaudens's Sherman monument and ultimately from Hellenistic sculpture.</p>

               <p>The story of how the 1907 Saint-Gaudens double eagle, or twenty-dollar gold piece, was issued in the face of determined opposition from Chief
                     <persName>Engraver Barber</persName> has been the subject of several detailed accounts. With its obverse of a striding Victory, again
                  related to the Sherman monument, and its flying eagle reverse (adapted from an earlier U.S. one-cent piece), the original high relief version
                  of the coin (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-59">202</ref>
                  </hi>) is generally acknowledged to be the finest numismatic issue in U.S. history. By contrast, the "business strike" issues of 1907 through
                  1933 (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-60">203</ref>
                  </hi>) with their low relief, arabic numerals, and "In God We Trust," suffer from the weakening of the coin's design imposed by Barber's
                  machinations, "mercantile concerns," and Congressional piety. Yet even the faded glory of these regular issues sets standards seldom
                  approached by other coins of the modern era.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' death in late 1907 did not deter <persName>Roosevelt</persName> from his renovation of the
                  coinage. Early in 1908, the President's friend <persName>Dr. W. S. Bigelow</persName> suggested that a new design for the fractional gold
                  coinage be modeled in incuse rather than in the usual raised relief. He recommended <persName>Bela Lyon Pratt</persName>, a former
                  student of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, for the job. With Roosevelt's enthusiastic approval of the models, and despite some
                  inevitable tampering by <persName>Barber</persName>, the new half eagle (<hi rend="italic">200</hi>) and quarter eagle (199) were issued
                  with no advance public notice. Essentially identical, these coins carry on their reverse an intaglio version of Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle.
                  The obverses feature the head of a rugged Indian chief in war bonnet. Symbolic representations of the New World and Liberty had long utilized
                  Native Americans, but usually in an idealized manner. Pratt's naturalistic treatment of the Indian marked an important advance in the
                  presentation of authentic Americana on the nation's coinage.</p>
               <p>Before he left office in 1909, <persName>Roosevelt</persName> effected the redesign of the one-cent piece, a commission <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> had been unable to complete before his death. While the president was posing for the Panama Canal Service
                  Medal (133), <persName>Victor Brenner</persName> offered to prepare a coin design featuring a portrait of <persName>Lincoln</persName>. The idea of portraying a real person, especially a president, instead of ideal types on a circulating coin must have been
                  particularly appealing to <persName>Roosevelt</persName>. The centenary of <persName>Lincoln's</persName> birth was at hand, and
                     <persName>Brenner</persName> had ready for inspection the model of the <persName>Lincoln</persName> plaquette (136) he had just
                  completed. Daily familiarity with the U.S. cent's current appearance makes it difficult for us to appreciate <persName>Brenner's</persName> subtle and effective modeling (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-61">193</ref>
                  </hi>). His early training as a die engraver enabled him to add to the master die details which contribute to the impressionistic play of
                  light on <persName>Lincoln's</persName> hair, cheekbone, and beard.</p>
               <p>The momentum for the redesign of the coinage built up in <persName>Roosevelt's</persName> second term carried into the administrations of
                     <persName>Taft</persName> and <persName>Wilson</persName>. The five-cent piece was the only coin eligible for retirement under
                  the twenty-five year rule when new designs were solicited in 1911. The commission again went outside the Mint, to <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName>, a French trained sculptor who had worked with Saint-Gaudens. Fraser's "buffalo" or
                  "Indian head" nickel (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-62">194</ref>
                  </hi>) represents the high point of the use of indigenous themes, handled in a realistic manner, in American coin design. The "buffalo,"
                  actually a bison, was modeled from life (albeit in a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> zoo), and the
                  Indian was a composite portrait drawn from three members of different tribes. The bison's hump and lowered head are configured to the round of
                  the tondo, as are the individual feathers at the back of the Indian's head. The powerful simplicity of the obverse is enhanced by the small
                  numerals and lettering and by the omission of the usual invocation of the Deity. Later issues slightly modified the exergue of the reverse,
                  but the coin retained its artistic integrity to its final year of issue in 1938.</p>

               <p>In 1916 the <persName>Barber</persName> dime, quarter, and half dollar reached the end of their twenty-five year mandate. Working closely
                  with the Commission of Fine Arts, the Mint invited a large number of prominent artists, including <persName>Barber</persName> and his
                  assistant <persName>George Morgan</persName>, to submit sketches for new designs. The Commission supported Treasury Secretary MacAdoo's
                  decision to award contracts for the dime and half dollar to <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph A. Weinman</persName> and for the
                  quarter to <persName>Hermon MacNeil</persName>.</p>
               <p>The designs of <persName>Weinman</persName>, who was trained by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> and influenced by <persName>Roty</persName>, exemplify the adaptation of the Beaux-Arts style to <placeName>United States</placeName> coinage. The obverse
                  Liberty with winged cap—misidentified as Mercury by much of the public—and the fasces on the reverse of his dime (195) have been seen as
                  containing specific references to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, the object of much American concern in 1916.
                  Weinman's half dollar (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-64">197</ref>
                  </hi>) conveys a similar message in larger format. The "Walking Liberty" of the obverse recalls Roty's "Semeuse" or "Sower" design on the
                  French two- franc piece, but she is wrapped in an American flag; the reverse features a standing eagle, similar to the noble birds of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Hermon MacNeil's</persName> "Liberty Standing" quarter of 1916 (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-63">196</ref>
                  </hi>) also reflects a mood favoring American intervention in the World War on behalf of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. <persName>MacNeil's</persName> design for the obverse of the quarter is based on the obverse of Brenner's 1909 medal
                  for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> Art Institute (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-44">138</ref>
                  </hi>), which had in turn been modeled on similar compositions by Roty. The palette and brushes of Brenner's female personification have been
                  replaced with patriotic iconography, and the classical parapet is now decorated with thirteen stars and bears the motto "In God We Trust."
                  Liberty's militant stance is somewhat balanced by the olive branches in her right hand and the soft draperies which leave her right breast
                  exposed. In 1917, as the nation prepared for war, Secretary MacAdoo insisted that this Liberty be girded with chain mail, concealing the
                  breast that had sparked public outcry.</p>
               <p>Today, sentiment has been voiced for a redesign of our circulating coinage. To find sculptors of the calibre of those who reshaped the
                  American coinage between 1907 and 1921 will, indeed, be a major challenge.</p>

               </head>
               <p>By the turn of the century, Mint engraver <persName corresp="#viaf_24873594">Charles E. Barber</persName> and his assistant <persName corresp="#viaf_305856677">George T. Morgan</persName> (1845-1925) were producing medals in an updated, French inspired style. An
                  Englishman like the <persName>Barbers</persName>, <persName>Morgan</persName> had studied at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName> and <placeName>South Kensington</placeName> art schools and worked in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> before immigrating to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in the 1870s.
                  Appointed a "special engraver" by the <placeName>U.S. Mint</placeName> in 1876 to redesign the silver dollar, <persName>Morgan</persName> became assistant engraver in 1879 and chief engraver after <persName>Charles Barber's</persName> death in 1917.</p>
               <p>A comparison of Barber's portrait of <persName>Benjamin Harrison</persName> for the 1889 inaugural medal (<hi rend="italic">65</hi>) and
                  his medallic portraits of <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName> (206-208 and <hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-65">209</ref>
                  </hi>) evidences his change from working in high relief to modeling in the soft, low relief style developed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. On the <persName>Roosevelt</persName> medals, thin, modem lettering replaces the heavy,
                  Gothic inscriptions used for the <persName>Harrison</persName> medal. While Cornelius <persName>Vermeule</persName> has argued that
                     <persName>Barber's</persName> portraits of <persName>Roosevelt</persName>, with their careful attention to the details of the
                  president's attire and facial features, "perfectly, incisively characterize" the leader "whose watchword was action," <persName>Roosevelt</persName> himself was so displeased with the medal produced by <persName>Barber</persName> and <persName>Morgan</persName> for his second inauguration in 1905 (207) that he asked <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> to create an
                  alternate inaugural medal (<hi rend="italic">78</hi>). <persName>Saint- Gaudens</persName>' <persName>Roosevelt</persName> inaugural
                  medal may be more aesthetically interesting than the official Mint medal, but the sculptor's idealized portrait of the president is less
                  effective than Barber's straightforward bust.</p>
               <pb n="55"/>

               <p>
                  <persName>Roosevelt</persName> had more reason to complain about a 1907 medal designed by <persName>Barber</persName> and <persName>Morgan</persName> to commemorate the departure of the <placeName>U.S. Atlantic</placeName> fleet from Hampton Roads (<hi rend="italic">209</hi>). While the Hampton Roads medal is innovative for the Mint in its use of an irregular plaquette format, the obverse
                  of this piece bears a portrait of <persName>Roosevelt</persName> only slightly varied from that which had appeared on official medals
                  since his 1901 inauguration. Morgan's design for the reverse of the Hampton Roads medal closely recalls Chaplain's reverse for his 1893 medal
                  commemorating the visit of the Russian fleet to Toulon (<hi rend="italic">11</hi>). The similarity of the compositions and the nearly
                  identical stance of the allegorical figure, who represents on the one hand Liberty or Columbia and on the other <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, prove that the medal by Chaplain served as the direct model for Morgan's design. In comparison
                  with Chaplain's restrained classicism, Morgan's trite handling of the figure and drapery and his addition of a superfluous cherub to the
                  composition suggest that at least some of the criticisms of <persName>Barber</persName> and <persName>Morgan's</persName> medallic
                  art were warranted.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Frederick MacMonnies</persName> was born in <placeName>Brooklyn</placeName> and began his career as an apprentice in <persName>Saint- Gaudens</persName>' <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> studio at the age of
                  seventeen, studying drawing in night classes at the Cooper Union and National Academy of Design. At the encouragement of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, he went to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1884 for further studies, first at the
                  Académie Colarossi and later at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts with Mercié and Falguière, who employed him as an assistant. By 1889 he had
                  established his own studio in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, where he created his sensational centerpiece for the
                  World's Columbian Exposition, the colossal fountain sculpture known as <hi rend="italic">The Barge of State</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Triumph
                     of Columbia</hi>, which brought him instant fame. <persName>MacMonnies</persName> lived in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> until 1915, when he returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Although MacMonnies executed only a few medallic works, he merits consideration as the American sculptor who most thoroughly absorbed the
                  decorative French style. Bemoaning the fact that the sculptor did not consider medallic art more worthy of his attention, the French critic
                  Roger Marx remarked on the "originality" and "artistic excellence" of the few medals exhibited by <persName>MacMonnies</persName> at the
                  1900 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Exposition. His Niagara medal (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-67">213</ref>
                  </hi>), engraved in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> by Tasset, depicts an American Indian, a favorite subject of
                  American sculptors at this time. In contrast to <persName>MacNeil's</persName> (<hi rend="italic">106</hi>) or Fraser's (<hi rend="italic">194</hi>) more closely observed Indian figures, MacMonnies' Indian is an elegant nude in the French tradition, set within a
                  lively, decorative composition.</p>

                  portrait reliefs, this piece, with its lively, textured surface, has the feeling of a quick sketch, catching the subject in an intimate

               </head>
               <p>
                  <persName>Bela Lyon Pratt</persName> grew up in Norwich, Connecticut, and entered the Yale School of Fine Arts at the age of sixteen. In
                  1887 he went to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> to study at the Art Students League with Augustus
                  Saint-Gaudens and the painters <persName>Kenyon Cox</persName> and <persName>William Merritt Chase</persName>. Pratt worked as an
                  assistant in the Saint-Gaudens studio for a short time before going to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1890. In
                  Paris he studied with Falguière at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and worked also with <persName>Henri Chapu</persName>. After his return to
                  the United States, he worked on the sculpture for the World's Columbian Exposition and moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, where he taught modeling for many years at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.</p>
               <p>Although Pratt's medals were only a very small part of his total sculptural output, his medallic work seems to have brought him great personal
                  satisfaction. His granddaughter, <persName>Cynthia Kennedy Sam</persName>, who is preparing a monograph on the sculptor, notes that Pratt
                  often sculpted his medals during vacations or in his spare time, sometimes sketching them in a "white heat" of creativity, in his own words.
                  The creation of a medal to commemorate the bicentennial of his alma mater, Yale University (217), was for Pratt a special labor of love.</p>
               <p>His <persName>Henry Wadsworth</persName> Longfellow medal for the Cambridge Historical Society (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-68">218</ref>
                  </hi>) and his New Theatre medal for the ANS (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-69">220</ref>
                  </hi>) illustrate an original feature of a number of Pratt's medals, the use of a foliate wreath to frame the composition. Not only does the
                  carefully detailed border add decorative interest to the piece, but its repetition on both obverse and reverse unifies the two sides of the
                  medal. The softly modeled head of Longfellow is very much in the Beaux-Arts tradition, while the medal commemorating the opening of the New
                  Theatre in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, with its highly decorative figural compositions and
                  sinuous line, perfectly captures the spirit of the Gilded Age. This medal may in fact best be seen as a miniature version of Pratt's
                  architectural reliefs, such as his medallions of the Seasons for the Library of Congress or his decorative friezes for the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Opera House, which are closely comparable in style. Interesting use is made of the ornamental
                  wreath on the obverse of the New Theatre medal, where the sensuous nude figure holding a mirror rests her foot on the frame, as if she is
                  about to stand up and step out of the picture.</p>

                  <persName>Herbert Adams</persName> was born in West Concord, Vermont, and studied at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Normal School of Art in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. From 1885 to 1890 he was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, where he studied and worked as an assistant in the atelier of Mercié at the Ecole des
                  Beaux-Arts. On his return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, he taught for a number of years at the Pratt
                  Institute in Brooklyn and established a studio in Cornish, New Hampshire. Best known for his softly carved marble busts of women, Adams also
                  created delicate bas-relief portraits in marble and bronze (221), inspired by the portrait reliefs of his Cornish neighbor <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>. Later in his career he designed a number of medals which are unexceptional in design, but worthy of note
                  for their refined low relief modeling.</p>

               <p>Born in <placeName>Braceville</placeName>, <persName>Ohio</persName>, <persName>Frances Grimes</persName> studied with <persName>Herbert Adams</persName> at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and worked from 1894 until 1900 as his assistant in his Cornish, New
                  Hampshire, studio. In 1900, she became an assistant in the neighboring <pb n="59"/>
                  <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> studio, where she was employed until the sculptor's death in 1907.</p>
               <p>Following the example of <persName>Adams</persName> and <persName>Saint- Gaudens</persName>, Grimes sculpted a number of portrait
                  reliefs of Cornish neighbors and their children. Her charming portraits of children, for example the relief of <persName>Harold Tripp
                     Clement</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-70">225</ref>

A more inventive work by <persName>Grimes</persName> is the beautiful decorative plaque of the goddess Diana (226), poetically inscribed in Greek. The lyrical nude
                  figure in an imaginary landscape is close in spirit to late nineteenth-century French pieces of this type by followers of Roty.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A native New Yorker, <persName>Henry Hering</persName> studied at the Cooper Union and Art Students League. He also worked with the
                  sculptor <persName corresp="#viaf_1573083">Philip Martiny</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> for six years before traveling to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> for further study at the Académie
                  Colarossi and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1900 <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> hired <persName>Hering</persName> as a studio
                  assistant, and he worked at Cornish until the master's death in 1907.</p>
               <p>Hering's most important contribution to <placeName>American</placeName> medallic art was his modeling of <persName>Saint-
                     Gaudens</persName>' designs for the U.S. ten and twenty-dollar gold pieces, which he discussed in a 1949 article in <hi rend="italic">The
                     Numismatist.</hi> Due to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' illness, it was <persName>Hering</persName> who played the role of
                  go-between in the dispute with the Mint over the striking of the coins. In the tradition of the "Saint-Gaudens School," he also produced some
                  portrait plaques and medallions in low relief (227 and 228). With their clearly delineated forms and smooth surfaces, these portrait reliefs
                  illustrate the relatively strong idealistic tendency of Hering's sculpture in comparison with the more naturalistic direction of work by other
                     <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> students.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName> was born in <placeName>Winona</placeName>, <placeName>Minnesota</placeName>, and grew up in the frontier Dakota Territory. After high school he moved to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> and entered the studio of the sculptor <persName>Richard Bock</persName>. He studied at the
                  Art Institute of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> for a short <pb n="60"/> time, and at age nineteen went to
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, where he studied with Falguière at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and also attended
                  classes at the Académies Julian and Colarossi. Impressed with Fraser's work at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>
                  Salon of 1898, <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> invited the younger sculptor to become one of his assistants. <persName>Fraser</persName> worked with <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> for two years in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> and returned with him to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in 1900 to assist him in his New
                  Hampshire studio. In 1902 <persName>Fraser</persName> established his own studio in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, and from 1906 until 1911 he taught at the Art Students League.</p>

               <p>While <persName>Fraser</persName> was still working with <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, he was invited by the commissioners of
                  the Pan-American Exposition to create a special medal honoring the outstanding exhibition of works by his mentor at the Buffalo Exposition.
                  Fraser's striking design for the obverse of the Saint-Gaudens medal (<hi rend="italic">107</hi>), with its noble portrait bust of the
                  sculptor, is based on the Quattrocentro composition used by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> a few years earlier for his <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</persName> medal (77). The reverse of the Saint-Gaudens medal features a classicizing
                  allegory of sculpture, represented by a heroic male nude holding a hammer and chisel and Pegasus, a symbol of the Muses' inspiration. The
                  motif of the winged horse is repeated by <persName>Fraser</persName> in a number of his other medallic compositions, both for its
                  symbolic value and for visual effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Fraser's</persName> debt to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> is also apparent in his relief portraits, which met with
                  great success. A portrait plaque of the children of <persName>Harry Payne Whitney</persName> on horseback (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-71">229</ref>
                  </hi>) shares the delicate low relief modeling of Saint-Gaudens' portrait reliefs, but the gentle texturing of the surface and the early
                  Renaissance restraint of the piece mark it as Fraser's work. His most famous portrait is that of <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName>,
                  first sculpted as a bust in 1909/10 and later adapted for a cast relief (238) and the Medal of Honor of the <persName>Roosevelt</persName> Memorial Association (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-72">237</ref>
                  </hi>). The forthright realism of Fraser's portrait of Roosevelt, which vividly captures his subject's personality, marks a departure from
                  Saint-Gaudens' more idealized portrayal of the president (<hi rend="italic">78),</hi> although the same Italian Renaissance models inform both
                  artists' work.</p>
               <p>Fraser's finest medal, the Harriman Memorial medal of the American Museum of Safety (<hi rend="italic">233),</hi> illustrates his ability to
                  blend successfully contemporary realism and Renaissance tradition. Once again he employs the Quattrocento format of a bust portrait surrounded
                  by simple lettering for the obverse, while on the reverse he depicts a track walker in contemporary garb striding along the rails. The realism
                  of this treatment of the theme of railroad safety contrasts sharply with Weinman's symbolic representation of the same subject on the U.S.
                  Lifesaving medal (<hi rend="italic">173</hi>). Fraser's textured modeling of the reverse of the Harriman medal, also used very effectively in
                  his portraits of Roosevelt, adds to the vigour of the towering figure, which is barely contained within the space of the tondo.</p>

               <p>A native of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>, <persName>Chester Beach</persName> studied
                  architectural modeling at the Lick Polytechnic School and drawing at the Mark Hopkins Institute there before leaving for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1904. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, he studied with the sculptors
                  Verlet and Roland at the Académie Julian. Upon his return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in 1907, he
                  established a studio in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, where he remained, with the exception of a
                  year spent in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> in 1911.</p>
               <p>Beach's designs for the reverse of the official badge for the 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration (<hi rend="italic">100</hi>) and his medal for
                  the School Art League of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-73">242</ref>
                  </hi>) are very similar in conception, sharing the "low relief planes," the elegant female personifications, and "the love of geography and
                  vistas"—here the dramatic backdrop of the Hudson River and the skyline of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName>—characteristic of his art (Vermeule). With their wispy figures and sinuous line, his works evoke the spirit of turn-of-
                  the-century Vienna, and he in fact employs decorative <hi rend="italic">art nouveau</hi> letter forms, comparable to those used by <persName>Heinrich Kautsch</persName> (<hi rend="italic">266</hi>). While it is true that Beach's style lends itself at times to
                  affectation, as Vermeule contends, the best of his medals, such as the School Art League piece, are imaginative and charming.</p>

                     <persName>Daniel Chester</persName> French (1850-1931)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Born in Exeter, <persName>New Hampshire</persName>, <persName>Daniel Chester</persName> French moved with his family to Concord,
                     <persName>Massachusetts</persName>, at the age of seventeen. There he took his first art classes with Abigail May Alcott and taught
                  himself modeling. In 1870 he worked for a short time with sculptor <persName>John Quincy Adams Ward</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, and in 1871 and 1872 he studied, also briefly, with <persName>William
                     Rimmer</persName> and <persName>William Morris</persName>
                  <persName>Hunt</persName> in <persName>Boston</persName>. Two years later he left for <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, where he worked in the Florence studio of expatriate sculptor <persName>Thomas Ball</persName>. After his return to
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in 1876, French worked in both <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> as an architectural sculptor. In 1886 he went again to
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, this time to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> to
                  perfect his modeling technique. On his return to the United States, he settled in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName>, embarking on a long and extremely successful career, which brought him many honors.</p>
               <p>Primarily known as a sculptor of ideal monuments, <placeName>French</placeName> created only a few medals, and most of these were executed
                  late in his career, with the help of assistants. His finest medals were all produced in association with the <placeName>American</placeName> Numismatic Society (<hi rend="italic">245, 317</hi>, and 327), of which he was a member. The only cast medal ever issued
                  by the ANS, <placeName>French</placeName>'s 1917 medal commemorating the completion of the Catskill Aqueduct (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-74">245</ref>
                  </hi>) shares the classical vocabulary and boldly defined, yet fluidly modeled, form of his monumental sculptures. The beautiful, ideal head
                  and beaded border of the obverse of this medal recall the masterpieces of Greek numismatic art. An equally beautiful, lyrical head of Victory,
                  modeled in more delicate, low relief, graces the obverse designed by <placeName>French</placeName> for the ANS medal commemorating the
                  visit of the <placeName>French</placeName> and <placeName>British</placeName> War Commissions to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in 1917 (<hi rend="italic">317</hi>). The trench helmet with a sprig of oak, a lily,
                  and a cluster of pine needles bound to it as emblems of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and the <placeName>United States</placeName> eloquently symbolizes the meeting of the Allies,
                  which is represented also in allegorical form on the reverse created for this medal by sculptor Evelyn <persName>B. Longman</persName>
                  (1874-1954), a former assistant in <placeName>French</placeName>'s studio. Longman's design is executed in a more stylized, archaizing
                  manner, befitting the medieval figures of Joan of Arc and a knight, who personify France and England seeking the aid of <placeName>American</placeName> Liberty.</p>

                     <persName>John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum</persName> (1867-1941)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The son of an immigrant <persName>Danish woodcarver</persName>, <persName>Gutzon Borglum</persName> was born near Bear Lake, Idaho,
                  and grew up in <persName>Nebraska</persName>. He attended St. Mary's College near Topeka, Kansas, and then went in the early 1880s to Los
                  Angeles, where he was apprenticed to a lithographer and fresco painter. Before going to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1890, he studied painting at the Mark Hopkins Art Institute in <persName>San Francisco</persName>. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, he studied painting with Lefebvre and Constant and sculpture with Mercié at the
                  Académie Julian. He was most impressed, however, by the sculpture of Rodin. After several periods of travel in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, Borglum established a studio in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> in 1902. His talent was quickly recognized when he exhibited at the <persName>St. Louis</persName> World's Fair in 1904,
                  and, although he taught for a short time at the Art Students League in 1906-7, his life was soon consumed by the giant sculptural projects
                  which he undertook at Stone Mountain and Mount Rushmore.</p>
               <p>Best remembered for his carvings on mountains, the sculptor who felt that "only the colossal matched the spirit of the <placeName>United States</placeName>" nevertheless did not overlook the art of the medal. <pb n="64"/>
                  <persName>Borglum's</persName> member's medal for the American Numismatic Society (<hi rend="italic">248</hi>) makes an interesting
                  comparison with <placeName>French</placeName>'s Catskill Aqueduct medal (<hi rend="italic">245</hi>). The realistic nude figure depicted on
                  the obverse of the member's medal is in sharp contrast to the ideal, athletic youth represented on the reverse of the Catskill Aqueduct medal.
                     <persName>Borglum</persName>'s handling of the figure, who turns with ease in the shallow space established by the rim of the medal to
                  give a view of the medallion which he holds out in front of him, is masterful. The combination of simple naturalism and bravura modeling in
                  this piece is reminiscent of Charpentier, the <placeName>French</placeName> medalist strongly influenced by Rodin, whom Borglum is known to
                  have admired. Even closer to certain works by Charpentier is the image on the obverse of <persName>Borglum</persName>'s Livingstone
                  Centenary Medal for the American Geographical Society (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-75">251</ref>
                  </hi>), which shows a wraith-like female figure, the Genius of the mountains, swirling through a rocky gorge in a cloud of vapor. Only a few
                  gouged lines aid in defining the forms that emerge from the freely modeled surface of the extremely low relief.</p>

               <p>The International Exhibition of Medallic Art held by the American Numismatic Society in March 1910 presented the American public with an
                  unprecedented opportunity to view about 2,400 medals by over 190 of the leading European and American medalists of the day. During its three
                  week run, the Exhibition attracted a remarkable number of visitors, and it received favorable notice in the local press. A. Piatt Andrew, the
                  Director of the <placeName>U.S. Mint</placeName>, wrote that "As an exhibition of modern medals it was unique in its variety and
                  completeness, and as an indication of the awakening of American appreciation in a field of art hitherto neglected it was equally
                  significant."</p>
               <p>Among the artists singled out by Andrew for comment were the <placeName>French</placeName> medalists <persName>Chaplain</persName> and
                     <persName>Roty</persName>, the Austrians <persName>Marschall</persName> and <persName>Kautsch</persName>, the Belgian
                  Devreese and the English engraver Spicer- Simson. In general, the reviews of the Exhibition focused more on the achievements of the European
                  medalists than on the work of their American counterparts. It is significant in this respect that the Committee of Award for the Exhibition,
                  which included <placeName>American</placeName> sculptors Herbert <persName>Adams</persName>, <persName>Daniel Chester</persName>
                  <placeName>French</placeName> and <persName>Hermon MacNeil</persName>, selected Belgian medalist Godefroid Devreese as Commemorative
                  Medalist for 1910, "for having presented the most successful exhibit." As the recipient of this honor, Devreese was commissioned to produce a
                  commemorative medal for the Exhibition, accompanied by a stipend of three thousand dollars. The resulting design was so disappointing that
                  only three examples of the piece were ever struck (<hi rend="italic">253).</hi> Using the rectangular plaquette format, Devreese created for
                  the two sides of the medal a pair of banal allegorical compositions in the <placeName>French</placeName> manner, which have little to do
                  with the subject matter of the Exhibition. The obverse of the medal depicts a female personification of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, who holds up a laurel branch and the U.S. flag and stands on a globe, facing a nude male figure
                  reclining on a bank of clouds, carrying a lyre, symbolic of the arts. On the reverse, a female figure representing Liberty appears, rushing in
                  on the back of an eagle which flies through a bank of clouds.</p>

                     <persName>Godefroid Devreese</persName> (1861-1941)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Born at <persName>Courtrai</persName>, <persName>Belgium</persName>, <persName>Godefroid Devreese</persName> was trained as a
                  sculptor from an early age in the studio of his father, the sculptor Constant <persName>Devreese</persName>. In 1881 he went to Brussels
                  to study at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts with the sculptors Eugène Simonis and <persName>Charles van der Stappen</persName>, a
                  friend of <persName>Roty</persName>. Devreese was awarded many honors and important commissions for medals and coins in his native
                  country, and his work was also popular in this country, as witnessed by the articles on him which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>American</placeName> Journal of Numismatics</hi> in 1908 and 1910 and by his selection as Commemorative Medalist of the 1910
                  International Medallic Exhibition.</p>
               <p>Devreese's medals and plaquettes are eclectic in style, drawing on both native traditions of the Low Countries and contemporary <placeName>French</placeName> medallic art as sources. His 1902 medal for the Association Belge de Photographie (254) and the 1906 plaquette
                  L'aïeule (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-76">257</ref>
                  </hi>), as well as a number of his other works, depict scenes of everyday life, inspired by the Flemish tradition of genre painting. The
                  touching image of an old woman peeling a potato in front of a hearth on the 1906 piece recalls similar compositions in seventeenth-century
                  paintings, both in the humble treatment of the theme and in its soft, painterly style, which shows the influence of Roty. Other medals by
                  Devreese, for example his 1905 plaquette commemorating the architect <persName>Henri <pb n="66"/> Beyaert</persName> (256) and his
                  commemorative plaquette for the 1910 International Medallic Exhibition (<hi rend="italic">253),</hi> are executed in a more decorative,
                  academic style. Both of these pieces feature classicizing allegorical compositions, comparable to the standard <placeName>French</placeName> work of the period, with much attention given to the modeling of the elaborate draperies that cling to the bodies of the
                  figures.</p>

                     <persName>Heinrich Kautsch</persName> (1859-1943)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The son of a Prague goldsmith, <persName>Heinrich Kautsch</persName> studied at the Imperial Schools of Decorative Arts in Prague and
                  Vienna. After travels in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, he returned in 1882 to Prague, where he became a
                  professor at the Imperial School of Decorative Arts. In 1889 he settled in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, and he
                  worked there for the rest of his life. A highly regarded medalist and sculptor, Kautsch served as a member of the Jury of Fine Arts at the
                  1893 Chicago World's Fair and as Vice- President of the Jury at the 1900 Paris Exposition. His work was awarded gold medals at the Universal
                  Expositions in <persName>St. Louis</persName> in 1904 and Liège in 1905.</p>
               <p>Kautsch's medals reveal an imaginative decorative sensibility, shaped by contact with the Austrian <hi rend="italic">art nouveau</hi>
                  movement, known as the Vienna Secession. In works such as his medals of the German poet Heinrich Heine (263) and the Munich painter Franz von
                  Lenbach (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-77">266</ref>
                  </hi>), Kautsch revitalizes the <placeName>French</placeName> allegorical idiom through his expressive modeling and use of artistic
                  lettering in the Vienna Secession style. His vigorous portrait of <pb n="67"/> Lenbach is rich in texture and pictorial detail. The reverse of
                  the Lenbach medal reworks an allegorical composition with antecedents in the oeuvre of <persName>Roty</persName>, which shows a female
                  figure representing Painting seated in an attitude of reverie before a distant view of the artist's home town. Beside the unmistakably
                  Viennese forms of the lettering in the inscription, Kautsch's clever treatment of the composition, constructed from an intriguing series of
                  overlapping planes, and his sensuous modeling distinguish his work from that of <persName>Roty</persName>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <persName>Anton Scharff</persName> was born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</placeName>, where his father was a
                  medalist at the Imperial and Royal Mint and an engraver of fine stones. In 1860, Scharff entered the Imperial School of Decorative Arts to
                  study engraving, and in 1862 he was accepted to the Graveurakademie des Hauptmunzamtes, the "Academy of Engraving" attached to the Vienna
                  Mint. He also studied modeling at the Akademie <pb n="68"/> der bildenden Kunste in Vienna. In 1866 he became an assistant engraver at the
                  Imperial and Royal Mint, two years later he was promoted to the position of engraver, and in 1881 he was named director of the
                  Graveurakademie. The culmination of Scharff's successful career at the Vienna Mint came in 1887, when the title <hi rend="italic">k. und k.
                     Kammer- medailleur</hi>, "Court Medalist," was bestowed on him. A very prolific medalist, Scharff was the recipient of many awards and
                  honors, including the Grand Prize at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Exposition in 1900.</p>
               <p>The sensitively modeled portrait of a Vienna laundry maid which Scharff first issued in 1878 as a medallion (269) established him as an artist
                  in his own right. This popular genre piece was later reissued as a small, struck medal by the Austrian Society for the Promotion of Medallic
                  Art. As <persName>Mark Jones</persName> has observed, Scharff's "fluent talent" brought him international recognition, and he was called
                  upon to execute numerous medals for patrons in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, including <persName corresp="#viaf_95738652">Queen Victoria</persName>. The medals
                  commissioned from him by American patrons (270-71, <hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-78">272</ref>
                  </hi>, and 273) feature carefully observed portraits and tasteful allegorical compositions, modeled in a lively manner that saves them from
                  banality. For example, his medal commemorating the first American statue of Gutenberg (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-78">272</ref>
                  </hi>), erected in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> by <persName>Robert Hoe</persName> in 1899,
                  is impressive for its rippling surfaces and exquisite handling of the textures of the printer's costume and beard. As this piece testifies,
                  the turn- of-the-century developments in Viennese art that influenced Kautsch's style had no impact on Scharff's work, although he was in
                  closer proximity to them.</p>

               <p>Born at <persName>Le Havre</persName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, to English parents, <persName corresp="#viaf_26629119">Theodore Spicer-Simson</persName> began his art studies in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>
                  and then went to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, where he lived for many years. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, he enrolled first at the Ecole des Arts Décoratifs and later studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts
                  with the sculptor Jean-Auguste Dampt. From 1896 on, Spicer-Simson regularly exhibited his softly modeled portrait busts at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Salons and the Royal Academy in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>. He also pursued a strong interest in the decorative arts, designing book illustrations in the manner of Aubrey Beardsley
                  (whose works he avidly collected) and working for Gorham &amp; Co. in the <placeName>United States</placeName> at some time before
                  1903.</p>
               <p>In 1903 <persName>Spicer-Simson</persName> began making cast portrait medallions, strongly reminiscent of the medals of the early
                  Renaissance masters. One of the finest of his early medals, the medallion of artist <persName>George Frederick Watts</persName> executed
                  in 1904 (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-79">274</ref>
                  </hi>), was highly acclaimed for its bold Quattrocento conception and dignified, realistic likeness of the <placeName>British</placeName>
                  painter. With its simple, cast surfaces and unelaborated composition, this piece more closely imitates the works of Pisanello and his
                  followers than do the portrait medals by <placeName>American</placeName> sculptors (<hi rend="italic">77</hi> and <hi rend="italic">233</hi>, for example) based on the same models. In later portrait medals produced by the galvano technique, such as his 1911 medallion of
                  Adra Newell (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-80">278</ref>
                  </hi>), Spicer-Simson transforms his Renaissance sources by employing a more refined, decorative style, in the spirit of the English Aesthetic
                  Movement. The portrait of Mrs. Newell is delicately modeled in extremely low relief, creating an elegant, almost precious, effect. In the
                  years before the First World War, <persName>Spicer-Simson</persName> visited this country regularly, and after 1915 he settled
                  permanently in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, although he maintained his <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> studio.</p>

                     <persName>Emil Fuchs</persName> (1866-1929)</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <persName>Emil Fuchs</persName> was born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</placeName>, where he studied sculpture at
                  the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. He later attended the Royal Academy in Berlin and received a traveling scholarship for study in Italy.
                  Fuchs worked in Rome from 1891 until 1897, when he went to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> at the behest of English
                  patrons. His marble busts and small portrait medals, which could be worn as jewelry or inserted in portable objects to be given as presents,
                  became fashionable with the English aristocracy. Taking a fancy to an ashtray with one of Fuchs' medals in it which he had received as a gift,
                  the Prince of Wales developed an interest in the artist's work and initiated a series of commissions by the Royal Family. Under the tutelage
                  of <persName>John</persName> Singer Sargent, Fuchs also took up oil painting and became a prolific portrait painter. After 1905, he began
                  to spend extended periods in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, where he was in demand as a
                  portraitist, and he later became a permanent resident of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-81">

               </figure>
               <p>His bust of Queen <persName>Victoria</persName> for the medal which she commissioned to celebrate the extension of her reign into the
                  twentieth century (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-81">285</ref>
                  </hi>) exemplifies Fuchs' soft, flattering style of portraiture. The delicate allegorical design on the reverse of this medal is also typical
                  of his work. In his autobiography, the artist describes this reverse, which shows an angel carrying the name of the Queen around the world, as
                  "a painting in light and shade." Fuchs achieves the desired painterly effect by modeling the composition in the lowest possible relief,
                  blurring the edges of forms so that only the light glancing across the surface of the medal defines the image.</p>
               <p>It is clear from his medals, as well as from his autobiography, that Fuchs admired the international elite whom he made a career of
                  portraying. His plaquette memorializing <persName>J. P. Morgan</persName> (292) is an elegant panegyric to one of the wealthy men whom he
                  described as "mile-stones in America's existence." A similar plaquette honoring metallurgist <persName>Robert Woolston Hunt</persName>
                     (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-82">294</ref>
                  </hi>) is of interest for the depiction of a steel mill on its reverse. While this image of workers and machinery should present a sharp
                  contrast to the classicizing composition of the obverse, which features a pair of allegorical figures <pb n="71"/> flanking a clipeate bust of
                  Hunt, the artist's soft- edged style blurs the distinction between reality and ideality. Nevertheless, in comparison with the formality of the
                  obverse, the reverse does have a more lively, sketchy quality, created by the subtle texturing of the surface and the use of incised lines to
                  pick out certain details of the scene.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A native of Nantes, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, <persName>J. Edouard Roiné</persName> studied with the
                  local artist Chantron before going to Paris in 1877 to work with the sculptor Morice. In 1886 he moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, where he worked primarily as a sculptor of architectural ornament and taught
                  modeling at the Trade Mechanical School. He returned often to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, exhibiting his
                  sculptures and medals yearly at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Salons from 1895 to 1904 and receiving a gold
                  medal for his work at the 1900 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Exposition.</p>
               <p>The allegorical figure-compositions of Roiné's medals are very much in the <placeName>French</placeName> academic mold. As Alan Stahl has
                  noted, the juxtaposition of classical and contemporary elements in Roiné's design for the medal of the <persName>Joseph K.
                     Davison</persName> company (<hi rend="italic">296</hi>), which features partially draped, nude figures operating the die cutting and reducing
                  machines used by the firm, follows a precedent established by Roty. Roiné's debt to Roty is also evident in the rectangular format and
                  soft-edged modeling of his Grover Cleveland commemorative medal (<hi rend="italic">302),</hi> commissioned by the ANS. The overabundance of
                  decorative detail and the awkward anatomy of the figures on the Cleveland medal detract from the effectiveness of the design and indicate some
                  of the weaknesses of this style of medallic art.</p>

                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>. <persName>Mowbray-Clarke</persName> came to the <placeName>United
                     States</placeName> in 1896 and worked for two years with the sculptor <persName>J. Massey Rhind</persName>, before establishing his own

               <pb n="74"/>
               <p>Although <persName>Mowbray-Clarke's</persName> medals are generally unexceptional, he was the only artist twice selected to design medals
                  for the series issued by the Circle of Friends of the Medallion between 1909 and 1915 (311 and <hi rend="italic">312</hi>). The American
                  equivalent of the French, Belgian and Austrian organizations dedicated to the promotion of medallic art, the Circle of Friends sponsored the
                  production of a dozen medals, which were issued in distinctive book-shaped holders with a text discussing the artist and the subject of the
                  piece. <persName>Mowbray-Clarke's</persName> 1914 medal for the Circle of Friends, commemorating one hundred years of peace between <placeName>Britain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-84">312</ref>
                  </hi>)—an appropriate subject for an expatriate <placeName>British</placeName> sculptor—is typical of his work in its soft modeling and
                  prosaic, allegorical compositions. His treatment of the image of two nude male figures locked in combat on the obverse of this piece is much
                  less forceful than <persName>John</persName> Flanagan's handling of the same Renaissance inspired motif on the obverse of his 1921 Verdun
                  medal (<hi rend="italic">330</hi>). The reverse, with its tame rendering of the American eagle and <placeName>British</placeName> lion who
                  flank a dreamy female figure personifying Peace, is even weaker. This continental style of medallic art seems to have appealed to the members
                  of the Circle of Friends, however, for they commissioned medals in a similar vein from several of the other immigrant European artists who
                  worked in this country (303 and 307, for example).</p>

               </head>
               <p>In his 1979 study of the medallic art of the First World War, <hi rend="italic">The Dance of Death</hi>, Mark <persName>Jones</persName>
                  has stressed the contrast between the war medals of the Allied nations and those produced by <placeName>German</placeName> medalists. While
                  the Allied medalists "remained true to the elegant refinement of the pre-war tradition that had been common to all European medalists," their
                     <placeName>German</placeName> counterparts abandoned the shared heritage of the "classical, post- Renaissance tradition" for a more
                  forceful, expressive style. In general, the World War I medals by <placeName>American</placeName> artists bear out Jones' thesis in their
                  use of ideal, allegorical compositions to represent the conflict.</p>
               <p>Motivated by a desire to contribute to the war effort, the foremost American sculptors of the day, including artists who had not previously
                  given much attention to medallic art, produced designs for war medals. Daniel Chester French, considered "the dean of American sculptors" by
                  his contemporaries, had created few medals earlier in his career, but in his late sixties he designed the two most outstanding pieces (<hi rend="italic">317</hi> and 327) in the extensive series of war medals sponsored by the ANS. With its soft modeling and refined allegory,
                  the beautiful head of <persName>Victory</persName> that he sculpted for the obverse of the ANS medal commemorating the visit of the
                  French and British war commissions to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in 1917 (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-85">317</ref>
                  </hi>) stands firmly in the continental tradition of medallic art. By contrast, the design created for the reverse of this medal by French's
                  former assistant Evelyn <persName>B. Longman</persName> is modeled in a more streamlined, hard-edged style, although it still features an
                  allegorical figure-composition. One wonders if Longman's use of the figures of <persName>Joan</persName> of Arc and a medieval knight to
                  represent <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> is a
                  conscious response to the medieval symbolism employed by <persName>Karl Goetz</persName> and other <placeName>German</placeName>
                  medalists in place of the classical vocabulary long favored by European medalists.</p>
               <p>Another American World War I medal notable for its treatment of the classicizing, allegorical idiom is the piece by <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph A. Weinman</persName> commemorating the war service of the Mount Sinai Hospital field unit (<hi rend="italic">328</hi>). <persName>Weinman's</persName> lucid style and mastery of medallic composition give renewed dramatic force to the
                  Greco-Roman imagery of a wounded warrior who is protected by a woman with attributes of the goddess Athena from a menacing German soldier
                  grasping a huge serpent. By comparison, <persName>John Flanagan's</persName> representation of the battle of Verdun as a struggle between
                  two Michelangelesque nude giants (<hi rend="italic">330</hi>) is more distanced and less effective at conveying a sense of the real conflict,
                  although the figures are powerfully modeled. Flanagan's design was selected over many others (331 and 332 for example) submitted in a 1921
                  competition for the official medal to be presented by the people of the <placeName>United States</placeName> to the city of Verdun. The
                  depiction of the medieval battlements of Verdun on the reverse of the Flanagan medal was an assigned feature of the piece and hence appears in
                  the competition designs by other artists as well.</p>

                  </hi>, 323, 324, and 329, for example). An attractive piece by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>
                  sculptor <persName>Allen G. Newman</persName> (1875-1940) won the National Arts Club competition for a Valor Medal (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-86">318</ref>
                  </hi>) awarded for bravery. The sensuous personification of America and the majestic bald eagle skillfully modeled by <persName>Newman</persName> for this piece are very much in the Beaux- Arts tradition. At the close of the war, a Victory Medal was designed to be
                  presented to every soldier who had fought for the Allied cause. Working from a standard format, an artist in each of the Allied nations
                  executed a version of the medal for his countrymen in the soft-edged international style, varying the prescribed figure of <placeName>Victory</placeName> as he saw fit. For the U.S. version of the medal (329), sculptor <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle
                     Fraser</persName> created an uninspired allegorical figure, overloaded with attributes, which bears the combined features of Victory and the
                  American Liberty.</p>

               <p>Born in <placeName>Augsburg</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, Karl Goetz first attended the
                  school of art in his home city and later studied in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2935022">Dresden</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2879139">Leipzig</placeName>, <placeName>Berlin,</placeName> and <placeName>Düsseldorf</placeName>. In 1897 he went to
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_2745912">Utrecht</placeName>, <placeName>Holland</placeName>, and in 1899 to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, where he worked for five years. On his return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName> in 1904, he settled in Munich, establishing himself in the succeeding decade as his country's leading medalist.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Goetz's early medals (334, for example) are stylistically related to the refined work of the Austrian court medalists Scharff and Marschall.
                  By the time of his 1909 <placeName>Darwin</placeName> medal (335), however, a new satirical element and a more direct realism are apparent
                  in his work. These characteristics intensified with the advent of the World War, as Goetz turned his energies to attacking the Allies and
                  promoting the <placeName>German</placeName> cause. The caustic satire and brutal realism of pieces like his <hi rend="italic">Lusitania
                        (<ref target="#fig-88">339</ref>)</hi> and Verdun (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-89">340</ref>
                  </hi>) medals are far removed from the elegant classicism of Allied war medals, and Goetz in fact directly mocks the allegorical symbolism of
                  the French tradition in a number of his medals (341, for example). In contrast to the "emotional <pb n="79"/> neutrality" of <persName>John Flanagan's</persName> Verdun medal (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-87">330</ref>
                  </hi>), Goetz's Verdun medal, which shows <placeName>Britain</placeName> as a pipe-smoking skeleton obscenely kneeing a captive <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, is filled with "naked hatred" (<persName>Jones</persName>). The macabre figure
                  of Death that appears over and over again in the medallic compositions of Goetz and his German contemporaries illustrates their turn away from
                  the classical artistic tradition which had prevailed since the Renaissance in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> to
                  medieval, <placeName>Germanic</placeName> sources. In his choice of subject matter, his graphic style, and his manipulation of the emotions
                  of the viewer, Goetz must be seen as part of the larger <placeName>German</placeName> expressionist art movement, as Cora Lee Gillilland
                  has argued.</p>
               <p>While Goetz's style of medallic art had little impact on American war medals, with the exception of a unique satirical piece by Paul Manship
                     (<hi rend="italic">365),</hi> the subject matter of his medals did provoke a great deal of reaction in this country, as well as in <placeName>Britain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. A quarter of a million copies of Goetz's <hi rend="italic">Lusitania</hi> medal (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-88">339</ref>
                  </hi>), depicting the ship's passengers at the Cunard Lines office buying their tickets from Death and the sinking ocean liner spilling over
                  with weapons, were produced in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and distributed also in the U.S. as evidence of
                  the callousness of the <placeName>German</placeName> "War Lords." The text accompanying the English copy of the medal even seizes on the
                  incorrect dating of the incident to May 5, rather than May 7, on Goetz's original version of the piece as proof of the Germans' "premeditated
                  and premature jubilation at the fate of innocent civilians."</p>

               <p>
                  <persName corresp="#viaf_96004462">Anthony de Francisci</persName> was born in Italy and came as a young man to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, where he studied with <persName>George Brewster</persName> at the Cooper Union,
                  with <persName>James</persName> Earle Fraser at the Art Students League, and at the National Academy of Design. Upon completion of his
                  studies, he was employed as a studio assistant by the sculptors <persName>Martiny</persName>, <persName>MacNeil</persName>, <persName>Niehaus</persName>, and, most importantly, <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph A. Weinman</persName>, with whom he
                  worked for six years. He later taught modeling at Columbia University's School of Architecture and at the Beaux-Arts Institute in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-90">

               <p>
                  <persName>De Francisci's</persName> medals and portrait reliefs carry the Saint-Gaudens tradition, handed down to him by <persName>Fraser</persName> and <persName>Weinman</persName>, beyond the First World War. In works such as his bas-relief portraits of
                  Weinman (343) and Carmela Cafarelli (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-90">347</ref>
                  </hi>), de <placeName>Francisci</placeName> shows a talent for modeling in the refined beaux-arts style. The Cafarelli portrait is
                  particularly notable for its fluid surfaces, which softly reflect the light shining on them, emphasizing the feminine grace of the sitter.
                  Other portraits of the artist's friends and relatives (346, for example) are modeled in a looser, sketchier style, reminiscent of some of
                  Saint-Gaudens' portrait reliefs.</p>
               <p>In his designs for medals, de Francisci closely follows Weinman's example. The reverses of his Douglas medal for the American Institute of
                  Mining and Metallurgical Engineers (345) and his McGraw award medal for the Electrical Industry (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-91">348</ref>
                  </hi>) are patterned after the innovative reverse of Weinman's Saltus award medal for the ANS (<hi rend="italic">182</hi>), where a depressed
                  circular field at the center of the composition is used to set off the pictorial motif from the surrounding inscriptions. De Francisci's
                  spare, allegorical designs, populated by ideal, nude figures, also recall Weinman's medallic compositions. For the 1928 lifesaving medal of
                  the Midland Utilities Company (350), the younger artist borrowed his mentor's discarded design for the 1906 U.S. Life Saving Medal (<hi rend="italic">172</hi>), modernizing Weinman's composition by employing the bolder forms associated with the Art Deco style of the 1920s.
                  This piece and the ANS medal produced by de Francisci in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Paul Revere's historic ride (349) are
                  original in their experimentation with the use of convex surfaces.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A native of <placeName>Chelsea</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>, <persName>Hermon
                     Atkins MacNeil</persName> studied sculpture at the Massachusetts Normal School of Art in Boston. Before going to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1888, he taught modeling and drawing for three years at Cornell University. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, he continued his studies with Chapu at the Académie <persName>Julian</persName> and Falguière
                  at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. On his return to the <placeName>United States</placeName> in 1891, he worked as an assistant to <persName corresp="#viaf_1573083">Philip Martiny</persName> on the architectural sculptures for the World's Columbian Exposition. After the
                  Fair, <persName>MacNeil</persName> remained in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> for three years, teaching at
                  the Art Institute and making several trips west to study Indians, who became the principal subject of his sculpture. In 1896 he won the
                  Rhinehart Roman scholarship, which enabled him to spend three years working in Rome. When he returned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, <pb n="82"/> his Indian sculptures were enthusiastically received, and he became a very
                  successful academic sculptor. <persName>MacNeil</persName> taught at the Pratt Institute in <placeName>Brooklyn</placeName>, the Art
                  Students League, and for twelve years in the evening school of the National Academy of Design. He was twice elected to the presidency of the
                  National Sculpture Society.</p>
               <p>The few medals which <persName>MacNeil</persName> executed are of high quality. While his earlier medals are modeled in delicate, low
                  relief in the Beaux-Arts tradition, his later medallic work makes the transition to the more hard-edged Art Deco style. The stylized snake
                  dancers of MacNeil's 1931 Hopi medal (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-92">354</ref>
                  </hi>) are in marked contrast to the more naturalistic Indian figures of his 1901 Pan-American Exposition medal (<hi rend="italic">106</hi>).
                  Although the figures are no longer individualized, the rhythm created by the sharp outlines and the repeated patterns in the design give the
                  Hopi medal a sense of lively movement, making it a fine piece of decorative work.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Although she was born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>, <persName>Laura Gardin</persName> went to high
                  school in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and studied briefly at <placeName corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</placeName> University. She then enrolled at the Art Students League, where she studied from 1907 to 1910
                  with <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName> and worked <pb n="83"/> for two more yearrs as an instructor. In
                  1913 she and Fraser were married, and they spent their later years living and working in Westport, Connecticut. Along with the more than one
                  hundred medals to her credit, <persName corresp="#viaf_7296946">Laura Gardin Fraser</persName> holds the distinction of being the first
                  woman to design a coin for any government, the Alabama Centennial half dollar of 1921. Three other issues of U.S. commemorative coinage—the
                  1922 Grant Centenary half dollar, and 1925 Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar, and the 1926 Oregon Trail memorial half dollar, designed in
                  collaboration with her husband—were her work.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>In the early 1920s, Fraser went from creating medals with "such appropriately feminine subjects" as Better Babies (355) to doing sensitively
                  modeled animal subjects (357 and 358) (Vermeule). When her commemorative coins proved to be popular, she was called upon to design several
                  important medals for the U.S. government. <persName>Laura Fraser's</persName> designs for the Congressional Medal presented to <persName>Charles A. Lindbergh</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-93">359</ref>
                  </hi>) and the official <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</persName> Bicentennial medal (360) update the Renaissance
                  models used by her husband in his medallic work. The streamlined style of the Lindbergh medal heralds the age of transatlantic aviation.
                  Boldly simple in design, this piece is particularly notable for its "Lone Eagle" reverse, a modernized version of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' flying eagle composition for the 1907 U.S. twenty-dollar gold piece (<hi rend="italic">202</hi>). <persName>Fraser's Washington Bicentennial</persName> medal is likewise based on a work by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, his 1889 Washington
                  medal (<hi rend="italic">77</hi>), but a comparison of the two pieces highlights the contrast between the soft, textured modeling of the
                  earlier medal and the smooth surfaces and clearly delineated forms of the later piece.</p>

He moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in 1905 and enrolled at the Art Students League, while working as an assistant in the
                  studio of sculptor <persName>Solon Borglum</persName>, the brother of <persName>Gutzon Borglum</persName>. In 1907 he went to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> to study with <persName>Charles Grafly</persName> at the
                     <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Academy of Fine Arts, and the following year he worked as an assistant to <persName>Isidore
                     Konti</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. Manship was awarded the newly instituted <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> Prize for sculpture in 1909 and spent the next three years at the American Academy in
                  Rome. A trip to Athens before his return to the <placeName>United States</placeName> in 1912 confirmed his appreciation of early Greek
                  sculpture and influenced the direction of his work. From 1922 until 1926, Manship was again in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, working this time in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. In the 1940s, the popular sculptor taught at

               <p>Manship's medals illustrate his development of a new style of sculptural art, related to the Art Deco movement of the 1920s and 1930s in its
                  bold, decorative stylizations, but based on the study of an eclectic array of Italian Renaissance, archaic Greek, Egyptian and Indian sources.
                  While Manship claimed that his designs for the 1916 medal of the <persName>St. Paul Art</persName> Institute (<hi rend="italic">
                     <ref target="#fig-94">364</ref>
                  </hi>), which feature Pegasus and a Muse holding a small Victory, represented a departure "from stereotyped models generally used in this

                  is more in style and technique than iconography that his medals differ from Beaux-Arts works like <persName>James Earle</persName>
                  Fraser's 1915 medal for the American Academy of Arts and Letters (234) which is similar in iconography to the St. Paul Institute medal. The
                  kneeling Muse on the obverse of the <persName>St. Paul</persName> Institute medal, who resembles an Indian or Egyptian statue in pose, is
                  sculpted in an appropriately archaizing, strongly linear style.</p>

               <p>Manship's revival of the direct casting technique of Renaissance medals contributes to the bold impression of his designs. In this aspect of
                  his medallic art he is comparable to <persName>Karl Goetz</persName>, who also preferred the rough finish obtained by casting, rather
                  than striking, his medals. It is significant that Manship alone, with his graphic style, attempted an American answer to Goetz's satirical war

            <p>Medals played only a minor role in the activities of the American Numismatic Society in the first decades after its founding in 1858. They were
               acquired and discussed, but generally grouped with tokens, decorations and other objects whose coin-like form or manufacture placed them within
               the purview of numismatic institutions. Through 1890, the Society issued only five medals: one each in honor of <placeName>Lincoln</placeName>
               and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>, a membership medal and two to honor its own presidents; three of these were
               from dies engraved in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</placeName> by <persName>Lea Ahlborn</persName>.</p>
            <p>A change in attitude towards the medal appears to have arisen in connection with the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, the impetus for so many developments in American art. After a survey of existing
               numismatic tributes to Columbus in response to an inquiry from the Società Geografica Italiana, the Society sponsored the striking of a Columbus
               medal by Tiffany &amp; Co. "believing that no medal has thus far been made suitable to the occasion." In addition it organized an exhibition of
               medals of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> Exposition which brought over 900 people in one day to the Society's
               premises.</p>
            <p>In 1896, the Society's president "stated that it seemed to him a duty of the Society to commemorate important events of local interest by the
               striking of a medal." In the next three years the Society issued a medal by Tiffany to commemorate the dedication of Grant's Tomb, and medals for
                  <persName>St. Luke's</persName> Hospital (116) and the National Conference of Charities and Corrections (<hi rend="italic">118</hi>),
               both by its active member Victor <persName>D. Brenner</persName>. At a meeting in 1896, <persName>Walter Tonnele</persName>, a member
               of the Executive Committee, addressed the Society on "The Modern Renaissance of the Medallic Art," devoted mainly to the careers of <persName>Chaplain</persName> and <persName>Roty</persName>, and the following year <persName>Brenner</persName> gave a talk on "Art
               and the Medal," in which he singled out for special praise the work of Bottée.</p>

            <p>Members of the Society had direct contact with the developments of the French medal at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Exposition of 1900. Despite the objections of a former president who feared "that the medals produced in this country could not
               compete with those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> in artistic merit," the Society accepted the invitation to send
               an exhibit to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. It had the good fortune of having four of its members in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> at that moment, including <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> and,
               especially, <persName>Victor Brenner</persName>, who took charge of setting up the 5 foot by 6 foot case of American coins, decorations and
               medals sent from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. Member <persName>George Kunz</persName> reported
               on the Exposition to the members the following year, <pb n="87"/> concentrating his account on a description of the extensive display of the
               French Mint, notable not only for the beautifully executed masterpieces by <persName>Roty</persName> and <persName>Chaplain</persName>,
               but for the low price at which tens of thousands of medals were sold to the public.</p>
            <p>In 1900, the Society undertook the sponsorship of a school for die cutting and medal design, established in conjunction with the National Academy
               of Design. The school soon reached its projected enrollment of nine students under the instruction of Charles <persName>J. Pike</persName>,
               who is not known to have produced any medals. In the fall of 1901, <persName>Brenner</persName>, recently returned from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, replaced Pike and taught die engraving as well as modeling. Brenner directed the school for a year and
               then resigned; Pike was reappointed and taught classes for the next three years. It appears that the class failed to enroll serious
               professionals, although instruction in "ornamental decoration and artistic jewelry" was added in the hopes of attracting students who might then
               develop an interest in medals. None of the winners of student prizes is known to have gone on to design a produced medal, and in 1905 the school
               was discontinued.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Another ambitious project of this period was the plan to issue a series of medals of noted Americans, to be offered to members of the Society on
               an annual basis. The original plan for medals honoring one man in each of six fields of endeavor was soon changed to individuals who had
               offerered distinguished service in the discovery or development of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. The first medal
               in the series, of Amerigo Vespucci (<hi rend="italic">
                  <ref target="#fig-96">125</ref>
               </hi>), appeared in 1903, after a delay caused by the search for an authentic portrait to serve as the basis for Brenner's depiction. A similar
               difficulty was encountered in the production of the Sir <persName>Francis Drake</persName> medal, the only other medal in the series.</p>
            <p>In the meantime came many opportunities for medals tied to the commemoration of specific events. Of chiefly internal significance were two medals
               for the fiftieth anniversary of the Society, by <persName>Victor Brenner</persName> (135) and Emil Fuchs (291), and a new membership medal
               by <persName>Gutzon Borglum</persName> (<hi rend="italic">248).</hi> Under its own initiative, the Society produced medals marking the visit
               to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> of <persName corresp="#viaf_102307639">Prince Henry</persName>
               of <placeName>Prussia</placeName> and the transfer of the body of <persName>John Paul Jones</persName> to Annapolis, both by <persName>Brenner</persName>.</p>
            <p>Most of the thirty-five medals issued under the auspices of the American Numismatic Society between 1893 and 1926 were, in fact, the result of
               agreements with other institutions. The philosophy behind such arrangements was expressed in the 1909 report of the Committee on the Publication
               of Medals: "The seal of the Society upon a medal or plaque would then be sought by those who wished <pb n="88"/> to provide commemorative medals;
               its facilities would be availed in the design and issue thereof; its vaults would become a depository of the dies; and the sculpture and other
               artistic societies, as well as historians in their various forms of organization, would actively support this Society in its several departments
               of artistic endeavor." President Huntington's plea at the same meeting that "the subject of the medal must be secondary to its artistic value"
               was heeded in most cases; the artists commissioned include many of the major sculptors of the day. Their style ranges from the formal medals by
               Fuchs for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration (99) and Roiné for the death of <persName corresp="#viaf_30330745">Grover Cleveland</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                  <ref target="#fig-97">302</ref>
               </hi>), to the more inventive New Theatre medal of Pratt (<hi rend="italic">220</hi>) and ANS Membership medal of Borglum (<hi rend="italic">
                  <ref target="#fig-98">248</ref>
               </hi>).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The Society attracted the leading medalists of the day to membership and to its meetings. In 1919 a competition was held for the design of the
                  <persName>J. Sanford Saltus</persName> medal, limited to those sculptors who were members of the Society; fifteen medalists submitted
               designs. The award medal, by <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">A. A. Weinman</persName> (<hi rend="italic">
                  <ref target="#fig-99">182</ref>
               </hi>), was designated for signal achievement in the art of the medal; it continues to be the most respected American award for medallic
               sculpture.</p>
            <p>The high point of the involvement of the American Numismatic Society in medallic art was its 1910 International Exhibition of Contemporary
               Medals. From the time of its move in 1907 to its present home, the Society had been planning a major opening exhibition. It is indicative of the
               role which medals played in the period that this took the form of an exhibition of 2,400 works by contemporary medalists from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. A total of more than 5,500 people
               viewed the exhibition in the three weeks it was on view in the Society's hall and a temporary building next door. Many pieces on exhibit were
               purchased for the Society's collection and these, along with subsequent purchases and gifts, form the base for the present exhibition.</p>
            <p>As the expositions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> in 1893 and in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1900 can be seen as the impetus for the Society's interest in medallic art and its own 1910 show as the high point, the final
               burst of enthusiasm can be seen in its shows of 1923 and 1924. In conjunction with the 1923 exhibition of the National Sculpture Society, the ANS
               mounted a display of work by contemporary American medalists. The next year it displayed works of Europeans produced since the 1910 show. By this
               time, however, the overall focus of the American Numismatic Society had shifted from a fellowship of collectors to that of a scholarly research
               institution whose main <pb n="89"/> interest was the study of coins as historical evidence. Medals, especially contemporary ones, were to play an
               ever smaller role in the activities and publications of the institution, and from 1927 to 1971 only four medals were issued by the Society, three
               of which were for internal events. With the resurgence in recent years of interest in American art and in the contemporary medal, the American
               Numismatic Society has again turned its attention to medallic sculpture, as its sponsorship of the current exhibition demonstrates.</p>
