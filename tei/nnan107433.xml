               <name type="place">Canada's</name> money provided the subject for the seventh annual Coinage of the Americas Conference sponsored by the American Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing Council as a forum for the dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of <name type="place">North and South America</name>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all interested in the topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants to come to know the Society's collections and library better during the days of the conference.</p>
            <p>A special exhibit of Canadian money was organized by <name type="pname">Anthony Terranova</name> with the assistance of modern curator <name type="pname">Dr. John Kleeberg</name> and registrar <name type="pname">Katharina Eldada</name>. This exhibit showed selections from the collections of <name type="pname">Joseph Lasser</name>, <name type="pname">Anthony Terranova</name>, <name type="pname">George Cuhaj</name>, and <name type="pname">Normand Pepin</name>, plus examples from the collection of the ANS. A special exhibit on the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> 125 Coin Program was provided through the courtesy of the Royal Canadian Mint.</p>

            <p>The American Numismatic Society can justifiably claim that it has long had an interest in Canadian numismatics. The very second donation ever received by the Society, accession number 1858.2, on May 25, 1858, included a sou issued by the Banque du Peuple of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, the gift of <name type="pname">Edward Groh</name>. In those days, interest in United States numismatics and Canadian numismatics grew hand-in-hand. This continued in the 1890s, after the formation of the American Numismatic Association. The first vice-president of the American Numismatic Association, <name type="pname">Joseph Hooper</name>, was a native of <name type="place">Ontario</name>. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</name> was almost invariably in attendance at ANA conventions, which were held in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> twice: in 1909 and 1923. One Canadian has also served as president of the American Numismatic Association: <name type="pname">J. Douglas Ferguson</name>.</p>
            <p>It is regrettable that the citizens of the respective countries have begun to concentrate on their own coinages to the exclusion of all else, and have turned away from the eclecticism of the early days. There was a good reason for that eclecticism: it reflected the circulating medium of the time. The collectors of the 1850s put together their first collections out of circulation, and a <name type="pname">Mickley</name> or a <name type="pname">Groh</name> was as likely to receive a Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> front view token in change as a <name type="pname">Nova Eborac</name>. Thus even the collector who is interested exclusively in the numismatics of the United States cannot ignore the Canadian series, for in the early part of the nineteenth century it was as much a part of United States coinage as it was part of <name type="place">Canada's</name>. There are some sections of the United States where this continued to be the case even after the great recoinage of 1857. <name type="place">Michigan</name> is the obvious example. A rather drastic example of the predominance of Canadian coppers in circulation in <name type="place">Michigan</name> is provided by the <name type="place">Delton</name>, <name type="place">Michigan</name> (1899) hoard. In the darkest days of the Civil War a great fear gripped the Middle West, and this is reflected in the large number of hoards buried about this time. The <name type="place">Delton</name>, <name type="place">Michigan</name> hoard closes in 1862 and probably was buried soon
<pb n="x"/>
after that date, in a woodpile near the right-of-way of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name>, <name type="place">Kalamazoo &amp; Saginaw</name> Railroad. It consisted of 119 copper coins; of those coppers, no fewer than 93 were of Canadian origin. There were only 15 United States large cents, along with various oddities, such as one Chinese cash coin.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> We should not be surprised that people would hoard copper in 1862: it had disappeared from circulation to such an extent that it had to be replaced by government issued fractional currency or privately issued scrip. The disappearing copper had to go somewhere, and it did—into hoards. The Aaron White hoard is another famous example.</p>
            <p>The importance of Canadian numismatics for the collector interested in the United States in the early nineteenth century is very great. Counterfeiters did not suddenly disappear once the <name type="place">United States Mint</name> began business. Yet we have to explain why there are so comparatively few contemporary circulating counterfeits of large cents. One answer, of course, is that some of the so-called "noncollectible large cents" may well be contemporary counterfeits: one highly educated dealer, <name type="pname">James G. Macallister</name>, thought the strawberry leaf cents were contemporary counterfeits, and he probably was right. But counterfeiters in the early nineteenth century had an easier option than counterfeiting large cents. They could instead counterfeit <name type="pname">George II</name> halfpence, which circulated almost as freely. <name type="pname">Eric P. Newman</name> has pointed out that what we commonly think of as "colonials" circulated in the <name type="place">United States</name> up until 1857-64.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> This means that counterfeit halfpence, whether attributed to <name type="place">Machin's</name>
               <name type="pname">Mills</name> or elsewhere, illicit Connecticut coppers, all sorts of parts of the "colonial" series which do not quite fit in, may have been produced later, perhaps much later. <name type="pname">John Lorenzo</name> has made the very attractive suggestion that the cast <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> copper with the date of 1776 might have actually been produced around the same time and by the same methods as the Canadian Blacksmith coppers.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> The specimen in the ANS collection, which we received in 1988 as the gift of Herbert Oechsner, seems to confirm this; it has the same sort of uneven, "rice pudding-like" surface which many Canadian Blacksmith coppers do.</p>
            <p>The <name type="place">United States</name> researcher faces great problems in dating these coins. The story is told of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_109772791">Margaret Thompson</name>, who, when asked to date a New Style tetradrachm, replied, "somewhere between 229 B.C. and the time of Augustus."<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> The <name type="place">United States</name> researcher, when asked the date of production of a <name type="pname">George II</name> counterfeit of <name type="place">North American</name> origin, could just as easily reply, "somewhere between 1727 and 1862." The Canadian series may provide the means of dating these counterfeit coppers. Many of the Canadian

 tokens have nineteenth century dates; and there is great difference in the weight standards. We can follow the debasement of copper in the Canadian tokens, even if we cannot follow it in the large cents. Further metrological analysis of some of the difficult parts of the colonial series, which could then be compared to coins in the Canadian series, might help us date "colonials" more accurately.</p>

               <p>1991 marked the 350th anniversary of the settlement of Montreal. In 1992 we celebrate the 130th anniversary of the founding of the Numismatic Society of Montreal. It is, therefore, fitting that the ANS mark both the establishment of permanent French settlements in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and their sister society's foundation with a conference dedicated to our northern neighbor's monetary history. Appropriately, this first paper of the conference will discuss <name type="place">Canada's</name> first coinage, the issues for La Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>.</p>
               <p>French <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> had a rich coinage history, but one that was confusing to contemporaries and is not well understood by today's collectors. The fundamental question of where to start a collection, what to include as French colonial issues, should be easy to answer. It is fairly simply resolved for collectors of American colonial coins. Unfortunately, this is the single most controversial question in French-Canadian numismatics and has been so for the past century and more. There is no consensus of what constitutes the body of coins struck for <name type="place">French</name>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and there has not been one since the early decades of the 20th century. From the foundation of the Numismatic Society of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> (1862, renamed the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> four years later) to today, numismatists have wrangled over this question.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> Since no resolution of the problem satisfactory to everyone was achieved by better students than I, such as <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_43194377">R.

               </head>
               <p>A short review of the major highlights in the historiography of French-Canadian numismatics will place the problem at hand in some perspective. When <name type="pname">Alfred Sandham</name> composed his pamphlet on the coins of the Dominion of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and the provinces in 1869 he did not specifically include any struck during the Ancien Regime. Instead, he reprinted observations from two travellers' journals that described French coins then in circulation, along with a short description of the card money.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Sandham</name> was a promoter of new and curious tokens who particularly aroused <name type="pname">McLachlan's</name> ire. It can be supposed that <name type="pname">Sandham</name> would not have missed a chance at popularizing issues that he could later have offered for sale. <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> named <name type="pname">Sandham</name> as one of the "...wholesale importers...who included over twenty-five exotics... [in his catalogue]," and went on to call <name type="pname">Leroux</name>, <name type="pname">Atkins</name>, and <name type="pname">Batty</name> "...great
<pb n="3"/>
sinners in this direction, as they included in their lists, besides all former claims, many of their own introduction."<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Although <name type="pname">Sandham</name> was more interested in copper tokens and was something of a <name type="pname">Francophobe</name>, his failure to notice the 1670 silver and copper issues is somewhat surprising, since they had been mentioned in the collectors' press three years earlier. The August 1866 issue of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> had carried a notice of these coins, quoting extracts from <name type="pname">Le Blanc's</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">Trait� historique des monnoyes de <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>
                  </hi> (1690).<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Sylvester S. Crosby</name> reprinted the 1866 <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> notice in his <hi rend="italic">The Early Coins of America,</hi> saying that he had seen only the smaller silver coin, in <name type="pname">William Sumner</name> Appleton's collection.<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
                  <name type="pname">James Stevenson's</name> essay "The Currency of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> After the Capitulation" (1877) did not mention any French minor coin, but did include the tariff published as part of General <name type="pname">Murray's</name> proclamation of January 1, 1765, which rated <name type="pname">French Louis</name> d'ors at £1/8 in currency of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Eleven years after they were first reported in the pages of the <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi>, the journal carried Professor <name type="pname">Charles E. Anthon's</name> article "The <name type="pname">Gloriam Regni</name>."<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref>
                  <name type="place">Anthon's</name> study drew collectors' attention more closely to the issues of 1670 in an authoritative and convincing way. His contribution seemed to legitimize the "<name type="pname">Gloriam regni</name>" issues as collectable French-Canadian coins. The circulation of the journal into many Canadian numismatic and antiquarian societies' libraries ensured that the "<name type="pname">Gloriam Regni</name>" coinage would become better appreciated in the country for which it was originally intended.</p>
               <p>In 1892 <name type="pname">�mile Zay</name>, a member of the Soci�t� fran�aise de numismatique (whose journal may have inspired <name type="pname">J. N. T. Levick</name> with the idea of creating the <hi rend="italic">AJN),</hi> published his <hi rend="italic">Histoire mon�taire des colonies fran�aises d'apr�s les documents officiels</hi>.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> Under the section specifically named "Colonies de l'Am�rique" <name type="pname">Zay</name> listed and illustrated the 1670 silver and copper issues (his numbers 1-3) as French coins struck for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. More importantly, Zay gave the texts of the arr�ts that originally authorized these issues. He included the 6 and 12 deniers of 1717 struck at Perpignan (his numbers 4-5) as other French coins struck for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. He also gave a long and still very useful selection of documents concerning the card money issues of 1685-1757. <name type="pname">Zay's</name> catalogue was and still is extremely influential.<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> It should be noted, however, that <name type="pname">Zay</name> did not attribute the 1670 or 1717 issues as exclusively "Canadian."</p>
               <p>In a footnote explaining the origin of the worn billon flans that were to be counterstamped with a crowned "C" for the <name type="pname">French colony</name> of <name type="pname">Cayenne</name>, <name type="pname">Zay</name> illustrated and discussed the billon sols and
<pb n="4"/>
demi-sols of the 1738 issue, calling these "marqu�s."<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Zay</name> noted a <name type="place">Quebec</name> ordinance of 1744 that fixed the values of "anciens sols marqu�s" at the then official homeland rate of 18 deniers. He did not document a contemporary use of the term "sols marqu�s" for the 1738 issue, and it is quite likely that he so named them based upon the wording of the 1744 <name type="place">Quebec</name> ordinance he quoted.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> That an issue first struck only six years earlier, was contemporaneous with the 1744 ordinance, and would be coined for a further 20 years, suggests that the "anciens sols marqu�s" referred to in 1744 were some other species of coinage and not the 1738 billon sols and demi-sols.</p>
               <p>On the other side of the Atlantic in 1892 <name type="pname">Dr. Joseph Leroux</name> published the second, expanded edition of his <hi rend="italic">The Canadian Coin Cabinet.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Leroux</name> adopted <name type="pname">Zay's</name> listings of the 1670 and 1717 Perpignan issues and called them French-Canadian (<name type="pname">Leroux</name> 250-252c). He noted that his illustrations of these types "...are taken from <name type="pname">Zay's</name> work."<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> Immediately following the Perpignan coppers <name type="pname">Leroux</name> included the 1721-22 nine deniers issues as French-Canadian, which <name type="pname">Zay</name> had listed in the "Colonies en <name type="pname">G�n�ral"</name> section, and went on to note that there were two varieties of the 1721-H (<name type="pname">Leroux</name> 253-54). The 1738 billon sols and demi-sols were not listed. <name type="pname">Leroux</name> did include a section entitled "<name type="pname">John Law</name>'s Serie[s/c]" (which was not in <name type="pname">Zay's</name> work and may represent the earliest appearance of "<name type="pname">John Law</name>'s coins" in the French-Canadian corpus), listing what he called the 20 livres, 1 livre, 10 sols, and six deniers of 1720-A, as well as the 3 deniers of 1721-B (<name type="pname">Leroux</name> 254b-g, 254e being omitted for some reason). In <name type="pname">Leroux</name>' catalogue there were a total of 12 different issues that he concluded were French-Canadian.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Two years after <name type="pname">Zay's</name> and <name type="pname">Leroux</name>' catalogues appeared, <name type="pname">Pierre Napoleon Breton</name>, a member of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Montreal, published his own <hi rend="italic">Illustrated History of Coins and Tokens Relating to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>
                  </hi>.<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Breton's</name> catalogue drew on his two, earlier illustrated pamphlets, but in the Preface, Breton acknowledged his debt to <name type="pname">Zay's</name> earlier work and said "The history of the coins and jetons issued under the French Regime is taken from [<name type="pname">Zay's</name> work]. In giving credit to Mr. <name type="pname">Zay</name> for the interesting notes brought together in his work, I am happy to here state that this work is a treasure to French-Canadians, for, but per [M<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] through it these pieces would not have been known amongst them."<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> In fact, <name type="pname">Breton</name> neatly lifted <name type="pname">Zay's</name> text concerning the card money nearly verbatim, without noting this additional debt to Zay. <name type="pname">Leroux</name>' name is notably absent from <name type="pname">Breton's</name> acknowledgements and the biography <name type="pname">Breton</name> included only thinly covered his resentment of

               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Breton</name> included <name type="pname">Zay's</name> nos. 1-5 as his own 501-5- Under his section "Colonies en <name type="pname">G�n�ral"</name>
                  <name type="pname">Zay</name> had included the 9 deniers coppers of 1721 and 1722, and a footnote concerning the sols and demi-sols of 1738, noting that these issues circulated in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Breton</name> adopted these other three as French-Canadian coins and listed them in his catalogue as nos. 506-9.<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> In the short space of 28 years, therefore, the corpus of French-Canadian coins had grown from An-thon's three and <name type="pname">Zay's</name> five, to <name type="pname">Leroux</name>' 12 and <name type="pname">Breton's</name> 9 different issues. <name type="pname">Breton's</name> influence upon the course of French-Canadian numismatics has been extraordinary. Most collectors today assume that if an issue appeared in <name type="pname">Breton</name> it was thereby a legitimate Canadian collectable. Few have ever taken the time to trace <name type="pname">Breton's</name> sources for the coins and tokens he listed.</p>
               <p>The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw something of a renaissance in the study of Canadian numismatic history. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W.

numismatics had had a distinctly inflationary effect upon the number and types of coins believed to be French-Canadian. <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> recognized this trend and, in a series of articles in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> and elsewhere, he pointedly set out to deflate the listings popularized by <name type="pname">Leroux</name> and <name type="pname">Breton</name>. In an address to the 1912 American Numismatic Association convention, <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> discussed seven kinds of what he called "fake" Canadian coins.<ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> The last category was "Foreign Coins," which included "British nineteenth century tokens, French coins and medals, besides coins of the other British colonies..." which, he said, "...have been drawn upon to increase the number of Canadians, each successive cataloguer adding one or more to those previously appropriated."<ref target="#CH2-n26">26</ref> These additions, he felt, were made both by design as well as in the interests of Canadian numismatics, but their effect had been not only to increase the corpus of Canadian coins, but also the prices asked for the new additions. Speaking of the sols and demi-sols of 1738, which were by then universally called "sou marques" (<name type="pname">Breton</name> 508, 509), <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> said "As a consequence [of their addition], these comparatively common French coins sell in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> for high, in fact, extravagant prices. Only the other day a collector in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> was asked $50. for a half soumarque."<ref target="#CH2-n27">27</ref> After reviewing those coins and tokens listed by <name type="pname">Breton</name> as Canadian, <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> stated "we would thus exclude from <name type="pname">Breton's</name> list alone five false coins, sixteen fictitious ones, ninety-seven fabrications, twenty mules, and thirty-five foreigners, or a total of 172," and answered his critics' objections to this winnowing by concluding "better that your collection be emasculated than that it should contain a lot of mere modern junk."<ref target="#CH2-n28">28</ref>

               <p>Two years later, in his brief 1914 review of the history of <name type="place">Canada's</name> money, <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> was notably silent concerning all French issues but the 1670 and 1717 coinages.<ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref> The next year <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> expanded his historical review, still omitting the 1721-22 and 1738 issues listed by <name type="pname">Breton</name>, but now also passing over the 1717 Perpignan six and 12 deniers.<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref> Why he excluded them in 1915 is, perhaps, to be explained by his choice of words when he described the 1670 issues as being "...especially struck for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>...." Although <name type="pname">Zay</name> had included the 1717 issue as American, <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> may have felt it did not pertain "especially" to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> since it was authorized for all French colonies in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>, including <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</name> and the island possessions. The same may have been said for the 1670 coinage, as well, but <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> seems to have ignored this fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> saved his most specific and detailed attack against the inflationary tendency for his war-time article "The Sou Marque Not a Canadian Coin."<ref target="#CH2-n31">31</ref>
                  <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> reviewed the evidence printed by
<pb n="7"/>
                  <name type="pname">Zay</name> and adopted by <name type="pname">Breton</name> and argued that the sou marque and its fraction should not be classed as colonial coins even in general unless they bore a crowned C counterstamp, and then only as issues for the French West Indies possessions.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref> Speaking of a suggestion he had recently read in Mehl's <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Monthly</hi> that would have included all dates and mints of the sou marques, <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> stated:
<q>If, therefore, this suggestion be accepted, we would have to include in our Canadian series, all dates of this coinage extending over twenty-two years, as well as varieties bearing the different mint marks. There were twenty or thirty mints at that time in operation in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>. This would load up our Canadian collections with over a hundred varieties of this truly exotic coin.<ref target="#CH2-n33">33</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He did not stop here, however, for at the end of his article <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> wrote:
<q>Now, if we were to class every coin that was made current in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> as Canadian by special ordonnance or proclamation, the list would include with equal show of authority the whole coinage of Great Britain, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>, Spain and Portugal issued during the latter part of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. Thus the Spanish dollars, French crown pieces and <name type="place">United States</name> half dollars, in silver, with the Portuguese joe in gold, constituted the main currency of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> up to the year 1837...All these, therefore could be classed as Canadian on the same grounds as the sou marque, and some of them even with greater show of authority...For these reasons I have never considered the sou marque a Canadian coin, and I would advise collectors to class it only among the French coins, where it really belongs.<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref>

                  <name type="pname">McLachlan's</name> criticism of <name type="pname">Breton</name> was both intemperate and ill founded, but it did succinctly outline the fundamental question about French-Canadian coins that concerns us here. If every type and issue known to have circulated in Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> is a legitimate French-Canadian colonial issue, then nearly the entire coinage of England, <name type="place">France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, Austria</name>, and some <name type="place">German</name> and <name type="place">Italian</name> states struck before 1763 would have to be included.</p>
               <p>A similar situation would exist for collectors of colonial American coins save for an important distinction between the numismatic histories of the two countries. Some parts of colonial <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> created their own native coinages before 1776. The British crown authorized and struck a copper coinage for one colony, Virginia. Between 1785 and 1792 several of the independent American states
<pb n="8"/>
coined their own coppers (popularly, but incorrectly, classed as "colonials" only because they were struck before the act of April 2, 1792 that established a national mint). Citizens of the <name type="place">United States</name> have a fairly rich native coinage history before our independence from colonial status. Had we been as barren of home-grown coinages as French <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> was, perhaps we would have tried to fill the vacuum with coins of the European states and those of our masters, the British.</p>
               <p>Closer to our own time, Walter Breen's "Some Neglected Colonials" began his work on the date and mint combinations known for the sols and demi-sols of 1738-64 and the earlier mousquetaires of 1709-13.<ref target="#CH2-n35">35</ref> Breen began his survey by stating "Collectors' attention should be called to several classes of coins really belonging with the American Colonial series but ordinarily not collected with them."<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref>
                  <name type="place">Robert Vlack's</name> six part series "The French Colonies Sous of 1767" illustrated and described 16 obverse and seven reverse dies used on this generic colonial issue.<ref target="#CH2-n37">37</ref> Vlack was careful nowhere to claim these coins as struck specifically for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</name> and, of course, they have no bearing on French-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. They have, nevertheless, found their way into successive editions of the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Breen's essay "<name type="place">North American</name> Colonial Coinages Under the <name type="pname">French Regimo</name> (1640-1763)," marked the beginnings of a new phase of inflation for French-Canadian coins.<ref target="#CH2-n38">38</ref> This wide-ranging type catalogue included 28 different issues (compared to <name type="pname">Breton's</name> mere nine) as French colonial coins and illustrated all of them. Breen wrote that his catalogue listed "...all the coins authorized to pass current in Colonial <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> under the Bourbons, including some heretofore apparently unrecognized."<ref target="#CH2-n39">39</ref> Included were the by now familiar <name type="pname">Breton</name> 501-9, much earlier billon issues counterstamped with a fleur-de-lys, the douzains and demi-douzains of 1658 (on the strength of <name type="pname">Adam Shortt</name>'s attribution of these as the "old sols marqu�s"), various 1720 dated French coins he attributed to <name type="pname">John Law</name>, gold and silver coins recovered from the wreck of <hi rend="italic">Le Chameau</hi> (foundered 1725), and the sous of 1767. Conspicuously absent were any of the other coins "...authorized to pass current..." in French American colonies, such as British, Spanish, Portuguese, or Dutch issues.</p>
               <p>By 1988, when he published his <hi rend="italic">Complete Encyclopedia of U.S. and Colonial Coins</hi>, Breen had recognized that his earlier treatment of French colonial coins required some new, justifying structure.<ref target="#CH2-n40">40</ref> He proposed six classes of coins that circulated in French <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</name>: 1) Coins officially made for the French colonies in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>; 2) Ordinance of 1683 Countermarks; 3) Domestic coins
<pb n="9"/>
officially exported to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>; 4) Domestic coins unofficially imported by merchants; 5) International trade coins unofficially imported by merchants; and 6) Lightweight British and Irish halfpence and tokens. Of these, <name type="pname">Breen</name> declared that only classes 1-3 were germane to his subject and discarded the others. He could find no surviving examples of his class 2 (Spanish cob eight reales countermarked with a fleur-de-lys) and was left with only classes 1 and 3 to discuss. Nevertheless, his encyclopedia represented something of an apotheosis as it allocated no less than 441 different numbers to the coins he included as French colonial! In less than a century, the corpus of French-Canadian coins grew from <name type="pname">Zay's</name> three, <name type="pname">Leroux</name>' 12 and <name type="pname">Breton's</name> nine, then to <name type="pname">Breen</name>'s 28, finally to an enormous 441 different issues that should be included.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">William T. Anton, Jr.</name> and <name type="pname">Bruce Kesse's</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Forgotten Coins of the <name type="place">North American</name> Colonies</hi> included a section entitled "French Coinage Circulating in the Colonies."<ref target="#CH2-n41">41</ref> The authors listed seven categories of coins and jetons they believed actively circulated in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>. <name type="pname">Anton</name> claimed the 1722-26 and 1734 buste enfantin coppers were "...shipped to the Americas, specifically <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</name>, for circulation in these French colonies," while those dated 1719-21 were "most likely minted solely for use in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>."<ref target="#CH2-n42">42</ref> The only evidence adduced for these statements was observational, from the appearance and quality of the flans, those apparently on poorer stock being assigned a "colonial" status.</p>
               <p>The modern, popular American collectors' handbooks reflect some of this inflation. They also betray a general unease with the subject of French-Canadian coins. The best edition of <hi rend="italic">The Standard Catalogue of <name type="place">United States</name> Coins</hi> (1957) listed as French Canadian the 1670 issues.<ref target="#CH2-n43">43</ref> The 1717 Perpignan coppers were confusingly listed under the Canadian section but described as ordered for circulation "...in the American colonies (<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</name>)" by an edict promulgated at <name type="place">Qu�bec</name>. The 1721-22 nine deniers and 1767 sous (with and without "RF" counterstamp) were listed under "French Colonies In General," following <name type="pname">Zay's</name> arrangement.<ref target="#CH2-n44">44</ref> The 1738 sols and demi-sols were not included. The <hi rend="italic">Coin World Comprehensive Catalog &amp; Encyclopedia of <name type="place">United States</name> Coins</hi> (1990) listed the 1670 silver issues but not the copper double, and classed the 1717 Perpignan and 1721-22 coppers as "Issues Intended for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</name>."<ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref> It dismissed the 1767 sous as having "...no rightful place in the American series..." The most popular handbook, <hi rend="italic">A Guide Book of <name type="place">United States</name> Coins</hi>, boldly led off its listings for the "French Colonies" by stating "none of the coins of the French regime is strictly American."<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref> With this proviso in mind, the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book</hi>
                  <pb n="10"/>
then listed the silver issues of 1670 (but not the copper double), the Perpignan coppers of 1717, and included the mousquetaires of 1709-13 and the sols and demi-sols of 1738-64 (called there half soumarques and soumarques), confusingly followed by the nine deniers of 1721-22. Under a different heading, "French Colonies in General" were placed the 1767 sous (both varieties).</p>
               <p>The most popular guide for collectors of Canadian coins, <hi rend="italic">The Charlton Standard Catalogue of Canadian Coins</hi>, is much more generous in what it includes as French-Canadian.<ref target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> Under its section "Coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>" are to be found 28 different types and denominations and the debt owed to <name type="pname">Breen</name>'s 1976 ANS study is obvious. There were some surprising additions in the Charlton guide, such as the copper deniers and doubles of <name type="pname">Louis XIII</name> and <name type="pname">XIV</name> and the liards of <name type="pname">Louis XIV and XV</name>, which had not been included by <name type="pname">Breen</name> in either of his catalogues. The 1670 silver issues were included, but not the copper double.</p>
               <p>On the assumption that the French should know more about their own coinage than anyone else, it is instructive to examine the best guide to French colonial coins published to see what might be included there as coins of French-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. As already noted, <name type="pname">Gadoury</name> and <name type="pname">Cousini�'s</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">Monnaies coloniales fran�aises, 1670-1980</hi>, largely preserves <name type="pname">Zay's</name> earlier structure.<ref target="#CH2-n48">48</ref> Under "<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>," the authors list the copper and silver issues of 1670 only. Under "Colonies G�n�rales" they include the 1717 Perpignan coppers, the 1721-22 nine deniers des colonies fran�aises, the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name> and <name type="pname">La Rochelle</name> billon sols of 1738-64 that bear a crowned "C" counterstamp (following the edict of 1763), blank or heavily worn flans bearing the same crowned "C" (issued by edict of 1779), and the 1767 sous with and without the "RF" counterstamp.<ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> The 1738-64 sols and demi-sols without the crowned "C" counterstamp are not included as colonial coins, generally or specifically. There are only three coins listed as French-Canadian and seven as struck for generic colonial circulation.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Influences upon the Inflation of French-Canadian Types</hi>
               </head>
               <p>There are three explanations for the gradual inflation of the types and issues assigned a French-Canadian status. The first, and earliest, can be ascribed to simple national chauvinism: lacking a homegrown colonial series, Canadian numismatists naturally looked to the motherland for issues that might be classed as French colonial. Both <name type="pname">Leroux</name> and <name type="pname">Breton</name> published at a time when the serious study of Canadian numismatics was in its early days. Their work with Canadian coins continued in the spirit of free intellectual enquiry
<pb n="11"/>
begun by the founders of the Institut Canadien in 1844.</p>
               <p>The second was the publication of <name type="pname">Adam Shortt</name>'s magisterial <hi rend="italic">Documents Relating to Canadian Currency, Exchange and Finance During the French Period</hi>.<ref target="#CH2-n50">50</ref> Shortt's archival study was intended to illuminate the economic life of La Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> by the publication of documents that were not generally available to historians. One of the classes of documentation he printed were the colonial registrations of royal decrees and arr�ts that authorized the circulation of French homeland coins in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. Another, related class was the colonial governors' acts rating the exchange values of these French coins for Canadian circulation. Taken together, these two classes of documents exposed to numismatists a host of French metropolitan and European coin types that were officially authorized to circulate in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. Given the cosmopolitan nature of coinage circulation during the French colonialization period, the types authorized included virtually everything minted from the beginning of the seventeenth century onward, ranging from Lion daalders of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2750405">Netherlands</name> to <name type="place">Spanish</name> silver and <name type="place">Portuguese</name> gold. Most frequently mentioned in the ordinances were, naturally enough, French metropolitan coins.</p>
               <p>Shortt had not intended his study to be a numismatic one, but the evidence he published was later taken up by the handful of collectors and numismatic writers astute enough to recognize its significance for their field. Where Shortt found a document authorizing a particular coinage to circulate in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, collectors found one that proved that coinage to have been intended for Canadian circulation from the start. No one bothered to study how the coins mentioned had entered Canadian circulation, whether officially or in the cargos of private speculators.<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> The connection was historically illogical but both understandable and alluring. The documents Shortt published supplied the evidence for the majority of the obscure French issues <name type="pname">Breen</name> included in his 1976 ANS study and 1988 catalogue, for example.</p>
               <p>The third, and more recent, major influence on the inflation of French types attributed as French-Canadian largely owes its origins to artifact reports from controlled archaeological excavations of French-Canadian sites. Following the Second World War, particularly after 1980, many French trading posts and forts, as well as parts of the important settlement sites in <name type="place">Qu�bec</name> City and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, were systematically excavated and the finds reported in the scholarly press. In a few cases the find reports were devoted specifically to the coins uncovered. <name type="pname">Donald P. Heldmann's</name> "Coins at <name type="pname">Michilimackinac"</name> is the best known of this type.<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> Usually,
<pb n="12"/>
however, reports of coin finds were incorporated into the body of the general excavation paper and were used as an aid in dating the habitation phase of the site.<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> In a few instances coins found were not recognized as such, because no trained numismatist was either present during the excavation or examined the finds subsequently. A classic example is the find of two douzains of the 1590s, both bearing the 1640 recoinage fleur-de-lys counterstamp, excavated at a Jesuit mission site established by <name type="pname">Fr. Jacques Marquette</name> in <name type="place">Michigan</name>'s Upper Peninsula. These coins, believed deposited between 1671-92, when the mission was burned and abandoned, were first reported as "copper kettle scraps," the identification later being corrected after the coins were properly attributed.<ref target="#CH2-n54">54</ref> In other cases, coins found were partially identified but their numismatic significance missed because the archaeological staff did not include a numismatist trained to their nuances. An example is the report of the coin finds at Champlain's settlement at <name type="place">Qu�bec</name>, the Place Royale, which failed to understand the numismatic purpose (or date) of the fleur-de-lys counterstamps found on several billon douzains excavated there.<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The best single study of the coins found in controlled archaeological excavations in French <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and French sites below the border is <name type="pname">Peter N. Moogk's</name> "When Money Talks: Coinage in New <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>."<ref target="#CH2-n56">56</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Moogk</name> reviewed the major excavation reports and personally inspected many of the coins found, in some cases accurately attributing pieces previously misunderstood. He listed those French coin types dated before 1760 that had been uncovered from archaeological digs. He showed that the copper coins found were composed primarily (299 of 323 found) of liards of Henry IV to <name type="pname">Louis XIII</name>. The billon coins were made up primarily of douzains of the sixteenth-seventeenth c., sols of 15 deniers of 1692-1713, sols of the 1738 series, and a few mousquetaires of 1709-13 and demi-sols of the 1739 series, with the second and third types predominating. Only a handful of silver coins had been recovered, mostly 1/2 and 1 ecus. <name type="pname">Moogk</name> found one type, the bronze 6 deniers of 1710-12 called the "Dardennes," as plentiful as the number of billon double sols of the 1738 series. The "Dardennes" were not recognized by <name type="pname">Breen</name> or the Charlton Guide. <name type="pname">Moogk</name>'s study provides a useful cross section of the coinage types that are known to have actively circulated in La Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>. For the collector interested in them, <name type="pname">Moogk</name>'s article is the best place to start learning about them.</p>

               <p>Undersea wrecks have been a fruitful source of new coin types claimed as French Canadian. During the night of August 25-26, 1725, the French 48 gun transport, <name type="pname">

She went down taking all hands and passengers, including the newly appointed Governor of Trois Rivi�res and Intendant Begon's successor, <name type="pname">Guillaume de Chazel</name>. Salvage operations commenced from <name type="place">Louisbourg</name> late the next year, but the gold and silver treasure she carried was not recovered until 1965.

No complete inventory listing of all the coins recovered from the wreck has been published. The most accessible one remains the auction catalogue entries, which are useful for the gold but unsatisfactory for the silver coins. The ill-fated vessel carried gold <name type="pname">Louis</name> d'ors mirlitons dated 1723 to 1725, including both reverse varieties (long or short fronds), struck at some 24 different mints. In some cases, the coins salvaged represent the majority of the survivors of their particular mintages. The silver �cus aux huit L appear to be dated 1724 and 1725, the majority being from the seaboard mints of <name type="pname">Bordeaux</name> and <name type="pname">La Rochelle</name>.

The gold and silver coins found in the wreck, although struck to French metropolitan types, were clearly destined for Canadian circulation. The fact that some coins found constituted the majority of their surviving populations suggested to some collectors that the entire mintage of these must have been allocated to <name type="place">Canada's</name> coinage needs.

               </head>
               <p>Are there any coins that are really French-Canadian? What types can a collector include with confidence? Finding an answer is not as easy as posing the question. Even for British-American colonial coins the answer has been at times elusive, as a cursory glance through any current edition of the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book</hi> will reveal. There, British merchants' tokens of the late eighteenth century are included solely because their types refer to American personalities or places (the Franklin Press, Theatre at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, Washington Grate, or Pitt tokens, as examples). For French speaking <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> the answer is even more difficult to find. <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> pointed out that the first coin specifically to mention <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> in its legends was the 1794 Copper Company of Upper Canada token.<ref target="#CH2-n60">60</ref> No other coin prior to that date bears the words "<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>" or "Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>" in its legends. The copper double of the 1670 issue is the only French colonial coin that bears the word "<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>" as part of its legend.</p>
               <p>To answer these questions we have to decide what we mean by "French-Canadian" coins. There are several possible definitions, and by examining these we may find our answer. The following catalogue listing is strictly reductionist in its philosophy. A mass of coins has accreted upon Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> like coral on shipwrecked ecus. This catalogue makes no claim to being complete in what should be included. There is much more work to be done before numismatists can be satisfied that all coins ordered for, shipped to, or circulating in French <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> have been rescued from historical obscurity. Rather, it should be seen as a modern first step toward that goal and as a continuation of <name type="pname">McLachlan's</name> deflationary influence upon the corpus of French-Canadian numismatics.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Here we are on much firmer ground. This definition includes French coins specifically coined for circulation in Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>, as well as other named colonies. These are the issues that have been attributed to French <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> from the earliest days of Canadian numismatic study. The royal decrees authorizing their issue were published by <name type="pname">Zay</name> and Shortt and their intended circulation in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> is specifically stated. They include the 1670 silver 5 and 15 sols, the "<name type="pname">Gloriam Regni</name>" issue, and the copper double de l'Am�rique fran�oise of the same date. These issues were struck just five years after the <name type="pname">Carignan-Sali�res</name> Regiment was dispatched to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and appear to have been part of an attempt by Colbert to put <name type="place">Canada's</name> security and local economy on a firmer footing than before. It is probable that the billon sols dated 1692-97 bearing an oval fleur-de-lys counterstamp (Gadoury-92a, b) were so marked specifically for <name type="place">North American</name> circulation. The earlier douzains with a similar counterstamp (Gadoury-21), authorized by <name type="pname">Louis XIII</name> in 1640, are another probable candidate for this category. These two types are, almost certainly, the sols marquez referred to in <name type="place">Quebec</name> ordinances dated prior to 1710, such as that of March 20, 1662, raising the ratings of French coins in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n63">63</ref> On the strength of this proposed attribution these two types are included in this category. It should be remembered that these two represent some of the most commonly found coins in archaeological excavations of French trading and military sites. The billon 30 deniers of 1710-13 struck at Lyons, the so-called Mousquetaires, were authorized by royal decree to circulate in Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n64">64</ref> Also included are the 1717-Q copper 12 and 6 deniers colonies, and the 1721-B, 1721-H, 1722/1-H, and 1722-H copper sols of 9 deniers which replaced the 1717 coins.</p>

                     </name> treasure. The question of the copper 12 deniers coins of 1720 is, in my opinion, as yet unsettled.

De Beauharnois was advised of the intended shipment on March 12, 1720.<ref target="#CH2-n66">66</ref> These could only have been the sols au buste enfantin (<name type="pname">Gadoury</name>-276), the only coppers of the reign rated at 12 deniers. However, although dies were received at <name type="place">La Rochelle</name> on April 8, 1720, no specimen from that mint appears to survive today dated 1720.<ref target="#CH2-n67">67</ref> This may be explained by the turmoil in French fiscal affairs that began in May and led, ultimately, to Law's fall from grace in December 1720. It is likely that no sols of 12 deniers were actually struck at <name type="place">La Rochelle</name> in 1720. It is equally likely that the 1721-22 issue of 9 deniers des colonies fran�oises, struck on Law's company's Swedish copper flans, was coined in place of the 12 deniers pieces called for the year before. The sols of the 1738-64 mintage were shipped to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> in fairly large quantities. Documents of 1745 and 1752-53 specifically mention such shipments, for example. The 9,000 Lt. known to have been shipped could have comprised virtually any date/mint combination struck from 1738-53. Unlike the <hi rend="italic">

Going solely on the strength of the written sources, it would be safe to include issues dated 1738-53 in a collection. Later dates are unsupported by the published sources; unpublished archival materials may lengthen the terminus, however. Other contemporary documents mention requests for and shipments of sols of 18 and 27 deniers and speak of "sols marquez," "sols neufs," and "sols vieux."<ref target="#CH2-n68">68</ref> The dates of these documents do not allow a certain attribution to specific coin types to be made in almost all of these cases, unfortunately.</p>

                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. Archaeological finds offer circumstantial, not historical, evidence of authorization.

                  <p>This is the largest category of all. All <name type="place">French</name> coins that had currency in the homeland were, in law, given currency in all <name type="place">French</name> overseas colonies.

The qualification that the ratings of <name type="place">French</name> coins were to be augmented meant that each coinage issue was subject to conciliar review and validation for overseas circulation. Thus, although the decree effectively authorized all <name type="place">French</name> coins to be current in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, the collector cannot simply assume that any he is offered could have been part of the French-Canadian coinage pool.

These were called "nouveaux demi-sols" in the 1738 edict that authorized their striking. They are generally much scarcer than the larger, sol denomination pieces.

               <p>The mousquetaires of 30 deniers (so-called because it was essentially a military issue and the addorsed L's on the obverse reminded an observer of a musketeer's moustaches) were not included in the French-Canadian corpus until after 1968. In that year, <name type="pname">J. Lafaurie</name> printed the �dit of 1709 which originally authorized the issue, showing that the Metz coinage of the 30 deniers denomination was given
<pb n="26"/>
currency in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>'s western border regions, primarily to provide troops on campaign there with small change.<ref target="#CH2-n77">77</ref> Metz was the premier western frontier mint and was the logical choice as the mint for this purpose. The Lyon coinage was given currency in the rest of mainland <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> and the overseas colonies of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. The smaller, 15 deniers denomination was struck only at Metz and was not intended for overseas circulation. The mousquetaires were not struck specifically for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> or any <name type="place">French</name> colony. In fact, in 1709 <name type="place">Pontchartrain</name> wrote to <name type="place">Quebec</name> denying the need or usefulness of a copper currency for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and in 1711 a memorandum on the state of <name type="place">Canada's</name> finances noted that so little funding had been received from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> that additional recourse was had to the card money expedient.<ref target="#CH2-n78">78</ref> The �dit authorizing their striking was not registered at <name type="place">Quebec</name> but that they actively circulated in Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> was demonstrated by <name type="pname">Moogk</name>'s survey of the archaeological evidence. Thus, of the three requirements for a coin to be a legitimate <name type="place">French</name> Canadian colonial issue (authorization for the colonies, official colonial rating, and evidence of official shipment and circulation), the 30 deniers mousquetaires satisfy two.</p>
               <p>The "sou marques" (sols and demi-sols of 1738-64) were authorized by an edict of October 1738. The new billon issue was to achieve several goals: to drive out foreign billon coins, which were to be demonetized in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> thereafter; to offset reductions in value on the Dutch exchange of <name type="place">French</name> billon coins of earlier issues (primarily the 1710-13 mousquetaires); and to replace all earlier <name type="place">French</name> billon issues, which thereafter were to be received at all <name type="place">French</name> mints on an intrinsic value basis only. The new billon issue was ordered current "...dans tout nôtre Royaume, pays, terres, &amp; Seigneuries de nôtre ob�ïissance..." This has been read as giving the issue currency everywhere the Bourbon flag flew, including Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>. However, these words were really formulaic. The �dit of May 1718 that authorized the gold <name type="pname">Louis</name> d'or à la croix de Malte (<name type="pname">Gadoury</name>-336) ordered their circulation "...dans l'�ntendue de royaume, pays, terres, et seigneuries de l'ob�ïssance de Sa Majest�...," for example. The �dit of September 1720, probably drafted by <name type="pname">John Law</name>, himself, authorized the coinage of the new silver de <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> and gold 2 L series and allowed their circulation "...dans tout nôtre royaume, pays, terres et seigneuries de nôtre ob�ïssance..." In both cases, the wording was, in its essentials, identical to that later found in the 1738 text and represented a general conveyance of currency for these issues throughout the kingdom. In this respect, the issues so authorized became legal "French" coins with currency everywhere. We have already seen that an earlier edict gave currency to all <name type="place">French</name> coins
<pb n="27"/>
throughout all <name type="place">French</name> overseas possessions. The wording of the 1738 �dit, then, on its face does not distinguish that issue from any other <name type="place">French</name> coin and should not be read as conveying a special "colonial" flavor to it. If it did, then all <name type="place">French</name> coins authorized by a similar formula would also have to be classed as "colonial." Not until 1743 and 1744 were the sols and demi-sols given official ratings for circulation in Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> and <name type="place">Louisbourg</name>. The original �dit that authorized a metropolitan coinage gave it legal currency. For the colonies, a second act was required, rating it for overseas circulation, and probably was issued only when the quantities in circulation of the mainland type had become noticeable enough to require action on the part of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>. On the other hand, the royal �dits that authorized the special colonial issues of 1670 and 1717, for example, specifically limited their circulation to the overseas colonies of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> and forbade their importation and currency in mainland <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>.</p>

               <p>The coinage issues of 1720, popularly called "<name type="pname">John Law</name>'s coinage," have been a perennial source of confusion and error for collectors and cataloguers of French-Canadian coins. Neither <name type="pname">Zay</name> nor <name type="pname">Breton</name> included the 1720 coins, but <name type="pname">Leroux</name> did. Apparently on the strength of <name type="pname">Leroux</name>' catalogue <name type="pname">Breen</name> wrote in his ANS study "...Law, as director of the mints, ordered certain coins to be shipped to the colonies, consisting apparently of only the following" and then listed 10 different coinage issues he attributed to <name type="pname">John Law</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n79">79</ref> In his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia</hi>, published 12 years later, <name type="pname">Breen</name> specifically listed as <name type="pname">John Law</name> issues only the copper demi-sol and sol au buste enfantin (<name type="pname">Gadoury</name>-273, 276). He mentioned in an introductory paragraph the 1720-A petit <name type="pname">Louis</name> d'argent (<name type="pname">Gadoury</name>-305) as a <name type="pname">John Law</name> coin.<ref target="#CH2-n80">80</ref>
               </p>
               <p>From July 25, 1719 to January 5, 1721, Law's Compagnie des Indes enjoyed the premier b�n�fice des monnaies and operated the <name type="place">French</name> mints for their own profit. Coin types specifically authorized by the crown during this period, and others for which deliveries of dies to local mints fall within these dates, may be considered to be "<name type="pname">John Law</name>" coins. Modern American collectors tend to assume that a coin type struck during Law's control of the mints is automatically a "colonial coin," because of the association between Law and his Mississippi Scheme. For example, the <name type="pname">Garrett</name> Collection sale included specimens of the 1720-A demi-sol au buste enfantin (Lot 1298, <name type="pname">Gadoury</name>-273), the 1720-A livre d'argent fin (Lot 1299, <name type="pname">Gadoury</name>-296), and the 1720-B petit <name type="pname">Louis</name> d'argent (Lot 1300,
<pb n="28"/>
                  <name type="pname">Gadoury</name>-305) as <name type="place">French</name> colonial coins. The "colonial" association is misleading, however. Law, in common with his generation, looked upon the <name type="place">French</name> overseas colonies as sources of natural products to be purchased at home on credit, payable in finished goods exported to the colony. His attitudes toward hard currency in the colonies, as well as at home, became negative in the extreme and from the beginning his scheme may have been aimed at withdrawing specie currency from circulation entirely.<ref target="#CH2-n81">81</ref> The coinages struck during his control of the mints, until the recoinage of September, 1720, were grudgingly approved and not altogether successful. None was struck for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. The Council's order directing the <name type="place">La Rochelle</name> mint to strike copper 12 deniers pieces in 1720 is the only exception to Law's disinterest in coinage for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and the other overseas colonies, and, as we have seen, even this issue was not actually struck.</p>
               <p>The question of which coins may properly be considered "<name type="pname">John Law</name>" coins has been discussed in my "The Compagnie des Indes and the Premiere B�n�fice des Monnaies: <name type="place">French</name> Coinage and the Mississippi Scheme, 1719-1720."<ref target="#CH2-n82">82</ref> There appear to be three copper, 10 silver, and three gold types attributable to the period of Law's control of the <name type="place">French</name> mints.

               <p>The review of the historiography of French-Canadian numismatics has shown that there has been a gradual tendency to include more and more <name type="place">French</name> coin types in the corpus of those considered to be French-Canadian colonial ones. Some, few voices were raised against this trend, but over the years they have been drowned by collectors' enthusiasm for finding new types to add to their holdings. If we review the types commonly thought to be French-Canadian we find that many must be reconsidered. No <name type="place">French</name> issue was struck exclusively for Canadian circulation. However, there are many that were coined specifically for circulation in Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>, as well as other colonies, and others that were authorized to pass current in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. Some others, mainland types, were officially exported to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, to pay military expenses or in answer to pressing needs for small change. Most foreign and all <name type="place">French</name> coins had currency in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> at one time or another. The so-called "<name type="pname">John Law</name>" coins
<pb n="29"/>
may have passed in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> but were not officially struck for or exported to Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>. In general terms, Nouvelle <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> appears to have been adequately supplied with minor copper or billon coins for small daily transactions, but deliberately kept undersupplied with silver and gold coins.</p>

                  <p>The Numismatic Society of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> was founded in December 1862, just short of five years after the founding of the ANS. See <name type="pname">Alfred Sandham</name>, <hi rend="italic">Coins, Tokens and Medals of the Dominion of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>
                     </hi> (Montreal, 1869), pp. 71-72. For a city considerably smaller in population than <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, this was by no means unremarkable. In 1866 the society expanded its interests to include documents and artifacts and changed its name accordingly. The Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> is the oldest Canadian organization of its sort still active. Its publication, <hi rend="italic">The Canadian Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal,</hi> has appeared irregularly. Volume 1, no. 1 of the Fifth Series will be published shortly, under the editorship of <name type="pname">Warren Baker</name>, another participant in the 1992 Coinage of the Americas Conference.</p>
                  <p>I should like to thank <name type="pname">Warren Baker</name> for making selections from his library available to me; and <name type="pname">Frank Campbell</name>, the Society's Librarian, for a similar favor.</p>

(<name type="place">Ottawa</name>, 1925), could find no contemporary evidence for calling the billon issue of 1738 "marqu�s" either, and was reduced to arguing that this name came from the way in which they were struck. (See below, n. 63). The use of the term "sol marqu�" predated the 1738 billon issue. When <name type="pname">Vaudreuil</name> and <name type="pname">B�gon</name> wrote to the Count de Maurepas on November 2, 1724, regarding the habitants' resistance to the copper nine deniers of 1721-22, they stated that the new coinage "...is not necessary as the smallest purchase is never below a sol marqu�." Shortt, pp. 536-537. In 1752 the sols were called "marqu�s" however. Confusion of terminology reigned then, as now. The �dit that authorized them in 1738 called them sols and demi-sols, not sols and double sols or sou marqu�s. I have used the original, enabling act's terms.</p>

                  <p>Examples of sols or double sols of the 1738 type counterstamped with a crowned "C" as called for in the 1763 �dit, appear to be extremely rare. <name type="pname">Zay</name> illustrated one in the line drawing on p. 65 of his work; <name type="pname">Gadoury</name> and <name type="pname">Cousini�</name> reproduce a photograph of a specimen on p. 17 of theirs. <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> could be dogmatic and intolerant in his opinions. He could also be very wrong. In the case of the 1738 sols and demi-sols, archaeological finds and documentary evidence show that not only did some circulate in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, but also that several hundred thousand pieces of the larger denomination were officially shipped to <name type="place">Quebec</name> by the Treasurer of Marine in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>.</p>

On the contrary, I date three of the five <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> parasites to 1789-90, the height of the overstriking period in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> series, and suggest that the sols were parts of batches of various, worn hosts meant for recoinage to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> types. The weights of host coins were unimportant to the NJ coiners, I know of many "overweight" ones. These worn host coins were essentially valueless at the time as they had been discredited in the marketplace. Their NJ overtypes gave them currency, not their weights. Had sols been as plentiful as <name type="pname">Anton</name> states we would expect to find more of them overstruck by NJ types. Instead, they are extremely rare.</p>

In this, he borrowed from Shortt, who had earlier argued that the 1658 issues had been struck on new minting

equipment and that the word "marquez" referred to this fact. If Shortt meant the introduction of screw presses at the Louvre, however, he was late by nearly 100 years. It is my belief that <name type="place">Quebec</name> or <name type="place">Louisbourg</name> references to "sols marquez" before 1710 should be understood as meaning the counterstamped billon coins of the 1640 and 1692 recoinages. A royal ordinance of June 20, 1743, for <name type="place">Louisbourg</name> (enacted for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> on March 30, 1744), distinguished the "anciens sols" and the "nouveaux sols" of 1738, the former to be current in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> at 18 deniers, the latter at 24, Shortt, pp. 718-19. An ordinance of Beauhamois and Hocquart dated January 30, 1744, reduced the "vieux sols marqu�s" to 18 deniers, the rating ordered by the king for the "anciens sols" the year previous, Shortt, pp. 726-27. This was the ordinance referred to by <name type="pname">Zay</name> in his note describing the 1738 billon sols and double sols. <name type="pname">Zay</name> incorrectly attributed the 18 deniers rating to the sols of 1738, whereas the ordinance of 1743 actually rated the 1738 issue at 24 deniers. <name type="pname">Zay's</name> misattribution, together with later Canadian references to sols of the 1738 mintage as "marqu�s," have obscured the real identity of the "sols marqu�s" in circulation before 1710. It is likely that in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> before 1710 the term "vieux sols marqu�s" referred to the billon pieces with fleur-de-lys counterstamps. Another ordinance of Beauharnois and Hocquart at <name type="place">Quebec</name> on October 5, 1743, restricted the tender of "anciens sols marqu�s" to one-fortieth the total of any payment, noting that these had been demonetized in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> by conciliar decree on August 1, 1738, three months prior to the �dit that authorized the new billon issue.</p>

               <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name> &amp; Company, the coining and machinery firm founded by <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> of Soho near Birmingham, prepared coins, tokens, dies and machinery for a variety of places around the world. Some of these were logical indeed, bearing numismatic testimony to the old adage that trade follows the flag. Thus, the British occupation of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> first resulted in coinages for various parts of this enlarged sphere of influence, and eventually the provision of mints for the striking, in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>, of a colony-wide coinage on <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> model.</p>
            <p>In other cases, the paths of coinage and minting machinery take us by surprise: what, precisely, was <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> doing in Russia? What did he <hi rend="italic">think</hi> he was doing when he actively solicited business from Britain's mortal foes, the Revolutionary French? This cheerful ability to pop up in unexpected places is one of the more interesting aspects of the <name type="pname">Boulton</name> operation, but it was not the most profitable. Taking the overall view, <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>, his successors, and their firm had their most persistent, most lucrative dealings with those areas under British political and/or commercial control. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> is a prime example, but the English possessions in the Caribbean are another. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> is a third, and it forms the subject of this article.</p>
            <p>The connections between the Birmingham firm and the British possession lasted, in an episodic way, for over half a century. To a degree, they functioned in the shadow of <name type="pname">Soho's</name> largest concerns and hopes vis-à-vis <name type="place">Canada's</name> southern neighbor, and, indeed <name type="pname">Soho's</name> successes in the Canadian arena can only be fully understood with due regard to its failures in the American one.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> had long enjoyed an ambivalent relationship with the inhabitants of the former thirteen colonies. In the mid-1770s, he had spearheaded a remonstrance to Parliament, condemning American insurgency in highly intemperate language.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> By the following decade, his views toward Americans had mellowed, <name type="pname">Boulton</name> wishing them well in their new government experiment. In part this originated in a natural desire to increase the volume and types of business which his company had with the former colonists. But it also stemmed from an authentic progressivism, one which was doubtless reinforced by all the trouble and blind obstinance which <name type="pname">Boulton</name> was now encountering in his attempts to secure a regal coining contract from the British king and his minions.</p>
            <p>Domestic resistance to new ideas, along with several thousand pounds' worth of improved minting equipment which he could not profitably allow to stand idle, led <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> into a number of speculative contacts with the Americans. His primary contact in these early negotiations was <name type="pname">John H. Mitchell</name> of <name type="place">Charleston, South
<pb n="39"/>
Carolina.</name>
               <name type="pname">Boulton</name> first discussed the possibilities of a state coinage with this young, prematurely-optimistic planter. After the creation of the new national government under the Constitution (which document prohibited state coinage), <name type="pname">Boulton</name> and the Charlestonian explored the prospects of securing the right to strike our new, national coinage. <name type="pname">Boulton</name> would fail in both attempts, in part because of the spirited opposition of Secretary of State <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</name> to the national proposal.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> But an American coinage would shine before <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> and his successor like a numismatic Holy Grail for the next two decades. Meanwhile, they would content themselves with lesser things. And here is where the contact with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> originated.</p>
            <p>We have no archival testimony bearing on that first connection; there is only the evidence of the coins. Or rather tokens; from 1794 come extremely rare pieces struck on behalf of the Copper Company of Upper Canada. They are unquestionably <name type="pname">Soho</name> products, their obverse die created by <name type="pname">No�l-Alexandre Ponthon</name>, who worked for <name type="pname">Boulton</name> between 1791 and 1795 <ref target="#fig-15">(fig. 1)</ref>.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>
               <name type="pname">Ponthon</name> may have gotten the idea for the composition from a previous <name type="pname">Boulton</name> piece, the 1791 <name type="pname">Glasgow</name> token for <name type="pname">Gilbert Shearer</name> &amp; Company, the product of an earlier, equally short-term engraver, <name type="pname">Rambert Dumarest</name>. The lettering surrounding the figure, sunk into a raised border, was a distinctive <name type="pname">Boulton</name> touch from the mid-1790s, which would soon find a more important expression, on <name type="pname">Soho's</name> regal copper issues of 1797.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-15">
               <graphic url="COAC8_039.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The reverse of the Canadian pattern is problematic. <name type="pname">Ponthon</name> presumably created it as well, for its style is highly reminiscent of the reverses used for the Monneron tokens, pieces for which <name type="pname">Ponthon</name> was certainly responsible. But its very simplicity renders such an attribution uncertain; virtually any middling diesinker could have created it. It seems to me that this plainness of reverse design may be ascribed to one of two possibilities. <name type="pname">Boulton</name> may have counseled haste in filling a request for a pattern, assuming that the artistry of <name type="pname">Ponthon's</name> obverse would carry the project to success. Or he may
<pb n="40"/>
have viewed its prospects as unlikely, not worth the time of an elaborate effort for the reverse die. Of the two possibilities, the former strikes me as the more probable, for it corresponds to <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> business procedure in several other instances. But the contrast between obverse and reverse, however it originated, strikes us as jarring. <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> suggests that the Copper Company of Upper Canada token was created on behalf of Governor Simcoe, whose recall in 1796 might explain why the pieces never got beyond pattern stage.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>There is a second, related piece worth mentioning, a mule created by combining the reverse of the Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> token with the obverse of a second <name type="pname">Soho</name> pattern for American consumption, a speculative halfpenny ordered by <name type="pname">Philip Parry Price Myddelton</name> for a new settlement in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254925">Kentucky</name>
               <ref target="#fig-16">(fig. 2)</ref>. The scheme never came to fruition, but a few tokens did get manufactured, harbingers of what would have been a large issue had irate Crown officials not prevented <name type="pname">Myddelton</name> and his flock from proceeding with their plans.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-16">
               <graphic url="COAC8_040.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Soho</name> tended to save dies, even those for unsuccessful coinages. After the demise of the firm, many of them were reused to create restrikes and mules by <name type="pname">W. J. Taylor</name>, a <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name> diesinker. Active between the 1860s and the 1890s, <name type="pname">Taylor</name> has made matters miserable for several generations of scholars and collectors of <name type="pname">Boultoniana</name>: many of his concoctions are readily identifiable, but others are not.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the case of the <name type="pname">Myddelton</name>/Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> mule, a restruck concoction by <name type="pname">Taylor</name> is definitely suggested. Photographs of the piece indicate rust spots, which is precisely what one encounters on other <name type="pname">Taylor</name> restrikes, pieces made decades after their purported date. Additionally, coins, tokens, and medals made at <name type="pname">Soho</name>, even those manufactured beyond their stated date, tend to have an internal consistency. Put another way, there are very few mules in the legitimate <name type="pname">Soho</name> series. This piece, with not one but two unrelated American references, strains credulity: the <name type="pname">Soho</name> coiners simply did not em-
<pb n="41"/>
brace that sort of practice. In my opinion, this hybrid is a later concoction, done outside the <name type="pname">Soho</name> Mint. But only a minute examination of the actual piece, its surfaces, and especially its edges (<name type="pname">Taylor's</name> edges are generally less precisely finished than <name type="pname">Soho's</name>) will tell for certain.</p>
            <p>There is a peculiarly episodic quality about <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name>'s Canadian connection. The next chapter in the story would take place in the early 1820s, a dozen years after <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>'s death. Like the initial contact of the 1790s, this one was abortive, but with a crucial difference. For the first period, we have coinage without archival testimony. For the second, we have archival testimony without coinage.</p>
            <p>This second stage in <name type="pname">Soho's</name> dealings with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> is represented by a single document in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name> Reference Library Collection. It is a reply to a letter of January 21, 1821, from <name type="pname">W. Richardson</name> of <name type="place">Halifax, Nova Scotia</name>. <name type="pname">Richardson</name> had written to <name type="pname">Boulton</name> and Watt (the branch of the firm which built steam engines, which eventually forwarded the letter to the coining branch of the operation), apparently requesting information on the firm's prices for preparing one or more orders of commercial tokens for Canadian circulation. <name type="pname">M. R. Boulton's</name> reply sets down the general parameters of a business arrangement:<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref>
               <q>Not possessing the advantage of being personally known to you, I hope it will not be deemed improper on my part, previous to our entering upon the subject of your letter, to beg the favor of a reference to some mercantile house of acknowledged respectability in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, who may be willing to take upon themselves the responsibility of answering my drafts for the amount of all your orders... It will also be requisite for your correspondent in this country to furnish me with a license from the Privy Council for Trade and Plantations, authorizing the export of these tokens, the making and shipping of which would otherwise be considered illegal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The younger <name type="pname">Boulton</name> was being prudent here: the firm had been less cautious in several other initial contacts, and it had occasionally paid dearly for its naiv�t�. But its polite request for credentials may have cost it dearly in this instance as well: we hear no more of Mr. <name type="pname">Richardson</name> in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name> Archives. And if he had tokens struck, they were not elaborated at <name type="pname">Soho</name>.</p>
            <p>What might they have been? As far as I have been able to determine, there are no tokens of this period from <name type="place">Nova Scotia</name>, or from any other Canadian province, made for a <name type="pname">Mr. Richardson</name>. It is con-
<pb n="42"/>
ceivable that he was involved in the semi-official <name type="place">Nova Scotian</name> halfpence and pence of 1823-1824. But these coins were most definitely not <name type="pname">Soho</name> products, with a standard of workmanship far inferior to anything emanating from the <name type="pname">Boulton</name> mint. At present, nothing further can be said, and we are simply left with one more instance of an initial contact left unfulfilled.</p>
            <p>The next contact would come during the later 1830s, and it would generate concrete results. <name type="pname">Soho</name> would carry through, actively solicit Canadian minting business, and create an excellent token coinage which would add much credit to its name, much vitality to an aging coinage operation.</p>
            <p>Between the beginning of 1838 and the spring of 1845, <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name> designed and produced no less than 90 tons of penny and halfpenny tokens for four fiscal institutions in Lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, the City Bank, the <name type="place">Quebec</name> Bank, and the <name type="place">Banque du Peuple</name>. During these activities, the venerable firm showed a surprising degree of celerity and panache, characteristics which stood in obvious contrast to the stodgy ways in which it had tended to conduct its affairs in previous years. Only replying by letter to an initial request made in late January 1838, <name type="pname">Soho</name> actually had dies engraved, copper rolled and struck, and the first batch of penny tokens (for the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>) out the door within three weeks' time.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> And the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name> coiners were soon sending them to their British port of debarkation by a newfangled, time-saving invention called a <hi rend="italic">railroad.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>What had happened? Why should <name type="pname">Soho</name> have behaved with an activity worthy of the elder <name type="pname">Boulton</name>, when it had very recently displayed a cheerful indifference to timeliness, an absentmindedness which drove its clients to distraction?<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The answer may be that the firm had just lost a lucrative piece of business, its lackadaisical tradition having perhaps been a factor. The severed connection had been in place for over 40 years, and it had been with one of the elder <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> targets of keenest interest, the <name type="place">United States</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. We need not go into details here, and in any case they are covered in an article I published in the <hi rend="italic">British Numismatic Journal.</hi> It must be admitted that there is no mention of habitual lateness in carrying out orders as a factor in the decision to end the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint's links with <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name>, either in the Mint Papers at the National Archives or in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name> Reference Library. But <name type="pname">Soho's</name> tardiness in filling and sending orders had annoyed the Mint on numerous occasions, and one virtue of the new, American supplier was that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> American, and hence somewhat more amenable of influence from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>.
<pb n="43"/>
In any event, <name type="pname">Matthew Robinson</name>
               <name type="pname">Boulton</name> and the other, aging members of the <name type="pname">Soho</name> operation must have gone through extensive soul-searching once the surprising and irrevocable decision of the Mint became known, and a determined resolve to do better with any future coining contracts would have been a logical reaction. And history would repeat itself: the disappearance of a moneying possibility with the Americans would, once again, inspire increased attention to the land to the north.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Soho's</name> tokens for Lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> bear dates of 1837, 1842, and 1844. The dates are generally inaccurate as to the time of manufacture. While 1842-dated issues actually were made in the summer of the year whose date they bear, the 1837 tokens were struck on several occasions from the winter of 1838 through the summer of 1839, while tokens dated 1844 were made well into 1845.<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> This was reasonably common procedure at <name type="pname">Soho</name>, as indeed it currently was or had been at many other mints, including our own. But confusion over the correct year to place on a die might explain the fact that there are also extremely rare halfpence dated 1845.</p>

            <p>These pence and halfpence featured two designs. The 1837 issues, for the four Lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> banks already mentioned, display a habitant or French-Canadian settler on their obverses. This figure was widely though incorrectly thought to be <name type="pname">Louis Joseph Papineau</name>, leader of an abortive rebellion against British rule in 1837, the date given on the reverse. The primary design on that side of these penny and halfpenny tokens was rendition of the arms of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. The name of the actual issuing bank may be seen in minute incused lettering on the ribbon beneath the arms <ref target="#fig-17">(figs. 3</ref>-<ref target="#fig-18">4)</ref>. This reverse was

retained for the issues of 1842 and 1844, but a frontal view of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> was substituted for the habitant <ref target="#fig-19">(figs. 5</ref>-<ref target="#fig-20">6)</ref>. I have been unable to uncover the name of the designer or designers of these tokens, although they may have been the products of <name type="pname">John Sheriff</name>, who was employed at <name type="pname">Soho</name> on Mexican coinage at the time the Canadian order was first discussed.<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref>

            <p>A progression of sorts exists in the Canadian activities of <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name> &amp; Company in the 1830s and 1840s. That is, the firm's first <name type="place">Quebec</name> coppers were created on behalf of several strictly private banking institution, while its second series had a quasi-official air about it. The Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> had secured what amounted to a monopoly for the importation and circulation of copper tokens before placing its second batch of orders with the <name type="pname">Soho</name> coiners:<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> from now on, <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name> would be coining for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> in at least a semi-official capacity.</p>
            <p>For New Brunswick, a logical end to this progression was achieved: in this case, <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name> would be coining a purely official, colonial issue for a Canadian province.</p>
            <p>The New Brunswick penny and halfpenny tokens were created in record time by <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name>. On August 4, 1842, <name type="pname">J. Tarratt</name> &amp; Company, of Ann Street, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name>, made enquiries to <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name> concerning a possible coinage for the province of New Brunswick. A list of charges was sent to <name type="pname">Tarratt</name> &amp; Company the following day.<ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> For the next several months, neither side appears to have pursued the issue: for <name type="pname">Soho</name> the younger <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> death
<pb n="45"/>
in mid-1842 would have complicated matters, as would have its current engagement with the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. But contact was resumed once the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> order had been finished: early in January 1843, a contract was drawn up between <name type="pname">Tarratt</name> &amp; Company and John Westley, on behalf of <name type="pname">Boulton, Watt</name>. Pence and halfpence were wanted, but speed was of the essence: a Captain <name type="pname">Dudne</name> was in Britain on business for the colony, and he hoped to return to <name type="pname">St. John</name>, with the tokens, at the end of February. The constraint of time in this particular instance (as well, I suspect, as a lingering memory of the loss of the <name type="place">United States</name> trade), inspired <name type="pname">Soho</name> to a celerity and an artistic excellence, a sort of numismatic grace under pressure, which would have done credit to the firm at any time during its career, and which was truly extraordinary this close to its end. <name type="pname">Soho's</name> estimate of charges for the coinage went out on January 6. More copper was arranged for the following day (for the coinage would exhaust the slender resources remaining after the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> order had been filled). An engraving of a frigate had been procured by the tenth; a rendition of this vessel would adorn the reverses of the new coppers.</p>
            <p>Metal for the issue was being rolled by the sixteenth. Dies were to be ready by the twenty-second (in the event, <name type="pname">Soho</name> had to wait until the second of February for them, <name type="pname">John Westley</name> explaining to the impatient Captain Dudne "that artists in our business are most notorious for procrastination, much to our annoyance"; he added that the delay would be worthwhile, considering the quality of the resulting tokens). Actual striking was under way by the middle of February, and this, the most crucial part of the operation, had been completed by about the end of the month. On March 1, Westley wrote Captain <name type="pname">Dudne</name> proudly to inform him that "I hope to have the pleasure to transmit the New Brunswick coinage per railway on Saturday next, the 4th instant, being six days before the time you gave us." And on the day following, Westley passed a final judgement on the new money. In a letter to <name type="pname">Thomas Jones Wilkinson</name>, he boldly said that "a more beautiful coinage was never before issued from our mint."<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>History supports this view. For all the speed with which it was executed, the New Brunswick coinage must certainly stand as one of <name type="pname">Soho's</name> loveliest creations. These are heavy pieces, the pence weighing 26 to the pound and the halfpence 52. The depiction of the frigate is rendered with the greatest attention to detail, while the head of the young Queen is charmingly presented <ref target="#fig-21">(figs. 7</ref>-<ref target="#fig-22">8)</ref>. These pieces are simply superb productions, and they invite comparison with the better-known Heaton issues of 1854.</p>

            <p>By that time, of course, <name type="pname">Soho</name> no longer existed, having gone out of business at mid-century; but since <name type="pname">Ralph Heaton</name> &amp; Sons had purchased the earlier firm's coining machinery, a direct line of descent exists between the issues of 1843 and those of 1854. Those machines, first developed by <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> and carefully tended by generations of <name type="pname">Soho</name> artisans, still had much work to do. And if a high degree of wear means anything, then the products they struck for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> enjoyed an eager and sustained acceptance among several generations of a growing nation. <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> could not have wished for a better, more lasting, Canadian legacy than this.</p>

               <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Coffin, Bart</name>., the individual responsible for ordering the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> token, also referred to as a <name type="pname">Penny</name>, was born in Boston on May 16, 1759. In 1773 he was appointed Midshipman in the British navy and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in only three years. He proved to be a capable young officer and continually rose through the ranks, eventually becoming an admiral in 1802 and a baronet in 1804.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>While still in the British navy, in 1786, he was appointed to the frigate <hi rend="italic">Thisbe</hi> and ordered to take <name type="pname">Lord Dorchester</name> and his family to <name type="place">Quebec</name>. While on his way up the river to <name type="place">Quebec</name> the <hi rend="italic">Thisbe</hi> was becalmed off the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name>s, in the St. <name type="place">Lawrence</name> River. <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> was struck by the islands and requested that <name type="pname">Lord Dorchester</name> bestow them on him. He was initially refused.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref>
               <name type="pname">W.A.B. Douglas</name> notes, however, that in 1787 <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> alerted the legislative council of <name type="place">Quebec</name> to American exploitation of the fisheries and illicit trade on the Iles de la Madeleine (The <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name>s). A committee of the council favored <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> "proprietor" of the islands. The matter was not acted on until 1795 when he raised the issue again with the Treasury in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, and letters patent were issued to <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> on April 24, 1798, for the seigneury of the islands. According to the terms of the grant, he was obliged to allow free access to the beaches and shores of the fishery. <name type="pname">W.A.B. Douglas</name> also notes that because of Coffin's professional abilities and reputed knowledge of the fisheries much "public utility" was expected from his proprietorship. As an absentee landlord acting through agents, however, he himself obtained nothing but aggravation.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref>

               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</name>, one of <name type="place">Canada's</name> premier numismatists, first addressed the topic of the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> token in 1880. He noted that while <name type="pname">Sandham</name> in 1869 gave a separate division to this coin, the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name>s are attached to the Province of <name type="place">Quebec</name>. At that time he believed that the penny was imported by some of the large fish dealers for change which was scarce on the islands.<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref>

            <p>In 1886, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_43194377">R. W. McLachlan</name> again addressed this topic, and noted that <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> visited his Canadian possession or kingdom only once and during this visit placed the token under consideration into circulation. He noted that the visit and the striking of the token was well described by the medallist <name type="pname">Sir Edward Thomason</name> in his "Memoirs during half a century" published in London in 1845 <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> quoted Sir <name type="pname">Thomason's</name> entire entry regarding the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> token which we deem worthy of repeating:
<q>1815. I had manufactured this year a large quantity of tokens for Admiral <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Coffin, Bart</name>., who is the sole possessor and king, as he calls himself, of the <name type="place">Magdalen
<pb n="51"/>
Island</name>s, situated in the Gulf of St. <name type="place">Lawrence</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>. They were principally of copper, pence and half-pence. The obverse was a seal, and the legend around the edge, "<name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> Token, 1815" The reverse, a split codfish; the legend "Success to the Fishery. One Penny."</q>
               <q>As soon as a large quantity of these were struck off, <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> sailed off with them, packed up in casks, and took with him a powerful coining press and machinery, and dies ready engraved, to establish what he called a little mint for his subjects to manufacture their coin for the future, on receiving the rolled copper from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, and disposing of the scrap part to the Americans. All this I arranged for him, agreeably to his wishes.</q>
               <q>On <name type="pname">Sir Isaac's</name> return to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, he informed me that the inhabitants paid him every attention and courtesy and were much delighted with the new coin which <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> advanced by way of loans to some of the superiors, at a fair interest, and for the expense that he had been at for their well-doing. They allowed him to institute a kind of poll tax, a trifle for each to pay annually to the Committee of Management, but no sooner had he left the <name type="place">Island</name>, but they broke faith and at the waters edge shouted out "Fouettez <name type="pname">King George</name> and <name type="pname">King Coffin</name>!" I have reason to believe that the Admiral never again went to visit his subjects.</q>

               <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> noted that "No specimen of the 'half-pence' mentioned in this memorandum has ever come to light." He felt that <name type="pname">Sir Edward</name>, writing from memory, took it for granted that there was a coinage of half-pence. He did concede, however, that such dies were prepared as noted by <name type="pname">Sir Edward</name>, and that they were probably sent to the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name>s with the coinage press.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref>
               <name type="pname">McLachlan's</name> conclusion regarding the half-pence has remained unchallenged to the present. But to our surprise, the landmark 1871 sale of the <name type="pname">Dr. Charles Clay</name> sale catalogued by <name type="pname">William Harvey</name> Strobridge, contains the following entry for lots 43 and 44:
<q>43. <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name>s. Pennies; Rev. dried fish. Two pieces. One uncirculated.</q>
               <q>44. do. Half Pennies. Fine. Two pieces.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Contemporary numismatic reports of the sale in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Mason's</name> Coin Collectors' Magazine</hi> are silent with respect to the lot in question. Perhaps the fact that lot 43 only brought 20 cents while lot 44 only brought the
<pb n="52"/>
lofty sum of 40 cents, coupled with the fact that the lot is not plated, accounts for the numismatic press of the day failing to realize the potential importance of the two half-pence listed in the sale. More importantly, no subsequent writer has challenged the entry as an error. We note, however, that <name type="pname">Ebenezer L. Mason</name> in the January 1872 issue of <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Mason's</name> Monthly Coin Collectors' Magazine</hi> commented about the extensive typographical and other errors found in the Clay sale;<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> unfortunately, he did not comment on the lot with the "two Half Pennies." Given the importance of that sale in its day, we are surprised that this lot went unreported. Nevertheless, in the absence of specific evidence to the contrary, and, despite <name type="pname">Mason's</name> criticism in general, the present writers are of the opinion that lot 44 of the Clay sale may represent examples of <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> Halfpennies, presumably from the aforementioned dies. Worthy of note is the fact that proofs of the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny were struck and, as we will develop, are far more common than uncirculated business strikes. Given the fact that proofs of the penny were struck, it seems unlikely that neither Sir Edward nor <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> obtained impressions from the Halfpenny dies. The two Halfpennies listed in the Clay sale may be such impressions. This, however, does not answer the question of why such a rarity existed only in circulated condition and why both of the specimens in question were identically described as in fine condition. If they exist, perhaps they were carried as pocket pieces.</p>
            <p>Returning to the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny, we note that it was first described by <name type="pname">Thomas Sharp</name> in his catalogue of the <name type="pname">Sir George Chet-wynd</name> collection published in 1834 in an edition of 60 copies. He accurately described the token noting that the edge was "engrailed-Halliday," referring to the fact that the dies were cut by Halliday. <name type="pname">Thomas</name> Halliday was one of the leading manufacturers of nineteenth century tokens, and was also a diesinker. He was known to have engraved many of <name type="pname">Sir Edward's</name> tokens including the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny. <name type="pname">Thomas Sharp</name> went on the describe two such tokens in <name type="pname">Sir George'</name>s collection; one noted as "fine bronzed impression," and the other noted as "another specimen - unbronzed." <name type="pname">Sir George's</name> collection was auctioned in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> in 1872, by <name type="pname">Christie, Manson and Woods</name>. Lot 549 of that sale contained a grouping that included a <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny without any further description.</p>
            <p>Typical specimens of the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny weigh between 17 and 18 g. <name type="pname">Warren Baker</name>, however, in his catalogue No. 33, at lot 343, offered for sale a plain edge test piece struck without a collar on a very thick flan of 3 mm which weighed 23.93 g That specimen was in extra fine condition and was described by <name type="pname">Mr. Baker</name> as having a small scratch on the obverse seal. He also noted the ex-
<pb n="53"/>
istence of one other such specimen that was in about very fine condition.</p>
            <p>We believe that all specimens, both proof as well as the business strikes, were struck from the same single pair of dies. We note that the obverse of proofs and high grade business strikes that we have examined all exhibit a shifted recut 5. We also note that the reverse of all proof and business strikes that we have examined contain what appears to be the remaining portion of the serif from the top of the Y to the right of the Y in <name type="pname">Penny</name>, and above the period between the Y in Penny, and the Y in Fishery. While we believe that all such specimens were struck from a single pair of dies, we note that lot 204 of the <name type="pname">Dr. A.N. Brushfield</name> sale by Glendining in 1945 contained two <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name>s pennies, one of which was described as struck from "cracked dies." We also note that in his fixed price list No. 12, October 1969, Lot 212, <name type="pname">Warren Baker</name> offered for sale the following described specimen:
<q>
                  <name type="pname">Breton</name> 520. <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> Token, a proof, but due to little rubbing now a.u: a die crack extends from right rim opposite "K" through "N" and to lower rim just left of date.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Regrettably it was not illustrated, and its exact nature cannot now be ascertained. If this specimen is indeed a proof and not a high grade business strike from a late state of the die as we suspect, it obviously raises the possibility that more than one obverse die was used as such a die break is generally not found in business strikes, and is unknown to the present writers on proofs. That business strikes are known from a cracked die is further confirmed by the following example offered for sale by <name type="pname">Warren Baker</name> in his list No. 32:
<q>Lot 27. <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny, v.f., obv. corrosion, somewhat affecting some letters, still presentable. Heavy die crack in right obv. border to rim to left rev. border.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We also note a further example in extra fine condition, with a planchet defect at top of coin in the <name type="place">United States</name> Coin Company sale of the <name type="pname">William Earl Hidden</name> collection (Oct. 15, 1914, lot 17).</p>
            <p>The most colorful description of a <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny is found in the 1884 <name type="pname">H. P. Smith</name> sale of the <name type="pname">Alfred Sandham</name> and <name type="pname">George Cushing</name> collection. Lot 148 of that sale which brought the sum of $2.10, contains the following entry:
<q>1815 <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> Penny: a seal on cake of ice: rev., a dried codfish: this is the finest specimen I have seen: but little circulated: the very bones of the cod are so distinct that one involuntarily grasps for his perfumed

            <p>The American Numismatic Society has a number of <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> pennies in its collection, two of which are described and illustrated herein, together with a counterstamped specimen in the author's collection:
<q>1. A proof formerly in the collection of Ambassador and <name type="pname">Mrs. R. Henry Norweb, Sr.</name> and noted in <name type="pname">Mrs. Norweb's</name> ledger which is also in the Society, as having been obtained from Tennant <ref target="#fig-23">(fig. 1)</ref>. According to <name type="pname">Fred Bowman, William B.</name>
                  <name type="pname">Tennant</name> was an enthusiastic collector who was convinced that he had an almost complete collection of Canadian coins and tokens. Following his death in 1943, his collection remained in the hands of his trustees until 1955 when it was purchased by the New Netherlands Coin Company on behalf of <name type="pname">Mr. R. Henry Norweb</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref>
               </q>

               </figure>
               <q>2. An example in fine condition, which is stamped twice with a quatrefoil, the meaning of which is unknown <ref target="#fig-24">(fig. 2)</ref>. This example which is also from the <name type="pname">Norweb</name> collection, is noted in <name type="pname">Mrs. Norweb's</name> ledger as having been obtained from Spink and Sons in 1955. We are aware of only three other counterstamped <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> pennies. One counterstamped twice "<name type="pname">Eugene H. Freeman</name>" was sold at auction in 1982 in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref> Unfortunately, the
<pb n="55"/>
catalogue did not illustrate this lot. Another was described by <name type="pname">D. T. Batty</name> in 1898 as being slightly circulated with a permanent countermark on obverse not injuring the surface of the coin, which will be further described below. Unfortunately, the countermark was not described. Lastly, we note a low grade specimen in the author's collection that is stamped <name type="pname">W. STEEL</name> twice on the obverse and numerous times on the reverse <ref target="#fig-25">(fig. 3)</ref>.</q>
               <figure xml:id="fig-25">

               </figure>
               <q>3. A high grade business strike from the collection of <name type="pname">Isaac J. Greenwood</name> in 1911.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Returning to the relevant numismatic literature, we note that following the publication of <name type="pname">Thomas Sharp's</name> catalogue of <name type="pname">Sir George Chetwynd's</name> collection in 1834, there are no references to the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny until <name type="pname">Rev. Henry Christmas</name> in 1862. The entry for the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny accurately describes it, but does not reveal any information of interest.<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>We next note an extreme rarity of Canadian numismatic literature issued in a very small quantity through the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> in 1863. Fred Bowman notes that in 1863 Adelard J. Boucher, the first president of that society, along with <name type="pname">Joshua L. Brondson</name>, and <name type="pname">James Rattery</name>, were commissioned by the society to compile a catalogue of Canadian coins. <name type="pname">Bowman</name> notes that this was the first catalogue of its kind but it was never published.<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref> Through the kind assistance of <name type="pname">Warren Baker</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, we had an opportunity to examine one of the few copies in existence of the partially completed work which is illustrated with plates by <name type="pname">W. Notman</name>. Of interest is the following remark: "No precisely corresponding half-penny has yet been met with."<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny did not escape the notice of German numismatic writers and collectors. It was listed by <name type="pname">Joseph Neumann</name> in his exhaustive work on copper coins published in 1863.<ref target="#CH4-n12">12</ref> In addition, examples were auctioned in the <name type="place">North American</name> section of the <name type="pname">Fonrobert</name> sale in 1877 by <name type="pname">Adolf Weyl</name> (lot 225); by <name type="pname">Adolph Weyl</name>
               <pb n="56"/>
again in his 147th sale in 1899 (lot 210), and by <name type="pname">Adolph Hess</name> in 1908 in his sale of the <name type="pname">George F. Ulex</name> collection (lot 117).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Alfred Sandham</name> described the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny in his work on the <hi rend="italic">Coins and Tokens of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>
               </hi> published in 1869.<ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref> His work was illustrated with an excellent line drawing, but shed no light on the half-penny.</p>
            <p>James Atkins also described the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny in 1889, noting that the islands contain about 2,000 people who are chiefly supported by the cod, herring and seal fisheries. He also pointed out that there was "[b]ut one token and that bears direct reference to the prevalent industry."<ref target="#CH4-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Both <name type="pname">Joseph LeRoux, M.D.</name> in <hi rend="italic">The Canadian Coins Cabinet</hi> published in 1892<ref target="#CH4-n15">15</ref> and <name type="pname">P.N.

               </hi> published in 1894<ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref> shed no further light on the mystery, although <name type="pname">Breton</name> notes that the half penny was never issued.</p>
            <p>The next important reference to the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny is found in <name type="pname">D.T. Batty's</name> monumental catalogue of British and Irish copper.<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref>
               <name type="pname">Batty</name> described proof pennies in both bronze and copper. He also described a "slightly circulated" penny that had a "permanent countermark on O (obverse), without injuring the surface of the coin." He made no comment regarding the half penny.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Robert W. McLachlan</name> revisited the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny in an address to The Royal Society of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> in 1915<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref> and again in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> that same year but shed no new light on the topic.<ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">William Butler</name> addressed the topic of the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny in an article in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> in 1924, but again did not add to our information.<ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Romance of <name type="place">Canada's</name> Money</hi> published in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> in 1933, Paul Montgomery erroneously concluded that the penny in question was coined in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> with a coining press manufactured in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Howard Kurth discussed the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny in 1942 in an extensive article on Canadian tokens. He stated that it was the only coin or token that he knew of that depicts a seal. He noted that the token was "quite scarce."<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref> The present authors believe that it is only scarce in grades above fine.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Robert C. Willey</name> in 1958 correctly noted, "this well-made coin comes on a somewhat thicker flan than most pennies of the early 19th century. Of some rarity, fine specimens have become ever more difficult to locate."<ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref>
               <name type="pname">Willey</name> returned to the topic in 1960 and noted that <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> intended to strike half pennies, "however, his plans were foiled by the arrival of a British man-of-war with official
<pb n="57"/>
notification that the right to coin money there pertained exclusively to the crown."<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">G. J. Dickie</name> discussed the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny in 1963. He believed that it was unlikely that <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> would have brought a cumbersome coin press to the islands, and therefore all of the tokens were struck in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. <name type="pname">Mr. Dickie</name> noted that <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> never revisited the Islands after he distributed his tokens, but that "[h]e and his descendants retained complete, if absentee, ownership and control of the islands. The relationship between inhabitants and the Coffin family was frequently stormy, with several rebellions against the arbitrary treatment meted out by their absentee landlords." He also noted that in 1903 a Canadian corporation, the "<name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> Company," bought out the heirs of Coffin, with the result that the islanders had control of their own affairs for the first time since 1787.<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>,</hi> authors <name type="pname">James A. Haxby</name> and <name type="pname">Robert C.

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, we note that <name type="pname">Sir Isaac</name> was responsible for one other issue of interest to numismatists. It is a medal commemorating his ancestor <name type="pname">Tristram Coffin</name> of <name type="place">Nantucket, Massachusetts</name>, and listed in <name type="pname">Betts</name> as number 533 <ref target="#fig-26">(fig. 4)</ref>. <name type="pname">Betts</name> described the medal as follows:
<q>533. Obv. TRISTRAM COFFIN THE FIRST OF THE RACE THAT SETTLED IN <name type="place">AMERICA</name>. Full length figure standing, facing, doublet, cloak, ruff and hat, upon a pedestal inscribed 1642. His right hand rests on his hip, and in his left hand he holds a staff.</q>

            <p>
               <name type="pname">Betts</name> notes that the medal was struck under the direction of Admiral <name type="pname">Sir Isaac Coffin</name>. He felt that it was struck at the beginning of the nineteenth century rather than at the time of the War of Independence as listed in <hi rend="italic">Medallic Illustrations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an aid in determining pedigree, to assist in determining the known specimens in high grade of the <name type="place">Magdalen Island</name> penny, some of the more important Canadian collections not previously mentioned, with examples grading very fine and above, are listed:</p>

            <p>In conclusion, much remains to be learned about this early Canadian token. The mystery of the so-called half penny may never be solved, although we believe, on the scanty evidence in the aforementioned Clay sale, and Sir Edward's memoirs, that patterns may exist. We know that proofs exist in both bronze and copper, and that all examples thus far examined by the authors appear to have been struck by just one pair of dies. We also know that some specimens were struck from late states of the dies and exhibit die cracks, the precise nature of which will have to await future study.</p>

            <p>Golden wedding anniversary medals constitute a rather unusual category of medallions. The type is in no way commonplace, and it seems rather extraordinary that <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> can lay claim to two medals of the first part of the nineteenth century. It is not peculiar that few such medals exist as couples of the era rarely attained the age together wherein such an event could take place. For those who did, it could only have been the elite that would have so distinguished it with the gift of bronze and silver medals commemorating the happy occasion.</p>
            <p>One of the early golden wedding medals to come to my attention is that struck in 1730 for <name type="pname">J.P. Winterbach,</name> Burgermeister of <name type="place">Rothenburg</name> and his wife, <name type="pname">Sophia M. Schilling</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> The first British medal known to me most closely related to our subject is that of the fortieth wedding anniversary of <name type="pname">Peter Mullman</name> and <name type="pname">Mary Chiswell</name> in 1774.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>
               <name type="pname">Sir Edward Thomason,</name> the great English medal manufacturer, talks of a medal ordered by <name type="pname">Robert Gilmor</name> of <name type="place">Baltimore,</name> the dies of which were finished in February, 1822, "to commemorate that his father and mother had lived in the marriage state in perfect harmony 50 years." According to <name type="pname">Thomason,</name> "a large number, consisting of gold, silver and bronzed, were struck off agreeable to <name type="pname">Mr. Robert Gilmor's</name> order, and the whole highly approved."<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref>

            <p>The two medals to be discussed have the distinction of being amongst the first medals struck for a purely Canadian subject. Earlier <name type="place">British</name> and French medals commemorating military conquests, and those awarded to the <name type="place">Indians</name> as tokens of allegiance to either crown, are considered as representative of their respective nations.</p>
            <p>In the case of the first medal, that of <name type="pname">Powell/Murray,</name>
               <ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> it goes unchallenged as the first for Upper Canada. The <name type="place">Quebec</name> Fishing Club medal,<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> according to <name type="pname">Norman Willis</name> bears "the earliest date, 1825, on a medal assumed to be of wholly Canadian origin ..."<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref> In fact this is an error originating with <name type="pname">Leroux</name>, who while giving the proper date, 1826, in his text description, illustrated the piece with the date 1825. The mistake was repeated by <name type="pname">Breton</name>, through to <name type="pname">Willis</name> 80 years later. At the same time <name type="pname">Willis</name> rightly points out that the date on the medal probably represents the year in which the club was established, not necessarily the year of its issuance. Nevertheless, if we take the dates indicated on the medals, viz. that of Oct. 3, 1825 for the Powell medal, and July 1826 for the <name type="place">Quebec</name> Fishing Club piece, the Powell clearly antedates the latter by a full nine months, and takes the place of honor as <name type="place">Canada's</name> first medal. <name type="pname">McLachlan's</name> description of the medal is as follows:

               <name type="pname">William Dummer Powell</name> and <name type="pname">Anne Murray</name>
               <ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref> were married in Boston in 1775 after what appears to have been a very short courtship. The wedding took place without parental consent. Opposed to the revolutionary party, William decided to leave <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>, sailing for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> with <name type="pname">Anne</name> soon after the marriage. They lived variously in <name type="place">Norfolk, London</name> and <name type="pname">Norwich</name> while <name type="pname">William</name> studied law in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>. By 1779, unable to afford the fees for his formal call to the bar, he departed for <name type="place">Quebec</name> on the recommendation of <name type="pname">William</name> Grant, former attorney general of <name type="place">Quebec</name>, a relative of <name type="pname">Powell's</name> mother. However, Powell was not well received. The Governor, <name type="pname">Sir Frederick Haldimand</name>, had an aversion to Americans, and considered all, even loyalists, to be tainted. To make matters worse for <name type="pname">Powell,</name> he considered lawyers contemptible. It was therefore recommended to Powell by the then attorney general, <name type="pname">James Monk,</name>
               <ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> and a brother-in-law to be, <name type="pname">Isaac Winslow Clarke</name>, the deputy commissary general, that he quit the capital and set up private practice in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. This suggestion he immediately seized upon and his practice soon developed into a highly successful one, enabling him to acquire a house on <name type="place">Mount Royal</name> for his wife and three sons whom he had brought out from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. His first and most famous case was the defence of <name type="pname">Pierre du Calvet</name> charged with libelling two of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas. <name type="pname">Powell</name> had been advised not to take the case, advice he chose to ignore. He triumphed in the matter, but it was an unpopular victory and with it he earned for himself the enmity of several of the ruling class. There soon after were accusations concerning his loyalty, suspicions that were renewed by his enemies time and again throughout his life.</p>
            <p>In 1789, <name type="pname">Powell</name> was appointed first judge of common pleas at Detroit, a position he occupied not without severe problems as well as a couple of lengthy leaves of absence, for about five years. At this time, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4990729">Detroit</name> and <name type="place">Michilimackinac</name> were controlled by <name type="place">Britain</name> and were under the jurisdiction of the District of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. As important fur trade centers, it had proven a great inconvenience that no courts closer than <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> could handle the quantity of litigation that would naturally occur in the course of the complicated trade. <name type="pname">Powell</name> had either represented or opposed many of the prime movers in the trade, such <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> merchant outfitters as <name type="pname">McTavish,</name>

            <p>The Constitutional Act of 1791 had divided the province of <name type="place">Quebec</name> into the two provinces of Upper and Lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. The former's capital was at <name type="place">Newark</name>,<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref>

               <name type="pname">Powell</name> had hoped that on the formation of a new province he would be elected its first Chief Justice, but was passed over for the less experienced <name type="pname">William Osgoode</name>. In October 1794, his tenure at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4990729">Detroit</name> having ended, he removed to <name type="place">Niagara.</name> The position of Chief Justice would further elude him under successive Lieutenant-Governors, <name type="pname">Peter Russell</name> and <name type="pname">Peter Hunter,</name> and it was not until well toward the end of the administration of Francis Gore that he gained the office he had long felt entitled to.<ref target="#CH5-n12">12</ref>

               <name type="pname">Alfred Sandham</name> is the first to record the <name type="pname">Powell</name> medal. In 1869, he states, "...during a visit to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, in 1825, he (<name type="pname">Powell</name>) caused dies to be prepared, and these medals were struck for circulation among his personal friends. They were in gold, silver, and copper, and the number struck was about 60 in all. We have never met with a copy, and are indebted to <name type="pname">Mr. Groh</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> for a rubbing, from which we take the description."<ref target="#CH5-n13">13</ref>
               <name type="pname">McLachlan</name>, who by 1886 had not seen a specimen of the medal, agreed with <name type="pname">Sandham</name>'s estimate of about 60 medals having been struck, and places it "as of the highest degree of rarity, although it has appeared in sales rather frequently."<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> He knew of but two in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, one in the Government Collection at <name type="place">Ottawa</name> (now National Archives) and the other in a private <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> collection, likely that of <name type="pname">Gerald Hart.</name>
               <ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The medals that were reported to <name type="pname">Sandham</name> and <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> were likely copper examples as it is only very much later that silver pieces become recorded. Fifteen of the copper medals and four silver specimens have been accounted for. The first silver <name type="pname">Powell</name> medal to come to my attention had been acquired by <name type="pname">John Ford</name> from the Brand estate. That medal, along with a <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> silver was exchanged by <name type="pname">Ford</name> to <name type="pname">Doug Ferguson</name> around 1964.<ref target="#CH5-n16">16</ref> Another piece had been acquired by a private collector in <name type="place">Ontario</name> in 1954 from the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> dealer, <name type="pname">Jules Mero</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref> A third silver medal, as well as a specimen in copper had been secured in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> by Bill Barrett around 1983.<ref target="#CH5-n18">18</ref> The last of the four silver medals known to me was only recently discovered. Appropriately, it was acquired from a <name type="pname">Powell</name> descendent by an indefatigable acquisitor by the name of <name type="pname">Hugh MacMillan.</name> Other copper medals are reported to be in the hands of family members, cherished mementos of an illustrious family. The unique gold medal for <name type="pname">Anne Murray</name> surfaced in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> only four years ago. It was purchased from a collector who had acquired it from a local <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> coin dealer. The medal had, previous to that, belonged to a descendent who, quite properly, had the given name <name type="pname">William</name> Dummer Powell.<ref target="#CH5-n19">19</ref> As late as the 1970s, he was said to have been seen scuba diving in <name type="place">Boca Raton, Florida,</name> sporting the medal suspended from a chain around his neck.<ref target="#CH5-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="68"/>
            <p>When the <name type="pname">Powell/Murray</name> medals were actually struck and distributed will probably never be known with certainty, but in order to arrive at a likely approximation it is necessary to trace <name type="pname">William's</name> movements from sometime before the anniversary, as well as for the period shortly after the event.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Powell</name> had been hurt and angered as a result of having been replaced as commissioner to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> in the matter of settling the division of customs duties between Upper and Lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. His replacement was <name type="pname">John Beverley Robinson,</name> the attorney general, a man <name type="pname">Powell</name> considered his prot�g�. In need of a rest, <name type="pname">Powell</name> indicated his intention of going to <name type="place">Bermuda.</name> Instead, around January 21, 1822, he left for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, via <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>. He would, at the same time, try to obtain a sum he considered long due him from the government.<ref target="#CH5-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The thought of a medal for his beloved <name type="pname">Anne</name> for their approaching fiftieth anniversary could have been on <name type="pname">William's</name> mind when in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> in 1822. The <name type="pname">Gilmor</name> medal had been struck earlier that year and could possibly have come to his attention if he had made inquiries about having one made. On April 20 of that year he writes (from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>) that he would "even coin myself into Gold if I could thereby afford you a single Hour of perfect Satisfaction. Mine and my highest is the grateful remembrance of your past kindness and the delightful hope of still experiencing in your affection the only solid Comfort I have ever known. God bless and preserve you all."<ref target="#CH5-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>But if <name type="pname">Powell</name> at that time had contemplated a medal, the thought must soon have been abandoned, for two days later occurred one of the great tragedies in the <name type="pname">Powells'</name> lives. Their daughter, <name type="pname">Anne,</name> had had an infatuation with <name type="pname">John Beverley Robinson</name>. <name type="pname">Robinson</name> had travelled to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> after the War of 1812 in order to further his legal training. <name type="pname">Anne</name> had succeeded in convincing her father that she should accompany him to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> and arrived a few months after <name type="pname">Robinson,</name> only to find that he had become engaged to a lady named <name type="pname">Emma Walker</name>. <name type="pname">Robinson</name> family legend has it that <name type="pname">Anne</name> continued her pursuit of <name type="pname">Robinson</name> in a most obsessive fashion. Nevertheless, five years after his marriage to <name type="pname">Emma Walker</name>, <name type="pname">Robinson</name> made the mistake of casually inviting <name type="pname">Anne</name> to travel with him and his wife to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n23">23</ref> This was very much against his wife's and <name type="pname">Anne's</name> family's wishes. <name type="pname">Anne's</name> family, anticipating her eagerness to join the couple, virtually incarcerated her, but she escaped from her home, arriving in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> with plans to set sail for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. Her uncle, <name type="pname">George Murray,</name> arranged for her to sail on the <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi>, a ship carrying other female passengers. The ship was caught in a violent

storm, and after taking on water for several days, was wrecked off the coast of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>. <name type="pname">Anne</name> was drowned in full sight of horrified spectators on the shore. Her death absolutely devastated the <name type="pname">Powells.</name>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Powell</name> returned home to <name type="place">York</name> after making the final arrangements for his daughter, <name type="pname">Anne,</name> who was buried in the churchyard of <name type="place">Templetrine</name>. In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, he had stayed with his brother-in-law, <name type="pname">Charles Murray,</name> and an active exchange of letters was carried on after <name type="pname">Powell's</name> return to <name type="place">York.</name>
               <ref target="#CH5-n24">24</ref>
               <name type="pname">Murray</name> may well have been helpful in procuring the medals for the couple's anniversary. Seventeen years later, no doubt influenced by the medal for their aunt and uncle, the children of <name type="pname">Charles and Elizabeth</name>
               <name type="pname">Murray</name> had struck a medal to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of their parent's marriage.<ref target="#CH5-n25">25</ref> The medal's design, however, is entirely different, and the sentiment is a family one, rather than a personal one as exhibited on the <name type="pname">Powell</name> medal. The description of the medal is as follows:

            <p>One would have expected the <name type="pname">Powell/Murray</name> anniversary to have been the social event of the year, attended by members of the Family Compact as well as friends and relatives from afar. The occasion is virtually never mentioned.<ref target="#CH5-n26">26</ref> In fact, this was a very unhappy period of their lives. <name type="pname">Powell's</name> earlier discontent over not having been named commissioner to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> had escalated into open rancor.
<pb n="70"/>
He offended other members of the Executive Council with the publication of two pamphlets in late 1824 which assailed the Governor, <name type="pname">Sir Peregrine Maitland,</name> and addressed the slight he had felt in the case of <name type="pname">John Beverley Robinson.</name> The material that he used for these attacks was of a private nature, being personal correspondence. This sounded the end of a long and brilliant career for <name type="pname">Powell.</name> He sat as Chief Justice and Speaker for the last time on July 2, 1825, and was obliged to resign from the Executive Council in September, being replaced by <name type="pname">William Campbell</name> as both speaker and Chief Justice on October 24, 1825, a mere three weeks after the golden wedding anniversary.</p>
            <p>The only reference found concerning the celebration, if such it can be called, comes in a very subdued letter to his brother-in-law, <name type="pname">George Murray</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, written on October 8, from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. <name type="pname">Powell</name> had left <name type="place">York</name> for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> the day after the anniversary: "... your Sister wears well and supports the Change [<name type="pname">Powell's</name> retirement] without complaint &amp; I believe feels no regret but the diminished power of rendering service.

<q>Have the goodness to say what the die &amp; each of the bronze &amp; silver medals cost you, that I may provide according'y, whether in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, or the United States. Excuse this liberty &amp; oblige D.S.<ref target="#CH5-n33">33</ref>

            <p>Alas, the letter responding to this question, if indeed there was an answer, is not extant or has yet to be located. This may be due to the fact that the <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> family papers, in contrast to those of the <name type="pname">Powell</name> family, are unlocated, perhaps yet with descendants, or destroyed.</p>
            <p>Doubtless, the <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>/<name type="pname">Robertson</name> medal could not have been struck in time for the celebration. Assuming <name type="pname">Powell</name> was to write <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> with the information by return mail, the answer could have arrived no earlier in <name type="place">Quebec</name> than the first couple of days of September. The letter would have probably been sent overland to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> on one of the fast sailing packets which would arrive in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> in about a month. Clearly, the medals could not have arrived in <name type="place">Quebec</name> before the end of May or beginning of June the following year. Let us hope they arrived by then, for two months
<pb n="73"/>
later, on August 19, 1832, <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> became another victim of the cholera epidemic which had been particularly devastating in <name type="place">Quebec</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> that year. Had there been a delay in the striking of the medals, or in shipping them out, it is entirely possible that <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> never saw them. Margaret Robertson eventually must have received her gold medal. The discovery of an inventory of her estate, found by <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> in the files of <name type="pname">John Griffin,</name> the notary, an early associate of <name type="pname">Daniel Sutherland</name>, is of great interest: "One Gold Medal, value 40 Shillings." <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> states, "at the rate of 5 shillings currency to the dollar, this would give its estimated value as $8.00, which taking the size of the medal into consideration, being larger than a $20 gold piece, would indicate that it was only plated or that the appraisers did not know its value."<ref target="#CH5-n34">34</ref> The assessment was under the heading of "Trinkets," so little thought was given to the medal, but it is probable that the medal valued at 40 shillings was the <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>/<name type="pname">Robertson</name> commemorative.</p>
            <p>The <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> medal was apparently unknown to <name type="pname">Sandham</name> and is first described by <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> who took his description from a specimen in the collection of the <name type="place">Quebec</name> numismatist, Cyrille Tessier, apparently a descendent of the couple.<ref target="#CH5-n35">35</ref> It is rarer than the <name type="pname">Powell</name> medal although the celebration, in contrast to that of the <name type="pname">Powells',</name> appears to have been joyous and well attended. The event also received appropriate attention in the press which recorded the celebration:
<q>On Thursday evening last an elegant entertainment was given by Mr. and Mrs. <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> at their house on <name type="pname">St. Ursule St.</name> in celebration of their 50th anniversary of their wedding day. About 200 persons were present. It was gratifying to see the hospitable host and hostess appear in excellent health and spirits. F�tes in commemoration of the grand jubilee of the day of marriage cannot be of every day occurrence, and when they do happen, it is still more rare to find both parties able to endure, much less to promote with so much hilarity, the festivities of an evening party in the manner which was done on the occasion we record.<ref target="#CH5-n36">36</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The quantity of medals struck would likely coincide with the size of the respective families. The <name type="pname">Powells'</name> family far exceeded that of the <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>s'. The medals, which were unquestionably not given at the celebrations, were likely presented to family members only, with perhaps the occasional one to a close friend.<ref target="#CH5-n37">37</ref> Based on the known medals, and the fact that <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> pieces appear to be much scarcer than those for the <name type="pname">Powell</name> anniversary, it is my opi-
<pb n="74"/>
nion that silver medals were given to the children, while sisters, brothers, grandchildren, etc. would have been offered copper ones. The Powells had five surviving children, and about ten grandchildren as well as several brothers and sisters each. The <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>s had three children, and Daniel had two sisters; his wife, <name type="pname">Margaret Robertson,</name> had two sisters and a brother. This would suggest that there were five silver medals for the <name type="pname">Powell</name> children, of which four are located today, and a goodly number of copper examples for the large <name type="pname">Powell/Murray</name> family.<ref target="#CH5-n38">38</ref> The <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>s would have had three silver medals struck of which two are known today; the copper specimens were, due to the small size of the family, probably struck in a very limited quantity, accounting for its scarcity today.<ref target="#CH5-n39">39</ref> The gold medal is as yet unlocated, a challenge for some enterprising numismatist.</p>
            <p>When did <name type="pname">Powell and Sutherland</name> meet and develop what would be a lifetime friendship? The precise date is not known, but it would likely have been around 1787 when <name type="pname">Powell</name> represented many of the more important fur trade interests in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> was in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4990729">Detroit</name> in 1791 and would no doubt have come into contact with Powell. His father-in-law, <name type="pname">Daniel Robertson,</name> as commander at <name type="place">Michilimackinac</name> would certainly have been well known to <name type="pname">Powell</name> when judge at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4990729">Detroit</name>. By 1790, <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> was offered a share in the North West Company, but in 1795, suffering financial problems, he sold his interest back. Three years later, he became involved in a new firm, the New North West Company, sometimes styled the XY Company, probably to differentiate the bale markings XY from those of the NW Company. In 1806, two years after the amalgamation of the old and new company, he retired from the fur trade. In 1807, he was appointed postmaster of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, and in 1816, moving to <name type="place">Quebec</name>, succeeded <name type="pname">George Heriot</name> as deputy postmaster general of British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>. In 1827 he retired from the Post Office, his son-in-law, <name type="pname">Thomas Allen Stayner</name> succeeding him as the new deputy postmaster general.<ref target="#CH5-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Many years later that friendship, now between the two couples, was firmly established. <name type="pname">Powell</name> had visited the <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>s shortly after his anniversary, on his trip to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. <name type="pname">Anne</name> writes <name type="pname">William</name> (in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>) from <name type="place">York</name> on October 27, 1825: "I hope you will assure the <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>s and other friends (if there are any) of my regards."<ref target="#CH5-n41">41</ref> Another letter, from <name type="pname">William</name> to <name type="pname">Anne</name> on November 1, 1825, likely in response to hers of the 27th, states: "... <name type="pname">Sutherland</name> and his family, the Coffins and their connections, and the <name type="pname">Taylors</name> are warm in their expressions of grateful remembrance of your virtues and kindness to them ..."<ref target="#CH5-n42">42</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="75"/>
            <p>The issue of where the <name type="pname">Powell/Murray</name> and <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>/<name type="pname">Robertson</name> medals were struck is yet another question that may never be absolutely proven. There is no evidence that any medals were struck in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> until the 1830s.<ref target="#CH5-n43">43</ref> In the case of the <name type="pname">Sutherland</name>/Robertson medal, there having been such a rush, it is likely that a manufacturer in the <name type="place">United States</name> was sought in order to expedite the production of the medal.<ref target="#CH5-n44">44</ref> But the superior <name type="pname">Powell</name> medal could have only been produced in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, and it is likely that it came from the <name type="pname">Thomason</name> manufactory. In his memoirs <name type="pname">Sir Edward Thomason</name> makes the following rather bold statement:
<q>His Royal Highness the <name type="place">Duke of Saxe Weimar</name>, in 1825 and 1826, travelled through the <name type="place">United States,</name> and I understood he was present at the completion of the Grand Canal, uniting the <name type="place">Erie</name> with the <name type="place">Atlantic.</name> The American Government employed their best artist in medal engraving to engrave a pair of medal dies (of small size, about one inch and a quarter in diameter) to commemorate this important undertaking, which was accomplished towards the end of the year 1825.</q>
               <q>The Duke, on his return, landed at <name type="place">Liverpool,</name> and called upon me as he passed through <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name>, and was so obliging as to present me with one of the American medals. His Royal Highness was well aware of the inferiority of the workmanship, both as to the execution of the dies and the making of the medal; but it was the best their artist could do. As so important an event was worth recording upon a medal, I had a pair of dies engraved, about four times the size, by one of my first artists, the <hi rend="italic">allegory</hi> of the medal being exactly a <hi rend="italic">facsimile</hi> of theirs. On the <hi rend="italic">Obverse</hi> was a River God encouraging Neptune for a time, whilst he conducted him to the River Erie, the <hi rend="italic">Legend</hi>, "Union of Erie with the Atlantic." On the <hi rend="italic">Reverse</hi> was the Eagle standing upon, and in the attitude of protecting one-half of the Globe. A ship at a distance— an escutcheon with the sun rising out of the water, and in a garter the word EXCELSIOR. The Legend "Erie Canal, commenced 4th July, 1817, completed 26th October, 1825."</q>
               <q>The Americans were delighted with this production, and seemed to acknowledge, without jealousy, the vast distinction between English and American artists.<ref target="#CH5-n45">45</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Clearly, <name type="pname">Thomason</name> was seeking an entry into the <name type="place">North American</name> market, boasting that his product was far superior to anything in
<pb n="76"/>
the United States. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> would certainly be a prime marketplace, there being no facilities for the striking of medals. It is possible that <name type="pname">Powell</name> had been aware of a medal for a fellow <name type="place">North American</name> in 1822, and had one ordered on his return to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> in 1826 while awaiting <name type="pname">Anne</name> who was to make the sacrifice of leaving her children behind to follow <name type="pname">William</name> later in the year. A gold medal would have been a deserving reward.</p>
            <p>The friendship between the two couples likely dates from before <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> was divided in 1791 when it incorporated the vast area called the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>n Territories, from the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi, northward to the southern boundary of the <name type="pname">Hudson's</name> Bay Company lands. It is fitting that two of <name type="place">Canada's</name> earliest medals commemorate two of its important families, in both government and mercantile affairs, and represent the capitals of both the Upper and Lower Canadian provinces.</p>

               <p>This is a reversal of what I had originally stated.

            <p>The discussion of Canadian numismatics in a historical context can engender some discomfort. First, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> does not have a long numismatic history and then, when a national currency did appear, it had very little relationship to the monetary difficulties of earlier times. It does not reflect the struggles and the problems with which the average person, whether consumer, shop-keeper or manufacturer, had to contend in carrying out his daily activity. However, there is an area of Canadian numismatics which does reflect these difficulties, that is paper money and the institutions which issued it. Until the eve of Confederation, paper money was issued and circulated by the various banks which operated under provincial charters. Some of these were founded to satisfy a real economic need; some because business interests in a given district felt that they were not being treated fairly by the existing banks; and still others as a matter of civic pride.</p>
            <p>One of the puzzles in the Canadian bank note field is the so-called "English Issues" of the 1850s of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. Discussion of this topic requires consideration of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> itself, some of the principles by which Canadian banks functioned, and then the notes themselves.<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, founded in 1817, was for over 100 years the dominant bank in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, although from time to time it was forced to share some of its prominence with other institutions such as the Bank of British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>.</p>
            <p>The bank was founded as the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> Bank and opened on November 27, 1817. The directors authorized the opening of an agency in <name type="place">Quebec</name> on December 17, 1817. The opening of agencies in Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> soon followed: Kingston and <name type="place">York</name> (<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>) in 1818, Queenston and Amherstburg in 1819 and Perth in 1820. In 1822, the directors of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> Bank received a charter from the Legislature of Lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> to operate under the name The Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>.</p>
            <p>In 1824 the Legislature of Upper Canada, influenced by its own supporters and by local business interests which had favored the opening of The Bank of Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, <name type="place">York</name> in 1821, enacted legislation prohibiting banking operations in the province unless the head office of the bank was also located in the province. As a result of this legislation the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> closed its agencies in Upper Canada.</p>
            <p>During the next 15 years the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> conducted its affairs in a steady, if unspectacular manner. It took over the business of the faltering Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, another <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> based bank which found itself in difficulty. Surviving the depression of 1837-38 and
<pb n="83"/>
the Rebellions of the same years, the bank again cast its eyes toward the business market of Upper Canada. This time in 1840, to comply with the provincial legislation, it purchased the Bank of the People which had its head office in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>.</p>
            <p>In 1841, the political situation changed. The Rebellions of 1837-38 in both Upper and Lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> had their roots in the conflict between political elite who wanted to retain their aristocratic privilege and reformers who wanted a representative government. The rebellions were put down but as a consequence, the two <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>s were united to form the Province of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, with first Kingston, then <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> as its capital. Lower <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> was designated <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East and Upper Canada, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West.</p>
            <p>With the new political arrangement the banks, in theory, could operate anywhere in the province. In reality, however, the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> still did not have the authority to open branches or agencies in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West until the proclamation of the Currency and Banking Acts in April 1842. Within a week of the passing of the Bank Act, the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> closed the Bank of the People and operated a branch in its own name out of the premises of the Bank of the People.</p>
            <p>The Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> reorganized to meet the new challenge. The province was divided into three districts with the head office in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> and district or branch offices in <name type="place">Quebec</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>. Each branch office had its own president and board of directors with the authority to conduct business, such as establishing agencies in its area, subject to the right of veto, at all times, by the Board of Directors in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. The bank notes issued by the district offices were to be signed by the branch president and the cashier (manager) and were to be redeemable in specie at that branch. By the fall of 1842 the reorganization was complete.</p>
            <p>The Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> also served as the Government's bank. In reality, this meant the bank held the Government's accounts, advanced the Government funds to carry out its obligations, and accordingly enjoyed the major share of the public works business.</p>
            <p>In 1849, a bill was introduced in the Legislature to recompense citizens who had suffered losses in the Rebellions. Many of the leaders of the Rebellions were now sitting as members of the Legislature, as were their former opponents. Since the rebels had suffered most of the losses, the loyalists felt and argued that under the terms of the bill the rebels would be rewarded for their treason. Feelings on both sides ran high. The bill passed and when the Governor-General, <name type="pname">Lord Elgin</name> (of the <name type="pname">Elgin Marbles</name> fame) signed, giving Royal assent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, rioting broke out
<pb n="84"/>
in the streets of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, led by the loyalist(?) middle class element who resented their tax money being spent in this manner. On April 25, 1849, the Parliament House in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> was burned to the ground. The Government then moved to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>.</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed that, when the Government moved from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>, the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> lost its position as the Government's bank to the Bank of Upper <name type="place">Canada.</name> This is simply not the case. Bank management was becoming more concerned about the Government's methods of financing its obligations. The Government approached both the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> and the Bank of British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name> and when both respectfully declined, then turned to the Bank of Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> which became the Government's bank from January 8, 1850 to December 31, 1863.</p>
            <p>The provincial Government found itself in constant need of more and more revenue to finance its commitments. As early as 1848, <name type="pname">Francis Hincks,</name> the Inspector General, in effect the Minister of Finance, realized that issuing its own notes was a most effective way of increasing government revenue. The chartered banks who had the sole responsibility for issuing notes under the terms of their charters bitterly opposed what they perceived to be government intrusion into their traditional domain. So in 1866 when <name type="pname">Alexander Galt,</name> the current Minister of Finance, again proposed that, in return for certain government concessions, the banks suspend their own note issues and act as fiscal agents for the Government, only <name type="pname">E.H. King,</name> general manager of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> agreed. The Government's offer was not restricted but in reality there were only four banks with branch networks capable of carrying out note distribution throughout the entire province.</p>
            <p>The Commercial Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and the Bank of Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> had their own financial problems as a result of railroad speculation, the collapse of land values, and the depression of 1857-58. The last thing in the world these institutions desired was surrendering a sure source of revenue, or closer government scrutiny of their affairs. The Bank of British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>, with its Board of Directors in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, was not really interested in resolving Canadian political difficulties. The Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> suspended its own note issue in 1866. This arrangement remained, even after Confederation, until 1871 when the Ministry of Finance assumed responsibility for the new Dominion's note issues.</p>
            <p>The management of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> has been praised for its farsightedness in accepting the government proposal. Indeed the close association between the bank and the Government continued long after the formal dissolution of the agreement in 1871. The Bank
<pb n="85"/>
of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> continued to serve as the Dominion Government's Bank in both domestic and foreign fiscal matters until the formation of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> in 1934.</p>
            <p>The development of banks and banking in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> followed quite a different path from that in <name type="place">United States</name>. In the <name type="place">United States</name> banks sprang up in communities as individual, independent, local enterprises. In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, banking followed the branch bank system. One of the enduring myths in Canadian numismatics is that branch banking in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> was borrowed from the Scottish system. The Bank of British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name> basically followed Scottish banking practices and is generally credited with introducing branch banking into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. However, as the Bank of British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name> did not operate in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> until 1837 and, as the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> operated a series of branches from 1818 and, as the Bank of Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> by its charter of 1819 was required to open and operate branches, let us hope that this myth will be finally laid to rest and that credit for pioneering branch banking be given, where it properly belongs, to the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. It is difficult to quarrel with <name type="pname">Merrill Dennison,</name> the author of the <hi rend="italic">History of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>
               </hi> who states, "branch banking [in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>] owed as much to the exigencies of geography and politics as to the assimilation of systems elsewhere."</p>
            <p>This branch bank system with a head office and branches or agencies in other areas meant that any branch or agency which found itself in difficulty could draw on the resources of the whole bank rather than be forced to face a crisis on its own. One might also argue that the public was better protected by use of internal auditors sent by a head office of a bank which had a financial stake in the operation of the branches than by state examiners who were public servants.</p>
            <p>In addition to the city where the bank was domiciled, many bank notes also had the name of the branch stamped or engraved on them. This practice had its roots in a fundamental economic principle that every nineteenth or early twentieth century Canadian banker knew, but many of us may have forgotten. Bank notes were not money, only gold and silver were. Canadian bank notes were, in essence, bearer promissory notes convertible to specie on demand. The notes stated clearly "will pay" or "promise to pay the bearer on demand." The purpose of an overprint was not to limit the circulation of a note to a particular area, although this was often the effect, but rather to restrict its convertibility. Until 1890, a bank was required to redeem its notes only at the head office or at the branch indicated on the note. This measure was designed to prevent other banks from amassing quantities of notes, and then presenting them at a small
<pb n="86"/>
branch which might not have sufficient specie on hand to redeem all notes, thereby causing a "run" on the bank.</p>
            <p>After the reorganization of 1842, the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> used two distinct sets of notes—one for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East which was subdivided into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> and <name type="place">Quebec</name> issues, and the other, with a completely different design, for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West and issued from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>On the notes dated 1849, the partially engraved date was replaced by the fully engraved date—January 1, 1849, on the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East issues and May 1, 1849, on the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West issues <ref target="#fig-34">(fig. 1)</ref>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Both issues had red word protectors and space was provided for the signatures of two signing officers.

               <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, but the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West issues have <name type="pname">Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson,</name>

            <p>We do not know whether the shift of the Government's accounts to the Bank of Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> in 1850 had any bearing on the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>'s decision to abandon its separate issues for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West, and adopt a single issue for the entire Province. However, printer's face proofs on card stock exist for a radical, new issue of notes, with the same basic design for all denominations.</p>
            <p>The serial number, the office, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> and the date, July 1, 1851, were added by letterpress <ref target="#fig-35">(fig. 2)</ref>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-36">

            </figure>
            <p>These proofs form the basis for the issue of 1852, the so-called "English Issue" <ref target="#fig-36">(fig. 3)</ref>; an issue which conventional wisdom either
<pb n="88"/>
ignored or dismissed as an issue withdrawn because of extensive counterfeiting.</p>
            <p>As all researchers are aware, one of the most difficult problems to be faced is locating sufficient material on which to base a premise. This problem is particularly acute in dealing with bank notes given the fragile nature of the pieces, and it is further compounded if the notes are redeemable. Banks were very thorough in withdrawing older notes once a new issue was released, simply to avoid confusion, and in mid-nineteenth century <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> no one was putting aside redeemable notes as souvenirs.</p>
            <p>Once the notes were grouped by region, it immediately became clear that the letter prefix established both the district and the denomination. The upper letters A, B, and C represented <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, <name type="place">Quebec</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>; the lower letter, the denomination from one dollar to ten dollars.</p>

            <p>The <name type="place">Quebec</name> office and the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> office had identical denomination letters, while the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> office set aside two letters A &amp; B as designations for the one dollar denomination. No notes are known for the letters in brackets. However, the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> $5.00 A/E prefix is substantiated from a photographic counterfeit.

               <hi rend="italic">$</hi>1.00 note is simply a way of making the denomination letter scheme work.

notes to one each for <name type="place">Quebec</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>
               <ref target="#fig-37">(fig. 4)</ref>. Examination of the notes themselves supports the proposed denomination letter code; the notes were also color coded to indicate the district: black-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>; blue-<name type="place">Quebec</name>; red-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>.</p>
            <p>The 5 digit numbering scheme could accommodate 100,000 notes of each denomination and when this total was reached, the denomination letter and the date were changed. As yet we have not been able to determine the quantity of notes issued for each branch within the 100,000 maximum for each denomination <ref target="#fig-38">(fig. 5)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The basic design of all denominations was the same. The vignette in the upper left corner depicted the arms of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, flanked by a standing and a seated native. In the upper right corner was the counter but the vignettes varied with the denomination. In the lower left, the denomination in dollars was written in full, either with or without a numeral. The signature of the signing officer appeared on the lower right.</p>

            <p>The name of the Bank, the pledge of redeemability and the values in shillings appear in the upper half of the note.

            <p>It is generally believed that, faced with a serious counterfeiting threat, the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> withdrew the issue. However, I believe we should reassess the situation. It would appear that initially the counterfeiting involved only the one and two dollar notes <ref target="#fig-39">(fig. 6)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Looking at the 1852 issue as a whole, it becomes quite apparent from the prefixes that there was only one issue of notes from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> and <name type="place">Quebec</name> but that there were two issues of one and two dollar notes and three issues of five dollar notes from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>. No genuine issued notes are known with a C/I prefix. The C/S prefix is listed on the authority of the late <name type="pname">Lindsey McLennan</name>, an eminently qualified Canadian paper money pioneer. He records the note as being <name type="place">Toronto-Hamilton op Guelph</name> and gives the number as C/S 17028.</p>
            <p>I have some difficulty in accepting the authenticity of the listing in spite of the details, because it does not seem reasonable that a bank could issue 100,000 notes dated February 1, 1853, in the course of one month and then require a subsequent issue of $500,000 dated March 1, 1853, unless these issues were intended for use throughout the entire province.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> The C/K issue of the ten dollar note is known only from counterfeits.</p>
            <p>One important part of this study which still remains is determining the number of notes issued for each branch within a given denomination letter but, at this time, we do not have enough material available to do this.</p>
            <p>This is the issue that cataloguers have identified as the English Issue. I can find no reason or justification for doing so. In fact, it just does not make any sense. If one were determined to apply a label to this issue, surely the Uniform or Common Issue of 1852 would be preferable. Or better still simply The Issue of 1852.</p>
            <p>The "blue back" issue, the next dated issue chronologically, was introduced in 1856. The initial date is August 1, 1856. In general the notes follow the same pattern as the 1852 issue. However, in

            <p>The one and two dollar notes were redesigned to increase their security. The quality of the engraving was improved; portraits were employed as vignettes, and a block of microprinting involving the
<pb n="95"/>
denomination in words was added to the face of the note <ref target="#fig-42">(fig. 9)</ref>. The names of subsidiary branches were engraved on a separate plate and inserted on either side of the block of microprinting. Other significant characteristics of these notes are the large word denomination beside the lower left counter and the single signature. The backs were printed in blue. The most significant change was the replacement of the district office <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>, with a series of area branch offices <ref target="#fig-43">(fig. 10)</ref>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-43">

            </figure>
            <p>As before, when 100,000 notes were issued, the denomination letter and the date changed. The four dollar note retained its original design and upper letter designation (C), but the district office was replaced by an area branch office. The five and ten dollar notes of the 1852 issue remained in use.</p>
            <p>The issue gives rise to some intriguing questions. Why are the notes all domiciled in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West? What was happening in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East? and perhaps the most fundamental of all: did the district offices continue to issue notes and if so, which notes?</p>
            <p>The answer lies in a third issue of notes; an issue whose association with the 1850s has been either unappreciated or ignored—the issue of one and two dollar notes dated January 1, 1849, with a green word protector. The basic design reverted to the 1849 notes of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East, except for the word denomination at the lower left and the single signature at the lower right.</p>
            <p>I thought it all worked out. The issue consisted of only one and two dollar notes and was issued from the three district offices; <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, <name type="place">Quebec</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>, while the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West notes were issued from the area branch offices <ref target="#fig-44">(fig. 11)</ref>.</p>
            <p>However, closer examination of the notes themselves forced me to abandon this theory. First, it did not take into account the rare <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West area branch offices on the green protector notes and second, all the <name type="place">Quebec</name> notes were printed after May 1, 1858.</p>
            <pb n="96"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-44">

            <pb n="97"/>
            <p>The 1849 issue with green protector was issued from the three district offices and two area branch offices—<name type="place">Cobourg and Hamilton</name>
               <ref target="#fig-45">(fig. 12)</ref>. It may be divided conveniently into two parts: notes without the ABN logo and those with the logo. The notes with the logo can be dated after May 1, 1858, the official date of the founding of the American Bank Note Company. None of the <name type="place">Cobourg and Hamilton</name> issues has the logo but, at the same time, all the <name type="place">Quebec</name> notes do. Since the serial number on one note is 00010, it is extremely unlikely that there are <name type="place">Quebec</name> issues without the logo. The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> issues occur with and without the logo.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-45">
               <graphic url="COAC8_097.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The starting date for the issue is the critical point. Does it predate the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West issue or does it follow it? I believe that the use of the green protector provides the answer. There is a two dollar note with a green protector in the 1852 issue. This is the note which provides the link between the 1852 issue and the 1849 green pro-
<pb n="98"/>
tector notes. There is also a five dollar note of the same issue, with a green protector. This note comes near the end of the first 100,000 notes of the issue <ref target="#fig-46">(fig. 13)</ref>. These are the only two 1852 notes known with green protectors. I would argue that the 1849 green protector notes were issued between the 1852 and 1856 issues. It does not seem logical to issue the 1856 notes, follow them with the 1849 green protector issue and then reissue the discredited 1852 notes, even with a green protector.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-46">

            </figure>
            <p>The green protector notes were printed from plates prepared by Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson, the foremost security printers of the day, and all had 5 digit serial numbers. When the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West issue, also consisting of one and two dollar notes and dated August 1, 1856, was introduced, the Bank withdrew the 1849 green protector notes with area branch office designations but continued to issue the notes from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. Notes from the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> office made up the bulk of the issue.</p>
            <p>In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> issues, the change from no logo to logo notes occurred between 28000 and 31000 for the one dollar notes. The highest number recorded for a one dollar with the logo, i.e. after May 1, 1858, is 38188. There are no known two dollar notes with the logo. It would appear that the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West issues filled the need.</p>
            <p>In the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> issues, the change from no logo to logo notes occurred between 71000 and 81000 for one dollar notes and somewhere between 2800 and 95000 for two dollar notes. However, unlike the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> issues the serial numbers in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> one dollar series increased to 6 digits with the highest known number being 157163. As indicated earlier all the <name type="place">Quebec</name> issues carried the logo. That the 1849 green protector issue began before 1856 and continued beyond 1858 is supported by the evidence of the bank

notes.</p>
            <p>The period from 1853 to 1857 was one of prosperity in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West. The Crimean War increased the demand for wheat and timber and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West, modern <name type="place">Southwestern Ontario,</name> had some of the richest farmland in the province. The shipyards of <name type="place">Georgian Bay</name> were booming and railroads were being constructed to speed the delivery of Canadian goods. The Grand Trunk Rail Road was being constructed to link <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> with the Great Lakes port of Sarnia. The Great Western was under construction from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> and then on to Windsor. Indeed the branch names on the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> notes, <name type="place">Hamilton, Brantford, Woodstock,</name>
               <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, read like station stops on the Great Western. <name type="place">Goderich on Lake Huron</name> sent salt and other goods to the Upper Great Lakes or south to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name> and the <name type="place">Mississippi valley.</name> The Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> was an integral part of this development.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the previous decade had been the period of railroad building in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East. There were only two major commercial centers, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> and <name type="place">Quebec</name>. The business community was still attempting to recover from the economic collapse of 1847. <name type="pname">Lord Elgin's</name> letter of April 23, 1849, to Lord Grey paints a very somber picture of the situation in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>: "Three quarters of the commercial men are bankrupt and property has fallen 50% in value."</p>
            <p>Given this situation perhaps it is not surprising that the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East issues were cut back and there is a strong possibility that, apart from the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> one and two dollar notes without the logo, the majority of the notes in circulation were supplied by <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West issues.</p>

            <p>An entirely spurious issue of five dollar notes dated September 1, 1858, purporting to be domiciled either in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> or <name type="place">Quebec</name> created havoc with the public <ref target="#fig-48">(fig. 15)</ref>.

These notes are so good that, even today, many collectors question the validity of the above statement. But the statement most certainly is correct. Simply look at the prefix. While the lower denomination letter I is a legitimate designation for the five dollar denomination, there is no way that C, the designation for the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> district office, could possibly be used for a <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> or <name type="place">Quebec</name> note. The ten dollar notes were not quite as deceptive <ref target="#fig-49">(fig. 16)</ref>.</p>

            <pb n="101"/>
            <p>There is one other mystery: the possibility of a very short-lived <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East issue for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. <ref target="#fig-50">Fig. 17</ref> is an example of a raised counterfeit. The N of the word denomination is clearly visible and the microprinting leaves no doubt as to its original value. It is also evident that the counterfeit was quite successful as the PAID indicates that it was taken at face value by the Bank.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-50">
               <graphic url="COAC8_101.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>This counterfeit differs from all the rest in that it is a raised note. However, the significance of the original note appears to have been totally overlooked. The prefix is EA and the note dated January 2, 1857, is domiciled in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>. Instead of a blue back the note has an orange one. The upper letter E is a logical designation for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East and the lower letter A for the one dollar denomination is supported by the N of the word denomination ONE, the microprinting on the face and the numeral and words one and une on the back. I believe we are looking at a note of a very short-lived, unsuspected <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East issue of one dollar notes parallel to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West issues.</p>
            <p>The release of a complete, new issue of notes, from one to ten dollars, dated January 3, 1859, brought a close to the note issues of the 1850s. The 1850s opened and closed with full sets of notes. There are some questions still to be resolved, but shifting the 1849 green protector issue to the mid-1850s, a move which is defensible on the basis of the word denomination, single signature, and the use of the green protector itself resolves the puzzle of the apparent lack of notes from the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> East offices. This arrangement of the issues: 1852-53; 1849 green protector; 1856 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> West also explains why there are two sets of notes issued with only one and two dollar denominations.</p>
            <pb n="102"/>
            <p>The records of the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> are, for the most part, silent on the notes of this period. We were hoping that the records of the American Bank Note Company might shed more light on the topic but since they are not forthcoming, we have to rely on the evidence of the notes themselves.</p>

            <p>In studying the medals relating to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> during the nineteenth century, we find only one event marked by an appreciable number of medals, the visit by the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> in 1860. The earliest catalogues of these medals were by <name type="pname">Alfred Sandham</name>, first in his 1869 work, <hi rend="italic">Coins, Tokens and Medals of the Dominion of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>
               </hi>,<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> and later in his lesser known <hi rend="italic">Medals Commemorative of the Visit of H.R.H. The <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> in 1860.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> Since that time, however, cataloguers and collectors have generally disassociated the medals from one another, so that they are no longer thought of as memorials of a single event. By examining the circumstances surrounding their issue, we can perhaps undo the practice of the last century and present these medals in their original context, as well as demonstrate how medals can be used to establish the cultural importance of events generally considered insignificant.</p>
            <p>As an historical event, the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> visit is thought to have little importance. However, to the popular imagination of the time, the visit meant a great deal. In addition, it appears to have been the first of many official tours undertaken by the British royal family which have made them more accessible to their subjects. Unlike earlier travels, the Prince was accompanied by a corps of journalists to report his every move. At least two of these reporters, those from the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Herald</hi>, later rewrote their dispatches and published them in book form. In fact, the tour was so popular that 50 years later, another book was published telling the reminiscences of a midshipman who served aboard the ship on which the Prince travelled. Despite its amazingly peripheral relevance to the tour, Lieutenant <name type="pname">Thomas Bunbury Gough</name> managed to fill a book with his <hi rend="italic">Boyish Reminiscences of His Majesty the King's Visit to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> in 1860</hi>.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Although there seems to have been a desire for some time by Canadians to host a royal visit, the specific request may be traced to an address voted by both houses of the Canadian Parliament informing <name type="pname">Queen Victoria</name> of the approaching completion of a bridge to be named in her honor, and requesting that she, or a member of her family, visit <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> for the purpose of inaugurating it when completed. The address was carried to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> by the <name type="pname">Hon. H. Smith,</name> Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. While <name type="pname">Queen Victoria</name> replied that it would be impossible for her to comply personally with the wishes of her Canadian subjects, she did consent to have the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> journey to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> as her personal representative.<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Having set sail from Plymouth on the frigate <hi rend="italic">HMS Hero</hi>, the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> arrived at <name type="pname">St.John's,</name> Newfoundland on July 24, 1860. Upon landing, the Prince received addresses from various notables and
<pb n="105"/>
organizations, saw some of the local sights, and was honored with balls and levees.<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> This was to be a standard routine throughout the tour, and one which seems to have changed little in more than 100 years.</p>
            <p>During the Prince's tour, much attention was paid by the popular press to the more social aspects of the visit, such as the many balls and the fashions of the participants. In describing a ball held in <name type="place">New Brunswick,</name>
               <name type="pname">Mr. Woods</name> of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> wrote:
<q>After this, of course, there was another Levee, at which every one was presented; and the local papers explained the niceties of evening dress, and were at pains to point out at length what it meant, and that a dress coat should not be frock coat, or of any color but black, with other valuable and important information with regard to neckerchiefs and waistcoats. Even these slight rules of etiquette were not without their use, and had the effect of keeping the applicants for the honor of presentation within tolerably moderate bounds. There was no limit to the number of those who wished to attend, but there was a most decided limit to the number of dress coats in the province, and the levees were thus kept down.<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mid-nineteenth century, most of the <name type="place">United States</name>, as well as <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, was not fully developed, or as urban as today. Perhaps <name type="pname">Mr. Woods</name> should not have been terribly surprised that even the elite of Canadian society did not have what in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> would be considered proper attire. Still, the people of <name type="place">New Brunswick</name> were treated well by him; at a people's ball in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> where there were no restrictions as to attire, and the tickets cost one dollar, <name type="pname">Mr. Woods</name> wrote that:
<q>The 'no restrictions as to dress' was popularly interpreted to mean corduroys, brown or gray shooting-jacket, yellow vest, and scarlet necktie, without gloves, or with thick leather ones, as the case may be... The toilets of the ladies, of course, are never alluded to except in terms of praise, but it may be said that I could praise them more if there had not been rather a sameness of bonnets and shawls.<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>While on the many stops of his tour, it might be noted that the Prince did more than attend balls and meet poorly clad colonials; he received more than 380 addresses and provided more than 100 replies.<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> In addition, although the visit was generally nonpolitical, it should be mentioned that on many occasions, arches were erected
<pb n="106"/>
by various Orange Societies, which were nearly always frustrated in their attempts to have the Prince ride through them.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of the many medals relating to the visit, only one general commemorative was issued, and it was a purely commercial venture. Struck in white metal, it bears on the obverse a military bust of the Prince, and on the reverse an eight line inscription within a wreath. At least two different varieties exist. The more common of the two depicts the Prince with a moustache, and has a legend in sans sens serif letters. A second obverse die using roman letters and portraying th Prince without moustache and in much higher relief was used to strike a quantity of medals which were imported by <name type="pname">J. E. Ellis &amp; Co.</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A number of authorities have written that three different obverse dies were used. Besides the Ellis die, <name type="pname">Sandham</name> and <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> claim that two different varieties exist using sans serif letters and low relief. On these medals, the Prince is depicted both with and without moustache.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref> Despite the frequency with which a sans serif, no moustache medal has been reported, all examples so far examined and noted in catalogues with plates have been of the moustache variety.</p>
            <p>The reporters from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Herald</hi> seemed to have had something of a rivalry going. While in <name type="place">Quebec</name>, a Grand Ball was given by the Mayor and citizens. Dress, as we have seen, was an important topic to the correspondents, and details of the various balls were not treated with any less enthusiasm. The <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> reported that His Highness:
<q>Danced every dance that was danced between that night and four next morning! Great numbers were at the same time dancing, or rather trying to dance, and knocking against each with an energy and determination that was worthy of a better cause. None could well avoid collision when limited to a spot little larger than an ordinary table-cloth, and the Prince with his fair partners had to run the gauntlet of polkas and waltzes like the rest. During one of these terpsichorean struggles, the Prince caught his spurs in a lady's dress—tripped and fell. He was up again in an instant, laughing heartily, and dancing away more vigorously than ever.</q>
               <q>In its vulgar way the <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Herald</hi> did its best to make the Prince appear ridiculous from this little contretemps. Five minutes after the occurrence it was telegraphed to that Journal. Probably in half-an-hour it was known in Texas, while the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> drew attention
<pb n="107"/>
to the fact in an alarming series of 'headings,' of which the following are only a few:</q>
               <q>"THE CANADIAN COMMOTION.</q>
               <q>"Splendid Splurge of the <name type="place">Quebec</name>kers.</q>
               <q>"The Prince at the Grand Ball given by the City.</q>
               <q>"He danced Twenty-two Times, tripped and fell, his Beautiful Partner rolling over him.</q>
               <q>"Honi soit qui mal y pense.</q>
               <q>"The Prince immediately picked himself and Partner up and continued the Dance.</q>
               <q>"Terrible flutter of Crinoline."</q>
               <q>Certainly to judge from the accounts in this voracious journal, the fall must have been an extraordinary one, inasmuch as it was detailed in no less than three different ways, and with four different partners. Princes fall very much like other people, and even if they did not, His Royal Highness would have found it most difficult to have touched the floor in the way indicated by the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, according to which 'he cut his eye' while coming 'heavily on the back of his head'.<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In fact, while the headlines as reported by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent are correct, the incident was actually reported in the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> as "while dancing a waltz he slipped and fell heavily on the floor, dragging his partner, <name type="pname">Madame Cartier</name>, the wife of the Canadian Premier, over him. Neither of them were injured, and the Prince instantly jumped up and raised the lady so quickly that but few in the room knew of the occurrence. He apologized to Madame C., and continued the dance."<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> Our ancestors, it would seem, were equally as adept in the use of exaggerated headlines as are our contemporaries.</p>
            <p>Poor weather travelled with the Prince through much of his tour so that his landing at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, scheduled for August 24, was delayed due to a heavy storm. Things improved a bit the following day so that the Prince and his suite were able to disembark, at which time one gentleman was overheard to remark that "his Royal Highness was not only heir apparent to the British throne, but the Raining Prince."<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> Upon arrival on dry land, the Prince was greeted by the usual dignitaries and addresses. He then proceeded in procession to his residence while in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, and to the Crystal Palace where he inaugurated the Industrial Exhibition of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> and Province of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>. The exhibition was opened approximately 10 days early to allow for the Prince's schedule and consequently many of the
<pb n="108"/>
exhibits had not yet arrived. The extra space was put to good use owing to the great crowds present.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Exhibitors were awarded prizes, and given the option of receiving a medal in lieu of cash. The dies were engraved by <name type="pname">J.S. Wyon,</name> and bear on the obverse the arms of the Board of Arts. The reverse carries a wreath of maple leaves with the commemorative inscription EXHIBITION OF/CANADIAN INDUSTRY/OPENING OF/VICTORIA BRIDGE/BY H.R.H./<name type="pname">PRINCE OF WALES</name>/<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>/1860. Ten medals were struck in gold, 100 in silver, and 250 in bronze.<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref> According to <name type="pname">Sandham</name>, the silver was available in place of a ten dollar cash prize, and the bronze in lieu of five dollars.</p>
            <p>After inspection of the exhibits, the Prince departed for what was the prime reason of his visit, the opening of the Victoria Bridge.<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref> Commenced in 1854, the bridge was the connecting link of a continuous rail line joining the westernmost limits of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> with the east. It also offered an outlet to the Atlantic when the St. <name type="place">Lawrence</name> was closed. Despite the presence of the Prince and the usual complement of dignitaries, the laying of the last stone was not a very impressive affair. The visitors were taken by special train to Point St. Charles, the entrance at the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> side. After the Prince patted the bed of mortar, the final granite stone was lowered from the scaffold into place. Although the arrival of the Prince was met with great enthusiasm, the crowd was silent after the stone was laid, so that the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent likened it to the laying of a tombstone over the grave of 15 million pounds. The Prince then went by car to the middle of the bridge where he drove the final silver rivet. Afterward, the Prince was presented with a gold medal to commemorate the occasion, and his suite with similar ones, but in silver.<ref target="#CH7-n18">18</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Besides its use as a commemorative by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> appears to have obtained a number of specimens for his personal use. In his memoirs of the voyage of the <hi rend="italic">HMS Hero</hi>, <name type="pname">Thomas Gough</name> recalled that during the voyage home, on November 9, the Prince's nineteenth birthday, the Prince distributed these commemoratives among the crew. <name type="pname">Lt. Gough</name> wrote:
<q>As my turn came, I arrived breathless from a rush up the lower-deck ladder. His Royal Highness laughed at my excitement. "Well, <name type="pname">Mr. Gough,</name>" he said, "do you want a medal?" "Yes, sir, if you please," I answered. "Teesdale, where's <name type="pname">Mr. Gough"s</name> medal?" asked His Royal Highness. Major <name type="pname">Teesdale</name> began looking on the table, where the medals were laid out. I believe he was slow on purpose,
<pb n="109"/>
to have a joke with me. The Prince went over to the table. "Why, here it is, just in front of you," he said, taking up the case. "So it is, sir," replied the Major. His Royal Highness handed me the medal, for which I thanked him....The medal was enclosed in a blue morocco case with the Prince's feathers embossed outside; inside was a small slip of paper with <name type="pname">"Mr. Gough,</name> from A.E.," written on it by His Royal Highness. The medal itself was a beautiful piece of work, by <name type="pname">Wyon,</name> and it is now amongst my most precious relics.<ref target="#CH7-n19">19</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Although not generally noted, two different reverse dies were used to strike this medal, and can be most easily distinguished by the use of stars as opposed to stops on either side of the date. Of the few specimens examined, the bronze medals all have stops, while the solitary silver specimen in the cabinet of the American Numismatic Society has stars. While it is possible that the different dies were used to distinguish their use, the small number of specimens examined and their lack of pedigrees make any explanation inconclusive.</p>
            <p>In addition to the medals presented by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, two other medals were produced and sold as commercial ventures. The first utilizes the same with moustache obverse as the general commemorative described earlier, while the reverse depicts the bridge from the north shore, with a train coming out of the north entrance. The medals were produced by an unnamed <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name> firm for Savage &amp; Lyman of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, and were offered for sale in silver at $3, bronze at $1, and white metal for 25¢.<ref target="#CH7-n20">20</ref> Judging by the number of surviving specimens, it would seem that this offering, at least in white metal, was quite successful. Although LeRoux claims that different varieties exist with the moustache longer or shorter ("il y a plusieurs vari�t�s avec la moustache plus ou moins longue," but translated into English as "both with and without moustache"), it appears that only one obverse die was used.</p>
            <p>The second commemorative is generally referred to as the Hoffnung medal because the dies were prepared for Mr. Hoffnung of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> who was also its designer. The medal was offered for sale in gold, silver, bronze and white metal, with the latter being the most common. Prices ranged from $100 for the gold to $1 for a white metal specimen. <name type="pname">Sandham</name> reports that a gold medal was presented to <name type="pname">Queen Victoria</name> in July 1860, though a later presentation would not be unlikely.<ref target="#CH7-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The <name type="pname">Hoffnung</name> medal is a particularly fine example of overcrowding as an attempt seems to have been made to include every possible fact or figure within as small a space as possible. On the
<pb n="110"/>
obverse is a view of the bridge with the arms of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name> above, on either side of which is a lion and unicorn. The names Ross and Stephenson inscribed on the ribbon refer to the engineers who designed the bridge. Below is an inscription describing the bridge as the greatest work of engineering skill in the world. On the reverse are the royal arms and medallions depicting the Queen, <name type="pname">Prince Albert</name> and the <name type="place">Prince of Wales,</name> along with a 14 line inscription giving the physical dimensions and statistics of the bridge. Two varieties are known; the original states the cost was <hi rend="italic">$5</hi> million, while a subsequent version shows the amount corrected to read <hi rend="italic">$7</hi> million. On the latter variety, the 5 can be seen faintly beneath the 7.</p>
            <p>After the formal opening of the bridge, the Prince and his suite returned to one of the workshops of the company where a lunch had been prepared, and to which, according to <hi rend="italic">The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Times</hi>, none but the uppiest of the uppy were invited. After toasts to the Queen, <name type="pname">Prince Albert</name> and the <name type="place">Prince of Wales,</name>
               <name type="pname">Albert Edward</name> proposed "The health of the Governor General, prosperity to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, and success to the Grand Trunk Railway".</p>
            <p>After <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, the Prince visited <name type="place">Ottawa</name> where he laid the cornerstone for the Parliament buildings, and then toured <name type="place">Kingston,</name> and on to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name>, where he visited the University and signed his name in the student's book. From the University the Prince proceeded to inaugurate the Horticultural Societies' grounds by planting what the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent described as "a meek-looking vegetable called a young maple-tree".<ref target="#CH7-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>From <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6167865">Toronto</name> the Prince and his suite departed by special train for <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, and then to Sarnia, the westernmost terminus of the Grand Trunk Railway.<ref target="#CH7-n23">23</ref> The Prince was greeted at the Sarnia railway station by a crowd of about 4,000, among whom were a group of about 150-200 <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>ns from the Chippewa tribe, including the Chief, <name type="pname">Kanwagashi,</name> who presented an address to the Prince in his native language. At the end of each sentence the Prince heard a translation, which "reminded the Prince that the sky was beautiful, and that it was preordained that <name type="pname">Albert Edward</name> and Himself should meet and that his heart was glad of the event. He hoped the sky would continue fine for both those of the white and those of the red skin, and that His Royal Highness would remember the red man when he came to the throne." The Prince replied that "he was grateful for the address, and hoped the sky would continue beautiful. He would never forget his red brethren."<ref target="#CH7-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After the addresses were given, the Prince presented each of the chiefs with a large silver medal in commemoration of the visit. There appears to have been some confusion among the popular press about
<pb n="111"/>
these medals, as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent wrote that he "was told that they had been struck at the close of the last century for distribution among the chiefs of the tribes who had most distinguished themselves in the war against the Americans. From some cause or another they were never given, but remained 'in store' till the arrival of His Royal Highness, when the matter was recollected by some one or other, and they were once more brought out, furbished out, and re-chased with the coronet of the Prince of Wales....As a rule the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>ns prize their medals beyond anything, and I saw several who cherished as priceless heir-looms the medals their forefathers had earned in the War of Independence."<ref target="#CH7-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Cornwallis,</name> who was associated with the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Herald</hi>, described the actual presentation when he wrote</p>
            <q>The chiefs, in addition to being ring-nosed, painted, and moccasined, had buffalo horns on their heads, and snake skins around their waists, thickly set with porcupine quills or colored grass. To these His Royal Highness presented medals as large as the mouth of a tumbler, while to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>ns of lower rank he gave medals of smaller size, and these bore the likeness of the Queen on one side and the royal arms on the reverse. The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>ns felt flattered, and returned the compliment by giving him a present of tomahawks, wampums, pipes, bows and arrows, and bark work.<ref target="#CH7-n26">26</ref>
            </q>
            <p>Three sizes of silver medals were presented, 3 inch, 2 3/8 inch, and 1 1/2 inch, and the distribution correlated size with rank. Despite reports from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, the medals presented do not date from the eighteenth century and with at least one exception bear the effigy of Victoria. Originally issued in 1840, they are distinguished by the Prince of Wales's plumes and the date 1860 to the left and right of the Queen's bust. The two larger medals carry the Queen's title VICTORIA DEI GRATIA BRITANNIARUM REGINA F: D:; on the smaller size the legend is somewhat abbreviated. In addition, it should be noted that the <name type="pname">W.W.C. Wilson</name> sale featured a 3 inch George III <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>n Peace Medal, dated 1814, which bears, to the right of the king's bust, the engraved <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> plumes and the date 1860.<ref target="#CH7-n27">27</ref> This specimen is now in the cabinet of the American Numismatic Society. Jamieson mentions that the Prince distributed these medals at the various gatherings of tribes throughout <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n28">28</ref> However, although both the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> correspondents report meetings between the Prince and Indians of many tribes on different occasions, they only mention distribution of medals on the one occasion already discussed. Ad-

ditional research utilizing contemporary records might provide the evidence necessary to determine under what circumstances medals were presented.</p>
            <p>The next stop of consequence for the Prince was <name type="place">Niagara Falls</name> where he was entertained by the renowned aerialist <name type="pname">Jean Fran�ois Gravelet,</name> better known as <name type="pname">Charles Blondin.</name> During the exhibition <name type="pname">Blondin</name> crossed the rapids on a tightrope with a man on his back, and offered to take the Prince across in a similar manner, but the offer was politely declined.<ref target="#CH7-n29">29</ref> It might be of interest to note that Blondin was not alone in the ability to cross the Falls on a tightrope. Prior to viewing <name type="pname">Blondin's</name> performance, the Prince happened to notice a similar feat by Farini.<ref target="#CH7-n30">30</ref> However, today we only remember <name type="pname">Blondin,</name> and, not surprisingly, we find that only he is depicted on a medal, struck in white metal, 35 mm in diameter, portraying Blondin on the obverse and a view of his crossing over the Falls by tightrope on the reverse. The inscription reads, on the obverse, <name type="pname">BLONDIN</name>/THE HERO OF <name type="place">NIAGARA,</name> and on the reverse, CROSSED THE FALLS OF <name type="place">NIAGARA</name>/IN PRESENCE OF/H.R.H. PRINCE OF WALES/SEPR 1/1860.<ref target="#CH7-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the medals already mentioned, most of which relate to specific events during the tour, a number of medals exist which represent a portion of the charities distributed by the Prince. During the course of his travels, <name type="pname">Albert Edward</name> visited a number of schools, and donated money to be used for medals which could be distributed as prizes. Although generally catalogued as school awards, they should be thought of as royal charities, and as lasting memorials of the royal tour.</p>
            <p>In a letter dated September 17, 1860, the <name type="place">Duke of Newcastle,</name> who accompanied the Prince, wrote to the Governor General, <name type="pname">Sir Edmund</name> Head:
<q>I have the pleasure of informing you that the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> has placed in your account at the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</name>, a sum of money, which His Royal Highness requests you to be so good as to distribute to the institutions in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> named in the following schedule, in the sums placed opposite to each, as some token of the very great gratification which His Royal Highness has derived from the interesting visit which is now nearly completed, and as proof of the deep interest which he must always take in the future progress of this magnificent Province. His Royal Highness wishes that the sums appropriated to each should be applied in the distribution to the students in such a way as may be suggested by the governing body
<pb n="113"/>
as the most conducive to the interests of the institutions, subject in each case to your approval.<ref target="#CH7-n32">32</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>At least four medals have been issued which directly reflect the Prince's generosity: those for <name type="pname">McGill</name> University; Bishop's College; Victoria College; and the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> Normal Schools.</p>
            <p>On September 30, 1860, the Prince departed <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> for an unofficial tour of the <name type="place">United States</name>,<ref target="#CH7-n33">33</ref> which was marked by a 30 mm medal by <name type="pname">Joseph H. Merriam</name> of <name type="place">Boston.</name> After enjoying several days shooting on the prairies of the midwest, the Prince travelled, as "Baron Renfrew," east from St. <name type="pname">Louis</name>, stopping at many of the major cities along the way.<ref target="#CH7-n34">34</ref> Of all the stops on the royal progress, the visit to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> was the most spectacular. A grand ball organized in honor of the Prince began most inauspiciously when the floor collapsed. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured, and many of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>'s social elite were given an opportunity to display their finery, which <name type="pname">Mr. Howard</name> of the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Times</hi> described in excruciating detail:
<q>
                  <name type="pname">Mrs. Gov. Morgan</name> wore a dress of white silk, elegantly trimmed and clouded with flounces of black lace, and lighted up with diamonds as became her matronly rank...Mrs. Dr. Alex Mott of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, wore a white silk, trimmed with quillings of shaded violet, extending up the left side of the skirt to the corsage. A sentimental and yet intellectual style of beauty.<ref target="#CH7-n35">35</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Times</hi> also reported that</p>
            <q>One lady, indeed, startled the Prince into expressing opinions, by regretting for him the unhappy fate which had compelled him to travel through the <name type="place">United States</name> without sharing in a railway accident, and by explaining to him that if American ladies lay aside their bouquets when they waltz, it is from their considerate anxiety "not to tickle their partner's ears."<ref target="#CH7-n36">36</ref>
            </q>
            <p>The following day the Prince did some sightseeing, which included visits to <name type="pname">Brady's</name> Gallery, where a number of photographs were taken, and to <name type="pname">Mr. Bamum's</name> museum.<ref target="#CH7-n37">37</ref> In the evening a magnificent fireman's torchlight parade was held along a rather strange route, so that Fourteenth Street was transversed three times. A small medal is perhaps the only reminder today of this brilliant event. As the Prince stood on the balcony of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, he viewed the procession of 5,000 firemen, along with their engines and other apparatus:
<q>Hour after hour, mile after mile, the gorgeous phalanx
<pb n="114"/>
wound its slow length along, suffusing the sky with the lurid glare of rockets, snakes, Prince's plumes, and much beside, and dazzling the eyes of the half million that beheld it with the blaze of Drummond lights, here and there softened by the mellow tints of variegated lanterns.<ref target="#CH7-n38">38</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Overall, the Prince's visit can only be termed a resounding success. Most importantly, coming at a time when the function of the British monarchy was undergoing radical change from political activism to one of seeming impartiality, symbolizing the nation and above politics, the monarchy needed to redefine its role. Had the Prince's tour been a failure, it is questionable whether the monarchy would have developed as it has into a major media event or even whether it would have survived the turmoils which have toppled similar institutions. However, the tour did prove a success, and became a precedent for the many subsequent tours which have brought the British monarchy into contact with its territories and colonies.</p>
            <p>One aspect of the Prince's tour has special significance for the American Numismatic Society, and deserves special recognition. Although no medals were issued by the Society to mark the Prince's visit to the <name type="place">United States</name>, the ANS did not pass up the opportunity to do so when his grandson <name type="pname">Edward</name> visited this country as <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> in 1919. In honor of that visit, the ANS struck a medal designed by John Flanagan. On November 18, 1919, during a ceremony aboard the <hi rend="italic">HMS Renown</hi>, the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name> received a gold specimen of the medal housed in a wooden case made from a tree planted by his grandfather on October 12, 1860, in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>'s Central Park.<ref target="#CH7-n39">39</ref>

            <p>This paper discusses patterns and trial pieces of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> including those of the former colonies of <name type="place">New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,</name> Province of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name>, British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</name> and <name type="place">Newfoundland.</name>
            </p>
            <p>Given the great rarity of the vast majority of Canadian patterns and trial pieces, it is not surprising that they are seldom encountered by numismatists. Several pieces found only in the British Royal Mint collection or the National Currency Collection, Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> are believed to be unique.</p>
            <p>This paper presents only patterns and trials that were examined by this writer and includes some previously unpublished pieces. Patterns and trials contained in the R. Henry <name type="pname">Norweb</name> Collection, as well as those of the American Numismatic Society, National Currency Collection, Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</name> and the British Royal Mint were examined and recorded.</p>

               <p>In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>, a piece is considered a pattern if it bears a proposed new design, denomination, or metal that is not adopted for currency use during the year it was produced. However, in <name type="place">Great Britain</name>, a piece bearing the adopted design but dated earlier than the currency issue is termed a "proof." The term "proof' also applies to off-metal strikes of the adopted design.</p>
               <p>Trial strikes are pieces produced at any stage of the preparation of a die allowing the designer or engraver to have a threedimensional representation of the piece. They are rarely struck in precious metal and are meant only for internal use. Trial pieces always display the adopted design but may differ in shape, finish, metal or have the addition or deletion of a mint mark. Some trial strikes occur only as proofs or specimens.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The Currency Act of 1910 provided for a silver dollar, and the Mint in <name type="place">Ottawa</name> acquired a new coining press capable of striking the large-sized silver dollar. The matrix for the silver dollar was produced in 1910.<ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref> However, the death of <name type="pname">King Edward VII</name> in May of that year resulted in a delay in producing the matrix and punches bearing <name type="pname">Bertram MacKennal's</name> portrait of <name type="pname">King George V.</name> The original obverse punch produced on July 21, 1911, was the "Godless" one omitting the DEI GRA: in the legend.<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> In October 1911, a new matrix was cut bearing the corrected legend (see Appendix A). A letter dated December 11, 1911, confirms that the newly elected Canadian government did not approve the production of the dollar (see Appendix B). There are two known patterns in silver along with a lead trial striking. The 1911 pattern dollar is probably the bestknown of all the Canadian patterns.</p>
