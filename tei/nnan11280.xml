            <p>Every worthwhile project begins with someone's good idea. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_55211700">Harry W. Bass</name>, Jr., President of the American Numismatic Society from 1978
					until 1984, outlined his concept of an ongoing conference series on specialized topics in American numismatics at the Society's 125th anniversary celebration in
					the fall of 1983. One year later, the first Coinage of the <name type="place">Americas</name> Conference became a reality.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present papers, collectors
					are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all interested in the topic. The Society also mounts an
					exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants to come to know the Society's collections and library better during the days of the conference. This
					invitation was best expressed by Society President <name type="pname">Harry W. Fowler</name> in his opening remarks to the 1984 Conference. "Our hope and our
					expectation is that the interchange of ideas this weekend will give impetus to a wider use of the great resources here at the Society and to a greater
					cooperation among all of us in the study and elucidation of these coinages."</p>

            <p>In this publication, we present the papers delivered at the first Coinage of the <name type="place">Americas</name> Conference. As will be seen, they represent a
					number of approaches to the phenomenon of copper coinage in the early United States. Some articles are of a general nature, embracing the entire period. <name type="pname">Elvira Clain-Stefanelli</name> discusses the question of copper coinage itself, and its historical role as the circulating medium of the
					masses. She draws interesting parallels between copper's use in ancient times and in the young Republic. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64112980">Eric P. Newman</name> examines a
					question most of us had never asked—how long into the federal period did pre-federal copper coinage circulate? He emerges with some surprising answers. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_21687562">Cora Lee Gillilland</name> addresses our early coppers from the standpoint of an art historian, and she finds parallels between the imagery
					employed on early <name type="place">American</name> copper coins and that seen in the wider world of art and fashion.</p>
            <p>Other speakers focus on more circumscribed themes. In state coinage, <name type="pname">Ronald Guth</name> discusses the issues of the "Vermont Republic"—the
					state did not formally join the Union until 1791, and all of its issues were struck while it was independent. <name type="pname">Donald Partrick</name>
					speculates on the origins of one of the least understood coppers of all <name type="place">American</name> History—the "<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> the
					Great" issue.</p>
            <p>As we move into federal coinage, <name type="pname">John Adams</name> sets the scene with a sympathetic look at one of the first collectors of <name type="place">American</name> copper coinage, <name type="pname">Benjamin H. Collins</name>. Other speakers discuss federal coinage itself, and most do so from two
					approaches, the methodological and the technological.</p>
            <p>In methodology, <name type="pname">P. Scott Rubin</name> sheds light on the establishment of pedigrees for early coppers, using the 1792 silver center pattern
					cent as his example. <name type="pname">Roger Cohen</name> explains the problems inherent in determining the emission pattern for "original" and "restrike" half
					cents, suggesting possible solutions. Jules Reiver demonstrates a new method for determining die identity in the late date cent series— effectively showing that
					there are several less varieties than com- <pb n="x"/> monly supposed. Denis Loring examines effective ways of understanding emission sequences, stressing the
					use of tools such as die deterioration, design characteristics, and planchet quality to establish order in difficult series.</p>
            <p>Other speakers emphasized early Mint technology in their presentations. <name type="pname">George Ewing</name> examined the Castaing edge-marking device, used on
						<name type="place">American</name> cents and half cents during the first two years of the mint operation. From an examination of superimposed images, <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> concludes that a primitive sort of "hubbing"— mass production of dies—was a Mint concern from the earliest days of its
					operation, rather than a later consideration, as was generally supposed. <name type="pname">R. Tettenhorst</name> concentrates on the half cent, demonstrating
					that Mint practice resulted in much overstriking and recycling of planchets in this coin series.</p>
            <p>Among our remaining speakers, <name type="pname">Peter Smith</name> examined the entire <name type="pname">Turbin Head</name> large cent series, especially from
					the viewpoint of die deterioration, while <name type="pname">David Cohen</name> shed new light on some of the most famous members of the succeeding Coronet
					series, the <name type="pname">Randall Hoard</name>.</p>

            <p>Cent collectors are a strange breed. We come in all ages and sizes, as well as from all walks of life. Our only common denominator is the hobby or, let me
					suggest, the tradition that unites us—those of us who share our interests wherever they may be and those who have gone before.</p>
            <p>Many cent collectors active today knew <name type="pname">William H. Sheldon</name>. Those who didn't know him personally know him through the eloquent phrases
					that leap from the pages of his books. Well, we knew Sheldon; he knew <name type="pname">David Proskey</name>; Proskey knew <name type="pname">Edward
						Cogan</name>; and that takes us back to 1858, the very beginning of the large cent hobby.</p>
            <p>This is but one of many byways that can take us back to our roots. The provenance of coins, typically no two of them alike, can take us back from today to <name type="pname">Mickley</name> or <name type="pname">McCoy</name> or <name type="pname">Bushnell</name>. Tracing the evolution of scholarship will wend us
					backward from Clapp and Newcomb to <name type="pname">S.H. Chapman</name>, <name type="pname">Ebenezer Gilbert</name>, <name type="pname">Hays</name>, <name type="pname">Proskey</name>, <name type="pname">Maris</name>, and, ultimately, the pioneering <name type="pname">S.S. Crosby</name>. These links with the
					past serve to define who we are. In effect, the medium is the message. Our oneness with earlier generations, to the extent that it is maintained, lends a
					dimension to our branch of the hobby to which, perhaps, no other branch can hope to aspire.</p>
            <p>Having first emerged as a recognizable activity in 1858, cent collecting is only 126 years old. Thus, our past is within our grasp if we will only reach out and
					give it recognition. It is in this spirit that I have elected to focus this paper upon our predecessors; and, in particular, to concentrate primarily on one
					predecessor, <name type="pname">Benjamin H. Collins</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, D.C.</p>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e604" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi rend="bold">Why <name type="pname">Collins</name>?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Benjamin H. Collins</name> was a pivotal member of the cent collecting fraternity just as it was beginning to come of age. He knew and
						worked closely with such luminaries as <name type="pname">Maris</name>, <name type="pname">Hays</name>, <name type="pname">Hall</name>, <name type="pname">Frossard</name>, <name type="pname">Phelps</name>, <name type="pname">Parmalee</name> and the <name type="pname">Chapmans</name> to name just some. His
						was perhaps the most visited cent collection of any at the time and any since, with the possible exception of the one housed at the ANS.</p>
               <p>In addition to being in the middle of the network, <name type="pname">Collins</name> was an accomplished collector. He set as his goal, "I have always had
						only one fixed purpose in view, viz: the obtaining of the best possible specimens."<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> And, as we shall see, the man was eminently
						successful in accomplishing his goal.</p>
               <p>Still another reason to focus on <name type="pname">Collins</name> is his relative obscurity. <pb n="3"/> Except for his obituary,<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> a fine article by <name type="pname">Jesse Patrick</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> and a few references by the author in <hi rend="italic">Penny-Wise</hi>—all of which sources, incidentally, contain errors—little has been recorded. The man is too important to our hobby to permit him to
						slip into the mists of the past.</p>
               <p>One final reason is the fortuitous discovery by <name type="pname">John J. Ford,</name> Jr. of a wealth of original <name type="pname">Collins</name>
						material including his large cent inventory, a portion of his will, correspondence and contemporary newspaper clippings. From this material, the collector
						cries out to have his story told.</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e674" type="section">

                  <hi rend="bold">
                     <name type="pname">Collins</name> the Man</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The obituary in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> states that <name type="pname">Collins</name> was born in Independence, Missouri, in 1845. He served
						in the Civil War, after which he settled in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, DC, and worked for the United States Government, finishing his career as a
						chief of division in the Treasury Department. Such hints as we have been able to uncover suggest that <name type="pname">Collins's</name> government career
						was a distinguished one but, after 12 years of collecting coins, he decided to turn his hobby into a vocation. In 1894, he opened an "Art Parlor," dealing
						in paintings, china and relics as well as numismatic items. <name type="pname">Collins</name> maintained his shop at the same location until two years
						before his death in 1928 at the age of 83.</p>
               <p>Whereas these biographical details are admittedly sketchy, it turns out that a close look at the numismatist reveals the man. Some years back, <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> wrote an article describing <name type="pname">Dr. Henry Beckwith</name> as the first perfectionist.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> Perfectionist to be sure but not the first as that title clearly belongs to <name type="pname">Benjamin Collins.</name> For 13
						intensive years, <name type="pname">Collins</name> set about "the obtaining of the best possible specimen, retaining them in my cabinet in the face of most
						tempting offers (Collins was never a wealthy man), and only dispensing of one when a more perfect or desirable cent took its place...Perfect condition
						should be our aim."<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> His definition of a perfect cent precluded "vandalism, nicks, oiling, tooling, holes, cleaning, cabinet
						friction and certainly absence in toto of corrosion."<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> He could not abide die breaks or planchet flaws but, unlike many modern
						collectors, he was not in love with mint red: "any fixed color, light olive preferred, though black or dark very acceptable. Red secondary which, though
						beautiful, will not stay put."<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The basis for <name type="pname">Collins's</name> opinion regarding mint red reveals another fundamental characteristic of the man—his gregarious, sharing
							<pb n="4"/> nature. He fully realized that the red could be maintained by careful storage techniques and the avoidance of human contact: "so if you
						require early red cents, bury them securely against atmospheric influences; don't look at or handle them; assert you have them, but don't produce for
						comparison. What pleasure is that? I am, perforce, willing to dispense with red cents and content myself with any fixed color perfect cents."<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> And so <name type="pname">Collins</name> took his cherished cents on the road. He welcomed visitors to his house; indeed, in
						1895, he hosted the entire ANA Convention—such as it then was—for a thorough viewing of his cent collection.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Assembly of the Cent Collection</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Collins</name> began collecting in 1882. His last important acquisition of large cents was at the Winsor Sale in 1895. Within this 13
						year time frame, he acquired pieces from many sources: from public auctions; directly from collectors such as <name type="pname">Maris</name>, <name type="pname">Newlin</name>, <name type="pname">Phelps</name>, <name type="pname">Parmalee</name> and <name type="pname">Randall</name>; and from the
						well-known dealers of the day. However, <name type="pname">Collins's</name> principal modus operandi was to buy entire collections—22 of them, in
						fact—containing many hundreds of large cents as well as a full range of other denominations.</p>
               <p>The first important collection to come his way belonged to <name type="pname">W.P. Titcomb</name>, a well-known <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>
						numismatist. <name type="pname">Collins</name> paid $450—a handsome price in 1885—but made a large profit on resale, even after retaining three early dates
						and five late dates for his permanent collection.</p>
               <p>Every successful collector receives at least one major stroke of good fortune and, for <name type="pname">Collins</name>, that good fortune occurred in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. On a visit to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> in the winter of 1891, he stopped by the firm of <name type="pname">W.S.
							Lincoln</name> &amp; Sons, a well-established shop which had been visited by tens of <name type="place">Americans</name> before. For some reason—<name type="pname">Collins's</name> contagious geneality perhaps—<name type="pname">F.W. Lincoln</name> pulled out tray after tray of gem coppers such as
						would have been the substance of dreams. Later, <name type="pname">John Jones</name> was to write <name type="pname">Max Mehl</name> that <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> had obtained the coins at time of issue<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> but, because the firm was not established until after 1830, <name type="pname">Collins's</name> statement that the set was diligently assembled over the 35 years prior to his visit is probably the correct account.</p>
               <p>Somehow, <name type="pname">Collins</name> had the composure to buy 28 cents, 5 half cents and a moderate assortment of early silver for the grand sum of
						$300. The 28 cents included MS-65 examples of 1793 (a chain), 1794, 1795, (2), 1796, 1797, 1800, 1801, 1802 (2), 1806, 1807, and 1808. <pb n="5"/> A second
						trip to <name type="pname">W.S. Lincoln</name> in the spring of 1892 secured a roughly equivalent haul: this time the 1793 was a wreath, the 1794 was a
						Hays-1, the 1796 was a liberty cap and so forth.</p>
               <p>At its high water mark in 1895, the <name type="pname">Collins</name> Collection contained all dates and types, every one of them in mint state save for the
						1793 cap, the 1799 and the 1839/36. Many dates were represented by multiple specimens, e.g. six 1794s, four 1801s, etc. These likewise were all in mint
						condition. Judging from the owner's eloquent descriptions, as many of the pieces were above MS-65 as were below. Space does not permit the rendering of a
						representative sample of <name type="pname">Collins's</name> prose but his cataloguing of his 1808 will give the reader the general drift: "1808, 13 stars.
						Get off the track, this is the best, sharpest, handsomest 1808 known. Every star centered and bold, even milling. Color a superb smooth steel with lingering
						traces original red. One of the gems of my gems. Worth any price. For several years I sought in vain for a satisfactory 1808. <name type="pname">Dr.
							Hall</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> has a beauty I envied—but now I have a superior one. As a rule, 1808 is always weak in the hair. This is
						sharp and bold and in its unique condition I consider it one of the rarest and most valuable cents I own. Superb and Matchless. Unique. From <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> 1891 purchase."</p>
            </div2>
            <div2 xml:id="d1e841" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi rend="bold">Dispersal</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The coin and curios business must have gotten off to a slow start because the first three years of its existence see <name type="pname">Collins</name>
						peeling off some of his precious cents. He sold one or two pieces each to <name type="pname">Borden</name>, <name type="pname">Hall</name> and <name type="pname">C.H. Deetz.</name> The last transaction included the Hays-1 sold by <name type="pname">Deetz</name> to <name type="pname">George
							Clapp</name> in 1923. <name type="pname">Clapp</name>, one of the few truly wealthy individuals to collect large cents, considered the Hays-1 to be his
						most valuable possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Collins's</name> major divestiture of this period was a 137 piece consignment to <name type="pname">Ed Frossard's</name> auction sale of
						March 2, 1897. Comparing the owner's inventory to the consignment, one can sense the agonizing care taken to pick pieces that would raise money without
						disturbing the essence of the set. In the end, most of the lots came out of the duplicate box but these were spiced with <name type="pname">Mickley's</name>
						1793 wreath, a gem 1796 fillet obtained from the <name type="pname">Chapmans</name>, and a dozen or so of the <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> mint
						states.</p>
               <p>In any event, the better than $ 1,000 proceeds from the sale were sufficient to get <name type="pname">Collins</name> over the financial hump. He made no
						more sales until 1919, when Beckwith made him an offer for five pieces <pb n="6"/> that was simply too good to refuse. The details of this transaction have
						been well chronicled by <name type="pname">Jesse Patrick</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> Suffice to observe that almost every cent collector has his
						price, but there are relatively few buyers with the reckless abandon to pay it.</p>
               <p>Back in 1910, <name type="pname">Collins</name> exhibited his cents at the ANA Convention and <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl</name> was so inspired by this
						exhibit that he set about assembling a gem set of his own. As a successful dealer, <name type="pname">Mehl</name> had far more opportunities than the
						average collector: in 1914, he bought <name type="pname">Adler's</name> collection—"one of the finest ever formed:" <ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> in 1929
						he picked from the French collection and, in the early 1930s, he bought heavily at the <name type="pname">Morgan</name> and <name type="pname">Sternberg</name> sales. Then, one quarter of a century after first seeing the <name type="pname">Collins</name> Exhibit, Mehl bought it intact at the
						1937 ANA Convention. Although he wrote "my collection was so far advanced I could improve but very few of the specimens (with) this great collection,"<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> such was hardly the case. Mehl's inventory, a copy of which was kindly supplied to me by <name type="pname">Del Bland</name>,
						reveals no less than 33 <name type="pname">Collins</name> pieces in the primary set. <name type="pname">Collins</name> might have sold some of his prizes
						but he still had plenty left that could improve 25 years of effort by an active professional.</p>
               <p>All good cent collections come to an end, but <name type="pname">Benjamin Collins</name> did some collecting that will endure. That he could be so
						passionately interested in his hobby, that he was so willing to share his excitement with others, that he could assemble a meaningful collection on a modest
						budget, these and other aspects of the man explain something about who we are or who we want to be. Our large cent tradition is a dimension of our hobby
						that will enrich us as we pay it heed. We must be aware of those who have gone before us and mindful of those who will come after.</p>

            <p>For well over a century, collectors of early <name type="place">U.S. Mint</name> issues have been fascinated with the diversity of heads on the coins of 1794,
					particularly the cents. As early as June 1869, <name type="pname">Edward Maris</name> had begun assigning fanciful names to them: <name type="place">Egeria</name>, The Coquette, <name type="pname">Amatory Face</name>, <name type="pname">Venus Marina</name>, The Ornate, Nondescript, Young Head, Pyramidal
					Head, <name type="pname">Many Haired</name>, Patagonian, Roman Plicae, etc.<ref target="CH2-#n1">1</ref> Maris intended these as mnemonics, in an epoch when
					coin photographs were rarer than the coins. His efforts redoubled collector attention to what seemed an immense diversity of styles of coiffure or even facial
					types; and many common varieties were in greater demand than rarer ones simply because they were easily remembered. (An obvious example is Maris's '95 Head.)
					Ten years later, <name type="pname">Edouard Frossard</name> alluded to <name type="pname">Maris</name>, "whose happy nomenclature, in the description of the
					1794 Cents, has generally been accepted by collectors."<ref target="CH2-#n2">2</ref> (Not that they had much choice, come to think of it: nobody else had
					written about 1794s in the meantime.)</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, as early as 1893, Frossard's collaboration with <name type="pname">William Wallace Hays</name> quietly dropped the <name type="pname">Maris</name>
					names, apparently on the grounds that photographic illustrations made such cryptic mnemonics unnecessary.<ref target="CH2-#n3">3</ref> Nor did the later
					illustrated monographs by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_48881600">Thomas L. Elder</name> and <name type="pname">Samuel Hudson Chapman</name> include the names.</p>
            <p>However, for sentimental reasons, <name type="pname">William H. Sheldon</name> revived the <name type="pname">Maris</name> names for the varieties, adding others
					of his own.<ref target="CH2-#n4">4</ref> This practice doubtless encouraged collectors to "cherish" particular obverses, as Sheldon put it,<ref target="CH2-#n5">5</ref> even though we have all learned the hard way that it is easier to attribute a 1794 cent if you start with the reverse.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Sheldon</name> shared the common belief that Scot engraved every one of the 1794 cent obverses by hand.<ref target="CH2-#n6">6</ref> This
					belief gave the coins of this year a special attraction: they were more individualized than the cents of 1795 and later years, in which the heads and wreaths
					were meant to be identical, and the varieties consisted mostly in shifting positions of individual letters and numerals. <name type="pname">Sheldon's</name>
					belief—one of the cornerstones of his cent philosophy—will be here reexamined in the light of evidence unknown to him, but to be included in the forthcoming <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of United States Cents, 1793-1814.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Following <name type="pname">Chapman</name>, <name type="pname">Sheldon</name> alludes to an alleged progressive simplification and lowering of relief on the
					1794 cent obverses as the styles shifted from <ref target="#fig-2">S-21</ref>, The Flat Pole, which shares a reverse with the Heads of 1793, to <ref target="#fig-3">S-NC-3</ref>, which shares a reverse with the <pb n="11"/> Head of 1795.<ref target="CH2-#n7">7</ref>
               <name type="pname">Sheldon</name> did not live long enough to realize just how drastic an oversimplification this was. Lower relief certainly reflected Scot's
					learning his trade as Mint Engraver. His predecessor's cent device punch, the Head of 1793, was in higher relief than anything Scot ever attempted, so that
					coins struck from dies sunk from it lacked detail, even despite Scot's hand strengthening of each obverse. Low relief was a necessary compromise in the absence
					of a steam press. But from then to the present day, the Mint has consistently opposed any attempt to make coins in high relief like medals or ancient Greek
					coins. This policy partly underlay <name type="pname">Charles E. Barber's</name> attempts to sabotage the <name type="pname">St.Gaudens</name> high relief Roman
					Numerals double eagles, though Barber's professional jealousy and opposition to any outsider's designs were also factors.<ref target="CH2-#n8">8</ref>

            <p>When I received the assignment from EAC to do the new book on cents, one of the first unsolved problems I had to deal with was the emission sequence for 1794. No
					previous writer on large cents had ever provided a completely satisfactory order for this date, not even <name type="pname">Sheldon</name>—and he actually
					admitted it!<ref target="CH2-#n9">9</ref> Yet if we are to make technical and historical sense, let alone artistic sense, out of the divergent styles of 1794
					cent obverses, a correct emission sequence is essential. Among other things, it will help in assigning the varieties to their actual diesinkers: a task in which
					all previous writers about 1794 cents have failed, partly because the necessary comparison methods had not yet been devised.</p>
            <p>There are several governing principles in devising a rational emission sequence:</p>
            <list type="numbered">
               <item n="1.">
                  <hi rend="italic">Of any two varieties sharing a common die, that with the shared die in earlier state precedes the other.</hi> For mechanical reasons, this
						takes precedence over all to follow.</item>
               <item n="2.">Group together all coins struck from a single circumscribed batch <pb n="12"/> of blanks.</item>
               <item n="3.">Wherever possible, group together all dies sharing a single device punch.</item>
               <item n="4.">Wherever possible, a die from an earlier device punch precedes dies from a later device punch.</item>
               <item n="5.">Wherever possible, group together all dies sharing the same letter and/or numeral punches.</item>
               <item n="6.">Wherever possible, a die showing earlier letter or numeral punches precedes dies showing later ones.</item>
               <item n="7.">Wherever possible, group together all dies sharing a peculiarity with each other but with no others.</item>
               <item n="8.">Wherever possible, a die of earlier style precedes those of later styles.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I do not know where these principles have been spelled out, but they are intuitively obvious, they make sense in terms of minting practice, and they have been
					used in every numismatic field where emission sequences are possible at all, from ancient Greek through Noe's monographs on <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver to my own <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Half Cents.</hi> In practice, occasional minor
					compromises are necessary to accommodate instances where a die has been removed from press for repairs, while another was briefly substituted.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, every previously published emission sequence for 1794 cents has violated one or more of these principles. Part of the difficulty has been in
					identifying and unambiguously defining style in an extreme diversity of heads; part was the erroneous and misleading assumption that Scot made all those dies
					completely by hand. Dropping that assumption was a necessary step toward solving the problem; another was considering the chronology of 1793-94 Mint activities.
					It is easier to start with the latter.</p>

            <p>Coinage of 1793 wreath cents ended with a delivery of only 176 specimens on July 17. <name type="pname">Julian</name> conjectured that at this point the Mint had
					run out of cent dies.<ref target="CH2-#n10">10</ref> On July 20, Chief Coiner Henry Voigt began delivering half cents, from 7/8 inch blanks that had been <pb n="13"/> prepared in May, struck from dies that <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name> had completed before July 18—probably from sketches furnished by
					Mint Director <name type="pname">David</name> Rittenhouse.<ref target="CH2-#n11">11</ref> In the meantime, Rittenhouse hired the illustrious <name type="pname">Joseph</name> Wright as first Mint Engraver, evidently because he was pleased with the design and execution of Wright's pattern quarter dollar of 1792 (the
					two copper pieces with eagle on segment of globe, surrounded by 87 minute stars).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Wright's</name> first task was to prepare working dies for an anticipated larger coinage of cents. It was out of the question to incise each
					die entirely by hand from scratch, as Henry Voigt had done for the Chain and Wreath designs (the latter most likely also from Rittenhouse sketches). Wright
					therefore began work on an obverse device punch which was to become the Liberty Cap design, and which would be reused in 1794 as the Head of 1793.</p>
            <p>Because the Chain and Wreath cents were comparatively thick in proportion to their diameters, they did not ring well: a circumstance then thought to ease the
					task of counterfeiters. Accordingly, someone (probably Wright, Voigt, or Eckfeldt, doubtless with Rittenhouse's approval) decided to enlarge cent diameters from
					1 1/16 to 1 1/8 inches. As the second batch of half cents also had their diameters enlarged from 7/8 to 15/16 inch, we may take the two events as reflecting the
					same official decision. These broad flan half cents were delivered September 18, from blanks made before July 26,<ref target="CH2-#n12">12</ref> which gives an
					approximate date for the decision.</p>
            <p>The new planchet size meant that each working die had to be of a larger diameter as well. Relief had to be kept low, preferably lower than before, so that the
					larger designs could be imparted to the coins without extra force, most of all without extra blows from the dies, a Mint Bureau consideration even today. Use of
					a device punch was an essential step in standardizing this crucial variable: all working dies sunk from the same hub would strike coins not only with an
					identical design but in the same relief, and therefore with a better chance of having enough details brought up. New blank cutters were necessary for making the
					new larger cent planchets. During the ensuing weeks, the Coiner's Department began rolling and cutting into blanks the 2,434 pounds of scrap copper bought
					August 1 from <name type="pname">Ferdinand Gourdon.</name>
            </p>
            <p>By early September, thousands of Philadelphians were dying of yellow fever, most likely brought by mosquitoes aboard ships arriving from the West Indies. Knowing
					they were in danger if they stayed in the city, Mint officials and personnel began preparations to close and evacuate the institution for the duration, though
					they did not know what spread the disease.</p>

            <p>
               <name type="pname">Joseph Wright</name> died of yellow fever on September 12 or 13, 1793.<ref target="CH2-#n13">13</ref> He had completed only one major
					project—the Liberty Cap device punch; but he apparently did not live to see even one coin of his new design. As the two wreaths of this group are hand drawn,
					they may have been by Wright or possibly <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name>. <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name>, then of the Engraving Department and later
					Chief Coiner, supervised the mechanical task of sinking four working obverses dated 1793 from this device punch, even as in December he would sink three more
					from it for January 1794 use. Letter punches were by the Germantown typefounder <name type="pname">Jacob Bay</name>.<ref target="CH2-#n14">14</ref> We are not
					certain who hammered the letters and numerals into each working die; <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> or some apprentice could have done so. Use of beaded
					borders increased the amount of time each working die took to complete. Most likely a twin punch was used, to minimize gaps or overlaps in the beaded circles;
					the only obvious one is above M on the <ref target="#fig-5">S-12</ref> reverse. We do not know who decided to use triangular serrations for the 1794 dies.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-6">

            </figure>
            <p>On the very day that the Mint authorities closed shop, September <pb n="15"/> 18, 1793, Voigt officially reported delivery of 11,056 Liberty Cap cents. Die state
					evidence of the reverses indicates that the first few thousand coins of this design came from the <name type="pname">Sheldon</name> 14 obverse die, which had
					split vertically, either in hardening or immediately afterward. Failures in hardening had been a plague not only from the beginning of the Philadelphia Mint's
					operations; they had quadrupled the problems facing all makers of Vermont, Connecticut, and New Jersey coppers. Hardening was the moment of truth for any
					working die or device punch. It was then normally done by heating the die or punch red hot, removing it from the furnace with tongs, then swishing it around in
					cold water until the bubbling stopped. A die that cracked from this drastic temperature shock sang its own death wail: a high-pitched screech. Many dies that
					survived hardening promptly bulged, cracked, or chipped, suggesting that the process had exposed hidden flaws—if it had not created them.<ref target="CH2-#n15">15</ref> Recall that <name type="pname">Joseph</name> Wright's pattern quarter reverse had cracked on the second impression. This was all the more reason
					for using device punches to multiply working dies, simultaneously minimizing manufacturing time, costs, and easing replacement of any that failed prematurely.
					According to <name type="pname">William Kneass</name>, Scot's successor as Engraver of the Mint, <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name> invented a solution to
					the hardening problem in 1795—he aimed cold water under pressure through a nozzle at the red hot die face.<ref target="CH2-#n16">16</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By early November, the epidemic ended as mysteriously as it had begun; evidently cold weather had killed off the mosquitoes. On November 12, Mint officials
					returned to Philadelphia and reopened the buildings. Wright's beautiful device punch would not last indefinitely, quite aside from its being in such high relief
					that the coins of this design almost never showed all the minute details of hair (the glorious exception is the Eliasberg coin).<ref target="CH2-#n17">17</ref>
               <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> could not be spared to make device punches or to hand-cut working dies. Rittenhouse began looking for a successor to <name type="pname">Joseph</name> Wright. No explanation is at hand as to why he did not hire <name type="pname">Benjamin Dudley</name>, who had made the dies for
					the 1783 CONSTELLATIO NOVA silver patterns, or <name type="pname">Peter Getz</name>, who had made the 1792 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> half dollars, or
					any of the diesinkers who had worked on the state coppers; possibly he could not locate any of them.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Robert Scot</name> received the appointment as Mint Engraver on November 23, 1793, and began work at once. His credentials consisted solely
					of his work as a bank note plate engraver for the State of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>; he apparently knew nothing of the technicalities of sinking dies
					or making device punches. He was then 53 years old, and he would remain Mint Engraver until age 83, despite failing eyesight, <pb n="16"/> while four Mint
					Directors were to come and go. Because <name type="pname">Albion Cox</name> (the Mint's Assayer) and <name type="pname">Chief Coiner Henry</name> Voigt had not
					managed to post their security bonds, the Mint could not issue gold or silver coins. Scot's first task was therefore to work on dies for 1794 cents and half
					cents. This task occupied him and <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name> (who must have taught him everything) through December 1793 and into early January
					1794.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-7">
               <graphic url="COAC1_016.jpg"/>
               <p>S-17a</p>
            </figure>
            <p>Somehow Scot managed to muddle through well enough to add letters, dates, and borders to the three obverses just sunk from Wright's device punch, and to copy
					Wright's wreath sketch onto a few reverses which he could complete by punching in letters, fraction and borders. The result was 11,000 cents delivered on
					January 13, 1794—the Heads of 1793. That meant fewer than 4,000 coins per obverse die. They looked oddly crude compared with the 1793 Caps. In the meantime,
					Scot must have been hard at work on other cent dies, as coinage went on without further interruption through February 5. <name type="pname">Julian</name> has
					conjectured that between then and the next delivery, February 21, Scot completed more cent dies.<ref target="CH2-#n18">18</ref> However, part of that time was
					used for sinking half cent dies and readying them for press, as the first delivery of this denomination took place on February 22.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Scot</name> was no more prepared for the task of sinking working dies (let alone making device punches) than the average schoolboy.
					Fortunately, he had professional help in the person of <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name>. Doubtless <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> showed him how to
					make working dies by hand: sinking the center dot with a compass, incising layout circles to define where letters and borders must go; imparting device outlines
					to the die blank from sketches, by applying transfer wax; incising the main device, hammering in letters and numerals from individual <pb n="17"/> punches,
					hammering in the serrated borders; taking impressions in fusible alloy (splashers) at each stage for inspection if necessary. Scot must have skipped this step
					most of the time, to judge by the number of blundered dies. <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> presumably also showed him how to correct errors by hand or by
					repunching, and how to lap and polish die fields to remove any burrs raised by previous incising or use of punches. Only then was each die ready for hardening,
					cleaning and repolishing, final inspection and installation in the press.<ref target="CH2-#n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>However, because each working die would make only a few thousand coins before cracking, chipping or caving in (usually at center), even if it had not suffered
					clashing accidents in the meantime, Scot had to multiply dies rapidly, preferably as nearly identical as possible, in anticipation of greatly increased orders
					for coins. This meant that he had to learn to make device punches.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Scot's</name> heads on most of the half dollars of 1794-95 are so nearly identical that they must have been made from a device punch. The
					same remark holds for the eagles on these half dollars, and for their smaller counterparts on the half dismes of 1794-95. Evidently during 1794 <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> taught Scot to make barely adequate device punches, which are in low relief like the coins. They would have been essential most
					of all for cents, which were the Mint's principal output for 1794 and some later years, far more than for half dismes, which remained limited issues through
					1805. But if so, why are the cent heads not more alike? Why are they so different that even <name type="pname">Dr. Sheldon</name> could go on believing until
					the end of his life that Scot made every cent die by hand?</p>
            <p>The answer eluded me for years until I literally got it in a dream, last June 2. I dreamed I was comparing 1794 cent obverses by superimposing slides, noticing
					that though the hair was different <hi rend="italic">the facial features were identical</hi>, and that I greeted the discovery with surprise and delight. After
					I awoke, I asked <name type="pname">Jack Collins</name> if he had a set of slides of 1794 cents; he did, and when I began the comparisons, the dream came true

            <p>Not that this should have been a total surprise. <name type="pname">David Proskey</name> was apparently the first to point out (in his 1879 serial) that the
					three Head of 1793 obverses were made from the old (<name type="pname">Joseph Wright</name>) device punch. On side-by-side comparison, <ref target="#fig-7">S-17a</ref> shows what mint error fanciers call design hub doubling; this is plainest at curl points, base of lowest curl and truncation, and (on the
					sharpest survivors only) on many other details of hair.</p>
            <p>When I studied <name type="pname">Joseph Brobston's</name> half cent collection (1952), I deduced that at least three, possibly all, of the 1794 half cent
					obverses came from a single device punch (see pp. 18-19). The <name type="pname">Gynandroid</name> Head, with pointed 9 in date, may have been from the same
					device punch as the others, though if so it was so drastically altered as to prevent certainty.</p>

            <p>The same remarks apply to the High Relief Head, which was so deeply recut that the coins made from it would not stack without a high protective border. An odd
					precedent for the latter is <name type="pname">Abel Buell's</name> Hercules Head Connecticut obverse, which was from the same complete hub as the rest of his
					obverses of 1786 but suffered similar deep recutting. Possibly both instances represented attempts to eliminate some kind of blunder.<ref target="CH2-#n20">20</ref>

               <name type="pname">Charles Steigerwalt</name>, back in 1908, was already aware that there are three close matches among the 1794 half cent reverses (see p.
						21),<ref target="CH2-#n21">21</ref> though again nobody seems to have figured out why until the 1950s. Maris, probably working from worn or weakly struck
					examples, had confused two of these dies. During study of Brobston's collection, I also deduced that these reverses were made from a complete hub, including all
					letters, fraction and serrated border, whereas the other two were obviously hand cut dies, as were their successors through 1800. The three hubbed half cent
					reverses can be distinguished only by differing details of hand strengthening such as numbers of extra berries. Most leaves and many letters were also
					individually repunched. Each of these dies therefore required so much handwork that it took nearly as much time to complete as one totally hand cut; perhaps
					more, if one counts the extra time needed to make the hub and sink it into each die blank. One of the three may conceivably have been the original matrix from
					which the hub was raised to make the other two working dies; this is undeterminable because all three dies were recut differently.</p>
            <p>A complete hub was a much more ambitious undertaking than a device punch, if only because it required much more power at the press than anything else short of
					the largest medals. Three years later, <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> could use complete hubs to multiply dies for 50,000,000 <name type="place">British</name> pence, only because he powered his Soho Mint with James Watt's biggest steam engines. But the Philadelphia Mint could neither order a steam
					coining press from local foundries nor build its own; the biggest of its five coining presses, used for silver dollars, medals, and hubbing, is likely to have
					been the one bought from <name type="pname">Samuel Howell,</name> Jr. &amp; Co. on March 25, 1795,<ref target="CH2-#n22">22</ref> and even this was only
					marginally adequate.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, from the 1790s to the present day, the Mint's ideal goal was the same as <name type="pname">Boulton's</name>: mass production coinage so nearly
					identical (except for dates) that any visible deviation is suspicious. Most likely Rittenhouse and <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> had noticed the extreme
					uniformity of <name type="pname">Abel Buell's</name> then familiar Mailed Bust Left 1786 Connecticut coppers, which used complete hubs including even the date,
					and which were the first <name type="place">American</name> coins ever to be made by that technique. Scot's three 1794 half cent reverses were the next, and the
					first federal coins to be so made.<ref target="CH2-#n23">23</ref> Scot and <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> tried it again in 1798-1801 on over 40 cent
					reverses, with the same result as in 1794. Each working die needed time-consuming handwork, and occasionally this led to blunders: 1798 <ref target="#fig-19">S-165</ref> and <ref target="#fig-19">179</ref> both show letters first inverted (rotated 180 degrees) then corrected. Their successors, <name type="pname">William Kneass</name>, <name type="pname">Christian Gobrecht</name> and <name type="pname">Franklin Peale</name>, tried again in 1835-39 on the cent
					reverses, with the same result; but thanks to steam power, they succeeded in making effectively identical reverses in 1839-40 on several different
					denominations; and later Mint Engravers have continued to make identical reverses in a given denomination ever since.</p>

            <p>But back to the superimposed slides of 1794 cents: when I superimposed a transparency of the earliest Scot cent obverse, S-21, successively on slides of the next
					dozen obverses in <name type="pname">Sheldon's</name> order (through S-40), I found that the facial features, busts and caps match identically except for
					occasional minor reworking of some folds of cap. Poles, lettering, dates, and borders do not; nor are the heads identically centered on the dies. Handwork has
					produced rounder <pb n="23"/> cheeks and lips on a few. The greatest differences are always in the hair, even as with the half cent obverses. Evidently Scot ran
					into the same problem in multiplying cent obverses from a device punch as with the half cent obverses, and he solved it in the same way.</p>

            <p>Probably by late April or early May 1794, Scot completed a copy punch, and with <name type="pname">Eckfeldt's</name> help sank some 16 more working obverses from
					it, to make the varieties <name type="pname">Sheldon</name> 41 through 66. These heads were more vigorously reworked than their predecessors, in varying degrees
					of relief and coarseness or fineness of hair, which explains why <name type="pname">Chapman</name> grouped them as his Styles 3, 4, 5. Crudities such as the
					Fallen 4 (S-63) doubtless represent some apprentice's ineptitude in hammering letters and numerals. Coinage resumed May 8 and continued through August 29, on
					which date operations halted: the rolling mills broke down, and apparently all cent obverses had been used up. Deliveries totaled 500,200.<ref target="CH2-#n25">25</ref> As Congress had in the meantime passed a law reducing the surety bond requirements for Cox and Voigt, these two officers found friends willing to
					risk signing their bonds, and the Mint was thereafter legally able to coin silver and gold. Rittenhouse took this interruption in cent coinage as an opportunity
					to prepare for the first federal mintage of silver, and ordered Scot to begin making dies for dollars, half dollars, and half dismes. The first half dollars and
					dollars appeared in late fall and early winter 1794; the first half dismes in March 1795, some <pb n="25"/> of them bearing the date 1794.</p>
            <p>On November 19, 1794, the Mint hired <name type="pname">John Smith Gardner</name> as Scot's assistant: the first to stay for more than a few days, and the most
					gifted aside from <name type="pname">John Reich</name>. On November 21, cent coinage resumed with a delivery of 21,000; these probably comprised the last few
					varieties from Scot's second head punch, ending with <ref target="#fig-26">S-66</ref>. Another interruption in cent coinage followed, partly to allow Scot time
					to make dies for silver coins. In the meantime, Gardner raised the first of his two head punches for cents, and sank five obverses from it. These made the
					varieties <ref target="#fig-27">S-67</ref> through 71 and NC-3: Maris's Roman Plicae. <name type="pname">Chapman</name> placed these and the Head of 1795 in his
					Style 6. Coinage of December 16-24 totaled 80,000 pieces. Lower relief paid off: this aggregate averages 16,000 coins per obverse die, which is much higher than
					previously; the more so since one die cracked at hardening (S-68) and another must have failed at once (NC-3).</p>

					Exact Head of 1795. Cent coinage halted, not to resume until October 1795—from the same device punch.</p>

            <p>So far we have only discussed obverses. What of the reverses? Were these all cut by hand as <name type="pname">Sheldon</name> believed? Apparently some few were,
					while many others were made from three or possibly four wreath punches—a discovery also made last June 2 as a result of that same dream.</p>
            <p>A wreath punch is a simpler proposition than a head punch, partly because of smaller size and lower relief, partly because it required less work to complete.
					Each wreath punch for cents comprised stems, 14 leaves on left branch, 18 on right, ribbon with bow, possibly stem ends, and possibly a few berries. Other
					berries, their <pb n="26"/> short stems, fraction, letters, and borders all had to be added by hand.</p>

            <p>The two reverses found with the Head of 1793 obverses are handcut; Scot's first wreath punch appears on <ref target="#fig-29">S-22</ref> through 28 (except 26)
					and NC-8. Then comes a group of hand-cut dies. Another wreath punch was used on reverses Q through V of <ref target="#fig-24">S-41</ref> through 47, then <pb n="27"/> more hand-cut dies. Scot's final wreath punch for 1794 includes reverses AA through JJ of <ref target="#fig-32">S-57</ref> through 71, except S-63
					and NC-6.</p>
            <p>Such drastic recutting as could have made reverse P from rev. <name type="pname">N</name> occurs on other 1794 working dies. A notorious instance is the <name type="pname">Marred Field, Sheldon</name> obverse 11, 12, and 17, which has a chip out of left field. This die was twice resoftened, the hair reworked, then
					rehardened, and nevertheless survived six reverses. No other die in the history of the Mint ever received such treatment, and fewer than six other dies are
					known to have been sent to press, resoftened, reworked and rehardened even once. Probably this was from the same batch of tool steel that yielded the Closed
					Wreath die X of S-49 through 54, which also survived six obverses.</p>

            <p>A more surprising and paradoxical instance of drastic retooling is that of the Fallen 4, <ref target="#fig-36">S-63</ref>, which was softened, reground (making
					berries smaller), lowest right leaf strengthened, left stem lengthen- <pb n="28"/> ed and other minor retouchings made, and altered in the border to add 94
					partly overlapped stars, creating the Starred Reverse, <ref target="#fig-37">S-48</ref>. I proved this by comparing superimposed slides during the
					abovementioned June 2 experiment. Denis Loring points out that he had visually identified these as earlier and later states of a single die some years ago; I
					had missed that issue of <hi rend="italic">Penny Wise,</hi> so that this may be taken as independent confirmation. The paradox is that a reverse which had
					already served to make over 10,000 cents was chosen for this experiment rather than a spare die not yet hardened; surely <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> knew
					that a rehardened die would have a shorter life than normal, as this one certainly did; it quickly buckled across, creating possibly the most famous rarity
					among 1794 cents. <name type="pname">Robert Julian</name> has conjectured that the partly concealed stars were an experimental anticounterfeiting measure, even
					the number 94 more than coincidentally matching the date.<ref target="CH2-#n26">26</ref> We may never know why this was abandoned; possibly Rittenhouse realized
					that it was a mere frill.</p>
            <p>Collectors hitherto have been more interested in the differences among varieties than in the similarities; and they have not realized how much can be learned
					from the latter. Apparently a different brain hemisphere is involved: the left hemisphere is supposed to be involved in perceiving and analyzing differences,
					the right hemisphere for globally recognizing resemblances. Now that we have begun learning to look at the same coins from both perspectives, the evidence here
					described and illustrated strongly suggests that in other denominations and dates further discoveries of the kind still remain to be made.</p>

            <p>Copper, unlike gold and silver, has been historically the coinage of the broad masses. After all it was copper and not gold or silver which bought the daily
					bread of the poorer classes. Thus copper was the most needed, the most used, but at the same time, the most neglected of the coins. Without it the daily life of
					large segments of the population was rendered difficult beyond belief, contributing also to the stagnation of the economic development of the entire nation. It
					is difficult for us, who are used to a smooth flow of the daily cash supply to imagine the tribulations that the generations prior to our period had to endure.
					It was a continuous battle to procure the necessary cash, and to figure the family budget in a constantly fluctuating rate of exchange.</p>
            <p>A brief glance at the role of copper throughout the ages might give us a wider perspective. Copper, a discovery of the neolithic age, found a great development
					in ancient <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. The metal was given an intrinsic value and was used by weight in barter transactions. The further development of
					copper as an economic tool is evidenced by the famous Keftiu bars found on the shores of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> Minor, and by the wealth of copper in
					its form as bronze—an alloy of copper and tin—extensively used for coinages by the ancient Greeks. Ancient <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_1814991">China</name> used bronze as money
					in the form of implements and continued for two millenia an economy based on a coinage made almost exclusively of bronze and copper. Cyprus, which developed
					from the fourth millenium B.C. an extensive production of this metal, exported it to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> which coined the word <hi rend="italic">cuprum</hi> from <hi rend="italic">cyprium.</hi>
               <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> started its trade with crude ingots of <hi rend="italic">aes rude</hi>, casting it later into regularly shaped ingots with
					markings, the <hi rend="italic">aes signatum,</hi> arriving finally at the widely used <hi rend="italic">aes grave,</hi> the Roman coins which were at the
					foundation of the monetary economy of a growing world empire.</p>
            <p>The precious metals, silver and especially gold, were late-comers in the Roman system, differing from the Greek monetary evolution in which bronze was a late
					addition to its basically monometallistic silver coinage. The Roman imperial period made a more extensive use of copper in the form of bronze, and the
					Greco-Roman world of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> Minor and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> flourished economically on a coinage rich in copper. With the fall
					of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>, bronze lost its importance, and the medieval money market brought the small silver coin into the daily exchange, relegating
					copper to sporadic appearances. Only during the Renaissance period did copper surface once again. The four-maravedi pieces which <name type="pname">Charles</name> and <name type="pname">Johanna</name> gave to the New World, should be noted as the first copper coins of our hemisphere.</p>
            <p>When discussing the role of copper coinages in the economy of <pb n="33"/> the early United States we find a situation which differs fundamentally from that
					customary in the empires of the ancient world. In the monetary economy of the American Colonies there coexisted two basic influences: the English and the
					Spanish traditions. The economic infancy of the United States was strongly influenced by the mercantilistic philosophy of these powers. The mother country's
					economic development was based on a favorable balance of trade guaranteed by a wealth of gold and silver which had to be produced by an active trade with the
					colonies; at the same time the colonies had to buy the manufactured goods from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> with "good" or "honest" money.</p>
            <p>The colonists came with little coin into a world where monetary trade was an unknown factor. A new and interesting phenomenon took place, the tendencies to
					transplant the well-known customs of the old country and the harsh realities of a completely new and different surrounding forced the colonists to sway from
					their old traditions. True to its mercantilistic belief, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> expected the colonists to be self-supporting, therefore it left them
					without any real financial and monetary aid. The lack of coins, especially those of copper, the main instrument of daily transactions, rendered the life of the
					early settlers very difficult and forced them to compromises in order to survive economically. Barter became their way of life, especially for the daily small
					transactions, wampum was used in the trade with the Indians; and the merchants, though they willingly used whatever coins came their way, were forced to rely in
					general on credit.</p>
            <p>The economic hardship brought about by this scarcity of coins was extended to the entire northern continent, including Canada and the West Indies. It created a
					very unrestrained situation, whereby everything that could pass as money was accepted. We had therefore on the one hand a multitude of money substitutes and
					coins of various origins, metals, weights, finenesses and shapes— even halved, quartered or holed—being avidly accepted, and, on the other hand, intransigent
					laws imposed by the mother country which forbade the creation of legislated and well-organized coinages. This chaotic situation was very detrimental to the
					poorer classes, beneficial only to the speculators who became rich playing the money game between home, the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3571219">West Indies</name>, <name type="place">Central America</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. When studying the economic and monetary situation of the early beginnings of this
					country, one wonders at the adaptability of the people. In contradiction with the great variety of means of exchange, the accounting books were kept in pounds
					and shillings. As an author put it: "Traders kept their books although deal- <pb n="34"/> ings were in tobacco."</p>
            <p>One of the main reasons for the monetary impasse, concerning especially the small change, lies in the tradition brought by the settlers from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, and in their continued economic ties with an intransigent central government set mostly on the exploitation of the colonies. Queen
					Elizabeth and her successors, as well as Parliament and the high nobility, considered the preoccupation with coins of inferior metals, as copper, tin or lead,
					beneath their dignity. The legitimate demands to replace the small silver coins for the daily market, which were easily worn or lost, with larger coins of a
					cheaper metal, were ignored by <name type="pname">Elizabeth</name>, who authorized a copper coinage only for Ireland, but hesitated to do it for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. The great inconvenience created by this lack of an appropriate coinage needed in daily transactions motivated the private
					sector, mostly merchants, to produce their own token coinage in base metals in large quantities. As an author of the seventeenth century stated: "The
					tokens...which every tavern and tippling house presumed to stamp and utter for immediate exchange."</p>
            <p>The English Crown authorized a copper coinage only in 1672 consisting mostly of half pence and farthings. Through the token issue a new balance was created,
					whenever the royal coinage diminished or was discontinued, the token issue increased, and vice versa. Especially during the great scarcity of official copper
					coins between 1787 and 1795 and the war years of 1811 to 1815, tokens tended to flood the market. The reason for the neglect on the part of the Crown was that
					copper coins were not considered proper currency. In 1757 the Assay Master of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> Mint stated "copper coins with us are
					properly not money but a kind of token passing by the way of exchange instead of parts of the smallest pieces of silver coin." In addition the supply of copper
					bullion fluctuated causing price changes which in turn deterred the Mint from striking them regularly. The English money market had a way of establishing a
					balance: whatever was in surplus found its way to the colonies.</p>
            <p>The settlers had little bullion available and one of their main preoccupations was to obtain metallic money. The trade with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>
					absorbed most of the "good" money available, especially gold and silver, which came through trade with the West Indies, where Jamaica was the main bullion
					center. Although "truck" or trade in agricultural goods was widely used, especially in the rural areas, small change of base metal was essential for the home
					trade. To follow the venturesome evolution of the copper coinage in the early eighteenth century is indeed highly interesting, revealing on the <pb n="35"/> one
					hand the constant battle between tradition and legality, and on the other hand a trend to adapt to the dictum of the daily needs. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> opened, against the orders of the mother country, a mint in 1652 in Boston, but it produced only silver coins. In the northern
					colonies English half pence of copper were accepted 12 to 18 to the colonial shilling. Other additions as the Irish coppers (<name type="pname">St.
						Patricks</name>) brought to <name type="pname">New Jersey</name> in 1681 by <name type="pname">Mark Newby</name> were only of little relief. Nevertheless
						<name type="pname">William Wood's</name> so-called "<name type="pname">Rosa Americana</name>" pieces of 1722-23 were rejected in New <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> because they were not of pure copper—actually they were more valuable, containing an addition of zinc and silver.</p>
            <p>The first copper coins made on <name type="place">American</name> soil were issued as private tokens by Samuel Higley from copper smelted in his mine near
					Granby, Connecticut, between 1737 and 1739. At first his coins, valued at three cents, were readily accepted, only to be later rejected as not being "real or
					legal money" although Higley was open to any compromise pleading "value me as you please." His Yankee ingenuity failed, the obedience toward English laws was
					still deeply ingrained and a token coinage, a frequent occurence for over a century in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, seemed unacceptable in Connecticut. A
					decade later, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> received an official shipment of 10 tons of English regal
					coppers, half pence and farthings, sent as compensation for war debts incurred by the states. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> was the only state which had
					the authority to have its own copper coinage, but this venture was ill-fated. The copper half pence of 1773, bearing King George Ill's portrait and struck in
						<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, arrived late, and due to a decrease in the price of copper and especially the outbreak of the Revolution, only very few
					coins reached actual circulation.</p>
            <p>The big money battle was fought in the Colonies not for a copper coinage but for the introduction of paper money, and we find reams of contemporary literature
					debating the pros and cons of its issuance. The colonists went into the war heavily burdened by bills of credit. The specie of which there were 12 to 30 million
					dollars worth in circulation before the war, disappeared completely after the outbreak of hostilities. The Continental Congress could not impose any taxation to
					meet its obligations, therefore many influential people thought that the issuance of paper notes was their only salvation: "Why load my constituents with taxes
					when we can send to our printer and get wagonloads of money." The demon of fiat money took possession of the country and the Colonial Assemblies and the
					well-meaning but naive and inexperienced politicians became in the eyes of their compatriots "honorable thieves, <pb n="36"/> zealots... yet robbers of the
					American people, pairing patriotism with financial crookedness." A few years later those wagonloads were worth almost nothing, as a contemporary said, "it
					quietly expired in the hands of the possessors...."</p>
            <p>During the Revolution all states were faced with economic disaster. As <name type="place">England's</name> primary strategy was against the fiscal stability of
					the states, to the self-inflicted evil of the uncontrolled issuance of bills of credit came the flood of counterfeits in paper and coin, sponsored by <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. English half pennies, 1771-76, were brought to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> and sold at a discount. After the Revolution
					there were <name type="place">American</name>-made counterfeits from <name type="place">Newburgh</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>. Private tokens were
					better made and circulated at a higher than intrinsic value, but after 1789 they ceased to circulate.</p>
            <p>The disaster was too obvious not to make people aware that one of the most imperative duties of the newly established government was to salvage the monetary
					situation. The newly formed Confederation needed above all financial help since the country was completely depleted of money after the heavy sacrifices
					sustained during the war. The shot in the arm came from France and <name type="pname">Holland</name> which supplied, in a series of loans paid in French and
					Dutch silver and gold coins, the necessary funds. Thus the government could start to consolidate its leadership by paying old debts for armaments, interest on
					loans, and compensation for the great losses incurred by the citizens through the paper money debacle. By 1789, 10 million dollars had come into the
					country.</p>
            <p>The federal system established by the Constitution of 1789 gave the sole right to regulate the new coinage to Congress; no state could coin its own money or emit
					bills. However there was no Treasury, as it was created only in September 1789, with <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_66496514">Alexander Hamilton</name> as the appointed Secretary.
					Until July 1785 the English pound was in use, and only on July 6, 1785 did the Congress establish after the model of the old Spanish eight real piece, the
					dollar of 365.64 grains fine silver, based on a ratio to gold of 15. 25 to 1. Gold and silver were made sole legal tender in payments of debts, copper was not
					deemed worth any consideration. It was a clear separation of the major coinage of high value and unlimited use, forming the standard, and the minor coinage of
					low value and limited use.</p>
            <p>No new government ever started under more discouraging prospects. While Congress was preoccupied with theoretical questions, stringent, practical, financial
					emergencies were awaiting solutions. The country continued to be plagued by a great shortage of small change, absolutely indispensable for daily transactions.
					It is easy to imagine their calamities when daily wages of laborers and farmhands <pb n="37"/> were counted in one dollar and some fractions, and when one pound
					of flour cost between 4 and 10 cents.</p>
            <p>Copper is a convenient but inexpensive metal, and the custom of governments was to pay little attention to the regulation of this cheap aggregate coinage. It was
					only natural that copper coinage had the tendency to become fiat money, which means that its value could be arbitrarily established by law, becoming what the
					masses called "thieves money." But in the daily trade its intrinsic value mattered very much, which explains the constant rejection of lighter pieces. The
					purity or weight of the coins was often checked and shopkeepers had sorting boxes and coins wanting in weight or fineness were immediately discounted.</p>

            <p>In order to satisfy the urgent need for "cheap money," states such as <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name>, Connecticut, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name>
					and Vermont put their own coins into circulation, and judging from the flourishing business of some coiners, such as <name type="pname">James Jarvis</name> of
					Connecticut, the demand was indeed great, especially since paper had been completely discredited, and the use of foreign copper coins had been outlawed by
					Congress in 1786. Finally the Continental Congress decided to fill this nationwide need and give to the united country a standard copper coin. Ordered in April
					1787, the Fugio cent, the first national copper coin, actually the first coin issued by the <name type="place">United States</name>, started its adventurous and
					ill-fated course. The coiner <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> from Connecticut had to produce 30 million coins without actually having either copper nor money.
					Two years later, Jarvis was a fugitive, and only part of the large issue was released in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>. But the people, irritated by a
					prolonged experience with a lot of counterfeits and underweight <name type="place">British</name> halfpence, refused this legally low weight cent (according to
					the new federal standard). In July 1789, 100 Fugios were worth only 21 cents and the results were disastrous; a real small-change panic broke out and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> City had to rely again on paper money, issuing fractional notes of one to three pence in order to establish order and
					confidence in money.</p>
            <pb n="38"/>
            <p>The Fugio cent with its inspiring design and motto was as transient as the passing of time it referred to, leaving behind it financial ruin and tragedy; its
					distributor, Royal Flint, ended up in jail.</p>
            <p>The most prominent minds of the nation—<name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</name>, <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name>, <name type="pname">Alexander
						Hamilton</name>—participated actively in the general effort to establish a uniform, viable coinage. The process was slow and lengthy; it took almost a
					decade, fraught with endless debates and controversies. The decision fell in favor of a silver dollar patterned after the Spanish "milled dollar," as the basic
					unit. As the smallest unit, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>, based on the decimal system, proposed the copper cent, or one hundreth of a silver dollar, to
					which was added later the half cent. The cent was formally adopted by Congress on July 6. 1785, but years were to pass before Congress enacted the National
					Coinage Act on April 2, 1792, creating the Mint and regulating a bimetallic coinage system of gold and silver. April 2, 1792, was also the birthday of the
					official United States cent and half cent. The cent was to be of good quality copper, and be the only coin to bear its denomination, but it did not share with
					the other coins the legal tender status. The Act of May 8 of the same year provided further details of its striking. The Director of the Mint was authorized to
					purchase copper, not to exceed 150 tons. After the striking of 50,000 dollars worth of coins, they were to be paid into the Treasury; six months later the coins
					were to be announced to the public in two gazettes. No other copper coins were to pass current as money.</p>
            <p>This cent was the successor to the unaccountable half pennies produced in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> by the Crown or by greedy counterfeiters, or forged
					on primitive machinery from copper gathered from every possible source in small towns of the various colonies. It was meant to help people, especially the
					worker, the farmer and the small trader, to face the daily payments with less tribulations, and with less fear that his earnings would be lost due to
					counterfeits or underweight pieces.</p>
            <p>What was its destiny in the ensuing half century from the moment the union of thirteen states started economic life as a nation? The monetary system freed from
					the ties of economic bondage to another power was now anchored on its own national foundation. Uninhibitedly it could stir toward its own growth, abiding only
					by the conditions created by its fast growing economy. With the move of hundreds of thousands of people toward the West, toward new lands and new opportunities,
					additional demands were made on the monetary supply. The country went through not only a fast consolidation process, but also an enormously rapid expansion,
					with <pb n="39"/> new homes, new farms, new businesses, new trades and new industries springing up everywhere which were in need of capital. The monetary system
					had to adapt to these rapidly increasing demands; it had to be flexible, but above all it had to be readily available. In this battle, paper currencies again
					took the lead supported by banks which were mushrooming all over the country. The metallic currency remained the more stable but less versatile medium of
					exchange.</p>
            <p>What was the position of the newly created copper coinage of the cent and half cent in a national monetary framework where the major coinages of silver and gold
					continued to be supported by foreign coinages? Statistics might help us cast a light on the destiny of the minor coinages in the early nineteenth century. The
					country almost doubled during the first decades of its existence in area and population, from 864,746 square miles in 1790 to 1,681,828 square miles in 1810;
					from 3,929,214 people in 1790 to 7,239,881 in 1810, reaching 23,191,576 in 1850. The country consisted mainly of rural areas which related to the urban areas in
					a ratio of 18.5 to 1 in 1790, decreasing to 5.5 to 1 in 1850. But the earnings remained strangely unchanged, artisans and laborers earned $ 1.33 per day in 1790
					and only $ 1.73 per day in 1830; farm workers were paid $ 8 to 10 monthly, and only $ 8.20 to 12 in 1850; wheat flour cost one cent per pound in 1800 while in
					1850 one cent would buy two pounds. These figures indicate that minor coinages played an important role in daily life; people quite often had to count their
					cents.</p>
            <p>If we turn now to the statistics of the copper coinages, we might be able to sketch a vague outline of their distribution. The Mint braved all adversities—lack
					of coining metal, good machinery, hostility on the part of the public and the politicians, of crippling epidemics—and started to crank out copper coins in ever
					increasing numbers. In the first year of operation, 1793, over 35,000 half cents and over 110,000 cents were issued. The number increased steadily, reaching
					over 1,800,000 cents in 1798, and over 1,000,000 half cents in 1804.The production of cents stayed in general in the millions, reaching its peak in 1851 with
					9,889,707 pieces being struck. The low points in the production of cents were in 1795 with 37,000 pieces, then in 1799, 1804, 1811 and 1815, (when none were
					produced), due in good part to a shortage in the supply of metal. A total of 155,296,734 cents were struck between 1793 and 1857.</p>
            <p>The half cent never reached the popularity of the cent, it was called the "Cinderella" of the <name type="place">United States</name> coinage and a total of only
					7,985,223 pieces was produced in the same period. It seemed not to fulfill a vital function in the monetary exchange. In general, <pb n="40"/> after a smooth
					beginning, it was issued only sporadically, with a complete lapse of 12 years between 1836 and 1848. Banks and traders did not have much use for it and the Mint
					could barely dispose of about 36,000 pieces a year. It was badly missed only during the financial crisis of 1837, under <name type="pname">Andrew
						Jackson's</name> administration, when people hoarded all metal coinages, leaving a vacuum into which came the usual symbol of bad times, the token.</p>
            <p>The money market of the first decades of the newly formed government absorbed avidly the new copper coinage, especially the cent, until its production reached
					the saturation point in 1820, when its minting was suspended for six months because of an oversupply. In general the rhythm of production was steadily
					increasing despite the enormous problems in the procurement of copper, gathered from any possible national or international source, mainly from shipwrecks.</p>
            <p>When comparing the two statistics, the population in the 1790s of close to 4,000,000 people with the number of issued copper coins by 1800 of about 4,200,000
					pieces, we reach the figure of one and 5/100 copper coin, cent or half cent, per person. This situation must have been quite disastrous from the monetary point
					of view, and we might safely assume that at least until 1820, when the supply of copper coins reached its saturation, substitutions were needed. Among others,
					barter or direct trade of goods and services must have taken place, especially in the rural areas. We must also assume that the greatest concentration of copper
					coinages must have been in the urban areas, especially in the industrial centers. The situation obviously improved with the passing of years, according to the
					production curve, and when, in 1857, the last pure copper large cents and their fraction, the half cents, were issued, did the people of the <name type="place">United States</name> look back with satisfaction to 64 years of service which they had had from this coinage? At least, the specter of financial
					instability due to a constantly changing, fraudulent mixture of copper pieces which had threatened their daily lives in the late 1700s, was a thing of the
					past.</p>

                     <p>I should not sell coin that I knew or believed to be restrikes without letting it be known. The bright, uncirculated cents I have sold of 1817, 1818,
								1819, 1820, and 1825, I am very sure <hi rend="italic">are not re-strikes.</hi> I bought them of <name type="pname">Wm. H. Chapman</name> &amp; Co.,
								dry goods merchants of this village, and the head of the firm, <name type="pname">W. H. C.</name>, informed me that he got them of a wholesale

								them as a payment on a debt, and that the Georgia merchant wrote him that they were found since the war in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_614540">Georgia</name> buried
								in the earth. <name type="pname">Mr. Chapman</name> said to me that he was in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> about the time the cents were
								received there, and that the merchant who had them thought they were too large to use, and did not know what to do with them; and that he (<name type="pname">Chapman</name>) thinking that his customers here would be pleased with bright cents, offered ninety cents a hundred for them, which
								was immediately taken. <name type="pname">Chapman</name> &amp; Co. commenced paying them out here, and their bright appearance and old dates made
								many think they were counterfeits, and they were called "<name type="pname">Chapman's</name> counterfeits", and the firm stopped paying them out. I
								then went to the store and asked <name type="pname">W.H. Chapman</name> if he had disposed of many of his bright cents; he replied, "No, I made a
								bad bargain", and laughed about their being regarded as his counterfeits. I then offered to take them at the price he paid—ninety cents a
								hundred—and he was very willing to let me have them. They were loose together in a small keg, and the great mass of them were <pb n="43"/> of 1818;
								and a great many, though apparently uncirculated, were more or less corroded or discolored. I enclose herewith one of 1817 and 1818, discolored on
								one side and bright on the other.</p>
                     <p>From this statement, you will see that there can be very little doubt about their being the genuine issues of the United States Mint of their

            <p>Randall's letter was in response to the following sequence of events. It appears that after <name type="pname">Randall</name> purchased the small keg of large
					cents from <name type="pname">W. H. Chapman</name>, he attempted to sell the coins by advertising them in journals of the time. I have been unable to find his
					advertisements, but it appears that it was well-known among coin collectors and dealers at the time, that someone was advertising bright, uncirculated large
					cents for sale. In the January 1870 issue of <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Mason's</name> Coin and Stamp Collectors' Magazine</hi>, the following notice appeared: <q>
                  <name type="pname">L.M., TROY</name>.—Beware of bright pennies of old dates. Buy them as restrikes, but not as originals. We can send 1816, '17, '18, and
						'19 (large and small dates) and 1820 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Cents for 25 cents each, fair ones for 2 cents each.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The notice must have had an effect on Randall's ability to sell his bright, uncirculated large cents. Thus, he attempted to use <name type="pname">Edward
						Cogan</name>, the first full-time numismatist dealer in the <name type="place">United States</name> in order to help him rebut the inferences drawn from the

                  <name type="pname">Mason's</name> Journal.</hi> Thus he wrote the previously quoted letter to <name type="pname">Cogan</name>.</p>

            <p>Such was the call that brought the most famous hoard of <name type="place">American</name> coins to the small upstate village of <name type="place">Norwich</name> in the spring of 1869.

               <p>We know from the Cogan letter that the ANS has at least four large cents from the <name type="pname">Randall Hoard</name>. Surely, some of the residents of
							<name type="place">Norwich</name> in 1869 took a few of the large cents in change and probably somwhere in the area, there are a few of the large cents
						still residing in a family collection.</p>
               <p>We can assume that Randall was able, through his advertising, to sell many of his large cents before his death. He either sold or consigned some to <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodward</name>. Woodward's sale catalogue 18 of February 23, 1874 contains the following lots: <q>1016: 1819. Splendid
							uncirculated Cent, with polished surface, from hoard recently found.</q>
                  <q>1017: 1820. From same hoard. Bright red. Tarnished in one place, and a little rough. Rare.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After <name type="pname">Randall</name> died, his extensive coin collection was consigned to his old friend Cogan, who catalogued it for sale by <name type="pname">Bangs</name> &amp; Co., on May 6, 7, 8 and 9 of 1878.</p>
               <p>A report of the Randall sale appeared in the July 1878 issue of <hi rend="italic">Numisma:</hi>

               <p>Assuming the original small keg contained 14,000 large cents,<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> Randall had sold approximately 12,000 of the original large cents
						prior to his death. Of the 2,000 coins offered in the <name type="pname">Bangs</name> sale, at least three-quarters were of the date 1818, and Randall
						indicated in his letter to Cogan that most of the cents in the keg were of 1818. Thus, if one were to find a large cent dated 1818 that "looks like it has
						not been injured by circulation but by corrosion from being kept in the damp," one might have a coin from the <name type="pname">Randall Hoard</name>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Of course, it is conjecture how the small keg of large cents came <pb n="50"/> about. Obviously, the coins were either buried intentionally or
						unintentionally some time during or after 1825, because this is the last date reported by Randall to have been in the keg. After they were buried, they
						remained as such until after the clean-up following the Civil War. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_244611490">Walter H. Breen</name> has written the most comprehensive article on
						hoards of <name type="place">American</name> coins, and reports that "the hoard is a result of overproduction at the Mint caused by a condition technically
						known as 'redundancy' and deliveries to banks lagged years behind coinages."<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>I would propose an alternative reason for the existence of these large cents. In 1976, Ted Schwarz wrote as follows: "After the initial flurry of interest in
						the Large Cents, shop keepers became wary of them. It was true that they met a definite need, but the fact that the coins were not legal tender greatly
						limited their usefulness. Ideally, they could exchange them for silver, but neither the banks nor other merchants accepted them. Many shop keepers got in
						the habit of tossing the coins into kegs, then selling the kegs for a percentage of the face value of the Large Cents contained inside."<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It seems logical to me that some storekeeper, between 1816 and 1825, threw his large cents into a small keg. I feel that there is a distinct possibility that
						he stored the keg, maybe below the floorboards in his store, and for some unknown reason he was unable to retrieve them. I suggest that maybe the store in
						which he operated was destroyed during the Civil War and while they were cleaning up the rubble, they found the small keg he had previously buried
						there.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Based upon the information that is contained in the literature, I was unable to understand why the people in <name type="place">Norwich</name> in 1869
						refused to take at least one large cent in change. A gamble on taking one large cent would have led to great profits for the relatives of the gambling
						patron.</p>
               <p>However, after researching this article, I believe I have a better understanding of the mental attitude of the people of that day. Firstly, I forgot that a
						cent was a lot of money at that time. Secondly, I ignored the fact that the size of the cents had changed in 1858 to the size we know today. Most
						importantly, it appears that many of the large cents found in the keg had a funny look to them. We know that at least the 2,000 that were sold after
						Randall's death <pb n="51"/> appeared to be corroded. I speculate that one side may have been uncirculated and the other side was pitted. This easily could
						make the patrons feel that the coins were counterfeit, even though they recognized large cents twelve years after they stopped minting them. In any case,
						that day's common coin, one hundred years later, turns into a great rarity.<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref>

            <p>This paper concerns coins that are currently known as original and restrike proof half cents of the period 1825 to approximately 1860. A reviewer of the first
					edition of <hi rend="italic">American Half Cents</hi>, published in 1971, stated that the proofs had been relegated to "second class citizenship" by the
					presentation in that book. This comment, along with requests from many collectors who thought proof specimens deserved equal status in any book on half cents,
					caused me to further research these coins. Thus, the presentation of the proofs in the second edition of my book published in 1982 has become the basis of this
						paper.<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that there are 57 varieties of proof original and restrikes of the period under consideration compared to only 24 of circulation
					strikes.</p>
            <p>In classifying these proofs and restrikes, a discipline other than date order is necessary. During the past 10 years or so a heightened collector interest in the
					background of these coins and when they were struck has created a need for another order of presentation that is more thought out than date order. Thus, I have
					formulated the following periods for classification.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1) the period 1825-1839</item>
               <item>2) the period 1839-1854</item>
               <item>3) the period 1855-1860</item>
            </list>
            <p>Each period represents a different set of facts and circumstances.</p>
            <p>The first period of 1825-1839, I have designated as <name type="pname">"Adam Eckfeldt."</name>
               <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> held the position of Chief Coiner of the Mint during this period and controlled the distribution of collector coins. The
					proofs during this period are all struck from circulation dies with the exception of the 1836 which has been heretofore referred to as an "original."</p>
            <p>The striking of proof specimens for collectors by the Mint appears to have started in the early 1820s. When half cent coinage resumed in 1825, proofs were struck
					from the second set of dies used that year. The use of the second set of dies reinforces my thought that the Mint's main concern at that time was the production
					of circulation coins. Coins for collectors were not a major concern. By 1836, collector coins appear to have gained some priority and in that year dies were
					prepared for circulation coins and proofs were struck for circulation, but no circulation strikes dated 1836 are known.</p>
            <p>Therefore the coins struck were dated 1835. Upon the conclu- <pb n="55"/> sion of the 1836 coinage the mint had a supply that would last until 1849 when the
					demand for circulation caused them to be coined again.</p>
            <p>The second period of 1839-1854 began with <name type="pname">Franklin Peale</name> replacing <name type="pname">Eckfeldt as Chief Coiner</name>. The following
					facts should be noted. First, the Mint had moved in 1833 to a much larger building, complete with then-modern machinery and the ability to fabricate copper
					planchets easily if so desired. Secondly, some dies which had had little use were retained rather than destroyed. For half cents, the obverses of 1831 and 1836,
					together with the 1836 reverse, were retained. The reason that the reverse of 1831 was not on hand was that it had been used in 1832 to strike circulation coins
					and had been discarded once it developed a break.</p>
            <p>Just when Peale started to coin proof half cents in conjunction with his private coin and medal business is not precisely known. It can definitely be stated that
					the production of collector coins had become an important issue. Thus, there are proof only coins for 1840 through 1848, and proofs of 1849 from a different set
					of dies that were used for the circulation strikes that began in November 1849. The circulation 1849 dies were also used to produce proofs. Proofs were also
					made from the circulation dies of 1850, 1851, and 1854. Since there appear to be no Mint records regarding these proofs, it has been necessary to use
					observations and other circumstances to explain my concept further.</p>
            <p>The method of preparing dies for coinage during this period consisted of using hubs to create the working die which struck the coin. The obverse hub was complete
					except for the date. The reverse hub contained the complete working die design. In examining the obverses of the period 1840-1849, it is apparent that the same
					size numeral punches are used for the dates 1840 through 1845. For the years 1846 through 1849, different size punches are used uniformly for the numerals, and
					each year is different. One also notes that the obverse hub received an injury in the hair to the lower right of the ear. It is a depressed, spike-like mark
					which was on the hub. The 1840 obverse does not show this injury, thus proving that the 1840 obverse was the first working die produced from the hub. All
					subsequent dies through 1857 have this injury with the exception of 1854 when the working die was repaired prior to striking both proofs and circulation
					strikes.</p>
            <p>The reverse dies of the 1839-1854 period were prepared from a single hub. The first working die which was used for proofs only is identified by the fact that 10
					of the 11 berries in the wreath are larger than on any other dies produced from the hub. This die was <pb n="56"/> used for proofs dated 1840 through 1849 and
					1852. Six additional working dies were prepared from the hub during the 1849-1854 period for circulation coins which were resumed in November 1849. Of these six
					dies, four were used on proof strikings.</p>
            <p>There are a few other items in regard to the proofs of the <name type="pname">Franklin Peale</name> period that are worthy of mention.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Peale</name> prepared cased proof sets for sale to collectors. In an 1843 set there is a printed card which lists the coins and their prices.
					It is assumed that the card was originally with the cased set when it left the Mint. I noted the following inscription on the card.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Manly</name> and <name type="pname">Orr</name>, Printers</p>
            <p>45 Chestnut Street</p>
            <p>
               <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>, PA</p>
            <p>In going over the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> city directories for the years 1839 through 1860, <name type="pname">Manly</name> &amp; <name type="pname">Orr</name> was listed only in the 1840 and 1841 directories. In 1842 through 1845, <name type="pname">Manly</name> and <name type="pname">Orr</name> are listed separately as printers. There are a number of questions that arise from this information.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1) Did Peale have a supply of cards printed in 1840 or 1841 as he was planning to sell cased proof sets?</item>
               <item>2) Did <name type="pname">Manly</name> or <name type="pname">Orr</name> print the card in 1843 but continue to use the old inscription?</item>
            </list>
            <p>What emerges is that Peale's starting date for the proof half cents as well as other denominations appears to have been no later than 1843.</p>
            <p>The 1840 and 1841 half cents struck with the large berry reverse have markings on the rim of the coin. In observing these it appears that the planchets were
					machine cut to size and then partially smoothed to eliminate the cutting marks. The process could be easily done on the machine tools of that day. The milling
					machine was developed during the 1820s principally for firearms manufacture and presumably was one of the-then modern machines placed in the new Mint in 1833.
					This would make it possible to fabricate half cent planchets from cent planchets which were being purchased by the mint to strike cents for circulation. The
					number of half cent proofs struck during the <name type="pname">Franklin Peale</name> period are estimated at less than 25 for each year. Planchets could easily
					be machined until late 1849 when <name type="pname">Crocker Bros</name>, sent a supply of blank planchets for circulation strikes.</p>
            <p>The omission of the 1852 and 1853 dates from my discussion will now be explained. As of now there has never been an 1853 proof <pb n="57"/> half cent identified
					other than a few auction catalogues which were presumably in error. I am not aware of any orginal 1853 proof coin of any denomination. It has been rationalized
					that the Mint just did did not have time that year to produce proofs of any denomination due to the Coinage Act of 1853 which greatly increased the production
					of silver coins. 1852 is another matter.</p>
            <p>It is my understanding that 1852 obverse and reverse dies were made in that year, but there were no coins struck for circulation, due to the inventory of
					unissued half cents on hand at the Mint.</p>
            <p>There are, however, proof coins dated 1852 which I classify as restrikes. <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> differs from my opinion and for those who are
					interested, Breen's book presents his side of this very old controversy.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref> The most important thing is that as of now, no known 1852
					proof half cent can be identified as an original.</p>
            <p>The final item of the "<name type="pname">Franklin Peale</name>" 1839-1854 Period has to do with restrikes of 1831 and 1836. These dies were in the mint in 1839
					when <name type="pname">Peale</name> became Chief Coiner. It is doubtful that Peale did nothing with them for 15 years, rather it would appear that the first
					1831 and 1836 restrikes were made during this period. The sequence of production of these restrikes can be determined by observing the deterioration of the 1836
					reverse die. The first strikings were with the obverse of 1836 and then the 1831 obverse was used. During this use the reverse developed severe cracks and was
					apparently discarded. However, the 1831 and 1836 obverses were kept.</p>
            <p>The Third Period starts in 1855 and ends about I860 to the best of my knowledge. As a result of Peale's removal in 1854, the control of proof coins was taken
					over by the Mint Director <name type="pname">James R. Snowden</name>. The original proofs are the 1855, 1856, and 1857 struck from circulation dies. The
					restrikes consist of 34 different die combinations and indicate that collector demand played an important part in the production of these coins.</p>
            <p>When Snowden assumed control there were obverse dies available for 1831, 1836, 1840-48, 1849 small date, and 1852. There was only one reverse available, that
					being the large berry reverse previously used in 1840-49. To this inventory of dies was added the 1856 and 1857 circulation obverses and two additional dies
					which were prepared from the hub. These dies were not separated by students until 1953. Prior to that date they were known collectively as the "Small Berry
					Reverse."</p>
            <p>The restrikes that were made do not appear in Mint records as production figures; rather one must use records of the I860 investigation and a great deal of
					collectors' information which has <pb n="58"/> been passed down through the years. There is, however, one exception to this. In the October 1972 <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Scrapbook</hi>
               <name type="pname">Robert Julian</name> presented an interesting hypothesis as to a shipment of 200 half cent planchets in June 1856 and their striking by the
						mint.<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> He believes that there is a strong possibility that the planchets were used for restrikes.</p>
            <p>The coining of the restrikes during the period 1855-1860 appears to have been done on three separate occasions. I classify these into groups as follows.</p>
            <p>The first group uses the obverses of 1840-48, 1852 and the circulation obverses of 1856 and 1857. The new reverse die is a small berry one with double hubbing
					showing particularly on the NT of CENT.</p>
            <p>The second group uses the obverses of 1831, 1836, 1840-48 and 1852 combined with another new small berry reverse which exhibits lines at a 45 degree angle in the
					field from the denticles to the tops of <name type="place">RICA of AMERICA</name>.</p>
            <p>The third group consists of seven obverses: 1840, 1843, 1845, 1847, 1848, 1849 small date, and 1852 combined with the large berry reverse. With the exception of
					1852, these proofs, struck from the original dies, are restrikes of previous proofs made during the Peale period.</p>
            <p>Strictly speaking, based on established numismatic standards, the first and second groups of "restrikes" are only restrikes as to the obverse dies. The reverse
					dies used are an original use but for convenience, I believe that the term restrike should continue to be used for these coins.</p>
            <p>The number of restrikes made in this period for each variety is unknown but as with original proofs it must have been small if the number of specimens now known
					is used as a guide, some of these restrikes are more plentiful than others, but in the numismatic market place, they have always commanded high prices in
					comparison to circulation strikes of the period.</p>

            <p>The purchasing power of today's one-cent piece is so inconsiderable that many of us will not even pause to pick up one dropped. But copper coins have not always
					been held in such low esteem. Indeed, there are those among us who can recall when three cents mailed a letter, bought the day's newspaper, or purchased enough
					candy to require a bag in which to carry it. But I speak of nostalgia more than history....</p>
            <p>Or do I? If we look back even farther into the past we can readily see that copper coins once played a dominant role in buying and selling. I speak of those
					centuries when the common man bartered for life's necessities and the wealthy exchanged gold and silver coins with one another. Only to the lowly tradesman did
					the rich dole out copper coins. Thus, in the market place, copper money was the coin of the realm. Copper coins bought the basic necessities of daily life:
					therefore, many more of them circulated in a day's time than any other coin.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, we can understand that it was as essential for the first <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint to maintain the integrity of copper coins as it
					was their more valuable betters: the gold and silver coins. And so it was that when the <name type="place">American</name> Mint began producing money, the
					copper cents had to be protected against the dangers of counterfeiting and clipping and had to be of such intrinsic value as to hold their own against standards
					of exchange with foreign countries.</p>
            <p>The debasing of early <name type="place">American</name> coins for financial gain was a major problem with the first <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint. A
					hammered coin could too easily be counterfeited. Or, the unscrupulous could simply file or pare a fraction from the edge of a coin, collecting the copper
					fragments to be melted down into bullion, while placing the coin itself back into circulation.</p>
            <p>The state of the art of minting at the time was such that the wouldbe counterfeiter or coin clipper's task was much simpler than now. Sensitive scales were not
					in use to weigh each coin as a standard of measure. Quality control, as we know it today, was not in use at the first Mint in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>. Thus, coins found to be heavier than the law allowed, could be culled and melted down. How profitable this must have been when the
					price of copper made the metal itself more valuable than the coin!</p>
            <p>Fortunately, however, our early <name type="place">American</name> minters did not have to invent the means of protecting coins against duplication or
					defacement. The solution lay in edge lettering the coins, a technology known to <name type="place">European</name> minters for more than a hundred years as a
					foolproof means of discouraging counterfeiting, clipping and altering coinage. This solution works as well today as in the past. I, <pb n="61"/> myself, have
					seen very few counterfeit coins with any form of edge lettering. <name type="pname">Edge</name> lettering of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coppers thus came
					about for protection's sake. It also reflected contemporary trends in <name type="place">European</name> coin design.</p>
            <p>Edge lettering or decorating, I should point out, is only possible in mechanized coining, where perfectly round planchets exist. Unless a round planchet is
					produced, edge marking cannot be affected. Yet, while the coining press was known to sixteenth-century minters, it was not extensively used until much later.
						<name type="pname">Aubrey Olivier</name> introduced the invention to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> around 1553,<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> but hammered
					coins existed there until 1645. And in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, the coining press or mill and screw was introduced by a Frenchman named <name type="pname">Eloye Mestrelle</name> during the reign of <name type="pname">Elizabeth I.</name>
               <ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> Milled sixpences were produced as early as 1561 but producion ceased around 1575.</p>
            <p>Why the reluctance of Euopean moneyers to adopt the use of milled coins? We shall probably find no better account of this resistance than appears in the
					"Medallic History of <name type="pname">Oliver Cromwell</name>," the <hi rend="italic">Numismata Cromwelliana</hi> published by <name type="pname">Henry William
						Henfrey</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> in 1877.<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref> In this treatise, <name type="pname">Henfrey</name> detailed the
					trials and tribulations of <name type="pname">Peter Blondeau</name>, a Frenchman invited to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> by the Council of State in 1649.
						<name type="pname">Blondeau</name> had invented and perfected "machinery for striking money of equal sizes and shapes, having a beautiful polish, and with
					graining or inscriptions on the edges; thus preventing the clipping of the currentcoins and the counterfeiting of them to any extent."<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The council and the House of Commons sought to have the country's coins made more perfectly and beautifully—the equal of any coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>. After submitting patterns of proposed coins, <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> was invited to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, he tells
					us in his "Proposals to the Parliament," a folio sheet dated June 1650 and now contained in the <name type="place">British</name> Museum.<ref target="#CH6-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> recounts that upon his arrival in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> he was courteously entertained by the council, but that
						<name type="pname">Dr. Aaron Guerdain</name>, Master of the Mint, endeavored to drive him back to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>, telling <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> that if he had come to be an officer of the Mint, they already had too many officers as well as more than enough good-workmen.
					The council, however, expressed its dissatisfaction with the well-known Commonwealth coins of the day, which were rudely executed and uneven in size. For nine
					months <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> waited (at his own expense) while the Corporation of the Mint argued with the Committee of Council for the Mint.</p>
            <p>In several papers outlining his difficulties, <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> described his invention as able to make a coin not only stamped on both flat
					sides <pb n="62"/> "but even to be marked upon the thickness of the 'brim,' whereby the counterfeiting, casting and clipping of the coin shall be
						prevented."<ref target="#CH6-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile the Mint moneyers held their ground. They attempted to imitate his patterns and learn his secrets—both unsuccessfully. They lowered their prices and
						<name type="pname">Blondeau</name> said he would match their rates, although his method was more complicated and costly, and eventually, <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> offered to prove his argument by making coins at no charge, as a demonstration offer.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> argued that his coins, unlike hammered coins, could not be counterfeited because of the size and complexity of the machinery
					needed in their manufacture. And his coins with the inscribed edges could not be successfully or expeditiously made in the Tower Mint by the old methods, he
					contended. Agreeing with <name type="pname">Blondeau</name>, the Mint Committee declared his money was better and should be adopted for the honor and great
					advantage of the Commonwealth... if the price was right.</p>
            <p>But the comittee's resolution only further enraged the Mint Corporation, which countered with a barrage of arguments. Blondeau's method was old hat and they
					could do the same thing themselves, if they wanted to, they charged. Besides, he probably didn't do the work himself, they said petulantly. As for the
					coins—they were nothing better than a curiosity, taking too much time and money to make. And furthermore, Blondeau's method was not adaptable to the ordinary
					coin, which was thin.</p>
            <p>The Minters offered a challenge: let <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> prove his skill by making some other pieces and they would show they could do as well. So
					it was back to the drawing board for <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> when the committee picked up the gauntlet flung down by the moneyers.</p>
            <p>In May 1651, the committee called for a competition. Both sides were to submit patterns for a six-pence and for two half-crown silver pieces. The designs were to
					include the motto, "Truth and Peace," the date 1651, the impression, "The States Armes," and "graining about the edges without the motto." The minters chose as
					their designer, an <name type="pname">Irish locksmith</name>, <name type="pname">David Rammage</name>. <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> selected <name type="pname">Thomas Simons</name>, the Mint engraver, and was given permission to use such "engines and instruments" as were in Simons' custody, but he
					could work at any place convenient to him.</p>
            <p>The contest took place but there was no clear-cut decision because the judges disagreed among themselves. Yet latter-day judges, viewing the samples, agree that
					Blondeau's samples were more regular in weight, the patterns more beautifully finished, and that the engraving of the dies and method of coining were far in
					advance <pb n="63"/> of anything previously done in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> is said to have submitted about 300
					coins to the Council of State, most of which were pocketed by the commitee and Parliament members, so that <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> had a time getting
					them back, although he had made them at his own expense and there is no record that Parliament paid for them.</p>
            <p>Rammage, on the other hand, charged the government 87 pounds to make about a dozen coins of inferior quality.</p>
            <p>Both contestants were required to submit proposals with their samples and Blondeau's contains this interesting note: "There be two different ways to make the
					pieces marked about the thickness or edge. One is ancient, known to several men..."<ref target="#CH6-n7">7</ref> In fact, said <name type="pname">Blondeau</name>, Rammage had used the ancient virole Brisee collar. Essentially this device was a collar used in conjunction with the screw press, the
					inscription was engraved in relief around the edge of the coin. It was tedious, time-consuming, spoiled an abundance of dies and engines and could not be done
					with thin coins. "As touching the new way," <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> wrote, "I am the inventor of it and only I know it..."<ref target="#CH6-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> did not enlarge upon descriptions of either the ancient method or his own. He, in fact, requested a law prohibiting anyone
					from using his new invention for 21 years. Additionally, he contended that hammered coins cost more to make than did his process, which could be used on "the
					current money which is thin..." he wrote.</p>
            <p>For a time no action was taken on Blondeau's proposal, leading him to issue another statement which, in addition to defending his process, accused the Mint
					officers of culling heavier coins for their own profit "and other dishonest practices."</p>
            <p>So much clipping went on, <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> wrote, that few coins could be found of true weight and counterfeiting was easy because hammered
					coins could not be made exactly round nor equal in weight and size. There was no remedy for such evils, <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> argued, except to
					make money his way—with devices not only on both sides but inscribed on the edge.</p>
            <p>For their part, the Corporation of Moneyers not only fought against Blondeau's coining process, they raged at his accusations of their dishonesty, claiming they
					were false and scandalous libels. In retaliation, they accused <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> of treason for making his pattern pieces in a private
					residence known as the Drury House, despite the fact that the Mint committee had allowed him that choice.</p>
            <p>To settle the question, once and for all, a debate was scheduled in Parliament on April 21, 1653, four years after <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> had ar- <pb n="64"/> rived in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, and two years after he and the Moneyers had submitted their sample designs. It appeared as though the
					Frenchman was finally to get a hearing, but fate intervened in the person of <name type="pname">Oliver Cromwell</name>. On the 20th of April Cromwell dissolved
					Parliament. The controversy was referred to the Council of State and apparently suffered a fate we are all familiar with—it died in committee.</p>
            <p>When Cromwell's protectorate began, <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> had yet to receive one cent—edge lettered or not—from the government which had invited him
					to come. He had submitted voluminous petitions and proposals but the Mint continued to strike inferior hammered coins. <name type="pname">Oliver
					Cromwell</name>, however, came to Blondeau's rescue. He ordered a complete series of coins to be struck by Blondeau's process and awarded the Frenchman a
					pension of 100 pounds a year. A reorganized Mint committee, overruling the objections of predecessors, placed <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> in charge of
					setting up a Mint in Ireland where, the committee reported, money was "so generally corrupted to the great prejudice of the inhabitants."</p>
            <p>The Mint, to be erected in Dublin, never came into being, but a petition to <name type="pname">Cromwell</name> from the Irish Council of State, setting forth the
					need for a Mint, offers us a view of what devastation occurs when a country's money is unregulated. We also get a glimpse of the problems that must have
					confronted our own early minters.</p>
            <p>The quantity of base and counterfeit coin, the <name type="place">Irish</name> Council lamented, "...eats up the good English money, which the merchants (for
					want of exchange or other commodities to return) make it a secret trade to export into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>... or any place where it yields most
					advantage."</p>
            <p>"Little other money is visible," the Irish petitioners wrote, "save counterfeit <name type="place">American</name>, which ordinarily goes for four shillings and
					sixpence and upon the essay is found not to value two shillings and four pence and that which runs currant is very little better than brasse or alchamy."<ref target="#CH6-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The result? According to the Irish state council, trade was obstructed, planting discouraged, necessary provisions withheld and the monthly contributions for
					supplying the English military forces was paid in such base coin that the suppliers were losing money and some were refusing to accept it. The outcome, the
					councilmen said with dismay, would be disturbance among the people. The cureall, they said, would be a mint where standard coinage could be produced.</p>
            <p>The petition concluded with these words: "And for that the soldier, and poorer sort especially, want the lesser and smaller sorts <pb n="65"/> of money for
					change and to buy provisions with; this may accommodate them with small and necessary proportions, et cetera."</p>
            <p>Although the proposed Irish Mint never came to pass, <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> was commissioned by Cromwell in 1656 to coin 2,000 pounds in the Tower of
						<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>.</p>
            <p>Writing for the <hi rend="italic">British Numismatic Journal</hi> in 1976, <name type="pname">Peter B. Gaspar</name> noted that on all English coinages with
					which <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> was associated,<ref target="#CH6-n10">10</ref> the edge inscription was applied in a separate operation, prior to the
					striking of the obverse and reverse, and that the final striking was carried out without the benefit of a collar. <name type="pname">Gaspar</name> based his
					observation on studies he made primarily of the <name type="pname">Simon-Cromwell</name> crown pieces.The slight curvature of the surface outside of the rim
					beading on these coins precluded the use of dies together with collars, he stated. He also observed that the indented or bifurcated letter bases on the same
					coins was due to a radial outward flow of metal during the striking of a blank in the mechanical press without the use of a collar to restrain the outward metal
					flow.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Gaspar</name> goes on to remark that <name type="pname">W. J. Hocking</name>, in discussing the competition between the Moneyers and <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> in 1651 to determine the manner in which letters and graining would be applied to the edges of coins to be produced by the
					screw press, suggested that Rammage, the champion of the moneyers, marked the edges of his coins by means of a segmented collar. Hocking quotes <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> as stating this method destroyed many dies and collars because the screw of the press was not sufficiently accurate to prevent
					the upper die from occasionally striking the collar upon its descent. Hocking believed that <name type="pname">Blondeau</name>, to lessen the consequences of
					that problem, substituted a thin strip of engraved steel for the segmented collar, and that this stencil-like steel strip, held in a collar to apply edge
					lettering, constituted Blondeau's "new invention."<ref target="#CH6-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>As described by Hocking, the thin strip of steel carried the inscription with which the edge of the coin was to be marked as a series of perforations shaped as
					letters. One steel strip, or perhaps several, were placed inside. When the blank was struck with the dies it expanded through the perforations, thus being
					marked on the edges with raised lettering <name type="pname">C. L. Mason</name> said it has been suggested that Blondeau's coining press may have been a drop
					press rather than a screw press.<ref target="#CH6-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The bands, said Hocking, would have been easier and cheaper to make than segmented collars and their loss, upon being struck and shattered by the upper die, less
					serious than the loss of a segmented collar. Losses would have occurred when the upper die <pb n="66"/> was not perfectly centered within the collar and they
					collided. If the upper die shattered the steel band, the band could be easily and inexpensively replaced. The die also would have been damaged and have had to
					be replaced but perhaps this was still less costly and time-consuming than replacing the segmented lettered collar. <name type="pname">H. G. Stride</name> has
					suggested that one method, although quite slow, would have been to use the inscribed thin steel bands with blank dies. He quotes the 1662 contract with <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> stating that gold and silver pieces were to be shaped and sized and the edges marked before they were stamped on the flat
					sides. The contract stipulated that <name type="pname">Blondeau</name> was "likewise to prepare the Rings or Viroles of Steel for marking the Edges of the
					Several Coynes with Letters and Graynings."<ref target="#CH6-n13">13</ref>

            <p>
               <name type="pname">Gaspar</name> has suggested the edge lettering of the <name type="pname">Cromwell</name> coins was rolled on by a precursor of the Castaing
					machine and raises the question of Blondeau's secrecy being attributable to its being his own invention or intended to conceal its source, possibly a device
					similar to the later Castaing machine. Examination of surviving <name type="pname">Cromwell</name> patterns tends to suggest this.</p>
            <p>Jean Castaing was a French engineer who, in 1685, also invented a machine for engraving the edge of coins. <ref target="#CH6-n14">14</ref> Castaing's experience
					was similar to Blondeau's in that <name type="pname">Louis</name> XIV was impressed with his <pb n="67"/> invention but the king's financial minister, <name type="pname">Jean Baptiste Colbert</name>, saw no need for adding the expense of edge-marking coins. Blondeau's machine was already in use in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> but Castaing's improvements made his machine worthy of being called an invention.</p>
            <p>Castaing's machine was described at the time as consisting of two thin steel rulers upon which are engraved the legend or <hi rend="italic">cordon.</hi> The
					first half of the legend is on one ruler and the second half, on a second ruler. One ruler is immobile and strongly attached by screws to a copper plate secured
					to a heavy wooden table or workbench. The other ruler is mobile and runs on the copper plate under the action of a crank or gear whose steel teeth mesh with the
					teeth mounted on the copper plate surface. The blank is placed horizontally between the two rulers and driven by the mobile ruler motion so that when it
					completes a half-turn, the coin is entirely marked.<ref target="#CH6-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1686, <name type="place">France's</name> Council of State approved a contract with Castaing to edge mark all the gold and silver coins of the kingdom. In
					1688, when King <name type="pname">Louis</name> needed money to support the war and a way to reduce counterfeiting abuses, Castaing proposed a method of
					reforming and remarking coins with a coin press. Castaing's proposal was accepted but a Parisian tinsmith named <name type="pname">Martin Masselin</name> was
					appointed to the job. We know that Masselin used Castaing's invention because he was obliged to pay Castaing 2,000 pounds annually for the use of it.<ref target="#CH6-n16">16</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This information came to light when Castaing's wife, <name type="pname">Marie Hippolyte Bosch</name>, petitioned the French Court of the Mint for redress after
					Castaing was imprisoned in 1700 through the conniving of his enemies. Like Blondeau, Castaing was fought by the minters who had lost their rights and
					opportunities for making illicit profits, because of him.<ref target="#CH6-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Two of Castaing's enemies were the guard judges of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name> Mint-men named <name type="pname">Maigret and Burgoing</name>. The third,
					and most dangerous, because he coveted Castaing's position as general manager of the royal mints, was <name type="pname">Jacques Fournier</name> de <name type="pname">Saint Andre</name>. It was Fournier who brought the charges against Castaing and his wife, accusing them of malfeasance in office. Girded with
					trumped-up charges, Fournier initiated a lawsuit against the Castaings and their clerks which was tried in the Court of the Mint.</p>
            <p>The schemers, however, had underestimated Castaing's wife. Nothing apparently escaped her notice. In acrimonious detail she listed not only the falsities
					inherent in the charges but her low opinion of the accusers as well. And all of this she presented the court in writing.</p>
            <pb n="68"/>
            <p>It seems that while Masselin received the initial appointment of supervisor of the 26 royal mints, he proved to be dishonest. In 17 months the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name> Mint alone recorded a shortage of 150,000 pounds and Masselin and all his clerks were dismissed, some of them jailed for stealing. Castaing
					was then appointed in 1691 to edge mark and reform all the coins in the kingdom and when a second reformation was decreed in 1693, he was reappointed to oversee
					the work.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-43">
               <graphic url="COAC1_068.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The conspiracy, Madame Castaing charged, took place in Maigret's apartment across the courtyard from Castaing's workshop and living quarters which Maigret was
					obliged by the king to rent Castaing for 450 pounds annually. Maigret wanted to evict them so he could raise the rent, said Madame Castaing. At the same time,
					she stated, contrary to laws forbidding mint officers to rent to strangers any lodgings assigned with their positions, Maigret was renting two floors of his big
					house to a gilt dealer.</p>
            <p>Also, she contended, Maigret and Burgoing had sustained financial losses of over 300,000 pounds by the 1693 decree decreasing the amount paid for each reformed
					coin. For this alone, Maigret had threatened to bring Castaing to his end, Madame Castaing said.</p>
            <p>Maigret and Burgoing should be called to account themselves, she maintained, for withholding her husband's key to the coffer containing rejected coins which were
					to be melted. This allowed them <pb n="69"/> to supervise the melting unwitnessed so that they were able to substitute ingots of "low title," proving the ingots
					did not entirely contain coinage. The coins they held back, she said, were kept for their own profit.</p>
            <p>The Castaings were accused of using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins turned over to them for remarking. If the scales were inaccurate, why hadn't there been
					complaints from others and why hadn't the alleged victim, a 72-year-old man named Cossin, ever filed suit, she asked.</p>
            <p>As for the chief accuser, <name type="pname">Fournier</name>, <name type="pname">Marie Bosch</name>, after calling him "a slanderer, an imposter and an ignorant
					in money matters," demanded he apologize and pay damages of up to 10,000 pounds to the Castings.<ref target="#CH6-n18">18</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Madame Castaing won. Her husband was cleared of the charges.</p>
            <p>Thus it was that Castaing's edge lettering machine was adopted by the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint when it began in 1792. Under the direction of <name type="pname">David</name> Rittenhouse, the first Mint Director, three large coin presses were received from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> in 1792 and
					then was added a modification of Castaing's edge-lettering machine.<ref target="#CH6-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-44">
               <graphic url="COAC1_069.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>In fact, the vine and bars on the 1793 large cent pieces was the most intricate of all devices ever done by the Castaing machine at the early <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint. The ornamented edge was divided into four alternating sections, two being lightly reeded sections and two large sections being filled by
					a series of sprays bearing small trefoils— probably representing cotton leaves and balls of cotton. This edging was also known as the stars and stripes, but was
					for the most part, called the vine and bars.</p>
            <p>It should be noted that the famous strawberry leaf variety carries the vine and bars edge device and that the small spray above the date on the obverse of the
					coin resembles the same vine design on the edge. The edge lettering device that replaced the vine and bars was plain with the incused inscription ONE HUNDRED
					FOR A DOLLAR followed by a single leaf. This type edge device was used <pb n="70"/> until 1795.<ref target="#CH6-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The initial step in early minting was to punch a planchet or blank from a drawn sheet of metal and transfer it to a milling machine where the edges of larger
					coins were lettered and all gold pieces and smaller coins were given reeded edges. Ridged or fluted edges on coins are said to be milled or reeded—reeding
					describing the edge itself, milling describing the process. Originally all edges were milled but when edge decorations began to be produced by use of the collar
					die instead of milling, the term milling was no longer technically correct except in describing the upsetting of the circumferential border. Lettered or
					decorated edges are milled edges only if applied by a milling machine.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-45">
               <graphic url="COAC1_070.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Edge lettering devices produced intaglio or incised designs. The distance between edging dies was slightly less than the diameter of the planchet so the letters
					would sink into the planchet and the edge would be squeezed. As the movable die was cranked past the fixed die, the planchet caught between them was rolled 180
					degrees and then freed.</p>
            <p>To eliminate the possibility of a gap, the parallel dies were slightly longer than half the circumference of the planchet. But this often resulted in a slight
					overlap of the decoration on either side of the coin edge. The pressure of the edge lettering machine also raised the marginal ridge, which upset the border.
					Because reeding was a repetitive design, edging dies could be made longer and two planchets could be inserted, one behind the other, and each rolled a full turn
					with one operation of the crank.</p>
            <p>With the Castaing method, coins had to be edge struck before the metal was hardened in striking. The distance between the edging dies is set for planchet size.
					The pressure in striking increases the coin's thickness at the margin and either the letters or the pressure <pb n="71"/> could disturb the coin's surface at
					the circumferential border. If the coin is annealed before lettering, it must be cleaned and will lose its finish and hardness. Also, if the letters do not sink
					easily into the metal or if the edging dies are too close, the coin may buckle.</p>
            <p>Buckling of coins was also possible when too much pressure was exerted by the Castaing machine. This can be observed in the reverses of the 1793 Liberty Cap
					cents, and reverses of many 1794 cents that have become concave in the center. It is theorized that the steel used for the dies was not properly carbonized and
					a weak impression in the center of the coin resulted.</p>
            <p>Edge lettering of coins was destined to end in 1836 when the new steam operated lever presses were put into operation at the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint,
					but edge lettering of America's copper coins had ceased long before that. With the steam operated presses, the planchets were confined in the collar die and
					forced against it when the face dies were struck, squeezing the metal against the collar die. The coins had to be released vertically, therefore, only a smooth
					or reeded edge could be used.</p>
            <p>But edge lettering of large cents and half cents came to an end in December 1795 as the result of a proclamation by President <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</name> to Secretary of State Timothy Pichering, reducing the weight of copper cents and half cents because of the increased price of copper and
					expense of coinage.<ref target="#CH6-n21">21</ref> By a proclamation issued January 26, 1796, but already put into effect, President <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> reduced the cent to a weight of seven pennyweights and the resultant coin was too thin to permit edge decoration.</p>

            <p>
               <name type="place">American</name> copper coinage has been examined, studied and categorized. The die varieties have been found and the links suggested. Even
					the condition of many pieces has been debated. Every berry, feather, letter or number has been counted, poured over and enlarged. I often wonder if we have been
					so busy looking at the trees that we have forgotten to see the forest. In this vein, I'd like to ask, "What is the place of early <name type="place">American</name> copper coinage within the wide context of <name type="place">American</name> arts and crafts?" If numismatic art is indeed art, then one
					should find some parallels and some kinship between the art of the designer-engraver and that of the image makers, whether the medium is paint, clay, stone, or
					clapboard.</p>
            <p>Within numismatics, colonial coinage is that coinage used in the colonies—whether it was produced here or abroad. Art historians, on the other hand, use the term
						<name type="place">American</name> art exclusively for art produced within the geographical confines of our shores. I, too, will limit the discussion to the
					local objects, not the imports.</p>
            <p>Colonists in America thought of themselves as <name type="place">Europeans</name> away from home. Many had come when situations in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> induced economic or philosophic changes. They were conservative in outlook with a bent toward preserving their particular life style. The art
					produced in the colonies during the seventeenth century is reminiscent of that which the colonists had left behind in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>. In their
					minds, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> was only a place, not a separate entity distinct in concept. This approach permeates the arts and it is not until the
					late eighteenth century that one finds <name type="place">American</name> coinage motifs meant to convey ideas rather than localities.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-46">
               <graphic url="COAC1_074.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>To set the stage for the appearance of <name type="place">American</name> made coppers in the eighteenth century, it may prove interesting to look at the sole
					coinage issue, albeit silver, produced in the seventeenth century within the confines of the <name type="place">United States</name> and compare it to the other
					arts of the time. The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> Pine Tree coinage reflects a sense of style not unlike that found within the other arts. The motif
					of the northeast flora, as well as the legend, immediately speaks of the locality. The wide, broad lettering seen in the capital letters of the tombstone of
					John Foster<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> in the graveyard at Dorchester, <pb n="75"/>
               <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name>, conveys a sense of proportion and arrangement reminiscent of that used by the die cutter of the small planchet Pine
					Tree shilling of the same decade. In both, the lower curve of the "S" seems to be cut short and the lower bar of the "E" projects toward the following letter.
					Even the upper curve of the "6" in both is short and stubby. Looking again at the central design, the pine tree, the form is described in every detail. Each jog
					of a leaf is defined as intently as is every detail of costume painted by one of the anonomyous limners.<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> There is nothing of
					illusion in either. The aim was the definition and assertion of the existence of the object. Every line of each branch is equally important just as is every
					element within the painting. One may find this same independence of parts in late seventeenth century furniture. In fact, if one turns the coin so the tree is
					inverted and looks afresh at the design, ignoring any preconceived idea, the parts seem as carefully tooled as do those of a late seventeenth century chair.
					Even homes being built at this time<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref> echo the concept that each part must attest to its own existence rather than fit a role within
					some preconceived larger plan. The relationship of each part to another rather than any moving rhythm between elements appears to have been the underlying
					design.</p>

            <p>And now to our <name type="place">American</name> coppers. The early Higley copper of 1737 bearing the legend "The Value of Three Pence" depicts a graceful
					standing deer, much less dog-like than that shown on the later issues. The animal in combination with the three crowned hammers reminds one of coats of arms
					appearing on silver tankards (see p. 76). In order to better fit both the obverse pattern of the deer and the circular format of the coin, Higley reversed the
					usual arrangement of the design elements. One finds extremely low relief used in both the tankard and the copper. On the tankards the items are engraved.<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref> On the token the elements are only bare- <pb n="76"/> ly discernable from the background as if to simulate engraving.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-48">
               <graphic url="COAC1_076.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>It is interesting to compare the shape of a tankard of the seventeenth century with one of the first half of the eighteenth century which bears a coat of arms.
					In the earlier piece the top of the vessel is almost as wide as the bottom and the cover sits above the sides similiar to a plate on a pan.<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> Comparing the tankard of 60 years later,<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref> we see a graceful element permeating the overall design. The wall of the
					vessel fits upon the bottom rim as if a continuation. The top is formed upon and echoes the movement of the parts below. Each line is built upon the other,
					independent yet relating to the whole. The design concept is changing. This, I believe, is evident in the interrelationship of all parts within the Higley
					design. The lettering, less stretched across a wide area, taller and more slender, adds to the perception of a design created from integrated and interrelated
					parts rather than to a realization of the beauty of each unit as seen in the earlier pieces. A chair from the 1760s displays an identical design concept.<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref> One curve completes a turn and ripples against the flow of the circular lines below. The Longfellow House in Cambridge built about
					1759 displays a similar approach. Each part is built upon another and interlocks to the next. Somehow each line cooperates with the whole, maintaining its
					identity yet dependent on the others. The progression of the pilasters from base to entablature on this house is like the progression of bands and lips on the
					tankard of 1749. The architectural design is far from classic or Renaissance, but, as with the copper, is completely <name type="place">American</name> in its
					manner of adaptation of borrowed elements.</p>

            <p>The copper issues of the several states reveal attempts to find proper and readily recognizable symbols to embody the beliefs inherent <pb n="77"/> in the new
					nation's governmental experiment. The eagle with down-turned wings similar to <name type="pname">Charles Thomson's</name> original design for the Great Seal is
					found on the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> issues. Even armbands made for gifts to Indians displayed the eagle of the new seal.<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> Other symbols also were widely used: although almost all tended to indicate locality rather than idea. For example, there is the standing figure of
					an Indian holding different implements. For over a century, the Indian had personified <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. In the hands of <name type="place">Europeans</name> it had been the Indian Princess symbol which had served to indicate location of this overseas colony. The <name type="place">New
						York</name> and the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> braves are less romanticized than the Indian princess version of the original inhabitants. Both
					serve as did the Indian maiden; and, for that matter, as did the <name type="pname">New Jersey</name> plow and horse or the Vermont <pb n="78"/> mountains and
					plow, to indicate location rather than the personification of abstract values. The masculinity of the Indian and the straightforward handling of the design on
					the coppers as opposed to the feminine rococo version of the <name type="place">Europeans</name>, such as that produced by <name type="pname">Dupre</name>,
					point to the search by the <name type="place">Americans</name> for a positive, meaningful symbol. A similar Indian motif appears in the adaptation of the arms
					of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> engraved by <name type="pname">Samuel Johnson</name> on a gold freedom box of 1784.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref> In these
					there is a matter-of-fact directness which in style is close to the unaffected approach of John Singleton Copley and other <name type="place">American</name>
					artists working prior to the beginning of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>By the time of the establishment of a <name type="place">United States</name> Mint many citizens had been educated in the classics. The ancients were identified
					by men such as <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>, <name type="pname">Adams</name> and <name type="pname">Hamilton</name> with the orderly, with scientific
					knowledge, social reform, and with the power of individuality. Moral values and heroic virtues came to be personified by what was considered classical form or
					at least classical reference. In 1796, the artist <name type="pname">Edward</name> Savage published an engraving of Liberty as the Goddess of Youth. She is
					shown in contemporary dress accompanied by what were considered the attributes of Liberty: the <name type="place">American</name> eagle, the flag and the
					liberty cap. The theme was classical, the style was rococo. The emphasis on the diagonal, the motion, the floating drapery, the disheveled hair, the stormy
					atmosphere: all bespeak the flamboyant style prevalent in eighteenth century <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-51">
               <graphic url="COAC1_078.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The personification of Liberty on the silver centered cent of 1792 and the bust used on the flowing hair cent of 1793 are similar in concept to the Liberty in
					the Savage print. All three are closer to eighteenth century <name type="place">European</name> art or even to the new pre-romantic <pb n="79"/> art in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> than to ancient <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> or <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name>. All three point in theme to a classic
					reference yet none are classical in style.</p>

            <p>A psychological and emotional purpose is evident in the concentrated intentness of the coin portrait. This artistic approach was advocated at the time by the
					English artist William Blake, a religious <pb n="80"/> mystic, who in the 1780s and 1790s was publishing engravings as illustrations for his prophetic books.
					Thomas Paine, whose interest in early <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coinage is recorded by Don Taxay, was involved with Blake in the Friends of Liberty.<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref> Blake's religious motifs would have appealed to those <name type="place">Americans</name> seeking artistic expressions of
					values.</p>
            <p>A teapot of the 1760s or 1770s displays the same fondness for the uncontrolled evident in the style of the flowing hair cent.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref>
					Details are free and move in serpentine lines over the contour of the silver pot just as strands of hair are allowed to float in uncontrolled directions on the
					planchets of the coin. This evidences a theory of design which had been advocated by <name type="pname">William Hogarth</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> and for which <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</name> indicated a preference when designing the serpentine walls of the University of
						<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>.</p>

            <p>The uncontrolled energy found in the flowing hair design had also swept through <name type="place">European</name> fashion to create extravagent attires in dress
					and hair-do. Bustles and peplums jutted backward. Ruffles folded downward from the neck. Even model ships were perched atop a mass of coiled hair which was
					pulled to better reveal a high forehead. The line of the high forehead of the early cent rushes forward in one direction to touch the tip of the straight
					elongated nose and in the other direction spills backward into a profusion of sinuous locks. All exhibit a certain explosive quality which must have troubled
					those seeking an artistic mode to best exemplify Liberty—a motif which was becoming synonymous with a just and well-ordered society. If art was to represent
					symbolically the new direction of thought it must mirror the ancients, "the free people." Uncontrolled fantasy and sensuous charm were thought to be modes of
					the old regimes. Restraint was needed and such simplicity and plain- <pb n="81"/> ness could only be found in the styles of the ancients.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-54">
               <graphic url="COAC1_081a.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Republican taste searched and found a more acceptable motif than the original Liberty and the calmer portrait with liberty cap replaced the wilder version. The
					idea that context and meaning could not be separated from form was becoming widely held. Educated leaders felt the qualities in art must fit the theories of the
					republic. The symbols of the new nation must speak of strength and simplicity, of chastity and logic, of humanism and of social virtue. Certainly the liberty
					cap had for decades carried a connotation of freedom and this motif juxtaposed with the simpler, quieter portrait found favor.</p>

            <p>The same artistic calm pervaded the other arts produced around <pb n="82"/> the turn of the century. A silver tea set elegantly demonstrates the new republican
					taste. Grace of line and minimal use of applied decoration create a form elegant in simplicity. A gently flowing quality appeared in the new fashions of the
					day. Greek inspired gowns popular in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> soon prompted <name type="place">American</name> women to dress in high-waisted, simple,
					long, straight-falling gowns requiring a minimum of ornamentation. Chairs, desks and tables were designed with simple lines and if decorated at all<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref>, carried only a referance to the classic wreath or swag which adorned even the common pottery of the period. The reverse of the
					copper coinage utilized the same popular motif and further added to the classicism of the obverse portrait.</p>
            <p>By 1795-96, the draped bust was found to be more fitting for a classical image and <name type="pname">Gilbert Stuart</name> adorned the Liberty in this manner
					with her hair tied befitting a goddess. The overall form is softer and more academically controlled than the earlier portrait. The hair waves above the forehead
					and curls at the ends provided a gentler meeting of the lines with the circular format. Most importantly, a long slender line is created much like the design of
					the empire style dress or the silver tea vessels. The mode was also perpetuated through architecture and sculpture. Every bank, church, and state capitol which
					was designed to convey a special quality of strength or goodness rose in the classic tradition and many were bedecked with draped <name type="place">American</name> heros and heroines.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-57">

            </figure>
            <p>The truly classic style was not long lived. By the end of the first decade of the 1800s strict simplicity was replaced with decorative elements foreign to the
					original concept of the unencumbered, graceful line which needed no decoration. Forms became rounder and more robust. Liberty shown on the cent of 1808 came to
					be personified by a more mature, more worldly woman, one not necessarily young or goddess-like. It was no longer necessary to establish the allegorical meaning
					of the Liberty motif. The idea was firmly rooted. The basic virtues associated with the ancients now blended with new concepts to form a truly <name type="place">American</name> Liberty, a matronly down-to-earth woman who could be connected with <name type="place">American</name> motherhood, agriculture
					and commerce.</p>

            <p>The roundness of the coin was heightened both by the full outline and by the stars surrounding the central motif as well. A band holding the crown of hair
					replaced the bow and long curls of the former young goddess. This Liberty band designed by <name type="pname">John Reich</name> was probably derived from the
					binding of the liberty cap appearing on his 1807 five dollar coin rather than from an athlete's fillet which has been suggested. Fashion plates dating from 1806
					which circulated in the United States show hairdresses adapted from Greek sphendomes with wide bands. The round form of the cap seen on the gold coin was one
					easily replaced by the bouffant curls atop the Liberty band on the <pb n="84"/> one cent portrait.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Such preference for style also appeared in womens' fashion design. The former soft flowing, non-binding lines of the classically inspired garb were altered by
					ties about the bust line in order to give emphasis to the roundness of the form beneath.<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> Puffed sleeves were often added in an
					attempt to accentuate the round. Hair styles changed from those which closely fit the head to a style which emphasized bouffant fullness. Domestic furnishings
					also reflected this preference for form. Simplicity suddenly was invaded by decorative elements having little or no relation to the form. Fluting on sugar bowls
					added non-classical dimensions.<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> Pieces of furniture grew claw feet or dragon-headed arm rests. Lyres supported one's back or held
					up table tops. The idea of beauty had changed. Illusions to many motifs borrowed from sources other than the classic were becoming the mode of the day and the
					non-classic portrait on the copper coinage reflects this preference of taste.</p>

            <p>The next major change in motif used on the copper coinage came with <name type="pname">Robert Scot's</name> design for the coronet type cent in 1816. Though <pb n="85"/> much censured on its artistic merit it does represent an alteration in the concept of Liberty. The <name type="place">American</name> princess had
					grown up and was assuming her place among the nations—a place equal to that of any ruling queen. The political experiment had weathered a variety of storms. The
						<name type="place">American</name> statement was being noted on the continent as well as in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. Travelled artists were
					returning home determined to provide <name type="place">American</name> expressions on a grand scale. With self-confidence displaying itself in myriad ways, it
					is not surprising to find the new Liberty bedecked with a coronet, the emblem of regal power and sovereignty. This motif was perhaps known from engravings of
					classical themes painted earlier by prominent <name type="place">American</name> artists; but it was also appearing in art work being created at the same time
					as was the new coin design. A classical sculpture of Justice commissioned for the <name type="place">United States</name> Supreme Court after the fire of 1814
					typifies the <name type="pname">Roman</name> goddess image soon to become so familiar. She wears a coronet. The sculptor of a Liberty and eagle statue placed in
					the Capitol's statuary hall during this period also crowned the goddess with the regal emblem. The art of fashion even included the symbol. A fashion plate from
					1812 recommends a woman's hair piece held with a coronet (see p. 86).</p>

            <p>The theme of the mature soverign personifying Liberty or Justice was typical of the developing spirit of the times and the internationalism bombarding the arts.
					For example, Turkish influence had brought divided skirts into vogue. Carved dragons and other animals from afar lent worldly sophistication to domestic
					furnishings.</p>
            <p>Scot, as other artists of the day, was attempting to infuse <name type="place">American</name>
               <pb n="86"/> design with cosmopolitan references in order to give Liberty an aura equal to all heads of state. Though his artistic representation is clearly not
					equal to that of Christian Gobrecht's later rendition, Scot must be given credit for the interpretation of the motif in line with the changing taste of the
					time.</p>

            <p>Through these many examples I have attempted to demonstrate that the art of the early <name type="place">American</name> coppers mirrors the evolving taste of
					the <name type="place">American</name> public. The preferences for design demonstrated in the numismatic examples directly relate to all forms of <name type="place">American</name> art.

					nation's artistic heritage and should be studied in accordance with all other artistic expressions of the time.</p>

            <p>The copper coins of Vermont offer a fascinating look at <name type="place">United States</name> colonial coinage. To historians, the period is one of transition
					in our country, from the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, through fledgling America's fighting and winning of the Revolutionary War against
					Great Britain, to the ratification of the Constitution in 1788. It was during this time that the legislatures of three of the original states and the colony of
					Vermont authorized coinage issues. Vermont, later to become the fourteenth state, was the first to issue a coinage patent, which was granted to <name type="pname">Reuben Harmon</name>, Jr. on June 15, 1785, a full four months ahead of any other state. Harmon's original right to coin coppers was exclusive,
					and Vermont required no compensation (in fact, the legislature was to be his "partner" only in that it dictated the coinage design elements). Harmon's
					association in 1787 with the Machin's Mill partnership further broadens the historical appeal of this series.</p>
            <p>To collectors, the copper coinage of Vermont offers an interesting cross section of colonial issues, often extending beyond the confines of the state borders.
					Presently, 39 varieties are collected as part of the Vermont copper coinage, yet several major types are represented, as well as pieces which are closely
					related to (and even collected as members of) other colonial series, including the Connecticut and New Jersey series, and the issues of Machin's Mill.</p>
            <p>In the past, potential collectors of the Vermont series have been hampered, and often discouraged, by a lack of readily available reference material. The word
					"available" is stressed, as much excellent material has been written on the series, which unfortunately, originally received only narrow distribution. Now,
					however, all the earlier works are available in reprint editions. A review of this principal literature is in order.</p>
            <p>In 1870, the Vermont Historical Society printed a mere 50 copies of a work by the Reverend <name type="pname">Edmund Slafter</name> titled <hi rend="italic">The
						Vermont Coinage.</hi> It begins as an excellent and complete presentation of source documents relating to Harmon's dealings with the Vermont legislature.
					Eventually, however, it becomes an extended lambasting of comments made by previous authors relative to the Vermont coinage which apparently inflamed the
					sensibilities of the good Reverend. The illustrations presented were (in part) from woodcuts borrowed from <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64367052">Sylvester S. Crosby</name>, and
					identified eight different varieties and five major types.</p>
            <p>Between 1873 and 1875, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64367052">Sylvester S. Crosby</name> published his monumental <hi rend="italic">The Early Coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
               </hi> which included a chapter on the Vermont Coinage. Contained in this section are lengthy and complete reproductions of the proceedings of the Vermont <pb n="91"/> authorities relative to a coinage, <name type="pname">Reuben Harmon's</name> contract with the Machin's Mill association, and correspondence on the
					Vermont coinage between <name type="pname">Charles I.Bushnell</name>, B.H. Hall, and <name type="pname">Julian Harmon</name> (who was <name type="pname">Rupert
						Harmon's grandson</name>). Also included were "Tables of Varieties of Vermont Coins" and woodcuts of the VERMONTIS, Baby Head, and Immune Columbia varieties
					(among others), and a description in the text of the later designated Ryder 5, a counterfeit with the sun rising from the left side of the mountains rather than
					the right. Overall, Crosby described 24 different varieties and 8 major types.</p>
            <p>In 1920, <hi rend="italic">The Colonial Coins of Vermont</hi>, written by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8962688">Hillyer Ryder</name>, was published by the ANS. Listing 31
					varieties, it was the first work to describe accurately the different dies and establish rarity ratings for the various mulings. For over a quarter of a
					century, it ranked as the standard reference on the series, and the Ryder numbering system is still retained by collectors. Photographs of 14 different
					varieties were offered, and 6 major types were represented.</p>
            <p>In May of 1947, the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> published a work by <name type="pname">John M. Richardson</name> entitled "The Copper Coins of Vermont."
					An introduction written by <name type="pname">Howard Kurth</name> provided a brief historical overview and a discussion of some of the more interesting aspects
					of the coinage. The remainder of the article was a description of each variety, with photographs of actual coins (when photographs were available) above each
					description. Three varieties were added which had been discovered since the Ryder article, and these were assigned numbers in continuation of the Ryder
					sequence. Of the 35 known varieties, 32 were illustrated, finally affording collectors a quick and simple means of attributing their Vermont Coppers.</p>
            <p>In 1976, the ANS published as Chapter 11 of their <hi rend="italic">Studies on Money in Early <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>,</hi> the "Vermont Copper
					Coinage" by <name type="pname">Kenneth E. Bressett</name>. The number of varieties was brought up to 39, and photographs were provided of every known Vermont
					die, including the counterfeit Ryder 5. Most of the coins plated are in exceptional states of preservation. In addition, an emission sequence was hypothesized
					and presented, and the different varieties were assigned to their reasoned mint of origin.</p>
            <p>Several important offerings of Vermont Coppers have appeared in recent years. In 1975, Pine Tree Auctions sold 42 examples in conjunction with the 1975 EAC
					Convention, including 24 different varieties. Each lot was photographed, allowing collectors to familiarize themselves with the nuances of grading this
					difficult series. The ANS duplicates were sold in May 1984 by Mid-American Rare Coin Auctions. Several of the <name type="pname">Richardson</name> plate coins
					were <pb n="92"/> presented and the best specimen of each variety was plated. In October 1984, Stack's sold selections from the <name type="pname">Richard
						Picker</name> collection, including several rarities and high-grade pieces.</p>
            <p>The copper coins of Vermont offer a fascinating challenge to the variety collector. Although only 39 different varieties are presently enumerated, several are
					unique or nearly so, and, in fact, only about 20 varieties are readily obtainable. The remainder require a good deal of patient hunting and luck to locate.
					Because of the miserable production techniques, locating any variety on a smooth planchet, with excellent details, centering and color becomes nearly
					impossible. Vermont Coppers circulated widely, and most extant examples are in low states of preservation. Fortunately, and as a result of the lack of available
					variety information, rare varieties are often priced as common types, and high grade examples are often underestimated, undergraded and hence underpriced.</p>
            <p>Several interesting undertypes exist in the Vermont series, including varieties struck over Nova Constellatios, Irish halfpence, and even other Vermonts. Errors,
					such as multiple strikes, off-centers and clips abound in the series and die state collectors are tempted by an array of breaks, cuds, swellings, sinkings,
					polishing marks, and an often illogical emission sequence. A complete collection of Vermont coppers by Ryder numbers would include a counterfeit Sun over the
					Mountains variety, an Immune Columbia issue, a Connecticut variety, several imitation Tory or British halfpenny varieties, and such famous and popular varieties
					as the Baby Head, Britannia Reverse, and the Reversed C variety. No other colonial series offers such diversification and challenge as does the Vermont series.
					The same thrill and challenge of variety collecting that half cent and large cent collectors have enjoyed for so many years awaits the serious numismatist in
					one of the best-kept secrets of numismatics—the copper coinage of Vermont.</p>

            <p>Numismatists are a fussy lot. For a given denomination and year of issue, it's not enough to know exactly what varieties—combinations of obverse and reverse
					dies—were produced. They want to know in what <hi rend="italic">order</hi> those varieties were made. This chronological progression of varieties is called the
						<hi rend="italic">emission sequence;</hi> its determination can be one of numismatics' most challenging exercises. The numismatist must adopt the role of
					detective, assembling varied (and sometimes contradictory) pieces of evidence to arrive at his best guess of what really happened long ago. Sometimes the answer
					is obvious, often it requires considerable digging, and on occasion there seems to be no answer at all—at least none that makes sense.</p>
            <p>In particular, there are numerous instances among the early cents of interrupted marriages. A number of coins (perhaps many, perhaps just a few) are struck using
					Obverse 1 and Reverse A, then some 1-Bs are made, then more 1-As. In which order should the two varieties be listed? There are at least four possible
					approaches:</p>
            <list>
               <item rend="hang">a. The variety that is struck first is listed first, regardless of the relative number of coins struck before and after the
						interruption.</item>
               <item rend="hang">b. The variety that is struck last is listed last, again independent of numbers.</item>
               <item rend="hang">c. The varieties are listed in the order in which <hi rend="italic">most</hi> of the coins were struck.</item>
               <item rend="hang">d. The varieties are listed in whichever order fits best with the emission sequence for the rest of the year.</item>
               <item rend="hang">Though any of these approaches can be justified, methods c. and d. seem to be used most frequently.</item>

                  </head>
                  <p>Chaining refers to the schematic representation of the known marriages among a group of obverse and reverse dies. It is usually the most efficient way to
							approach the emission sequence question, and often suggests an answer as well. We can distinguish three cases:</p>
                  <p>a. Serial polygamy. An excellent example is furnished by the ten 1796 Liberty Cap varieties, S-81 through S-90. The five obverses and six reverses unite
							in ten marriages. The chain is well defined, and we need only determine which is the beginning and which the end.</p>
                  <p>b. Monogamy, as illustrated by 1810. Five obverses, five reverses, <pb n="95"/> five marriages, and 100 percent fidelity. No help at all, but there is no
							reason to believe that the varieties emerged in other than a well-defined order.</p>
                  <p>c. Mate-swapping. Consider the 1793 Liberty Caps. Obverses 12 and 14 each mate with Reverses K and L. This is the most difficult case. The mixed
							marriages, when combined with other evidence, may be quite helpful. On the other hand, they may indicate that there was no clear-cut emission sequence
							at all, at least not that we can determine.</p>
                  <p>Often, the total picture is a combination of two or all three of the above. When this happens, chaining does not provide a complete answer to the
							emission sequence problem, but represents an excellent starting point.</p>

                  <p>When two or more obverses (say) are mated with a single reverse die, changes in the condition of that die can tell us in which order the marriages took
							place. We can identify several different types of die deterioration; one or more of them will almost surely appear.</p>
                  <p>a. Die breaks. Examples are abundant throughout the early cent series. One good one is Obverse 13 of 1794: perfect on <ref target="#fig-63">S-32</ref>,
							small rim break continuing into <ref target="#fig-64">S-33</ref>, large rim break on <ref target="#fig-65">S-34</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Of course, die deterioration can also demonstrate the <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> of a clear-cut emission sequence. Probably the most famous example
							occurs at the end of the 1803s. An examination of the various combinations of die states of Obverses 14 and 15 and Reverse Q suggests an emission
							sequence of 263-264-263-265-264-265. Then again, it may have been 263-264-265-263-264-265. We'll never know for sure.</p>
                  <p>Just as dies deteriorate, they can also be repaired. Retouching, polishing, regrinding and retooling can all prolong a die's useful lifetime, and
							incidentally help solve the emission sequence puzzle. Obverse 2 of 1798 is one example: unfinished and rusted on <ref target="#fig-79">S-146</ref>,
							reground and completed on <ref target="#fig-80">S-147</ref>. There are numerous others.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>The design of an individual die can reveal important clues as to its place in an emission sequence. On the simplest level, we assume that the 1796
							Liberty Caps preceded the 1796 Draped Busts, as only Caps were struck in 1794-95 and Draped Busts continued until 1807. Here are two more subtle
							examples:</p>
                  <p>a. 1796 S-91, 6-G. This is the only 1796 Cap not connected to the others by chaining. We therefore assume that it was either the first '96 Cap to be
							struck, or the last. But which? Sheldon placed it last, but a careful comparison of reverse dies reveals that Reverse G has much more in common with
							Reverse A than with Reverse F: <pb n="98"/>
                     <q>Leaves under UN: double on A and G, triple on F</q>
                     <q>Leaves under IT: triple on A and G, double on F</q>
                     <q>Leaves left of ONE: triple on A and G, double on F</q>
                     <q>Berries right of bow: one on A and G, none on F</q>
                     <q>Berries under ME: two on A and G; one on F.</q>
                     <q>In contrast, there are no features shared by Reverses F and G that are not shared by A as well. Therefore, we conclude that S-91 was probably the
								first, not the last, of the 1796 Caps.</q>

                  <p>It's often been said that a coin has three sides; the numismatist as detective should be sure to consider all three. For instance, take the ongoing

					1783 through 1787; of variously dated, American-made, English style, counterfeit halfpence principally originating from 1787 through 1789 at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> mint near <name type="place">Newburgh</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>; and of genuine and counterfeit English and Irish
					halfpence dated 1782 or earlier found in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>.<ref target="#CH10-n1">1</ref> The natural wear in many instances indicates over half
					a century of normal use. Until the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint in Philadelphia, beginning in 1793, made adequate quantities of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> cents and half cents available, the extended use of previously existing copper coin for circulation was to be expected, but for it to continue
					for decades thereafter seems somewhat surprising.</p>
            <p>The overproduction of copper coinage in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> by the middle of 1787 as well as the steady importation of English style coppers had
					dropped the circulating value in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> from 14 to 20 coppers to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> money of account shilling
					and by the middle of 1789 from 20 to 60. Similar depreciation in copper coin value had occurred in other states temporarily.</p>
            <p>As a consequence small size paper notes in pence denominatons were issued by cities, churches and merchants and used for small change purposes, primarily in the
					State of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>.<ref target="#CH10-n2">2</ref> Then several years after the beginning of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint
					coinage, the rise in the price of copper metal helped to restore mercantile confidence in copper coins and their acceptance was reestablished in some parts of
					the Middle Atlantic and northeastern states.</p>
            <p>However a major mystery exists—on what valuation basis did other than <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint copper coinage circulate, in what localities and for
					what lengths of time? There appears to be almost a total lack of data on this subject. The public apparently was left to its own devices to handle the matter.
					The government did not seriously try to control such copper coins or to enforce their legislated elimination. The merchants and the news media did not seem to
					care enough to complain or to write about it. There were many more serious silver and gold coin problems to solve and those took precedence over copper coin
					standardization.</p>
            <p>As is well known, the Constitution of the <name type="place">United States</name> gave the federal government, in addition to the right to coin money, the power
					"to regulate the value thereof." It denied the States the power to give anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender status. The Mint Act of April 2, 1792
					included two denominations of copper <pb n="103"/> coinage, designating a value of a cent for the larger and a half cent for the smaller, but did not give those
					coins any legal tender status as was done for all <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> silver and gold coins and, soon thereafter, for many foreign silver and gold
					coins. It created no incentive or opportunity for the public to turn in copper or copper coin for new copper coinage as it did for silver and gold. The lack of
					a needed support system for copper coinage was promptly realized by Congress and the Act of May 8, 1792 was passed giving the Director of the Mint limited
					authority to buy copper metal for coinage and providing that when $50,000 in cents and half cents were coined and delivered by the Mint and six months notice of
					that event given to the public by the Secretary of the Treasury "no copper coins or pieces whatsoever, except said cents and half cents, shall pass current as
					money." From this legislation it is obvious from the use of the words, "copper coins or pieces," that Congress knew well the conglomeration of copper money and
					tokens then in circulation.</p>
            <p>By the end of 1799, a $50,000 total had been reached and official requests for issuance of the notice were made on several occasions from 1800 to 1803 without
					result and the notice requirement was finally officially forgotten. President <name type="pname">Jefferson</name>, who was the last to be formally reminded of
					the matter by Treasury Secretary <name type="pname">Albert Gallatin</name> on April 9, 1803, responded the following day that because "the continuance of the
					Mint was uncertain and if put down, the concluding other coppers might be inconvenient." He then passed the buck to the legislative branch when he wrote that
					the required announcement should be delayed for more than a month so "that Congress may have time to interpose before the expiration of the 6 months allowed the
					copper circulation after the annunciation."<ref target="#CH10-n3">3</ref> It is reassuring to note that <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> refers to the mass
					of pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint pieces as "other coppers" and to their active use as "copper circulation." The coppers intended to be eliminated were
					not eliminated and neither Congress nor the Secretary of the Treasury accomplished anything further on the matter until the Act of February 21, 1857 was
					passed.</p>
            <p>During the 1793-1857 period the price of copper fluctuated; the amount of copper metal in the cent and half cent was officially reduced on two occasions; the
						<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint was said not to have supplied enough copper coins; the future of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint was challenged
					in favor of foreign and domestic private contract coinage for the <name type="place">United States</name>; the distribution of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name>
					copper coinage was erratic; and its acceptance was somewhat unpopular. In spite of this the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> made a profit on copper coinage; was
					able to coin as many as 15,000 cents in one day; was able to and did produce 50 tons <pb n="104"/> of copper coin per year when needed; paid the shopping costs
					for sending cents and half cents to the Bank of the <name type="place">United States</name> and its branches and to various other cities and towns; on January
					3, 1799 had "a considerable number on hand;" and in 1821 the Director of the Mint reported that at the Mint "the quantity of copper coins had accumulated far
					beyond the public demand."<ref target="#CH10-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> copper coinage was not protected by the first <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coin counterfeiting law of April 21, 1806 but was
					eventually included in the counterfeiting law of March 3, 1825.</p>
            <p>An early example of the sporatic public prejudice against copper coins was the rejection by the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> public of the <name type="pname">Talbot Allum</name> &amp; Lee cents dated 1794 and 1795. These pieces were of a size and weight conforming generally to the Federal cent
					standard. They were beautifully coined in Birmingham, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> and redeemable by a reputable <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>
					business. Yet a very substantial portion of them had to be sold for copper metal value to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint which, instead of melting them
					to prepare new planchets, cut them down to a proper diameter for striking 1795 and 1797 half cents, even eliminating the rolling process.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Erastus Root</name>, a member of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> House of Representatives from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, told
					that body on January 19, 1816 that the current coins in circulation were so deficient that they were "hardly accepted by servants in taverns." He must have been
					referring to copper coins as he promptly proposed, without success, a revision of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> copper coinage laws.<ref target="#CH10-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It was asserted that a half cent had so little value that it was unneeded. This was unsound. Admittedly half cent coinage for circulation was discontinued for
					two long periods from 1812 through 1824 and from 1836 through 1848, but due to unpopularity, not lack of value. If after about 150 years of price increases the
					public today constantly uses one cent coins, then a half cent had to have meaningful value then. To claim that our large cents were too heavy for convenience is
					also unsound when one compares that to the mixture of smaller non-uniform coppers which were in circulation for over a half century. The reason for continued
					circulation of pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers must therefore be sought elsewhere.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The 1830 Senate Report</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A comprehensive report on the circulation of coins in the <name type="place">United States</name> was submitted to the Senate on January 11, 1830, by <name type="pname">Nathan</name>
                  <pb n="105"/> Sanford (1777-1838) of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> as chairman of a Select Committee of five senators appointed to revise coinage laws.
						Although primarily devoted to foreign and domestic gold and silver coinage, the report is very specific on the need for straightening out the copper
						circulation problems. Its numismatic timing is particularly significant because it is prior to the introduction into circulation of Hard Times Tokens and
						related large cent size store cards. It included recognition that, after 37 years of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint copper coin production being added
						to the pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint copper pieces, no solution to the small change problems had resulted.</p>
               <p>Fundamentally the report pointed out that <name type="place">United States</name> copper coinage never had any legal tender status and that it was uncertain
						as to whether there was any limit to the amount of copper which could be tendered in a payment. It emphasized that "our copper coins are either legal money,
						or they are not." To solve this issue it was proposed (Senate Bill 49 filed January 11, 1830) that <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> copper coins become legal
						tender up to ten cents. This was to confine copper coins to "their proper province" for convenience in making small and exact payments.</p>
               <p>Even though <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> half dimes and dimes were already legal tender within the 10 cent limit, it was felt that such legislation would
						eliminate "burdening creditors with an inconvenient amount" of copper and satisfy the often made objection that the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> copper
						coin was "too heavy for the purposes of money." He continued that as to all non-Federal coins, both silver and copper, "when coins are so worn that their
						inscriptions and distinctive marks are effaced they have lost the character which they received from the mint...that coins reduced to disks of smooth metal
						are too inconvenient."</p>
               <p>The main thrust of the report was that Spanish-American silver coins, reduced in weight by wear during 20 to 100 years of use and from "artificial
						diminishment," are customarily accepted by tale or count, regardless of weight, thus driving from circulation <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coins which are
						"not yet much reduced by ordinary use." It was estimated then that circulation of all coins in the <name type="place">United States</name> was $23,000,000
						of which $14,000,000 was of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coinage (of $34,497,138 minted), $5,000,000 in Spanish-American pieces and $4,000,000 in other
						foreign coins. The amount of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> copper coinage in circulation was not commented upon because the circulation of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> silver could not even be stimulated when small Spanish-American silver coins, being underweight by an average of 6 percent,
						were for that reason forcing <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> silver coinage out of circulation. Even though Spanish-American silver coins were usually <pb n="106"/> accepted by tale at par in trade,they could not be turned in to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint for recoinage without a party losing a
						large percentage because of their weight deficiency.</p>
               <p>The importance of this report as to copper coin in circulation is the fact that no elimination of pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint copper was even
						suggested, although it was intended that an increase in the circulation of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint copper coins would occur by making them legal
						tender up to 10 cents. If Spanish-American silver coin, regardless of extensive wear and substantial loss of metallic value was then generally circulating
						by tale, there was no apparent urgency or logic to undertake a reformation of copper circulation, the intrinsic value of which as metal was normally as much
						as 50 percent below its circulating value.</p>
               <p>The text and recommendations of the report were ordered printed and distributed but nothing whatsoever resulted. The lack of action on the report made it
						clear that the problem was too complex at that time for the government to solve.</p>
               <p>The diminution in metallic value of small Spanish-American silver coins was recognized in 1843 in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> when the banks refused
						to accept such silver except at the rate of 23 cents (8 percent discount) for the 2 real, at 10 cents (20 percent discount) for the 1 real, and at 5 cents
						(20 percent discount) for the 1/2 real. This practice spread to banks, post offices and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Land Offices throughout the <name type="place">United States</name> by 1848.<ref target="#CH10-n6">6</ref> The <name type="place">United States</name> by its February 21, 1857,
						legislation finally accepted those coins by giving the holder a choice either to turn in the small Spanish-American silver coins without any discount in
						exchange for the new flying eagle small cents for a period of two years or to turn in such silver coins at a discount of 20 percent in exchange for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> silver or gold coin. Naturally virtually everyone elected the full-value option. The option to exchange for cents without any
						discount was extended to February 21, 1861, but was cut off on June 25, I860 by repeal of the extension.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Effect of Moneys of Account</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The reason why many pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers remained in circulation through 1857 is somewhat clarified by certain monetary conditions
						mentioned in the 1830 report. The principal cause seems to be the use during more than the first half of the nineteenth century of money of account shilling
						and pence pricing and record keeping. In turn the continued circulation of Spanish-American silver <pb n="107"/> coinage in the <name type="place">United
							States</name> helped to keep the several moneys of account in use in many areas. A review of these conditions should explain their effect on pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint copper circulation.</p>
               <p>In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, for example, where the money of account was 8 shillings to the <name type="place">Spanish</name> dollar of 8 reales
						(also equal to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Dollar), the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> money of account shilling was exactly the same value as
						the 1 real Spanish-American coin, 2 shillings exactly the same as the 2 real coin, and 6 pence the same as a 1/2 real coin. If the denomination of coins
						created under the laws of the <name type="place">United States</name> were used for small transactions in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> money of
						account pricing, the shilling or 6 pence prices had to be recalculated at 12 1/2 cents or 6 1/4 cents respectively, for which it took at least four specific
							<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coins to make up the former and there was no <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coin combination to make up the latter. Only
						the 2 shilling amount and the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> quarter dollar coin were equivalent to one another, but many transactions involved smaller
						sums. So long as Spanish-American coins remained in circulation it was more convenient for many people to keep the shilling and pence exchange and price
						system than to change such prices into cent amounts.</p>
               <p>The tenacity with which <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> held to its money of account standard is well demonstrated by the fact that the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> shilling or 1/8th dollar equivalent became the trading price differential in 1792 when security brokers first organized in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and today the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, etc., continue to trade with
						that price differential in spite of almost 200 years of a decimal monetary system. It has always been difficult to make people change an economic habit when
						the suggested change is or is perceived to be more inconvenient for them.</p>
               <p>In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name>, modifying its money of account equivalent of 6 shillings to the Spanish Dollar (which standard had been unchanged
						since 1750) was even more difficult to accomplish. In the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> money of account basis, 1 shilling was equal to 16 2/3 cents
						(the same value as the coined Pine Tree Shilling which was still sometimes found in circulation well into the nineteenth century). The 6 pence in such money
						of account was equal to 8 1/3 cents. A Spanish-American 1 real coin was equal to 9 pence in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> money of account. The
						State franchised coppers and genuine and counterfeit English-style halfpence had been circulated at 18 to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> money of
						account shilling, equivalent to 15 coppers for 10 pence, 9 coppers for 6 pence, and 3 coppers for 2 pence. As complex as small transactions in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> might have been, no <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coin came close to coordinating with the <name type="place">New
							England</name> money of account and the only available computer able to handle equivalents in such a money environment was a programmed human mind. The
						arithmetic primers and handbooks continued into the nineteenth century to drill the reader in the necessary conversion <pb n="108"/> calculations in this
						well developed money of account system. When one reached whole dollar sums there was no problem but for small transactions a system of sixths (shillings per
						Spanish dollar), eighths (reales per coined dollar), twelfths (pence per shilling), eignteenths (coppers per shilling), and hundredths (cents per coined
						dollar) would, when learned, be a matter of pride and a source of stubbornness against modification. Imagine a visitor from out of town going to the Faneuil
						Hall Market to buy food in the early nineteenth century and facing such a price and coin structure.</p>
               <p>In <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> and <name type="pname">Delaware</name> (the Middle <name type="place">Atlantic States</name>) the money of account at 7 shillings 6 pence to the Spanish Dollar was so well established from colonial times that neighboring
						Maryland was forced to conform to it as an economic practicality. In this system of 90 pence equal to the Spanish Dollar, there were no small <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> or Spanish-American coins with which it could readily accommodate. However, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> had tried by
						law and otherwise to stabilize the value of its own coppers at 15 to the money of account shilling which would enable 10 coppers to pass for 8 pence, and 5
						coppers to pass for 4 pence. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> coppers in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> had on September 5, 1789, fallen in value to
						2 for the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> money of account penny (24 for the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> shilling), but at that time even 2 real,
						1 real and 1/2 real Spanish-American silver coins were temporarily "depreciated into pistareens, half pistareens, etc.," amounting to a 20 percent discount.
						This demonstrated the effect of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> practices on neighboring areas, even though temporary.</p>
               <p>The westward movement of American population spread the money of account habits and thus the coin circulating customs. The firmly established <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> money of account had spread to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</name> and <name type="place">Indiana</name>. The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> money of account, on the same basis (6 shillings to the dollar), had spread to Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi.<ref target="#CH10-n7">7</ref> The <name type="place">southern states</name>, however, had steadily refused to embrace copper circulation of any type and in

               </head>
               <p>The 1830 Senate report confirmed that in some parts of the <name type="place">United States</name>, prices were to a great extent expressed in four
						dissimilar types of shilling and pence moneys of account carried over from the <pb n="109"/> American colonial period and that "these discordant imaginary
						moneys though understood by the inhabitant of the local scene where it prevails" cause the value of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> coins to be converted to
						the various moneys of account by calculations involving small fractions.</p>
               <p>For prices in pence the conversion of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> cent values into moneys of account was complex and impractical. Rounded off to the
						nearest farthing as well as exact conversion calculations were published in various forms beginning in 1793 and continuing for at least 35 years.<ref target="#CH10-n8">8</ref> A selection of a few of the values is set forth hereafter for various moneys of account, showing both the true conversion
						amount as well as the rounded off tabular value to the nearest farthing. A calculation could be based on money of account farthings for a book entry, but
						the public could not make a small payment to the nearest farthing because there was no coin in circulation to do it with, not even the very occasional
						genuine or counterfeit English farthings. No one published conversion values which included that for a <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> half cent.</p>
               <p>In small transactions someone always gained and someone always lost when cents or half cents were converted to pay prices in money of account pence. If,
						however, in a transaction one <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> cent was tendered to pay an obligation of one money of account pence there would be a loss to
						the receiver of 28 percent in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name>, 10 percent in the middle <name type="place">Atlantic states</name> and 4 percent in
							<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>. Thus, a rejection of the use of a <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Cent for such a payment was justifiable,

						coppers confirms their long circulation but throws virtually no light as to the valuation basis on which they circulated. Those who wrote did so from their

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Montroville W. Dickeson</name>, writing just prior to 1859 concerning 1787 Connecticut coppers, stated that "at this time, they can be

						stated that those coppers "are frequently met with among those now in circulation." He then mentions some dug up in Knoxville, Tennessee and in Easton,

                  <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> &amp; <name type="pname">DuBois</name>, both of whom were officers at the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint and were
						loyal to it, wrote in 1842 that State copper coinages continued current for an unknown period, but by 1842 coin collectors had gained possession of

                  <hi rend="italic">Dye's Coin Encyclopedia</hi> stated in 1883 that coins of State mints and Bungtown coppers in circulation began to disappear "as so much

						circulation." In a subsequent letter he wrote shortly thereafter from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</name> he made a similar comment but added that the
						place of circulation of Fugio cents was "in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name>." This places such circulation circa 1848 in <name type="place">New

At the ticket offices of the halls and theatres where he exhibited, he gathered thousands of colonial, <name type="place">United States</name> and other copper coins which he shipped to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> to sell to dealers on his return. On
						one occasion he sent by Adams Express a keg of old coppers in rolls of 25 coins each, consisting of two groups. One group contained 1793, 1799 and 1804
							<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> cents, colonial coins, <name type="place">Washingtons</name>, uncirculated half cents and uncirculated cents of any date,
						these being rolled up in white wrappers. The other group consisted of "bungtowns and wretched coppers" (presumably genuine and counterfeit English-type
						halfpence, Hard Times Tokens and other American store cards, Canadian tokens, etc.), those being wrapped in brown paper. He instructed his wife by letter to
						spend for food those rolled in brown paper and to retain for him those enclosed in white paper. She made an error and paid out to shopkeepers and other
						market people the scarce pieces enclosed in white wrappers, saving the other rolls for him. Thus the pieces of numismatic significance were expended and
						those to be spent were still on hand. From this casualty to his economic welfare important conclusions can be drawn, namely:</p>

                  <item n="a)">Colonial coins, <name type="place">Washingtons</name>, <name type="place">Bungtowns</name>, and "wretched coppers" were still acceptable in

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Joseph B. Felt</name>, writing in 1839, was referring to English style coppers and copper coins minted under American State franchises
						when he stated: "Now and then the remains of them have come forth and passed for a season, till driven back by new regulations."<ref target="#CH10-n19">19</ref> Those "regulations" were adopted commercial practices. The comment indicated that pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint copper coins
						returned to circulation from time to time when the price of copper metal increased sufficiently or merchants' whims changed or they would sometimes lose
						acceptance when the price of copper would be depressed or the <pb n="113"/> quantity of copper coin would become excessive. One could conclude that the
						value at which coppers circulated would remain the same in an area but that those coppers would be acceptable off and on, depending on the price of copper
						as a metal and upon other economic conditions. When the price of copper metal went high enough or when copper coin became unacceptable, then such coins
						would be driven from circulation into the melting pot as scrap.</p>
               <p>It is of interest to observe that the obverse and reverse of the 1783 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> &amp; Independence cent are illustrated in some
						gold and silver coin chart manuals in the 1848 to 1855 period. This would indicate that this copper coin too was then in circulation. No other copper coins
						are included in these coin chart manuals. The description of the piece in one instance stated "One cent, of <name type="place">Washington's</name> time" and
						in another "One cent (<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>'s day) One cent."<ref target="#CH10-n20">20</ref> Although this copper token was a <name type="place">British</name> product of the 1820 period, it was obviously added to the pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers in circulation in

               </head>
               <p>The fact that the money of account systems continued to be steadily used in parts of the United States until 1857 seems to be the main reason many pre-U. S.
						Mint copper coins remained in circulation even though they were steadily displaced and depleted.The small change habits of the public made it easier to
						calculate and make payments with pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers in small transactions in many money of account areas and to treat <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint copper coinage as foreign exchange because it did not fit into the established money of account systems. Such money of
						account systems were kept active by the large quantities of small Spanish-American silver coins which continued to remain in circulation. If such silver
						coins had been withdrawn from circulation earlier in the nineteenth century the money of account systems would have collapsed and consequently <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers would have quickly become the coins used in small transactions.</p>
               <p>The importance of eliminating the money of account systems was reconfirmed by <name type="pname">James Ross Snowden</name>, Director of the <name type="place">United States</name>
                  <pb n="114"/> Mint, in his report dated November 5, 1859, after the February 21, 1857 Act authorizing the exchange of Spanish-American silver coin had been
						in operation. He stated, "our circulation is thus being rid of a foreign currency, which interferes with our own excellent system of decimal coinage and
						accounts. It is hoped, that this reform in our circulation will lead people to adopt the language of our system, and abandon terms which are absurd, and
						would be ridiculous if they were not so common. I refer especially to the term shilling, which never had a place in our coinage, and was variable as a term
						of account in different localities during our colonial existence."</p>
               <p>In portions of the <name type="place">United States</name> where money of account shillings were not in use and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> copper coins
						were in circulation, pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers of the same general size as the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> cents must have
						circulated along with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> cents to some extent. In that situation such pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers would have
						to have circulated at a value of one cent each. Hard Times Tokens and store cards of the one cent size were similarly accepted as cent payment when they
						were introduced during and after the 1837 panic. Yet we do not know to what extent and which of the pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers might
						have been acceptable in cent transactions.</p>
               <p>It is tantalizing not to know enough facts to determine on what basis pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers circulated in money of account areas
						and exactly where those areas were. The writer's conclusion is that we should assume tentatively that the number of such coppers per money of account
						shilling in the nineteenth century was the same as had been customary in normal periods of late eighteenth century circulation, namely: <q>18 coppers to the
								<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> money of account shilling (108 to the dollar);</q>
                  <q>15 coppers to the middle <name type="place">Atlantic</name> money of account shilling (112 1/2 to the dollar); and</q>

               <p>If these ratios had been more divergent, the movement of pre-<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Mint coppers from one money of account area to another would have

            <p>These two pieces are the finest examples I know of, others I have seen were all made from one or the other of these two.</p>
            <p>The copper piece is struck on a rolled out copper planchet. It has diagonal reeding on the edge and is of a nice, rich tan color, indicating to the eye that the
					quality of the metal was good for that day.</p>
            <p>The silver piece is different. Someone has told me it is struck on a cast planchet. I would surmise that a cast planchet was used because rolled out and cut
					silver planchets were just not available for a limited striking. If indeed, the piece is on a cast planchet, it would be the only feasible avenue available to
					the makers at the time.</p>
            <p>Many early silver pieces manufactured in this country were made on cast planchets. For example, the 1790 <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> made <name type="pname">Manly</name> medal was struck on a cast planchet.</p>
            <p>This piece made its first documented appearance in 1861 in <name type="pname">James R. Snowden's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">A Description of the Medals of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>; of National and Miscellaneous Medals; and of other Objects of Interest In
						The Museum Of The Mint</hi> published in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>. It is plated and described as item number 74. Following the catalogue
					description, Snowden commented, "this curious medalet was presented [to the Mint] by <name type="pname">Dr. Gibbes</name>, of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</name>, <name type="place">South Carolina</name>. It is rude in design and execution, but is a very rare, and probably unique, piece."</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64367052">Sylvester S. Crosby</name> in his <hi rend="italic">Early Coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
               </hi> notes it on plate 10, 3. Interestingly, he comments about weight, 102 grains, and size, 16 1/2, very close to Snowden's size 16; but neither author
					mentions the metal. Crosby describes the edge as plain. Did he see the silver example illustrated here, or did he possibly see a copper example with a plain
					edge?</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Carl Carlson</name> tells me that the earliest auction record he has been able to find of the piece was in the Cogan Sale of April 7, 1863,
					where a copper specimen appeared as lot 116. His annotated catalogue shows Appleton was the buyer. <name type="pname">Carlson</name> presumes it went to the
					Massachusetts Historical Society with the rest of Appleton's collection but he has no trace of it since the time of the Cogan sale. No edge description was
					given in the 1863 sale catalogue.</p>
            <p>Back in the early 60s when I first determined that the collecting of the coinage of the colonial colonies would be a worthwhile field to pursue, I decided that
					certain areas of the wide scope of colonials might best be skipped in favor of others. I remember believing that the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> the
					Great was not worth pursuing as it would not be an attractive coin to acquire. Of course that decision was arrived at easily because my limited knowledge of the
					coin was that it <pb n="120"/> was an unimportant piece of questionable historical value and one generally maligned by the numismatic fraternity. This might be
					compared with the blind leading the blind. I can be an opinionated person and my mind was not soon to be changed. I think I finally started to wake up when I
					became more studied in the workmanship of the more crudely made state coinages.</p>
            <p>At the time I entered the field of colonials, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> cents had a fair following. Ted Craige was the Connecticut authority of the
					day. Connecticut cents were well researched but had not achieved the status of the Jerseys. Connecticuts still don't occupy the same high pedestal to which the
						<name type="pname">Jerseys</name> have been elevated. There seems to have been a psychological barrier to the Connecticut series simply because of its
					length. Too much study, too much attribution, and too many examples of types. Too prolific an issue with its many die varieties. Simply put, just too much work.
					Fortunately for numismatics there has been a change in that "just too much work" trend. The young numismatists coming up in the ranks are far better students
					than we have seen in the past. They have the stamina and the desire to learn. Also, institutions such as the American Numismatic Society are providing aid in
					funding for the research that is taking place at this time.</p>
            <p>I recall also that in the early 60s the Vermont coinage had been overlooked by the general collector of colonials. This indeed was a crudely turned out product,
					hardly worthy of the collecting beginner. We all know to what lofty heights of recognition such great numismatic students as <name type="pname">David
						Bowers</name> have elevated this state coinage.</p>
            <p>What this all points to is that there has been a renewal of interest in this so-called crude coinage. The modern scholar now appreciates the purposeful crude
					workmanship. It is now recognized that the collectors at the beginning of this century had great taste and were diligent in their pursuit of these so-called
					crude issues. The great <name type="pname">Chapman</name> catalogues give ample testimony to this. Beautiful examples of all the state coinages played a
					prominent part in the great colonial collections catalogued and sold by the <name type="pname">Chapmans</name>. Famous names of that era such as <name type="pname">Bushnell</name>, <name type="pname">Mills</name>, <name type="pname">Cleaney</name>, <name type="pname">Stickney</name>, <name type="pname">Jewett</name>, <name type="pname">Zabriske</name>, <name type="pname">Earle</name>, <name type="pname">Parsons</name>, <name type="pname">Jackman</name>,
						<name type="pname">Jenks</name> and many others had very creditable representations of the state series.</p>
            <p>I have heard the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> The Great copper referred to as a token. Perhaps that term might be properly attributed to the Mott token
					or the Talbot Allum and Lee Cents, but I didn't agree that such terminology would be correct here. I feel this particular piece is a speculative issue of the
					day, made to circulate as an accepted cop- <pb n="121"/> per of the time. The design is what has given most numismatists trouble.</p>
            <p>Let us hypothesize together. Suppose you were about to enter into the production of a speculative coinage. You determine that your best avenue of success would
					be a coin with the appearance of having been circulated. It is 1784. I have no problem with the dating of this coin. The circular opening in the center of the
					reverse formed by the thirteen links plainly displays the 84 in its lower half. The 17 which would occupy the upper half is not evident on the examples
					illustrated. I am confident a future discovery will reveal this. However, it is possible that the intentional honing down of the dies to give the coins an
					appearance of previous circulation may have totally worn away that part of the die. Thus, these coins fall into the general category of imitation coinage.</p>
            <p>The <name type="place">British</name> troops have only just left <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> City in the spring of 1784. Again I make a presumption, that
					the coin was made in <name type="place" corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</name>. The treaty of peace was signed at Versailles last fall and we've only just recently learned about
					that. <name type="place">British</name> troops were here almost eight long years and who knows if this independence is for real? So if we're going to go into
					this adventure and burn all our bridges behind us, let's take out some insurance. We'll put George <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> on the obverse and we'll
					put <name type="pname">Ben Franklin's</name> design of the thirteen link chain on the reverse. After all, <name type="pname">Frankl</name>in went over big on
					the paper money. Too bad we have to buy copper. Those other guys did great with paper. Too bad they ruined a good thing. Maybe our descendants will profit by
					our mistakes and avoid inflation. Ah well, such is the time. Let's hedge our bets. We're not going to advertise we're doing this job. But you know how word gets
					around. Let's give <name type="pname">George</name> a little jibe. Refer to him as "<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> The Great D.G." That way if the <name type="place">British</name> do come back, and we do become known, we can always say it was a little political satire. After all, what's it our business if
					everybody starts to pass them around as coins. Not guilty your worship, as you can plainly see.</p>
            <p>It is important to keep in mind that these were not stable times. Independence was not a sure thing in 1784; tories were still very much in style in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> City. It was not until the end of 1784 and into 1785 that the tories began to give up the ghost and get out of town. By then it
					was a reasonable certainty to the local populace that the British were not coming back.</p>
            <p>The most important comparison to be made about this speculative issue is its similarity to the <name type="pname">Machin Mills</name> series that was to follow a
					year later. The honing down of the dies, to create the illusion of <pb n="122"/> previous circulation, is one of the major clues to suggest that the sponsorship
					of this predecessor copper may have carried over to the <name type="pname">Machin Mill</name> operation. It is especially the similarity in finishing that leads
					me to speculate on the possible <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> City design of this coin. Recent research has confirmed that the <name type="pname">Machin
						Mill</name> organization was a gathering of multiple sponsorship. Many people were involved, most of whom had coinage ventures in their background. So,
					whether we make the connection through die makers, coiners, sponsors, or whatever; I feel there is reasonable ground to expect that a relationship does exist.
					The tie will be found by future scholars. The Jersey coppers, the Connecticut coppers, the Vermont coppers; all the State issues between 1785 and 1788 have been
					tied together through die work, die letters, die makers and sponsors. The possibility of linking this piece seems almost certain. Just recently the 1785 Non
						<name type="pname">Vi Virtute Vici</name>
               <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> coin of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> has been connected to that group of sponsors. In the case of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> The Great coin, its fabric, its workmanship, its weight, its entire window to the market parallels the others. We must bear
					in mind that there were not that many in the coin manufacturing business in those days.</p>
            <p>The coin was short lived; the number of surviving specimens attests to that. We have silver and copper specimens and it is my opinion that the coin maker had in
					mind a multidenomination coinage. Why not? The Myddelton issue is a prime example; the Continental Dollar of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> fame is
					another example. Informed numismatists now accept that the brass Continental specimens were issued as a penny and the silver pieces as the dollar. The white
					metal or tin pieces are simply copper substitutes. Consider the metallic content of the base silver <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> The Great piece—56
					percent silver. Hardly enough silver content to get by as a government sponsored issue but certainly enough to get by as a speculative try at making it as a
					shilling or two real equivalent. In other words, good as a speculation. Certainly good as the first speculation after the cessation of hostilities following a
					nine year war. Certainly the young and hungry economic scene would induce one to such a speculation. The fact that it may not have proved successful gives us a
					clue as to why there is no evidence that <name type="pname">Machin Mill</name> ever tried such a combination effort. The Machin scheme simply restricted its
					effort to underweight duplication of the <name type="place">British</name> Halfpenny, still in wide use in the "colonies." Later Machin, et al., went into state
					contracts.</p>
            <p>New York's Hudson River Valley was the focal point for the manufacture of all the coinages from 1785 to 1788. All the sponsors, etc., had origination in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> City. Manufacture for New <pb n="123"/>
               <name type="pname">Jersey</name>, Connecticut, Vermont, and the Machins Mill operation itself, all had origins or roots in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>
					City. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> certainly had been an originating center for coinage a decade earlier but at this time was no longer the center for
					"creative" coinage. The fabric, dating and manufacture of this coin has that <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> feel for me. The similarity and potential as a
					forerunner to the <name type="pname">Machin Mill</name> series has the most significance for me in my belief that a tie to the <name type="pname">Machin
						Mill</name> issues will some day be forthcoming. I emphasize that this is only supposition on my part, at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Maurice M. Gould</name> wrote an article about this coin in the June, 1954, <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Scrapbook.</hi> He was the owner of
					the silver specimen illustrated here. He describes the coin as a satirical medal. That it is satirical in a political way is obvious. The bust in profile is
					about as uncomplimentary to <name type="pname">George</name>
               <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> as possible. The D. G. on the obverse copies that on contemporary <name type="place">British</name> coins and is obviously
					a slight of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>. However, to say the item is a medal is inaccurate. The 1792 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> Roman Head
					copper struck in Birmingham more closely meets medallic standards despite the "cent" reverse designation. It is medallic in striking—clear, well struck and
					artistically created to convey a satirical message. Not in any way disguised, or manufactured to appear worn when struck to be put into immediate circulation.
					The fact that almost all surviving specimens of the Roman Head are in proof condition indicates it was kept as a memento. On the contrary, the few survivors of
					the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> The Great coin were all well circulated and, to the best of my knowledge, the copper and silver pieces illustrated here
					are the finest known examples. Obviously, they were not meant as medals or any type of memento. The fact that so few survive in other than very good condition
					attests to their circulation. The rarity indicates that the issue was shortlived, at best. Either the quality or the taste in political satire caused the
					acceptance to be limited. Possibly both.</p>
            <p>In the case of the 1792 <name type="pname">Roman Head</name> which was struck eight years later, we must remember that it was made in the motherland and
					obviously was at the heart of a popular political issue of the day. The fact that the colonies were now independent was resented by the English.</p>
            <p>Hopefully, somewhere in our public libraries there is a reference in some newspaper of the day as to the unusual political characteristics of this coin.
					Historians without numismatic background would pass over such an article or reference as being unimportant, but eventually I trust that a numismatic researcher
					will pick up on the tie and bring the pieces of history together.</p>

            <p>Collecting <name type="place">United States</name> coins by variety has been popular for many years. In 1869 Crosby and Levick wrote on the varieties of 1793
					cents, and <name type="pname">Maris</name> on 1794 cents.<ref target="#CH12-n1">1</ref> Since that time, books have been written covering practically all of the
					early coinage of the <name type="place">United States</name>, and these have been updated as new information has been discovered.</p>
            <p>The word "variety" does not mean the same thing to all collectors. To the collector of early coins, a "variety" is the product of a pair of dies. Even if only
					one die is changed, a new "variety" is the result. Breaking down of the dies, however, merely results in different die states, as long as the dies continue in
					use.</p>
            <p>The greatest interest among large cent collectors has always been in the early coins, from 1793 to 1814. Early die making was not an exact art and each die was
					different from every other die. The master die contained only the main figure and all letters and numbers were punched into the die individually. Mistakes in
					spelling occurred frequently. Stars were counted incorrectly. Fractions were set in the die so that some of the cents have 1/000 for the value. In some cases
					this was corrected, in some cases not. Stems of the bow were omitted and letters were punched upside down, then corrected. All in all, it is a very interesting
					period for collectors.</p>
            <p>As time went on, the dies improved. More devices were added to the master hub and in time the only item to be added to the die was the date. Differences in
					varieties in the later coins were hard to detect, and the interest in collecting them was much lower.</p>
            <p>In 1881, <name type="pname">Frank D. Andrews</name>, of <name type="place">Vineland</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name>, wrote a book listing some 268
					varieties of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</name> Cents in his collection from 1816 to 1857. He printed 40 copies of the book, gave most of them to his friends, and
					sold the remaining copies for 25 cents each. He must have received quite a bit of additional information from his friends, because in 1883 he wrote another book
					listing over 400 varieties.<ref target="#CH12-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Several lists of additional varieties were issued over the years. Most of these were valid new varieties, but some were not. In 1944, Howard R. Newcomb wrote his
					book and it is still the standard reference.<ref target="#CH12-n3">3</ref> It incorporates all of the valid discoveries until that time.</p>
            <p>When Andrews wrote his 1883 book, he listed the varieties of each year from 1844 to 1857 so that the point of the hair over the figure 8 was at the extreme left
					for the first variety shown, each subsequent change being to the right. For some years Newcomb did the same thing for his additional varieties, starting at the
					left, and working toward the right. Many collectors found this system to be <pb n="127"/> of considerable help in attributing.</p>
            <p>Illustrated here is a page from the notebook of <name type="pname">Admiral S. Bitler</name>. He developed a chart showing the cents of 1852, changing the verbal
					descriptions of the date locations to numerical listings. Large cent collector Scott Rubin acquired the Admiral's Newcomb book and graciously let me have the
					chart.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-91">
               <graphic url="COAC1_127.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Unaware of what Admiral Bitler had done, I had completed a similar listing for the entire series. In 1970 the first work was issued, covering the system and the
					year 1850. Some of the collectors liked it and asked for the numerical listings for the entire series, but many of them were not sold on the system. In 1980, my
					book covering the entire series was issued, and to date there have been five printings of about 250 copies each.<ref target="#CH12-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In reviewing the coins for this work, many of the new discoveries were verified; but some were not, merely being die states of known varieties. Several new
					varieties were discovered. It is always a thrill to discover a new variety. Both sides of the coin must be checked <pb n="128"/> against every known variety of
					the date. In many cases the obverse and reverse are known and the coin is a new mating of the dies. Sometimes a brand new die surfaces, and checking against the
					known dies must be thorough and complete. In many of the new discoveries, one of the dies was discarded because of damage to it. Some of them have heavy cracks,
					some have rim breaks, some have die crumbling. When any of these things happened, frequently the die was discarded. Sometimes a die broke and was retired quite
					early in its life. In these cases the varieties are quite rare.</p>
            <p>It is not too difficult to verify a new variety. If the dies are both known, it is a simple matter to match each with its identical twin. I have asked
					individuals who know nothing about variety collecting to identify a coin by matching it with the variety pictures in the reference book. They have no trouble in
					doing it. It is more difficult to verify a new die, matching it against all of the other dies of that year, but it is still reasonably simple.</p>
            <p>If we are trying to arrive at the best possible list of varieties of early coins, we have to think of another possibility. Are there varieties listed which are
					not really different varieties? Several of these have come to light recently. They are much more difficult to verify. It is fairly easy to prove that something
					exists, but much more difficult to prove that it does not.</p>
            <p>Several varieties listed in the past have been dropped. Some of them, like 1847 N33, were described by Newcomb as being from the same obverse and reverse dies as
					1847 N3. The obverse die had been lapped, removing signs of a repunched date, and the reverse die had developed some additional breaks. It is a die state,
					rather than a different variety.</p>
            <p>Some varieties were unknown in any collection. I wrote some articles about them, and asked anyone knowing about them to get in touch. <name type="pname">Robinson
						Brown</name>, who has one of the largest collections of large cents, said that he had the 1850 N8, which nobody else had seen. Its main characteristic
					mentioned by Newcomb was a doubling at the top of R in LIBERTY. <name type="pname">Robbie</name> and I studied the coin in great detail. The doubling was very
					prominent, the coin had been lacquered some time ago. The double line at the top of R followed the curve of the R, then ran over to the top of the T. We decided
					that it was a short bristle from the brush used in applying the lacquer, held in place by the lacquer. The coin met all of the criteria for N9, and we decided
					that is what it really is. We also thought that this had to be the coin which Newcomb had seen and about which he wrote.</p>
            <p>Seeing the coins which a preceding author had written about is <pb n="129"/> one of the best ways to delist the variety. Take the case of 1852 N19, another of
					the varieties not known in any collection. When I asked for information about it, several collectors sent theirs in for inspection. In every case they turned
					out to be other, known varieties. The only one we know of was in the Starr collection, and only <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> had seen it. He had not
					had the opportunity to study the piece. Since Starr had purchased the entire Newcomb collection, most of the coins Newcomb used in his book were in the Starr
					collection. At Stack's, working on the catalogue for the Starr sale provided an excellent opportunity to check it. It was the Newcomb coin, and turned out to be
					an early die state of N16. When I had definitely attributed it as N16, I asked <name type="pname">Doug Smith</name> and <name type="pname">Scott
					Mitchell</name>, both very knowledgeable on the checking of varieties, to check the coin. They both agreed that it was definitely Nl6.</p>
            <p>Another method of checking two varieties is by using color slides. Pictures of the same areas of both coins are taken with the camera remaining in the same
					position. Two similar projectors are used to superimpose the two images on the screen. There is of necessity a slight parallax in using this method, since the
					two images come from sources slightly apart. Another method used is to staple the two slides together. The combined slides are put in one projector. The results
					are excellent. Since the slides are about a sixteenth of an inch apart, both slides are not in focus at the same time. One is in sharp focus, and the other is
					in a slightly out-of-focus state, but visible. Changing the focus of the projector slightly throws the first slide out of focus, and the second slide in. It is
					fairly simple to determine whether the two coins represented by the slides are from the same dies, or whether they are not.</p>
            <p>Another method of dropping known varieties has developed. In two cases collectors have sent coins and information proving that two known varieties are products
					of the same pair of dies. <name type="pname">Robinson Brown</name>, whom I have mentioned previously, sent me his 1840 N11, with a very distinctive rim break.
					My 1840 N10 has exactly the same break. Newcomb gives as the difference between the two varieties the fact that one has a sharp point on the curl near the
					figure 8, and the other has a blunt point. Both coins met the correct descriptions in Newcomb. Since they both had the same rim break, it is safe to assume that
					they are from the same die, but the die was lapped between striking the two. This weakened the curl point, changing it from blunt to pointed. I call the coins
					which connect the two varieties "bridge coins," coins with the characteristics of two varieties, proving that both came from the same die. Larry Whitlow came up
					with the same situation with the 1849 N6 and <pb n="130"/> N22. these are also products of the same dies.</p>
            <p>Working on the late date large cent varieties is a real challenge and a lot of work. It is really helpful to have high grade coins to work with. They must be
					clean. The identification points are so small that a bit of dirt can hide them. There is so much work to be done in this series, and I hope that my efforts have
					been a step in the right direction.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this paper is not to give a history lesson about the beginnings of the <name type="place">United States</name> coinage or its first issues, but to
					show one person's method of gathering data on rarity and conditions of surviving specimens of historically significant coins. In this case study, I used the
					1792 Silver Center Cent.</p>
            <p>I decided the best way of zeroing in on how many coins of this issue still exist was to check sale information, photographs, and pedigree data wherever I could
					find it. Following the pedigree of any coin is a complicated task. Much of the printed pedigree information is at least suspect, if not completely doubtful.
					With this in mind I started the search.</p>
            <p>The first thing I did was a line by line scan of the 3,200 auction catalogs in my library spanning the years 1855 to 1984. I logged every appearance of these
					coins, noting cataloger, collector's name, date of sale, lot number, price realized, stated pedigree information and if the coin was plated, when this
					information was included in my copy of the catalog. Once this was finished a certain amount of background experience with cataloging techniques of auction
					houses was needed to evaluate the information in my log.</p>
            <p>When finished, my log consisted of only 38 listings of Silver Center Cents; of this number many were obviously repeat showings of the same specimens. Following
					is an evaluation of this log.</p>
            <p>1) <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodward's</name> Nov. 11-14, 1862 sale of the Finotti Collection. Lot number 1528 was graded Very Fine and realized the
					substantial sum of $52.50. No earlier history of ownership is given. No plates were in use in auction catalogs this early and no mention of planchet color of
					defects is given making later pedigree verification difficult. A copy of this catalog with buyers' names would certainly be useful, but unfortunately I have
					none.</p>
            <p>2) <name type="pname">Benjamin Haines</name> sale sold by <name type="pname">Bangs</name>, <name type="pname">Merwin</name> &amp; Co. Jan. 19-23, 1863. Lot
					number 780 is described only as "somewhat rubbed" which is hardly a twentieth century cataloger's ideal grading category. A quote from the NOTICE page of the
					catalog may reinforce what was generally considered a must for buying at auction in the nineteenth century.</p>
            <q>I should prefer that parties intending to purchase should be present and examine the condition of the various pieces for themselves, inasmuch as it is impossible
					always to give a description that is understood by all.</q>
            <pb n="133"/>
            <q>Owning to the haste in the preparation of the catalog, some errors may have crept in, but collectors may rely upon the general accuracy of the description.</q>
            <p>As you can see, "somewhat rubbed" is all that we non-viewers of the lots are left with today.</p>
            <p>3) <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodward's</name> sale of the famous <name type="pname">Joseph J. Mickley</name> Collection. This sale took place on Oct. 28,
					1867 and the five following evenings."Remarkably Fine condition," is how this Silver Center Cent was described as lot 2135. It realized $54 and again without
					plates or a more definitive description, pedigree information is only to be had by other means, if any is possible.</p>
            <p>4) <name type="pname">Edward Cogan's</name> sale of the <name type="pname">Colonel M.I. Cohen</name> Collection on Oct. 25-29, 1875. This sale was plated, I
					however do not have a plated catalog. Lot 380 was a Silver Center Cent graded Very Fine, but for the first time some other information as to the quality of the
					coin is mentioned, "slightly corroded on the rev." This may prove useful later on in establishing or at least limiting this coin from certain pedigree chains.
					It realized $45.</p>
            <p>5) <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodward's</name> 31st sale of the <name type="pname">Wm. J. Jenks</name> Collection. Graded as "Very Fine Indeed" as lot 1383.
					This sale was not plated even though this sale took place Sept. 1-3, 1880. We see that many of the cataloging techniques of the 1860s were still in use, so much
					more our loss today.</p>
            <p>6) <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodward's</name> 45th sale of the <name type="pname">A. Dohrmann</name> Collection on Mar. 6-11, 1882. This catalog comes
					plated, I do not have the plates. The coin is graded "Very Fine Indeed" as lot 437. It seems with this listing we may have our first pedigree clue. This coin is
					graded identical to the <name type="pname">Woodward's Jenks</name> listing of 1880 (my number 5), also the two preceding lots in both auctions were a 1792
					Silver Disme and 1792 Half Disme. So it seems quite possible the same coins were offered in both sales.</p>
            <p>7) <name type="pname">S.H</name>. &amp; <name type="pname">H. Chapman's</name> sale of the <name type="pname">Charles I. Bushnell</name> Collection which took
					place June 20-24, 1882. This was the first of the large size <name type="pname">Chapman</name> catalogs. Lot 1766 was a Silver Center Cent graded Extremely Fine
					which sold at <hi rend="italic">$</hi>120. The description is not particularly useful for pedigree purposes, but this is the first plated catalog of which I
					have a copy showing a photo of a Silver Center Cent <pb n="134"/> actually sold. I do not have an original plate but, a fine photographic copy done by <name type="pname">James M. Toney</name> in 1967.</p>
            <p>8) <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodward's</name> 62nd sale of the <name type="pname">Heman Ely</name> Collection sold Jan. 8-10, 1884, as lot 444. This coin is
					graded Very Fine. This is another plated catalog I have not had a chance to examine. It does seem that this is not the same coin as appeared in the 1880 and
					1882 Woodward sales, but then again it might be. This coin sold for <hi rend="italic">$25.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9) <name type="pname">S.H.</name> &amp; <name type="pname">H. Chapman's</name> June 9-14, 1884 auction of the <name type="pname">Thomas Warner</name> Collection.
					This coin was called Extremely Fine, "the finest of five known," as lot 3215 of this auction where it brought $ 155. This was the second large <name type="pname">Chapman</name> sale and comes plated. I had access to a plated copy and was able to use the photo for pedigree linkage, which I will mention
					with the next appearance of this coin. However, it did not match the <name type="pname">Chapman's Bushnell plate</name>.</p>
            <p>10) <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodward's</name> 80th sale, which was sold Dec. 16-19, 1885, contained from the <name type="pname">Matthews</name> Collection,
					lot 2120, a Silver Center Cent described as "Extremely Fine, fully equal to the best known." This catalog is not plated and no other pedigree information or for
					that matter any information is available except it seems unlikely that this coin was the same as any of the other Woodward 1880s offerings, if the same grading
					criterion was used in each, and there is no reason to believe that it was not.</p>
            <p>11) <name type="pname">W. Elliot Woodwards</name> 93rd sale of Feb. 1-2, 1887, has as lot 816 one of the most interesting listings of any Silver Center Cent. The
					coin offered is referred to as the Dohrmann coin which had been offered for sale by Woodward to the <name type="pname">Chapman</name> Brothers who returned the
					coin and on its being offered at sale by <name type="pname">Mr. Woodward</name>, was denounced by the <name type="pname">Chapmans</name> who doubted its being
					genuine. To which Woodward in this catalog goes on to explain that the coin was "intrusted to <name type="pname">Mr. A.C. Gies</name>, of <name type="pname">Pittsburg</name>, Pa., who tightened the plug, and, with consummate skill, retouched the engraving of the legend on the silver." Woodward also says that
					this is the <name type="pname">Mickley</name>, <name type="pname">Col. Cohen</name> coin and that the said "retouching was known to the <name type="pname">Chapmans</name> at the time they offered the coin themselves in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>." From this I will attempt to establish the
					following pedigree of this coin, it first appeared in the <name type="pname">Mickley</name> sale where it was bought by <name type="pname">Col. Cohen</name>,
					then by some means to <name type="pname">Mr. Dohrmann</name> who offered it for sale in Woodward's 31st and 45th sales and finally <pb n="135"/> in the present
					sale. This catalog is not plated and I have no earlier photographs to prove the just mentioned pedigree, but for the time being nothing stands in its way to
					disallow it.</p>
            <p>12) <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Coin and Stamp Company's Jan. 20-24, 1890 sale of the <name type="pname">R. Coulton Davis</name> Collection, Lot 1008a,
					which was graded "very fine impression: believed to be the finest specimen known." This catalog comes plated and I have an original plate containing the Silver
					Center Cent. The photo does not match the <name type="pname">Bushnell</name> or Warner plates. We now have three photographically proven different specimens;
					more will be said later about this coin.</p>
            <p>13) <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Coin and Stamp Company's June 25-27, 1890 sale of the famous <name type="pname">Lorin G. Parmelee</name> Collection. The
					Silver Center Cent in this sale appeared as lot 5 and was described as "very fine sharp impression: unexcelled." This coin was plated in this catalog and for
					the first time in our list a photo matched a previous photo. This is the reappearance of the Bushnell coin and realized $73.50.</p>
            <p>14) <name type="pname">S.H.</name> &amp; <name type="pname">H. Chapman's</name> Dec. 16-17, 1895 sale of the <name type="pname">Richard B. Winsor</name>
					Collection. Lot 291 is graded Extremely Fine and this catalog also comes plated, I had access to the plates of this catalog at the same time I had access to the
					Warner plates and this coin appears in both sales. I will have more later on this coin.</p>
            <p>15) <name type="pname">Lyman H. Low's</name> Oct. 11, 1904 sale of the <name type="pname">H.G. Brown</name> Collection. Lot 209, which realized only $7.50,
					illustrates how much condition, even on this historical rarity, matters when sold. This coin was listed as "the centre has been abused, probably when
					reinstating the small circular silver piece, otherwise good." This catalog comes plated, but this coin was not included with those chosen for photographing This
					is probably not the Dohrmann coin because of the grading difference, but is probably at least the second coin to have had work done on it over the years to keep
					the silver center in place.</p>
            <p>16) <name type="pname">S.H.</name> &amp; <name type="pname">H. Chapman's</name> Apr. 19-20, 1905 sale of the <name type="pname">Charles Morris</name> Collection.
					The Silver Center Cent described in this catalog as lot 361 is again a coin of some question, at least in the <name type="pname">Chapmans'</name> minds. The
					coin is said to have a "silver center inserted to give bullion value to this small size cent but the plug in this specimen has been inserted after the piece was
					struck and engraved with part <pb n="136"/> impression." They go on to say another interesting thing about the no silver center cents, "two or three proofs in
					copper without the silver center are known, and this is one of these with the silver center falsely inserted. Extremely Fine. Sharp Impression. Light Olive.
					Excessively Rare. See Plate." and see plate I did. The plate of this coin is of interest later on.</p>
            <p>17) <name type="pname">S.H.</name> &amp; <name type="pname">H. Chapman's</name> May 8-11, 1906 sale of the <name type="pname">H.P. Smith</name> Collection. <name type="pname">Mr. Smith</name> along with <name type="pname">David Proskey</name> was the catalogers of the previously mentioned <name type="pname">R.C.
						Davis</name> and <name type="pname">L.G. Parmelee</name> collections. This coin, described as lot 1315, Extremely Fine, is said to be "from the <name type="pname">Bushnell Coll</name>., 1882 no. 1776." This catalog comes plated as did the Bushnell and the two coins photographically match, as did the
					Parmelee offering. So now we have photographic evidence of a <name type="pname">Bushnell</name> to <name type="pname">Parmelee</name> to <name type="pname">H.P.
						Smith</name> connection. This coin realized $160. in this <name type="pname">Smith sale</name>.</p>
            <p>18) <name type="pname">Thomas L. Elder's</name> 13th sale, held Oct. 14-15, 1907. Lot 1732 was graded Very Fine. The obverse of this coin is plated and it does
					not match any other plate, up to this point. This will be of use later on.</p>
            <p>19) <name type="pname">Thomas L. Elder's</name> June 15-16, 1908 sale of the <name type="pname">Peter Gschwend</name> Collection. Lot 116 describes a Silver
					Center Cent as "Uncirculated, with faint traces of original red around obverse letters." This coin is plated, but unfortunately I have not had access to a
					plated catalog. Other information relating to my listing number 18 is printed in this catalog, "one, Very Good, in my sale of October, 1907, sold to a prominent
					dealer for $212.50."</p>
            <p>20) <name type="pname">Henry Chapman's</name> June 25-29, 1912 sale of the <name type="pname">George H. Earle</name> Collection which as lot 2179 offered an
					Extremely Fine specimen which was plated and for which I had access to a plated catalog. This turned out to be the <name type="pname">Bushnell-Parmelee-H.P.</name> Smith to Earle coin by photo comparison matching.</p>
            <p>21) <name type="pname">Henry Chapman's</name> Dec. 7-17, 1921 sale of the famous <name type="pname">John Story Jenks</name> Collection. This is by size and total
					number of lots the largest of the <name type="pname">Chapman</name> catalogs. Lot 5569 which realized $440 is said to be Extremely Fine and to have come from
					the <name type="pname">R.C. Davis</name> Collection. This catalog is plated and I have a set of reprint plates. The photo of this coin matches the coin sold in
					the Davis sale, thus we <pb n="137"/> have another coin with a photo linked pedigree, the <name type="pname">R.C. Davis</name> to <name type="pname">J.S. Jenks
						coin</name>.</p>
            <p>22) <name type="pname">Thomas L. Elder's</name> Oct. 27-30, 1926 catalog of collections belonging to "The late <name type="pname">William Poillon</name>, <name type="pname">G.W. Lee</name> and others," has included as lot 1436 one of the most interesting and confusing listings for a Silver Center Cent. I quote
					"1792. Pattern for Silver Centre Cent (freak)." I am at a loss as to what this refers to so I will have no more to say about this listing.</p>
            <p>23) <name type="pname">J. C. Morgenthau</name> &amp; Co.'s 311th sale which took place Oct. 18, 1933, contained "selections from a Great American Collection" and
					had as lot 78 a Silver Center Cent described as only in Good condition. This coin is plated and the grade is fairly accurate. Recent information about this sale
					written by <name type="pname">Q. David Bowers</name> in his book <hi rend="italic">Virgil Brand: the Man and His Era</hi> (<name type="pname">Wolfeboro,
						N.H.</name>, 1983), points out that the consignor of this auction was a Brand heir and that this coin among others was never actually sold, but was returned
					to the consignor even though my priced copy of this sale shows the coin selling for $175. I will refer to this coin later.</p>
            <p>24) <name type="pname">Thomas L. Elder's</name> Jan. 22-25, 1936, Sloane, Lenz sale contained as lot 2968 a specimen described as Fine to Very Fine. This coin is
					not plated and no further information about it is given. This catalog does contain an interesting piece of information or should I say misinformation and I
					quote from the catalog. "We have had none since the Wilson Sale, held by us in 1907, when we sold an Uncirculated specimen, the buyer being <name type="pname">Virgil M</name>. Brand who attended the sale." This statement is confusing since Elder sold one in the 1908 <name type="pname">Gschwend sale</name>, and
					that coin was graded Uncirculated, and the only specimen he offered for sale by auction in 1907 was not in the Wilson sale but his October sale and that coin
					graded only Fine. So much for some catalog comments. In this 1936 sale the Silver Center Cent brought $390.</p>
            <p>25) <name type="pname">Ira S. Reed's</name> Aug. 19, 1941, American Numismatic Association sale, lot 77, contained a specimen graded Very Fine which sold for
					$205, and for which no plate is shown or any other information given. Our loss.</p>
            <p>26) <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl's</name> Feb. 8, 1944 Mail Bid Sale of the <name type="pname">Belden E. Roach</name> Collection contained as lot 3111 a
					specimen described as Extreme- <pb n="138"/> ly Fine. It is also stated in this catalog that this coin came to <name type="pname">Mr. Roach via
						Earle-Wurtzbach-Virgil</name> Brand. The coin is plated and since this is the first <name type="pname">Mr. Mehl</name> seems to have sold at auction it is
					likely the coin pictured is the one offered. This is not always the case with his catalogs, but this plate does match the <name type="pname">Bushnell-Parmelee-H.P</name>. <name type="pname">Smith-Earle</name> plates so there is little reason to disbelieve <name type="pname">Mehl's</name> story.
					The Roach coin brought $525.</p>
            <p>27) Celina Coin Co.'s 12th sale, dated Feb. 5, 1945. This was a mail bid sale and lot 2022 was described as an Uncirculated Silver Center Cent. No other
					information is given, no plates. Our loss.</p>
            <p>28) <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl's</name> June 17, 1947, <name type="pname">Mail Bid Sale</name> of the <name type="pname">Will W. Neil</name> Collection. This
					coin was offered as lot 1794 and brought only $225, which was a substantial loss because this Extremely Fine graded coin is purported in the catalog to be the
					same coin which Mehl sold in 1944 in the Roach sale. That coin sold for $525. The plate in this catalog matches the Roach plate so if it is really the same coin
					the pedigree now goes <name type="pname">Bushnell-Parmelee-H.P</name>. <name type="pname">Smith-Earle-Roach-Neil</name> by photo and the addition of
					Wurtzbach-Virgil Brand between Earle and Roach if <name type="pname">Mehl</name> is to be believed.</p>
            <p>29) Celina Coin Company's Oct. 8-9, 1949 sale held in conjunction with the Ohio State Numismatic Convention in Lima, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</name>. Lot 591 is
					described as being Uncirculated, but no plate or other information is given. This might be the same coin offered by this company in their 1945 sale but there is
					no way of knowing for sure.</p>
            <p>30) <name type="place">New Netherland</name>'s 52nd sale, of Dec. 13, 1958 of the <name type="pname">Elliot Landau</name> Collection. This coin is lot 104 where
					it is described as just about EF-40. This catalog is plated and the plate matches the <name type="pname">Bushnell-Parmelee-H.P</name>. <name type="pname">Smith-Earle-Roach-Neil</name> plates and among other useful information contained in this excellently prepared catalog is the fact that the plate of the
					Wurtzbach coin in the 1914 American Numismatic Society Exhibition Catalog matches this coin. I compared the plates and agree, thus more credence to the Mehl
					statement that the coin went from Earle in 1912 to Wurtzbach. For the first time in an auction catalog the catalogers' attempted to give as complete as possible
					pedigree information about all known Silver Center Cents. This data lists two sales I do not have catalogs for, which occurred prior to this auction. They were
					the <name type="pname">George Wood</name>-side Collection sold in 1892 by <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Coin and Stamp Com- <pb n="139"/> pany and the
					April 1863 <name type="pname">Edward Cogan</name> sale. They mention that the Cogan coin is believed to have gone to <name type="pname">Bushnell</name>, thereby
					giving the earliest history of the same coin they were offering. This <name type="place">New Netherland</name>'s coin sold for $2,300.</p>
            <p>31) <name type="pname">Abner Kreisberg</name> and <name type="pname">Hans M.F. Schulman</name> sale of Mar. 18-21, 1964. This sale contained coins from the Brand
					and <name type="pname">Lichtenfels</name> Collections. Lot 1106 contained a coin graded Very Fine with the following description of its appearance "tiny dot in
					field between the tip of nose and beneath T in LIBERTY, also minor fault below second E in SCIENCE. Reverse, sharply struck except around portions of upper
					right segment of wreath, field and letters F and AMER. This particular area is blackish brown in color and under a strong glass appears corroded." This coin was
					plated but I do not have the plates. Because of this an interesting thing happened when checking this coin against my next listing, so let us continue.</p>
            <p>32) Mayflower Coin Auction Inc.'s Dec. 2-3, 1966 sale of the C.H. Stearns Collection. Lot 280 is described as Extremely Fine "free from all defects and flaws."
					The plate of the coin, however, seems to show a spot in front of Liberty's face, a weakness at the second E of SCIENCE, and a dark area on the upper right side
					of the reverse, thus matching almost exactly the description in the 1964 <name type="pname">Kreisberg-Schulman</name> sale. I was puzzled at this since the
					Stearns Collection was supposed to be a nineteenth-century collection just coming on the market; for the time being, I concluded that this was the 1964 coin.
					More later about this mystery.</p>
            <p>33) Pine Tree Rare Coin Auction Sales' Sept. 18-21, 1974 sale, held in conjunction with the Great Eastern Numismatic Association convention. Lot 1272a is
					described as Extremely Fine-About Uncirculated and is plated. More information about pedigrees is printed in this catalog than in any previous source. Seven
					different specimens are noted. From the plate, I was able to see that this is the same coin that appeared in the 1905 <name type="pname">Chapman</name> sale of
					the Morris Collection. At that sale, the <name type="pname">Chapmans</name> made a big deal about the silver center (see listing above): no mention of its
					legitimacy is made in the current sale. Without proper examination, it would be impossible to tell if it is a real Silver Center Cent or a doctored No Silver
					Center Cent. This coin realized $105,000.</p>
            <p>34) Stack's Nov. 11, 1974 auction of the <name type="pname">Gibson</name> Collection contained <pb n="140"/> as lot 14 a coin described thus: "this specimen is
					Extremely Fine with a tiny mark in the field before the face and another touching the final e of the word science. The reverse has a rough area in the upper
					right quadrant that could have been caused by old corrosion or a defective planchet." What we have here matches the 1964 Kreisberg-Schulman description exactly
					and the plate is of a different coin then the Stearns coin, so I had jumped the gun. The Stearns catalog was probably just poorly done and the Stearns coin was
					in all probability a coin which had been off the market for years. I was almost led astray.</p>
            <p>35) <name type="pname">Bowers</name> and <name type="pname">Ruddy Galleries</name>' Nov. 11-13, 1976 auction of the River Oaks &amp; C.W. Krugjohann Collections.
					Lot number 908 contained a coin graded About Uncirculated and said to have been formerly owned by <name type="pname">Lenox R. Lohr</name> whose collection <name type="pname">Mr. Bowers</name> and <name type="pname">Mr. Ruddy</name> sold in 1961. They say the coin was in the River Oaks Collection ever since 1961.
					This catalog contains pedigrees of eleven different Silver Center Cents, or does it. The plate from this sale matches the <name type="pname">R.C. Davis</name>
					and J.S. Jenks plates, so this coin really was a reappearance of another coin on their list, more about this later. This coin sold in this auction for
					$28,000.</p>
            <p>36) <name type="pname">Bowers</name> and Ruddy Galleries' Mar. 25-26, 1981 sale of the Garrett Collection sold for Johns Hopkins University. This famous sale had
					as Lot 2347 a choice Uncirculated Silver Center Cent which was reported in the catalog to have been bought by <name type="pname">John Work Garrett</name>
					through the noted numismatic dealer Wayte Raymond from the collection of <name type="pname">James W. Ellsworth</name> in March of 1923. This catalog goes on to
					give pedigrees of eleven different specimens of which this is the finest. The plate of this coin does not match any of the earlier sales I had access to plates
					of. This coin realized $95,000.</p>
            <p>37) Stack's <name type="pname">John L. Roper</name>, 2nd, Collection, sold December 8-9, 1983. Lot number 425 was described as Extremely Fine with a description
					of the problems visible on the planchet plus the pedigree that this coin was the 1974 Gibson coin. The plate included in this catalog matches the Gibson plate
					and the description likewise matches the 1964 <name type="pname">Kreisberg</name> &amp; Schulman coin. This coin realized only $ 19,800.</p>
            <p>38) <name type="pname">William Doyle Galleries</name>' December 15 and 16, 1983 sale of the <name type="pname">Loye L. Lauder</name> Collection. This coin was
					lot number 233 and is graded About Uncirculated (55) and is plated in the catalog in black and <pb n="141"/> white, the obverse is plated on the cover in color.
					When I saw the <name type="pname">Warner</name> and <name type="pname">Winsor</name> plates I did not have this catalog with me, but from my notes of
					peculiarities of that coin it would seem that the present coin is a reappearance of the <name type="pname">Warner-Windsor</name> coin. This coin realized
					$40,000.</p>

            <p>I have some question about my listing number 6. I have no photo of this coin and the description in the 1875 Cohen sale mentions reverse corrosion, so in my mind
					there is the possibility that the <name type="pname">Mickley</name>-<name type="pname">Cohen</name>-<name type="pname">Dohrmann</name>-<name type="pname">Woodward</name> coin is really earlier appearances of the Brand-1964 <name type="pname">Kreisberg</name> &amp; <name type="pname">Schulman</name>-<name type="pname">Gibson</name>-<name type="pname">Roper</name> coin since both have been mentioned as having reverse corrosion.</p>
            <p>Auction information is great, but not the last word so at this point I checked newspaper and magazine stories, fixed price lists, and probably the best overall
					source for numismatic information, the manuscript for the book <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name>'s Encyclopedia of <name type="place">United States</name> Coins.</hi> I was in awe of the information included in
					this book and thank <name type="pname">Mr. Breen</name> for his kind permission to view it. Lastly but, certainly not least, I was privileged to gain
					information from some of the present owners and recent owners of these coins thus firming the data already gathered, or in some cases new information.</p>
            <p>From these other sources I learned that:</p>
            <p>1) The 1905 Morris coin was in an eastern collection in the late 1960s (a photo of this coin was supplied to me by my source). The same coin was bought with an
					extensive pattern collection by <name type="pname">William Mitkoff</name> &amp; Numismatic Ltd., verified by enlarged photo of the coin appearing in the May 8,
					1974 issue of Coin World. This coin was later in the hands of <name type="pname">William Anton</name>, who told me it is now in a <pb n="142"/> private
					collection.</p>
            <p>2) The <name type="pname">J. Hewitt Judd</name> coin was plated in <name type="pname">A. Kosoff</name> s book <hi rend="italic">An Illustrated History of <name type="place">United States</name> Coins</hi> (<name type="place">Encino</name>, Cal., 1962). This photo matches the October 1907 Elder catalog plate
					giving this coin its earliest appearance. This coin was later owned by the well known dealer <name type="pname">Julian Leidman</name> around 1974. I have
					photographs from various sources of this coin, due to the fact that a number of deceptive copies of this coin were made sometime before <name type="pname">Mr.
						Leidman</name> owned the real one. <name type="pname">Mr. Leidman</name> told me the the coin is now in a northeastern collection.</p>
            <p>3) <name type="pname">Mr. Eric P. Newman</name> owns one which was from the <name type="pname">F.C.C. Boyd</name> Collection. <name type="pname">Mr.
						Newman</name> supplied me a photo of his coin; it matches no other photo I have seen.</p>
            <p>4) The Stearns coin is reported to be in the Groves Collection, I have no photo proof of this, but the Groves Collection has a Silver Center Cent.</p>
            <p>5) The Smithsonian Institution has the <name type="pname">Davis</name>-<name type="pname">Jenks</name>-<name type="pname">Lohr</name>-<name type="pname">River
						Oaks</name> coin, which in 1979 was offered for sale by <name type="pname">Robert L. Hughes</name> in his fixed price lists (where the obverse of the coin
					is plated). The <name type="pname">Smithsonian</name> donor is anonymous.</p>
            <p>6) The Norweb Collection is reported to have a Silver Center Cent.</p>
            <p>7) The Lauder coin was bought by <name type="pname">Alan Weinberg</name>.</p>
            <p>8) From <name type="pname">Jack Collins</name> I learned that in a cited <name type="pname">Mickley catalog</name>, <name type="pname">M.I. Cohen</name> was the
					buyer of the Silver Center Cent, also the coin whose obverse is plated in the Cohen Catalog matches the 1964 <name type="pname">Kreisberg</name> &amp; <name type="pname">Schulman</name> (this photo was also verified by <name type="pname">Mr. Collins</name>), 1974 <name type="pname">Gibson</name> and 1983 Roper
					photographs.</p>
            <p>9) From <name type="pname">Breen</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia</hi>, we learn the following: <q>a) The Norweb coin is the <name type="pname">Gschwend</name> coin with a middle pedigree of Brock-University of Pa.-<name type="pname">Phillip Ward</name>-<name type="pname">JohnJ</name>.
						Ford.</q>
               <q>b) The <name type="pname">Bushnell</name>...<name type="place">New Netherlands</name>' 52nd Sale coin went to C. <name type="pname">Ramano</name>.</q>
               <q>c) There are two perforated blank planchets in Congress Hall from <name type="pname">Frank Stewart</name> (1909). These are Illustrated in his book about the
						first Mint.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From these sources, we can construct a final listing of all known <pb n="143"/> specimens.</p>

            <p>Collectors of <name type="place">United States</name> Large Cents generally divide the series into three periods. These include the Early Cents 1793-1814, Middle
					Date Cents 1816-1839, and Late Date Cents 1840-1857. Within the early period there are five distinct types: Chain Cents of 1793, Wreath Cents of 1793, Liberty
					Cap Cents of 1793-1796, Draped Bust Cents of 1796-1807, and the Turban Cents of 1808-1814. The Turban Cents, also called Classic Cents, may be the most
					underappreciated of these series. It is one purpose of this article to point out some of the fascinating features of the series.</p>
            <p>Turban Cents in low grades are common in the numismatic marketplace. High grade pieces are difficult to locate. It is possible to contact many dealers or to
					attend many local shows without finding a "nice" Turban. Even when coins are found with little wear, the surfaces may be granular, porous or corroded. Some of
					the features that make Turbans interesting, such as flowlines or clashmarks, can only be seen on coins with nice surfaces. The study and assembly of a
					collection of Turban Cents would require a great deal of patience. One source for high grade coins is through the major national coin auctions. A survey of
					Turban cents offered at auction in recent years is included later in this report.</p>
            <p>There are many features that make this an interesting series for study. Each obverse and reverse die used was different. Some of these differences are well
					described and easy to spot. Other differences may be very slight. Within the coins struck from a single pair of dies, there may be differences in strike,
					variances in centering, clash marks, and examples of die wear or of die failure. Each of these areas will be discussed in greater detail.</p>
            <p>Several authors have written descriptions of the Turban series. There will be a brief review of these previous efforts. Their attempts to describe the different
					dies and die states have been consolidated and additional observations have been added. The final section includes the most complete description of Turban Cents
					published to date.</p>

               <p>This design was used for seven years. There were 19 known obverse dies used and 18 known reverse dies. One reverse die used in 1811 was reused for a cent of

						smaller scale. The larger denominations designed by Reich have an obverse similar to the Turban design but with an actual capped head and draped bust. These
						include the 10 cent piece of 1809-37,the 25 cent piece of 1815-28, the 50 cent piece of 1807-36, quarter eagle of 1808 and half eagle of 1807-12.</p>

               <p>Several explanations have been offered to account for the scarcity of Turbans which have survived in high grades. Among these are:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1.">That the copper contained impurities that led to early corrosion.</item>
                  <item n="2.">That the copper was very pure, unalloyed, and therefore soft and easily worn.</item>
                  <item n="3.">That the rims were not high enough to protect the surfaces from <pb n="152"/> wear.</item>
                  <item n="4.">That the planchets were corroded by sea water during transit from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Whatever the reason, the Turban Cents seen today are usually well worn and/or with porous surfaces. A typical dealer who has only low quality Turbans to sell
						will frequently comment, "They don't come nice." In truth, nice ones do exist but are highly sought and prized by collectors.</p>
               <p>A shipment of 20 tons (about 1,900,000 pieces) of cent planchets arrived in April 1812 prior to the outbreak of war. By 1814 the supply had been exhausted.
						It is reported that the last 1814 cents were paid out in December as wages to the workers at the Mint. For 1815 there were no planchets and no cents struck.
						With this sole exception the cent denomination has been struck every year since 1793</p>

               <p>The work of Dickeson is notable because of the number of varieties mentioned. He lists 7 varieties of 1808, 4 of 1809, 7 of 1810, 8 of 1811, 9 of 1812, 9 of
						1813 and 8 of 1814 for a total of 52. However, these varieties are not described so it cannot be determined what standards were used. Although seriously
						out-dated, this work still includes some interesting comments. By 1860, alterations to 1809, 1811, and 1815 were already notable. Dickeson attributes the
						rarity of 1813 to the number altered to 1815! He also comments on hoarding of the cents of 1814 based on rumors that they contain gold lost at the Mint.</p>

                  <name type="pname">Doughty</name> identified 15 obverse dies and 13 reverse dies in 18 combinations. His list included one variety, D223, now known to be an

               </head>
               <p>Die progressions or die states are usually identified in terms of <pb n="154"/> die breaks. The Turban Cents are notable for a number of additional
						progressive effects which change the dies and can be observed on the coins.</p>
               <p>Striking of coins is based on the principal that a hard die will leave an impression on a softer planchet without suffering any effect. In actual practice,
						over hundreds of thousands of impressions, the coins can also have a cumulative effect on the dies.</p>
               <p>For the 19 Turban Cent varieties, there are over 50 die states identified. Undoubtably additional die states and intermediate states will be discovered with
						subsequent research.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>A die could crack without the effect showing on a struck coin. Usually comments about die cracks really are references to the effect on the coin rather
							than the effect on the die. Die cracks are observed as fine lines across the surface of a coin, as lumps of metal extruded through a void where the die
							has broken away, as differences in level, as swelling of the coins surface or in many combinations of these effects.</p>
                  <p>Several Turban Cent varieties develop die breaks as the dies crumble near the edges. Because Turban Cents are frequently struck off center, the edge
							detail is not always visable. Die crumbling may also be observed within the interior of the die, most notably on the "bearded" variety of 1814,
							S-295.</p>

                  <p>In the striking process the metal of the planchet is compressed between the two dies. It is also forced outward from the center. This lateral movement
							may have a cumulative effect upon the dies. The effect can be observed as radial lines across the surface of the coin. Some of these radial lines are a
							natural product of the metal stretching. However, when they appear in the same place and pattern on many coins, it is apparent that the lines are
							transfered from the surface of the die. These lines can also be observed at the points of greatest resistance. Often the points of the stars on the
							obverse or the letters of the reverse legend become connected to the rims because of this effect.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>The dies are supposed to transfer their image to the planchet. Sometimes the dies came together without a planchet in place. If the dies strike together
							hard enough or often enough, one die may transfer an image to the other. This effect may be noted on the coins as parts of the design from the opposite
							side.</p>
                  <p>A clash mark can be considered a view through to the other side of the coin, A die is a negative image of the final coin design. Generally the two dies
							are positioned top to bottom. Therefore the image transfered by die clashing may appear to be upside down, backward, and negative.</p>
                  <p>The lowest points on the coin are produced by the highest areas of the die. Clashing occurs between high points of opposite dies. These, marks, called
							incusations, are incuse in the die but are seen as raised areas on the coins.</p>
                  <p>On the Turbans, clash marks are most frequently seen on the reverse inside the right side of the wreath. The image of the lower ribbon end from the
							obverse can be seen right of the E of ONE. The base line of the bust may be seen below the wreath over ONE. The image of the throat appears at O of ONE.
							The lips may be seen inside the C of CENT. With different die alignment, the lips may appear closer to the leaf under D.</p>
                  <p>All 19 of the Turban varieties exhibit signs of clashing in late die states. When high grade specimens are examined, perhaps 2/3 show at least some signs
							of clashing.</p>

                  <p>The dies may start with crisp sharp details. Over the life of the die the details may become less sharp. On the Turban Cents one very noticable area of
							die weakness occurs as a raised ridge just inside the rim. Denticles fade and disappear. The tops of letters of the legend may disappear into this
							ridge.</p>
                  <p>The position of this die wear corresponds to the raised rim on prepared planchets. As the highest point on the planchet, this rim would have the first
							and strongest contact with the dies. It would therefore be the area of greatest die wear.</p>
                  <p>The ridge most frequently appears in the reverse die around K-12. It extends in both directions until in rare cases it may encircle the entire die. It is
							occasionally but less frequently found to effect the obverse die as well.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Two coins struck from the same dies on the same day may appear to be different because of variations in the precise way they were struck. These variations
						can provide another interesting area for study.</p>
               <p>In modern coinage the collar acts to position the planchet and restricts the outward flow of metal. For earlier coinage struck without a collar, several
						different results may be seen.</p>
               <div3 xml:id="d1e8259" type="subsection">

                        <hi rend="italic">CENTERING</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Without the collar for positioning, the planchets may not be correctly aligned at the time they are struck. Turban cents that are struck slightly off
							center are very common. For most varieties, a well centered coin is difficult to find. As a general rule, there was not enough copper in the planchets
							to fill out the borders of the dies. The perfectly centered coin is probably lacking in detail around the entire border. Often the entire border design
							can only be seen after accumulating several coins that are struck off center in different directions.</p>
                  <p>Coins that appear to be struck off center may also be the result of poor die allignment. The faces of the two dies may not be parallel. Where the dies
							strike close together, the detail is strong with a strong rim. Where the dies are apart, surface detail may be weak and the rim may be weak or
							absent.</p>
                  <p>Some late die states appear to be well centered. This occurs when extended die wear has obliterated the details in the denticles. With the denticles
							gone, original border positions are no longer apparent. It may be, in these cases, that planchet allignment ultimately determines the position of the
							borders.</p>
                  <p>The coins from the survey were identified as to the quality of centering. The following codes were assigned:</p>
                  <list type="numbered">
                     <item n="1">—Well Centered</item>
                     <item n="2">—Slightly off center, a noticable difference in the width of edge milling showing.</item>
                     <item n="3">—Off Centered, showing total lack of milling on one side.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The direction was also noted for coins that were not well centered. The standard clock or K (Kolit) positions were used to identify the widest area of
							the edge milling. If most coins of a variety are off center in the same direction, it might be an indication of the <pb n="157"/> positioning of the
							planchets prior to striking. It might also be an indication that the dies were not parallel. If coins of a single variety are off center in different
							directions, it would be an indication that the planchets were not in the same position prior to striking.</p>
                  <p>The relative position of both sides were also compared. This can give an indication as to the alignment of dies. If both sides are off center in the same
							direction, it might be an indication that the dies were properly aligned with each other but the planchet was not well positioned. The following pairs
							of numbers indicate K positions that represent relatively the same position of the obverse and reverse dies:</p>
                  <p>K1-K5; K2-K4; K3-K3; K4-K2; K5-K1; K6-K12; K7-K11; K8-K10; K9-K9; K10-K8; K11-K7; K12-K6</p>

                  <p>The appearance of borders could be the topic for an extensive study by itself. Usually, the description of a Turban Cent will say that the borders are
							milled. When a Turban Cent is struck off center, it may show this milled border on one side. On a cent that is well centered, the copper may only fill
							part of the border detail and give the appearance of a beaded edge. In other examples, after considerable die wear, the edge may appear to be a plain
							edge.</p>

                  <p>Often the pressure of the dies and flow of metal were not adequate to fill all the details near the outer edges of the dies. On the obverse, the stars
							often lack the central detail. On the reverses, the letters of the legend may not fill completely. This effect creates a style of letter that may appear
							to come from different die punches. However, this is a striking variation rather than a die variety.</p>

                  <p>The weakness of the first star on the obverse is the result of the condition of the reverse die. The break on the reverse resulted in inadequate pressure

               </head>
               <p>Collectors looking at half cents are often puzzled by something unusual they see on a coin. They recognize that it is different from what they have seen on
						other coins of the same design, but wonder what it is or how it happens to be there.</p>
               <p>Resolving these questions is important to collectors for two reasons. First, they are interesting intellectual puzzles, opprtunities for increasing
						numismatic knowledge. Second, some of these lines or marks can greatly affect the importance of the coin. If it is just damage which exists, then the
						interest in it is decreased. But if it is a rare die state or unusual undertype, its significance may be substantial.</p>
               <p>This paper will discuss these lines and marks on half cents in three broad categories, distinguished by whether they were created after, during, or before
						the striking process. Although <name type="pname">Walter Breen's</name> 1984 book, <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of <name type="place">United States</name>
							Half Cents,</hi> contains extremely comprehensive discussions of these kinds of half cents, bringing these sometimes puzzling coins together as a single
						topic may be helpful.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The post-striking appearance, or for that matter, disappearance of marks on half cents can be further divided into two categories. Most of these marks
						reflect normal wear and other damage that occurs as a result of the coins circulating as money. Coins were made to be articles of use, and that use entails
						experiences, both gradual and sudden, which leave their record on the coin itself.</p>
               <p>Generally, the nicks, scratches and pits on half cents are easily recognizable. They involve removal or displacement of metal, which can be readily noticed,
						although in some difficult cases high magnification may be required. However, even an experienced numismatist need not be embarrassed at being occasionally
						misled. Ebenezer Gilbert in 1916 published his thorough and careful work on half-cent varieties. Yet he mistakenly described an 1808 variety 3, which was
						actually his variety 2 after having accidentally experienced a bit of well-concealed damage. A bump, which left virtually no other trace, had displaced the
						highest wave of hair upward toward the R of LIBERTY. Gilbert's coin, which later found its way into the Brobston and Showers collections, is now in my
						possession. It is extraordinarily difficult to see that the changed posi- <pb n="177"/> tion of the hair wave is due to a bump rather than being a normal
						striking from a different die.</p>
               <p>Of more concern to numismatists are the deliberately altered examples which occasionally appear, such as an 1834 half cent with the date altered so that it
						appears to be a rare 1831. <name type="pname">Gilbert</name>'s other mistaken listing of a non-existent variety was of this kind. His 1795, no. 2 was
						described as having the same dies as the lettered edge no. 1, except with a plain edge. It was, in fact, a 1795, no. 1 which had had the edge deliberately
						filed or ground away to eliminate the incuse lettering.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Marks created during the striking process can be further subdivided into marks which are in the dies and those which arise as a result of some event which
						occured during the striking process:</p>
               <p>A. Some well-known features of particular half-cent dies were created during the preparation of the die. Examples include:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1.">The "comma" in the punctuated date of 1795.</item>
                  <item n="2.">The "1 over 1" on an obverse die of 1797.</item>
                  <item n="3.">The "inner circle" of an obverse die of 1809.</item>
                  <item n="4.">Traces of guide lines for the punching of letters on reverses of 1825 and 1826.</item>
                  <item n="5.">Overdates in general.</item>
                  <item n="6.">Various engravers' scratches, file marks, etc.</item>
                  <item n="7.">The missing pole of varieties of 1795, 1796, and 1797.</item>
                  <item n="8.">The missing stems on the wreath of a reverse used in 1804, 1805, and 1806.</item>
                  <item n="9.">The missing star in an 1828 obverse.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Normally, if a mark arose during the preparation of a die, it could be expected to show in every sufficiently unworn example of the coin. However, some marks
						are faint and do not show in lightly struck coins, or fade away as a die becomes worn through use. Conversely, even though every known 1796 no pole variety
						shows a prominent obverse horizontal line from a cracked die, it is assumed that uncracked specimens must have existed.</p>
               <p>B. Other marks in dies arose as a result of injuries to the dies after they were placed in service. Examples include:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1.">A shattered obverse die of 1797 (variety 1).</item>
                  <item n="2.">The spiked chin obverse of 1804.</item>
                  <pb n="178"/>
                  <item n="3.">The dramatically progressive breaking of a reverse are of 1804 (variety 6).</item>
                  <item n="4.">Major cuds at the stars on an obverse of 1811 (variety 1) and above LIBERTY on an 1826 obverse (variety 2) and an 1808 obverse (variety 2),
							among others.</item>
                  <item n="5.">Clash marks in general (particularly prominent in 1794 and 1833 pieces).</item>
                  <item n="6.">Die cracks and rim crumbling in many varieties, and raised dots from rusted dies in a few others.</item>
               </list>
               <p>C. A common example of a mark that arises as a result of the striking of the particular coin is a coin which has been struck two or more times. Usually
						enough of the early strike shows to make identification easy, but this is not always true. This category yields some interesting variations which can be
						quite different in appearance. For example:</p>
               <p>1. A normal double strike with both obverse and reverse showing similar evidence of the two strikings. With respect to each other the two strikes may display
						a rotation, a linear shift, or both.</p>
               <p>2. A coin may show similar evidence of three or more strikes.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-123">
                  <graphic url="COAC1_178.jpg"/>
                  <p>2. Triple strike</p>
               </figure>
               <pb n="179"/>
               <figure xml:id="fig-124">
                  <graphic url="COAC1_179.jpg"/>
                  <p>3.Flip-over double strike</p>
               </figure>
               <p>3. A flip-over double strike, in which the obverse shows traces of an earlier reverse strike, and vice-versa.</p>
               <p>4. A triple strike in which a flip-over has occurred.</p>
               <pb n="180"/>
               <p>5. A half cent which was first created as a brockage and then restruck normally. Examples exist of both an off-center brockage and a normally centered one as
						the first strike. In fact, there are a considerable number of different possible orientations of the two planchets to each other and to the respective dies.
						Each possibility yields a somewhat different appearance. However, they can often be distinguished with study, even as undertypes, if sufficient detail
						remains.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-125">
                  <graphic url="COAC1_180a.jpg"/>

                  <p>5. Off-center brockage</p>
               </figure>
               <pb n="181"/>
               <p>6. A half cent which was first struck with another blank planchet in the press at the same time, creating a uniface impression, and then restruck normally.
						In this case, one side is struck twice and the other only once. The singularly struck side is aligned with the second strike on the other side.</p>
               <p>7. A coin which was first struck normally, but which remained in the press when a second planchet was fed in and another strike occured. The second coin
						becomes a brockage. The first coin shows a clear double strike on one side, but only a single strike on the side which was in contact with the blank
						planchet during the second strike. The appearance of this coin is similar to that of (6) above. However, it differs in that this has the singularly struck
						side aligned with the first strike on the other side.</p>
               <p>8. A normally struck coin which remained in the press as a second blank planchet was partly fed into the press. In this case, the first coin displays on one
						side a prominently depressed arc created by the rim of the new planchet during the second striking.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-127">
                  <graphic url="COAC1_181.jpg"/>
                  <p>8. Second strike by blank planchet</p>
               </figure>
               <p>9. A similarly created "tiddly-winks" coin, in which only a very small portion of the second planchet was projected over the first coin, and popped out as
						the second strike occurred.</p>
               <p>10. Another variation, in which only a very small portion of the first coin remained in the press, and popped out during the second striking.</p>
               <pb n="182"/>
               <p>For some reason, these multiple strikes are found quite frequently in some varieties and are much less common in other varieties of the same year which are
						of equivalent rarity. It is a reasonable assumption that some malfunction of equipment or personnel persisted long enough before being corrected to produce
						a meaningful number of examples with multiple strikes. Varieties for which relatively large numbers of multiple strikes exist include: 1795, no. 6; 1797,
						no. 2; 1804, no. 10; 1804, no. 13; 1805, no. 1; 1806, no. 1; 1808, no. 3, 1809, no. 6.</p>
               <p>In spite of the relatively good number of double-struck plain edge 1795 half cents which exist, no double-struck lettered edge 1795 has come to the writer's
						attention. Nor has a double-struck 1793 or 1794. It would be much appreciated if any reader who knows of one would share that information.</p>
               <p>Moreover, double-struck half cents dated later than 1829 are also quite rare, except for those with a very small distance between the two strikings,
						sometimes described as "double profile" or "die chatter."</p>

               </head>
               <p>Another category covers identifiable devices or traces of another coin which was used to make a half-cent planchet. This is what is usually meant by the term
						"undertype." Two common undertypes exist on early half cents:</p>
               <p>A. Talbot, Allum &amp; Lee tokens dated 1794 and 1795 were purchased by the Mint in 1795 and 1796. These were used to make planchets for half cents dated
						1795 and 1797, respectively.</p>
               <p>The purchase of these tokens and their use to make half cents is well documented in the records of the Mint. <name type="pname">Both Roger Cohen</name> and
							<name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> have extensive discussions of this in their books. Traces of the original TA&amp;L devices are commonly seen on
						1795 and 1797 half cents. In some instances, there is a substantial amount of the original design visible, and at least one half cent exists where several
						of the edge letters of the token can be seen on the edge of the half cent.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">B. Misstruck</name> large cents were withdrawn and saved by the Mint instead of being melted and rolled into strips. Periodically these
						were cut in to half-cent planchets. Little care appears to have been taken to obliterate the traces of the large cents or to roll them to half-cent <pb n="183"/> planchet thickness.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-128">
                  <graphic url="COAC1_183.jpg"/>
                  <p>A. Struck over Talbot, Allum &amp; <name type="pname">Lee</name> token</p>
               </figure>
               <p>The most common type of error which appears as an undertype is an off-center large cent. The arc of heavy denticles is a prominent feature of many such half
						cents. It can prevent a portion of the half-cent devices from being visible, even on an uncirculated specimen. This appears to the casual observer as a
						disfiguring defect. Strictly speaking, however, it is not damage. The finest known 1795, no. 5b, is an uncirculated specimen of this kind with a good deal
						of original mint red.</p>
               <p>There are some half cents made from large-cent brockages. However, far more large-cent brockages exist in collectors' hands than do half cents made from
						rejected and retained brockages. Therefore, it would appear that the Mint as a rule must have considered such coins as acceptable for circulation. Exactly
						the opposite is true for off-center large cents, which are less frequently seen in collectors' hands than as undertypes for half cents.</p>
               <p>In addition, one 1795, no. 5b, is known which shows a double clip of large-cent arc, indicating that the planchet was rejected for large cent use and cut
						down to make a half cent.</p>
               <p>These spoiled large cents exist as undertypes for each half-cent date from 1795 to 1802. Several varieties appear to have been made exclusively from
						planchets cut from spoiled large cents. These are: 1795, no. 5b; 1795, no. 6b; 1797, no. 3 (all three subvarieties); 1802 <pb n="184"/> (both
						varieties).</p>
               <p>In some cases, enough of the large-cent detail is still visible to permit attribution of the variety. And in at least two instances the digits 98 of the
						large-cent date appear as part of the undertype on half cents dated 1797. This is clear confirmation that the dies were continued in use after the year of
						their date, which can also be deduced from the records of the Mint.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-129">
                  <graphic url="COAC1_184.jpg"/>
                  <p>B. 1797 half cent struck on planchet cut from off-center 1798 large cent (S-164)</p>
               </figure>
               <pb n="185"/>
               <p>C. There are three 1795, no. 6 half cents struck on planchets made from copper trial strikings of half-dollar dies. Two of these, one of a 1794 (0-105) half
						dollar and the other of a 1795 (0-117) half dollar, have been listed for some time in editions of Judd's book on patterns. Another pair of 1794 half-dollar
						dies (0-104) comprise the undertype of the third half cent of this kind. It appears that these die trials were rolled down to half-cent thickness before
						half-cent planchets were cut from them, in contrast to what was done with spoiled large cents at about the same time.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-130">
                  <graphic url="COAC1_185.jpg"/>
                  <p>C. 1795 half cent struck on planchet cut from copper trial piece for 1794 half dollar (0-104)</p>
               </figure>
               <p>D. A final reference to undertype is in the Brobston catalogue which makes the following statement as part of the text for the 1802, Reverse of 1800 half
						cent: "Practically all were struck on cut-down planchets of Large Cents, Mass. half cents and other coins." No record or reference to Massachusetts half
						cents or other coins as undertypes for half cents, other than the Brobston reference, is known to the writer. Neither Cohen or Breen mention knowing of any.
						I would be delighted to hear from anyone who knows of such references or coins.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Half cents are particularly rich in specimens which display unusual marks and details. Perhaps because the denomination was of such small value, it was used
						to salvage bits of copper. Little effort appears to have been made to remove traces of the planchets' prior devices. And dies were retained in use long
						after they had sustained considerable wear or damage.</p>
               <p>These coins can challenge us to use more than the usual amounts of observation and analysis. And in return, they can reward us with additional knowledge, not
						only about themselves, but about the coinage techniques and practices of that early era.</p>
