            <p>The Thesprotian town of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> in <placeName>Epirus</placeName> (Άμβραία) was situated where the town of <placeName>Arta</placeName> now stands. Its territory extended all round the northern and western side of the Gulf of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> (now Gulf of <placeName>Arta</placeName>). On the southeast, it was bounded by the territory of the. <placeName>Amphilochians</placeName> and on the west by the <placeName>Laguna Tsukalia</placeName>, or probably the small river Oropos (Luro). Inland, we do not know how far it extended.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The city itself was situated at the mouth of the river Arachthos (Ἄραϑϑος), and at the head of a gulf eighty stadia from the sea.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> Above the town of which some ancient walls still exist, stands a rocky hill—the Acropolis, and from its height the plain could be dominated and one had an extensive view over the sea.</p>
            <p>The harbor was provided with dikes and dams (κλειστòς λιμήν) and was probably situated at the mouth of the river,<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> which vessels could navigate as far as the town.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The mythical founder of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> was <persName>Ambrax</persName>, son of <persName>Thesprotos</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> but according to <persName>Dionysios</persName> of <placeName>Halikarnassos</placeName>, the eponymous founder was the son of <persName>Dexamenos</persName>, son of <persName>Heracles</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>The town was colonized by <placeName>Corinth</placeName> about 630 B.C. <persName>Strabo</persName> says <persName>Gorgos</persName>, son of <persName>Kypselos</persName>, was the leader of the Corinthian expedition and became the first tyrant of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. His son, <persName>Periander II</persName>, succeeded him but was soon deposed by the citizens who then instituted a democratic form of government.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By some authors, the historical founder of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> is called Torgos, Gorgias or <persName>Gorgos</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> but as his name is inscribed in full on a beautiful coin (pl. XI, 127), we may be sure that it was really <persName>Gorgos</persName> (ΓΟΡΓΟΣ).<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Owing to her very favorable situation, <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> was the natural port for <placeName>Epirus</placeName> and the interior, and the medium for commerce with <placeName>Italy</placeName> and <placeName>Sicily</placeName>. Practically all the trade of the country passed through her harbor, so that she grew in wealth and soon became one of the most flourishing of the <placeName>Corinth</placeName>ian colonies.</p>
            <p>The first we know of her in history is that in 480 B.C. she joined with <placeName>Corinth</placeName> in the war against <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, sending five hundred hoplites and seven vessels.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <placeName>Corinth</placeName> through hostility for <placeName>Aegina</placeName> established a close friendship with <placeName>Athens</placeName>, which she supported, in order that, through her, <placeName>Aegina</placeName> should be humiliated. We have no direct proofs that <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> was with <placeName>Athens</placeName> against <placeName>Aegina</placeName>, but knowing she was very faithful to her mother-city, we may suppose she helped <placeName>Corinth</placeName>.
<pb n="3"/>
When, in 456 B.C., <placeName>Aegina</placeName> became tributary to <placeName>Athens</placeName>, the dangerous rival to the Corinthian influence in <placeName>Peloponnesus</placeName> was eliminated.<ref target="#CH1-n10a">10a</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 432 B.C., <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> took an active part, on the Corinthian side, in the war between <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and <placeName>Corcyra</placeName> and supplied a fleet of 27 vessels.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>At first <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> invaded the neighbouring town of <placeName>Argos</placeName> and expelled the Amphilochians.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> They, with the help of their allies, the Akarnanians, later recaptured the town.<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>During the second part of the Peloponnesian war the Ambracians again besieged <placeName>Argos</placeName>, but did not succeed in taking it and were obliged to retreat. In 426 B.C., with the help of the Lakedemonian <persName>Eurylochos</persName>, they again tried to take that town, but the Akarnanians had received important help from the Athenians and directed by the Athenian general <persName>Demosthenes</persName>, they defeated the Ambracians at Olpai (Ὄλπαι), and destroyed their army completely.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref>
               <persName>Thucydides</persName> says that during the Peloponnesian war no other Greek town suffered so great a calamity within so short a time. After this defeat, a truce of 100 years was concluded between <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> and the Akarnanians.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, always faithful to her mother-city and to <placeName>Sparta</placeName>, in the last period of the Peloponnesian war (ca. 415-414) sent troops to help <placeName>Syracuse</placeName> then besieged by the Athenians.</p>
            <p>From this time she seems to have lived in
<pb n="4"/>
peace and there followed the most flourishing epoch of her history. About 342, <persName>Alexander</persName> of <placeName>Epirus</placeName>, made <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> one of his capitals and sailed <placeName>thence</placeName> to <placeName>Italy</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> (ca. 334 B.C.). In 340 B.C., she entered into the defensive league with <placeName>Athens</placeName> against <persName>Philip</persName> of <placeName>Macedon</placeName>, but after the battle of <placeName>Chaeronea</placeName> in 338 B.C., <persName>Philip</persName> established a Macedonian garrison in the town.</p>
            <p>As the object of the present study is the coinage of the Ambracian mint, and as this was closed under <persName>Philip</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> the events posterior to 338 B.C. do not concern us. These historical facts are cited merely to facilitate examination of the events that may have left a mark upon the coinage.</p>
            <p>The coinage of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> is almost exclusively staters of Corinthian types and standard; some small denominations are recorded as belonging to this mint, owing to the initial A under the Pegasos, but it is more likely that they should be attributed to some other mint. The small coins in the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum, of Roman standard,<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> like all the late staters, do not belong to this mint.</p>
            <p>In the Museum of <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, there are two small coins, probably drachms, of archaic style, inscribed A under the Pegasos and therefore considered as being of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. These pieces are the only instance of small coins in all the series. To support this attribution, there is only the initial A, but as this may be the initial of other mints too, we prefer to leave these coins among those of "uncertain mints."</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>The present study treats the series of beautiful Ambracian staters. These most remarkable coins of Corinthian types are very carefully executed. They show much variety in composition, and the symbols are often of great interest. Like the Corinthian staters, those of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> were known everywhere as pegasi or "colts" (πῶλοι), and circulated freely as a kind of international currency. The name colts was given these staters owing to the constant reiteration of the principal type, the flying Pegasos, popularly known as the 'colt.'<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> and this type was considered as a kind of guaranty of good alloy and weight. A circumstance that seems to justify the great success of the pegasi is that, although many thousand pegasi are recorded, so far no plated example has been met.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>Ambracia's</placeName> trade with <placeName>Italy</placeName> and <placeName>Sicily</placeName> was very important, and this explains why the greatest number of Ambracian colts have been found in these countries. Their abundance in Sicilian hoards seems to indicate that, as the coinage of didrachms was very scanty in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, they were normally used, with the other pegasi, in the transactions where didrachms, or ten-litrae pieces, were needed.</p>
            <p>Although hoards of pegasi have been numerous in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, it is greatly to be regretted that not a single detailed record has been made of them. Even when the other coins found with them have
<pb n="6"/>
been carefully described and published, the colts have been completely neglected. This is due to several reasons—a general contempt for them, the very erroneous idea that they are such common coins that it is not worth while wasting time over them and the scarcity of books of reference dealing with them.<ref target="#CH1-n19a">19a</ref>
            </p>
            <p>That the pegasi of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> are not common is amply proved by the following catalogue. The coins recorded are by no means all that exist, but as almost all the coins of the principal public and private collections and all the coins illustrated in the sale catalogues have been noted, it is surprising how few there are. Very important museums, such as <placeName>Athens</placeName> and <placeName>Naples</placeName>, have only half a score of specimens in their trays. Very few series of <placeName>Greek</placeName> coins show such a large number of presumably unique varieties.</p>
            <p>I am particularly indebted to <persName>Mr. E. T. Newell</persName>, President of the American Numismatic Society, who has helped me with his valuable advice, and, especially, to <persName>Mr. Sydney P. Noe</persName>, Secretary of the American Numismatic Society, who was kind enough to read over and correct the proofs, and to help me with friendly criticism so that I have modified in some cases my possibly over-bold views, clashing with opinions which still hold the field.<ref target="#CH1-n19b">19b</ref>
            </p>
            <p>I have to express my gratitude also to my friend <persName>M. Michel P. Vlasto</persName>, with whom I discussed
<pb n="7"/>
many points and who has constantly assisted me with his knowledge.</p>

               <head>SYMBOLS</head>
               <p>On a great number of the staters of Corinthian type there are symbols in the field of the reverses. Some of these are common to all mints and generally represent a variety of simple or conventionalized objects such as animals, insects, plants, or articles associated with religious ceremonies, etc.</p>
               <p>Others of more complicated nature are found chiefly on the Ambracian colts. They sometimes represent human figures of comparatively large size—at times real "tableaux de genre."</p>
               <p>Head, speaking of the symbols found on the staters of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> corresponding to those illustrated on <hi rend="italic">pl. XIX</hi>, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, says that they
<pb n="9"/>
are doubtless magistrates' signets, and that those found on the series with the magistrates' initials stand for mint-officials of lower rank, who were replaced at frequent intervals, perhaps annually, while the superior magistrate remained in office for a longer period of time.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Prof. Oman</persName> repeats this explanation but applies the theory of mint-officials changing annually to the great variety of symbols found on the early staters without initials.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Babelon follows Head's opinion.<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The writer's idea is that it is a mistake to generalize on the basis of this theory. It may be that the symbols on the late Corinthian coins with initials ΑΛ–Αϒ–ΑΡ–ΔΙ–Δ–Γ–Ι–Ν<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> have some connection with the mint-officials, but this possibility is no more than conjecture that has still to be proved. If the symbols are really magistrates' signets, it can only be ascertained through a careful examination of a large number of die-combinations.</p>
               <p>There is a class of staters studied by <persName>Sir Charles Oman</persName> in his paper on the Fifth century coins of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> that presents a strong objection to Head's opinion.</p>
               <p>Fourteen reverses with different symbols are found coupled with two obverses so similar that only a very slight difference in the position of the Pegasos head and fore-legs permits one to see that they are not of the same die. These dies (pl.

XIX, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi>) are apparently contemporary, and this is proved since the same reverses are found coupled with both.</p>

               <p>I have found 42 staters from these die-combinations. Two of these 14 different reverses, Nos. 5 and 7, are found coupled with both <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> Only two, Nos. 1 and 5, are found coupled with other obverse-dies. The first is found with an obverse depicting a standing Pegasos (cf. <persName>Babelon</persName>, pl. CCX, 11) and the second with a flying Pegasos of later style. (Cf. Ratto, 1927, pl. XXXIX, 1438.)</p>
               <p>This group of colts shows a concrete sequence of dies, where No. 1 represents the link with the previous issues and No. 5 the link with the following. We can therefore infer that the 14 reverses are all contemporary. But the above mentioned staters have been placed by <persName>Professor Oman</persName> in different periods, ranging from 414 to 394 B.C., Nos. 1 and 2 in the "Circle of dolphins class," Nos. 11 and 12 in the "Palmette and dolphin class" and the others in Period IX (Dolphin and varying annual symbols).</p>
               <p>If we accept this classification, we are obliged to assume that the two dies <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> have been in constant use for 20 years, which is certainly not possible.</p>
               <p>If the symbols stand for the magistrates' badges, there must have been at least 13 magistrates in the mint of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, during the
<pb n="12"/>
use of the two dies that we have seen were employed at the same time, and this is certainly very difficult to believe.</p>
               <p>Even if we only take into consideration the symbols we find on the reverses coupled with die <hi rend="italic">A</hi> alone, we should find, during the use of one single die, at least nine magistrates, as there are nine different symbols.</p>
               <p>On the other hand if we consider only the dies belonging to <persName>Professor Oman's Period IX</persName>, the eleven symbols we find would represent the mintmarks, or badges of magistrates that changed <hi rend="italic">at least</hi> once a year. Therefore the two dies that we have seen were used at the same time would have been employed constantly during eleven years. From what we know of the technique of ancient coining<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> this is most improbable too. No die could stand hard hammering for such a long time; a duration of two years would certainly be more than we can expect from a die under normal circumstances.<ref target="#CH1-n26a">26a</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Studying a large number of colts of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, of which I have collected a considerable number of casts, with a view to establishing their chronological sequence, it has been found that the above case is not an exception. On the contrary we find very often a large number of reverses with differing symbols, coupled with the same obverse die. This is also met with in the Ambracian series. For instance, coins Nos. 125 to 132 have
<pb n="13"/>
all the obverses from the same die, coupled with eight reverses with different symbols. These coins are certainly contemporary and belong to the same issue; in this case, too, we should have eight magistrates in charge at the same time, and this is even more astonishing in a mint as small as <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>
               <p>We also find cases sometimes that at first glance seem just the reverse. Several symbols are repeated for a long time and on reverses of quite different style. For instance, we find the kerykeion on coins of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> of the second and third period. There are ten dies (P 10, 11, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33) all with the same symbol, and their issue is certainly wide apart in time. How can we explain that in the same mint in the one case we have a single magistrate for a long period and in the other eight magistrates during the short life-time of a single die?</p>
               <p>From these considerations we should be justified in concluding that the symbols on the pegasi cannot represent the signets of mint-officials or magistrates, and that their meaning must be quite different.</p>
               <p>One class of symbols is found repeated on the coins of the same mint, such as the <hi rend="italic">Club</hi> on those of <placeName>Dyrrhachium</placeName>, the <hi rend="italic">Achelous' head</hi> on the coins of <placeName>Stratos</placeName>, the <hi rend="italic">Bow</hi> on those of <placeName>Alyzia</placeName>. In these cases, owing to their constant reiteration, they are not considered as magistrates' signets, but
<pb n="14"/>
as a kind of παράσημον<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> of the town. It is evident that they imply a religious meaning, being the attributes of gods whose cult was greatly in honour there. But these symbols were by no means used at the above mentioned mints exclusively; we find the <hi rend="italic">Club,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Achelous' head</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Bow</hi> symbols also on the colts of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> (No. 29, pl. III, No. 89, pl. XII, No. 54, pl. V). If these symbols have a religious meaning on the colts of <placeName>Dyrrhachium</placeName>, <placeName>Stratos</placeName> and <placeName>Alyzia</placeName>, why should they not have the same meaning on the other colts?</p>
               <p>Our hypothesis for explaining the symbols is that they were at first merely ornamental devices, meant to embellish the composition and to break the bareness of the field. Later, attributes of gods were chosen with the same object, but with the supplementary purpose of putting the issue under the protection of a tutelary divinity. Once the fashion of the symbols became established, they must have been considered a kind of customary accessory to the Athena's head, and the die-cutters gave free course to their imagination and a great variety of objects were chosen, but chiefly from among the numerous ἀποτρόπαια of recognized protective power.</p>
               <p>The symbols on the colts were for a long time religious and, after the usual attributes of gods, we find totems of all kinds, gods themselves or reproductions of well-known statues of divinities
<pb n="15"/>
or heroes and even mythological scenes or allusions to some legendary or historical event. This class of symbols should be considered as a kind of accessory type, added to the standard Corinthian type.</p>
               <p>We can follow this evolution, step by step, on the colts of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>
               <p>On the first archaic issues we find no symbols (Nos. 1 to 7, pl. I), but on the following issue, which we shall show hereafter was probably struck at <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, we find an ivy-branch (Nos. 8 to 11, pl. I). The nature of the symbol and its decorative disposition leave no doubt that it was meant to embellish the composition.</p>
               <p>The first symbol that follows the ivy-branch is a kerykeion, and we have already noted that this is found repeated for a long time in periods II and III (pl. II, III, IV, and V). The kerykeion marks the first step in the evolution of the original purpose, which was simply decorative. The choice was natural; this symbol is not only a decorative device, but has its own particular meaning. In fact what could have been found more appropriate for an issue of coins than the golden rod of Hermes, the herald of peaceful intercourse among people and the symbol of trade?</p>
               <p>Later, however, only the religious meaning survived and, as the kerykeion was the attribute of Hermes, there were no reasons that those of the
<pb n="16"/>
other gods worshipped should not have been employed also as symbols. Thus we have the Club<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> of <persName>Herakles</persName>, the Kantharos of <persName>Dionysos</persName>, the Tripod of <persName>Apollo</persName>.</p>
               <p>From these simple attributes we pass to the figures of divinities such as the flying Nike, a Satyr, an <persName>Eros</persName> (?), and later <hi rend="italic">local</hi> gods and heroes—Arachthos, <persName>Gorgos</persName> and the Dolphin-rider—were taken for symbols. On some coins we even find <hi rend="italic">complete scenes</hi>, like the girl playing at Kottabos and <persName>Ambrax</persName> watching the fight of the serpent with the tortoise.</p>
               <p>It is therefore evident that the study of these symbols is of more interest than if they are considered as mint-marks or magistrates' signets only.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Adrien Blanchet</persName> saw the importance of the study of these symbols and in his paper "Representations de statues sur les statères de Corinthe" concludes that the study of them may supply us with considerable archaeological and chronological information.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the present study great importance has therefore been given to the symbols and we have attempted to explain their meaning. Unfortunately we know very little about the local legends of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> and consequently we can submit an interpretation in a few cases only. Many symbols, in spite of our endeavours, are incomprehensible and will perhaps remain puzzles until new archaeological discoveries shall have furnished us with the necessary clues.</p>

               <head>CHRONOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION</head>
               <p>The classification of the staters of Corinthian types has always been considered a very difficult task. In the introduction of the Catalogue of the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum for <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, Head says that few series of coins present greater difficulties. <persName>Prof. P. Gardner</persName> says that to arrange them accurately by date is impossible.<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> The great uniformity of types, and the small differences of style, were the chief difficulties.</p>
               <p>But as many other <placeName>Greek</placeName> series present the same peculiarity and have been carefully classified, we are justified in believing that there must be other reasons.</p>
               <p>As a rule in all ancient coins the die with deep relief was fixed to the anvil, and used as a pile; the other die was used as a punch or trussel and received the blow. The die fixed to the anvil was the one which gave the more important side of the coin, or obverse; and the side from the punch die was the reverse. This last received the blows and therefore lasted a shorter time than the die fixed to the anvil, which accounts for the fact that generally the reverses are more numerous than the obverses.<ref target="#CH1-n31a">31a</ref>.</p>
               <p>Although on the Corinthian staters the head of Athena,<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> apparently the more important side of the coin, is on the reverse, the Pegasos is on the obverse; therefore it is the principal type.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> On
<pb n="18"/>
the earliest coins of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> we find the Pegasos on the obverse, and on the reverse only a kind of incuse pattern. Afterwards Athena's head took the place of the incuse device, while the flying-horse, the παράσημον of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, remained on the obverse.<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In all attempts at classification of the colts, the obverses, viz., the most important side of the coin, have been completely neglected, even in the best catalogues. Often they are not even illustrated and their descriptions are limited to "Pegasos flying r. or l."<ref target="#CH1-n34a">34a</ref> Modern authors, following this general habit, try to establish the chronological sequence of the types by studying the reverses only.</p>
               <p>Although at first sight the obverses seem similar, they are by no means so nearly alike as it was generally supposed. If we study them closely, we are surprised to see how different they really are. If they look similar, it is a probability that they are closely related—that the coins either belong to the same issue or at least to the same period.</p>
               <p>This uniformity of the obverses, which was the reason for their being neglected, is of great help in the study of the series.</p>
               <p>In fact, it is obvious that it is much easier to perceive differences of design and style on artistic productions if they always reproduce the same object, than if this varies.</p>
               <pb n="19"/>
               <p>It is misleading to rely on style alone, and in the present study several cases confirm this.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref> Striking differences of style are to be found on coins of the same epoch, either because earlier types were copied intentionally, or because, in all epochs, there were clever and inferior engravers working together and therefore good and bad style.</p>
               <p>In trying to establish the chronology of the colts of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n35a">35a</ref> we have followed the only really scientific system, that of the die-sequence, inaugurated by Regling and followed by <persName>Tudeer</persName>, <persName>Newell</persName>, <persName>Seltman</persName> and other modern numismatists.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The coinage of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> is particularly interesting, as the dies interlace frequently. This fact permits us to establish a die-sequence that is almost continuous. Naturally there are missing links, but in this case stylistic considerations help greatly to bridge the interruptions.</p>
               <p>Some die-combinations that we do not know may come to light, and these may change the sequence submitted herein and demand a "reshuffling," but the present essay is only a modest attempt at the classification, and it should be considered as the first step to a more complete and exhaustive work.</p>
               <p>The coinage has been divided into five chronological periods, taking into consideration the established die-sequence, comparisons of style and the available historical data.</p>

               <p>Both Head<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> and <persName>Babelon</persName> agree in fixing the beginning of the coinage of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> at 480 B.C., when <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> joined the war against <persName>Corinth</persName>. <persName>Babelon</persName> supposes the first issue of coins to have been made to pay the Ambracian troops.<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The second period begins with the fall of <placeName>Aegina</placeName> in 456 B.C. and ends with the defeat of <placeName>Olpai</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The third period beginning with the truce of 100 years ends with the fall of <placeName>Athens</placeName>. The date of 360 B.C. closing the fourth period is only conjectural. The fifth period ends with the closing of the mint in 338 B.C.</p>
               <p>The periods have been subdivided into groups, taking as a rule the obverses rather than the reverses into consideration. It would be impossible to establish groups or classes where obverses and reverses would exactly fit. Because of the concatenation of the dies several reverses from the same die are coupled with obverses of two groups. We do not fix any dating for the
<pb n="21"/>
groups as this would only be guess-work and consequently of very doubtful utility.</p>
               <p>The system of labelling in the following catalogue is the same that has been adopted by <persName>C. T. Seltman</persName> in his "<placeName>Athens</placeName>, its History and Coinage." Each coin or die-combination has a progressive
<figure xml:id="fig-3">
                     <graphic url="NNM37_027.jpg"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is called the <hi rend="italic">"Edge of the wing"; b,</hi> the "<hi rend="italic">Upper part of the wing"; c,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">"Row of small feathers"; d, the "Row of long feathers"</hi> The numbering of the feathers begins from the top.</p>
                  </figure>
number; each obverse die has a progressive number following the letter A (Anvil-die). Each reverse a number following the letter P (Punchdie). Each recorded specimen of the same die-combination is lettered <hi rend="italic">a, b, c</hi>, etc. Thus 76 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is
<pb n="22"/>
the specimen in the Cabinet des Médailles in <placeName>Paris</placeName> from the obverse die A 39 and the reverse P 51.</p>
               <p>To show the complete die-sequence all the finest available coins have been illustrated on the plates; in this way it is easier to follow the interlacing of the dies. When two specimens complete each other, both have been illustrated. As all the coins were struck with loose dies, the relative position of the dies has been omitted.<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> The weight of each coin has been noted when available; the results of a Hill-Robinson frequency-table are indicated afterwards.</p>
               <p>The wing of the Pegasos, being the part that shows the greatest variety in shape, is the essential feature of the obverse. An accurate description of it is therefore obligatory to recognize the different dies. As the terms employed may be wrongly interpreted, the cut on the preceding page is necessary.</p>

                  <head>I <hi rend="smallcaps">Period, from 480 to 456</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Although the coins of this period, like the corresponding archaic coins of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, are rare, it will be observed that those here described are very few for so long a time as 24 years. To explain this anomaly we have to consider that before 480 B.C., the normal currency of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> was represented by the Corinthian staters, probably those with the incuse patterns on the reverses. The first autonomous coins with the
<pb n="83"/>
civic initial of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> must have been very few, and, at the beginning, just as a kind of supplementary currency, while the coins of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> were still the principal ones.</p>
                  <p>Several coins of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> have beneath the Pegasos an archaic form of koppa, ♀, that resembles a φ. The tail of the letter instead of beginning from below the O, begins from the upper part and crosses it.<ref target="#CH1-n92a">92a</ref> This peculiar letter was taken by <persName>Babelon</persName> for a φ, and he attributed the coin 1138 in the Jameson collection to Phytia.<ref target="#CH1-n92">92</ref> In the writer's collection, there are two Corinthian staters with the same ♀ on the obverse, coupled with common Corinthian reverses, like Bement 1155.<ref target="#CH1-n93">93</ref> All these coins are certainly of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Jameson's coin, from the same die-combination as another specimen in the writer's collection (XIX, 1)<ref target="#CH1-n94">94</ref> has the reverse from the same die as the Ambracian staters 10 and 11 (Pl. I). Furthermore, in <persName>Mr. E. T. Newell's</persName> cabinet there is another coin attributed to <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n95">95</ref> the φ being "off flan" (Pl. XIX, 2), having the obverse from the same die as that mentioned above, but coupled with the other Ambracian obverse die as 8 and 9 (Pl. I). These three Corinthian coins prove that dies P 5 and P 6 were employed at the same time for Corinthian and Ambracian coins, and therefore we are entitled to conclude that all these coins come from the same mint and that they were no doubt coined at <placeName>Corinth</placeName>.</p>
                  <pb n="84"/>
                  <p>
                     <persName>E. Curtius</persName> in his "Studien zur Geschichte von Korinth"<ref target="#CH1-n96">96</ref> says that <placeName>Corinth</placeName> struck the coins for her colonies at first, but this statement was only conjectural, as he had no ground to support it other than the general likeness of the archaic colonial issues. The above mentioned case seems to confirm his surmise, at least for <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. A close examination of the archaic dies of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and her colonies would probably show that all the archaic colts were struck at <placeName>Corinth</placeName>. They look so much alike that if it were not for the civic initials, they could hardly be distinguished one from the other.</p>
                  <p>We know seventeen Ambracian staters with the reverse from dies P 5 and P 6 and only six Corinthian specimens with the reverse from the same dies; this seems to indicate that these two reverse dies were really made for <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> and only occasionally employed for <placeName>Corinth</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>Probably after the Persian war, to reward the colonies that helped her, <placeName>Corinth</placeName> authorized them to have their own currency, but either because she still wanted to have control of the finances of these colonies or because they had not yet organized mints of their own, it was the mother- city that struck the coins for them.</p>
                  <p>The Pegasos on all the archaic staters is an extraordinary one. The wing is curled and certainly ill adapted for flying, the head is big and very long, and the legs are short. The reverses,
<pb n="85"/>
on the contrary, show beautiful archaic heads of Athena.</p>
                  <p>It is incomprehensible that the same artist who engraved the lovely reverses, could make so bad a Pegasos. <persName>Sir Charles Oman</persName> supposes that this ugly beast was made like that for a set purpose,<ref target="#CH1-n97">97</ref> and that it was probably copied from a well known archaic statue of Pegasos. This ingenious hypothesis would fully explain the above mentioned difference in style of the two sides of these early colts.</p>
                  <p>In all <placeName>Greek</placeName> series, the number of the known reverses is always much greater than that of the obverses, and this is understandable as the obverses were fixed to the anvil, while the reverses were used as a punch and received the blow.<ref target="#CH1-n98">98</ref> Therefore this side wore out sooner and had to be changed more frequently than the other. In this period, on the contrary, we find a very puzzling peculiarity; we know 9 obverses and only 6 reverses. As the deep incuse square leaves no doubt that the Athena type is really the reverse, the reason for this abnormal proportion of dies escapes us.</p>
                  <p>The only hypothesis that could explain it is that for some special reason that we cannot guess, the surviving coins of this period are fewer than in the other series, and we may suppose that a great many other reverses existed which may turn up some day.</p>
                  <div4 xml:id="d210e6884" type="subsection">

                     </head>
                     <p>This group is characterized by having no symbols. Coins 1 and 2 have a lovely archaic head of Athena with the distinctive "archaic smile." Although these heads are a little flat, they are of the best archaic style.</p>
                     <p>The following coins, 3 to 7 (Pl. I), show a more advanced reverse. We no longer find the "archaic smile"; the relief is higher and the necklace is of beads, while before it was only a kind of ribbon.</p>
                     <p>All the obverses of this group are very similar, only the position of the A beneath the Pegasos and other very slight details change from one die to the other. They all look as if they had been made from the same hub.</p>

                  <div4 xml:id="d210e6895" type="subsection">

                     </head>
                     <p>The obverses of coins 8 to 11 show a better proportioned Pegasos and although the general appearance is always kept close to the typical early <hi rend="italic">parasemon</hi> of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, the style is better and more in accordance with Athena's head of the reverses.</p>
                     <p>In this group we see for the first time a symbol. To the left of Athena's head there is an ivy- branch. This has a decorative effect and relieves the bareness of the field; evidently its only object is to embellish.</p>
                     <p>The style of these reverses (P 5 and P 6) is
<pb n="87"/>
exceedingly good, and they are among the best examples of the early Fifth Century art. A peculiarity of these reverses is the earring worn by the goddess, which resembles a bunch of grapes. On several Corinthian staters, of more advanced style, we find a somewhat similar earring.<ref target="#CH1-n99">99</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>As said before, dies P 5 and P 6 are found curiously coupled with Corinthian obverses; on these Pegasos is flying to left—on the Ambracian obverses he is flying to right. This difference was probably necessary in the mint, in order to recognize easily the dies of the colony from those of the mother-country.</p>

                  <head>II <hi rend="smallcaps">Period, from 456 to 426 b.c.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The archaic coinage of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> is generally attributed to the period between the Persian war (480 B.C.) and the end of the war of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> against <placeName>Corcyra</placeName> (432 B.C.). Head and <persName>Babelon</persName> both give these dates, but <persName>Prof. P. Gardner</persName> holds that Head's dates are too late.<ref target="#CH1-n99a">99a</ref> He assumes that these early issues should be dated from 520 to 480 B.C. He supposes there was a great break in the coinage of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> and that between 480 and 425 there were no coins at this mint, which did not again begin to strike pegasi, until after the disaster of Olpai.</p>
                  <p>If we examine the two series of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, we find in the present period a striking peculiarity; almost all the first Corinthian pegasi
<pb n="88"/>
after the archaic period have corresponding Ambracian coins, and the likeness is so great that one is tempted to suppose that the same die-cutters worked for the two mints. The two series are closely parallel, and there is no reason to suppose there was any pause in the coining of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, if this is not found in <placeName>Corinth</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, if during 55 years there were no colts struck in <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, why should we find a coin (Pl. II, 21) muling a reverse of the first period and a reverse of the second? The reverse belongs to the middle of the first period. According to <persName>Mr. Gardner's</persName> dating, it should be dated about 500 B.C. while the obverse, which is not one of the first of this period, should be assigned to about 400-410 B.C. Therefore, if these dates were correct, die A 4 would have been in operation for at least 90 years. But if we take 480 B.C. as the date of the beginning of the Ambracian coinage and 456 B.C. for the beginning of the second period, this muling is easier to understand.</p>
                  <p>The fixing of 456 B.C. for the beginning of this period is suggested by our explanation of the symbol found on the obverses following the archaic colts (cf. p. 91); but even if this symbol does not mean what we suggest, we think that this date may be considered as exact.</p>
                  <p>Gardner's and Head's dates make the transitional style begin at 425 or 432 B.C.; this is certainly too late, if we consider the other branches of <placeName>Greek</placeName> art.</p>
                  <pb n="89"/>
                  <p>The end of this period is 426 B.C.—the date of the Olpai disaster; from then on, <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> is more nearly independent of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, and we no longer find such strikingly similar coins in the two series.</p>
                  <div4 xml:id="d210e6986" type="subsection">
                     <head>
                        <hi rend="italic">Group A</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>In this first group the Pegasos is of a new design. The wing is still curled, but the shape quite different, and, artistically, it is even poorer than the foregoing; but owing to the wings being still curled, it is very likely that this new type of flying-horse is the successor of the archaic one. This issue marks a new epoch in the coinage of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> and may correspond to the fall of <placeName>Aegina</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>As we have already remarked, we find in this group coins that are very like some Corinthian staters; probably at this time the same die-cutters worked in the two mints. This would explain the great similarity of style, design and fabric that we find on these first obverses and on those of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> with the murex-shell beneath the Pegasos.<ref target="#CH1-n100">100</ref> Both issues have exactly the same Pegasos with the civic initials 9 or A under its neck. Generally these are found beneath the body of Pegasos, but on these coins in their place is a symbol—on the Corinthian a murex-shell, and on the Ambracian a complicated symbol that has been hitherto differently interpreted. Owing to
<pb n="90"/>
the poor specimens in the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum, Head could not see what it really was. Describing one coin,<ref target="#CH1-n101">101</ref> he calls it a "rose-bud" and another<ref target="#CH1-n102">102</ref> a "pellet." Imhoof-Blumer, describing his fine specimen, now in <placeName>Berlin</placeName> (12a, Pl. I), explains it as "a serpent over a land-tortoise."<ref target="#CH1-n103">103</ref>
                        <persName>Babelon</persName> in the posthumous portion of his Traité,<ref target="#CH1-n104">104</ref> was the first to see what it really was, viz. "a serpent fighting with a land-tortoise"; but on another coin with the same symbol, he saw only "a coquillage" (a shell).<ref target="#CH1-n45">45</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>What the symbol represents is a serpent coiled round a land-tortoise (Chelonia Græca) and striking at it. This very interesting symbol, found later, but enlarged, on a beautiful stater of Period III, 135, Pl. XII, is too elaborate not to have a special meaning. Evidently it is an historical allusion to some well known struggle, and probably the animals symbolize the fighters.<ref target="#CH1-n105">105</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>We know that the staters of <placeName>Aegina</placeName> were accepted universally and because of their constant type, the turtle, were commonly called the "turtles" (χελῶvαι),<ref target="#CH1-n106">106</ref> in the same way as the Corinthian staters were called the "colts" (πῶλοι), from their type.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> Turtles and colts were strong competitors in the commercial world of the time. This competition and the fact that <placeName>Aegina</placeName> greatly handicapped the development of Corinthian influence and trade in the <placeName>Peloponnesus</placeName> and was a constant menace to her, induced <placeName>Corinth</placeName> to
<pb n="91"/>
side with <placeName>Athens</placeName> in the long fight against <placeName>Aegina</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n107">107</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>When in 456 B.C., <placeName>Aegina</placeName> became tributary to <placeName>Athens</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n108">108</ref> it is most unlikely that the latter would have allowed the striking of the "turtles" which competed with her own "owls," in the commercial market.<ref target="#CH1-n108">108a</ref> The coinage of the "turtles" therefore must have come to a stop at the time. Erichthonios (Ἐριχϑόνιος), son of Hephaistos and Atthis, and pupil of Athena, was the first ruler of Attica after Kekrops and was often represented as a serpent.<ref target="#CH1-n109">109</ref> We may, therefore, assume that a serpent may symbolize Attica or <placeName>Athens</placeName>. If so, the symbol we find on the Ambracian staters may be an allusion to the ending of the Aeginetan coinage, as a consequence of the conflict between <placeName>Athens</placeName> and <placeName>Aegina</placeName>. The serpent Erichthonios, symbolizing <placeName>Athens</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n109a">109a</ref> has a "turtle" (χελώνη)<ref target="#CH1-n108b">108b</ref> in his coils; in other words, through <placeName>Athens</placeName> the "turtles" have come to an end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <placeName>Corinth</placeName> fostered the diffusion of her currency and through her money she held her colonies together and tightened relations with others. She (and therefore her colonies) considered the colts as a kind of national flag, of which they were proud.<ref target="#CH1-n110">110</ref> We can therefore understand that the stopping of the coinage of the "turtles" was an event of the greatest importance both for <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and for her colonies, and a reason for great
<pb n="92"/>
rejoicing. From this moment the "colts," no longer having this competitor, would be able to fly unfettered, passing over the fallen "turtles."</p>
                     <p>If such is not the intended meaning of the symbol, it has certainly been an omen that has proved true, as very few other coins had such a large circulation and such a wide success as the πῶλοι.<ref target="#CH1-n111">111</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>This symbol is very important as it permits us to fix the date of the issues of this period—these coins must have been issued shortly after the stopping of the coinage of <placeName>Aegina</placeName>, about 456 B.C. The reverses P 7 and P 8 of beautiful transitional style are very like the reverse of the Corinthian stater in the Museum of <placeName>Berlin</placeName> illustrated by Oman, the same head of Athena l. without neck-guard, with the same hair in long locks over the neck. Undoubtedly, these reverses are the work of the same artist.</p>
                     <p>The reverses, P 7 and P 8, show a remarkable peculiarity. On the top of Athena's helmet stands a butting bull. There is no doubt that it really stands on the helmet—one can distinctly see that the legs touch the helmet. This anomaly did not attract the attention of numismatists; the bull seems to have been considered as one of the numerous symbols we find in the field near the Athena's head. Head, although he noticed that the bull was standing on the top of the helmet,<ref target="#CH1-n112">112</ref> made no comment; he must have considered
<pb n="93"/>
the abnormal position of the bull as a fancy of the die-cutter; in fact, he placed coin 17<hi rend="italic">a</hi>, Pl. II, near 111<hi rend="italic">c</hi>, Pl. X, just because this last had for a symbol the forepart of a butting bull.<ref target="#CH1-n113">113</ref> Imhoof-Blumer noticed this peculiarity too, and describing his 12a (Pl. I) says: "taureau se cramponnant au casque" (bull clinging to the helmet).<ref target="#CH1-n114">114</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>Die P 9 on coin 14 (Pl. II), now published for the first time, from the only known specimen in the writer's cabinet, shows a similar butting bull, but in an even more extraordinary position. It stands no longer on the top of the helmet, but is butting vertically downwards, on the neck of the Goddess. Its hind-feet are on the lower edge of the helmet and the left fore-foot touches the neck-guard.</p>
                     <p>If we compare the dies P 7 and P 9 it is evident that the bull is not an ordinary symbol; it does not stand alone in the field, but is an integral part of Athena's helmet. On the other hand, its very strange position, once on the top and once almost falling off it, suggests the idea that this bull is walking about on the helmet. It must represent some local legend about Athena that we have not been able to trace.</p>
                     <p>This same coin, 14, shows for the first time a neck-guard under the helmet, which afterwards is constantly met, with but few exceptions, on all the staters of Corinthian types. This part of the
<pb n="94"/>
helmet was often called a leather cap; the writer submitted the reasons that seem to prove that it was really a neck-guard, in "Notes on some rare and unpublished Pegasi of my collection."<ref target="#CH1-n115">115</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dies P 10 and P 11 have for symbol the kerykeion, of which we have already spoken. We shall find it constantly repeated in the following groups.</p>
                     <p>All colts of this period have a deep incuse square.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>Beginning with this group, the Pegasos changes completely—the conventional <hi rend="italic">parasemon</hi> of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and her colonies, the extraordinary animal with curled wing is definitely abandoned. From this moment, the wing is adapted for flying and the body is that of a real horse. We find the same evolution on the corresponding Corinthian issues. The Pegasos we find on die A 14 still shows a certain archaic stiffness; the hind-legs, for instance, remind us of those of the first Pegasoi.</p>
                     <p>No. 21 (Pl. II), the first coin of this group, has a reverse coming from an old die (P 4), that shows traces of long wear as several fractures may be seen. Such anachronistic couplings of dies, although rare, are found sometimes even in other series. <persName>Seltman</persName>
                        <ref target="#CH1-n116">116</ref> explains a similar case observed in the mint of Olympia. We may suppose that the old die, lying idle for years in the mint,
<pb n="95"/>
has been put into use again either by mistake or in order to replace temporarily a broken die. The fact that we know but one specimen from these dies (in <persName>Mr. Newell's</persName> collection) proves that it is something in the nature of an exception.</p>
                     <p>Coin 22 from <persName>Mr. Newell's</persName> cabinet, looks very similar to a Corinthian stater of the same epoch. (Cf. Num. Chr., 1909, Pl. XXVI, 9.) On thé Corinthian coin, the goddess wears earrings and there is a trident turned downwards in the field. Apart from these differences the two coins look very much alike. The same long curls fall down to the back of the neck, from under the helmet, which is without neck-guard, and there is the same long profile. These dies look as though they were made by the same artist.</p>
                     <p>The following coin, 23, in the writer's cabinet, has also a corresponding Corinthian stater. (Cf. Num. Chr., 1909, Pl. XXVII, 13.) On the Corinthian coin the first two curls are longer; this is the only difference.</p>
                     <p>These two Ambracian colts, now published for the first time, not having any visible initial, were placed under "uncertain mints" both in <persName>Mr. Newell's</persName> and in the writer's cabinets, and it is only through the other coins 21 and 24, with the same obverse, that we can attribute them beyond question to the Ambracian mint.</p>
                     <p>The obverses A 16 and A 17 show two beautiful Pegasoi; both are very similar. The horses are
<pb n="96"/>
well proportioned and the wings large and well drawn. The principal difference lies in the size. The sequence is therefore well established with the following coins.</p>
                     <p>Nos. 27 and 28, both known in a single specimen only, have no neck-guard under the helmet, a sure sign that they are among the earliest coins of the series and that they follow 22 and 23. Henceforward, the goddess always wears a neck-guard. The hair of Athena on 27 is treated in the same way as on the previous dies. There are the same long loose locks falling from under the helmet and covering the neck. Nos. 27 and 28 are closely similar and are certainly made by the same die-cutter. They are among the finest staters of Corinthian types.</p>
                     <p>No. 29, Pl. III, in the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum, was placed by Head under <placeName>Dyrrhachium</placeName> (but he was in doubt about this attribution)<ref target="#CH1-n117">117</ref> probably owing to the symbol—the club, generally found on coins of this mint. Even if the obverse, A 17, was not coupled with the two reverses P 16 and P 17, the style of them is so alike that there can be no doubt that they both belong to <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>Another similar specimen, No. 30, Pl. III, but from slightly different dies, now in the writer's collection, was also attributed to <placeName>Dyrrhachium</placeName> in the Naville XII catalogue, following the catalogue of the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum. The club is a very exceptional symbol on the Ambracian colts. We
<pb n="97"/>
know of no other attribute of Heracles used as a symbol in all the series. In the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> Cabinet there is a colt from the Prokesch-Osten collection, under <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, with a club behind the Athena's head (Pl. XVII, 1), but this coin belongs to <placeName>Alyzia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n118">118</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of twelve die-combinations out of the thirteen composing this group, we can trace only one specimen of each. They are certainly among the rarest colts of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>

                     <p>This group is connected with the previous one through the Pegasos of die A 22, which is very like the one on dies A 19 and A 17, though details differ. Die A 22 and A 23 are very similar, and we find them coupled with several quite different reverses. Not only do the symbols vary on these reverses, but the design and the style are also quite different.</p>
                     <p>In this group, too, we find a coin having a striking likeness to the contemporary Corinthian issue. Die P 27 shows an Athena's head, wearing a wreathed helmet, very similar to the head on the Corinthian Pegasos in <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, illustrated by <persName>Prof. Oman</persName> in Num. Chron., 1909, Pl. XXVII, 16. This olive wreath which appears now for the first time either in <placeName>Corinth</placeName> or in <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, is often met in the next period.</p>
                     <p>After a time, die A 23 shows traces of wear, and
<pb n="98"/>
in some places fractures begin of which the progression can be followed. On some specimens the alteration is so great that the shape of the Pegasos' head seems changed. The sequence of the types can therefore be established with great certainty.</p>
                     <p>Coin 34, Pl. III, shows an obverse struck from a very fresh die and a reverse P 22, which is an exact copy of die P 10 of Period II. This coin is certainly the first of the group.</p>
                     <p>Coin 36, Pl. III, is known only from the specimen in the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum where it is placed under "Uncertain mints."<ref target="#CH1-n119">119</ref> This coin finds its right place in this group, the obverse being from die A 22. The style and the general appearance are those of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, and <persName>Babelon</persName> had correctly ascribed it to this mint.<ref target="#CH1-n120">120</ref> The symbol on this coin is a remarkable one; we never come across it at <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> again. It represents a sword in its scabbard.</p>
                     <p>The kerykeion is found again in this group on dies P 27 (a copy of die P 11), P 23, P 29 and P 26. On this last one of the best style we find an Athena's head of serene beauty. Behind it, in the field, there is a symbol that although really only a kerykeion, is of a very complex and elaborate shape. To the writer's knowledge it is quite unique and hitherto unpublished. This symbol is formed of a kind of circle, with twelve pellets disposed round it, in four groups of three each, forming four corners outside it. The
<pb n="99"/>
kerykeion crosses this wreath vertically and near the shaft, inside the circle, there are two more pellets on each side of it. What this symbol may mean is rather difficult to conjecture. Only four coins are known with it and on one only (in <placeName>Berlin</placeName>) is it possible to see it distinctly, which may account for the fact that nobody has noticed it before.</p>
                     <p>Another beautiful reverse, of very good style, is P 28 (Pl. IV). On it, we see a remarkable little flying Nike; at first sight we would be justified in supposing she is crowning Athena's helmet. Grose, in describing the specimen in the McClean collection, takes the Nike for a flying Eros and supposes the coin to be the same as 120 (Pl. XI). The lovely flying figure is certainly a Nike—the confusion is due to the McClean specimen being very poor. What the Nike holds in her hand is not a wreath, but a kind of knotted fillet, outstretched in a straight line in front of her.</p>
                     <p>Babelon in "Mélanges et Documents"<ref target="#CH1-n120a">120a</ref> speaks of similar fillets. He illustrates some coins of Sicyon with the flying dove carrying a fillet in its beak (Fig. 6, 7), and others with a naked youth holding the same fillet over his head (Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). He quotes Fougères' definition,<ref target="#CH1-n120a">120a</ref> which says that these fillets were made of knotted wool. Similar fillets are found tied on the top of the obelisk of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> on the staters 177 to 180 (Pl. XVI). Some coins of Croton (Cf.
<pb n="100"/>
Head, Hist. Num., p. 96, fig. 53 and 54) represent a tripod adorned with fillets. One (fig. 54) has two fillets hanging from the Tripod; on one side is Apollo and on the other, the Python. The other (fig. 53) shows only one fillet tied to the handle of the tripod and the lower end of it raised. There is no doubt that both coins reproduce the Delphic tripod; and the raised end of the fillet on the second coin is certainly meant to indicate that it was dangling in the wind that blew from the crevice over which the tripod stood in the Adyton.</p>
                     <p>All these coins reproduce the Delphic fillet, which was probably made of wool or of another similar material, but always very light, as the wind was able to sway it.<ref target="#CH1-n120b">120b</ref> The shape is always the same; it is a cord with a long series of balls or knots, without any space between them and ending with a tassel, probably of the same material. The fillet that the Nike holds on the Ambracian colt is quite different. It is exactly the same as the one we find in front of the Apollo's head, on the beautiful tetradrachm of Catana, by Euainetos (Cf. <persName>B. M. C. Sicily</persName>, No. 55). It is formed of a cord or ribbon with four pellets and ends in a bell-like object, probably metallic. On a stater of Velia by ΦΙΛΙΣΤΙΩΝ, there is a Nike very similar to the one on the Ambracian colt flying to left, over the lion; she holds in her hands an object that was taken for a wreath, but Poole doubted it was really one.<ref target="#CH1-n121">121</ref> On the very
<pb n="101"/>
fine specimen in the collection of <persName>Mr. E. S. G. Robinson</persName>, who kindly allows me to illustrate it (Pl. XVIII, 3), we can distinctly see that this Nike holds the same outstretched fillet.</p>
                     <p>This fillet is not supposed to have been made of a rigid material; it is a cord, a ribbon or a chain, and this is confirmed by the Catanian coin, where it encircles Apollo's profile, conforming to the shape of the die. But if this fillet is not rigid, how could the Nike possibly hold it in a straight line in front of her while she is flying? In the flight it would naturally slant toward her and not precede her. On the coins of Sicyon, illustrated by <persName>Babelon</persName> (figs. 6 and 7), the flying dove holds a fillet in its beak which falls in the logical position that a ribbon or cord would take when carried.</p>
                     <p>To explain this abnormal position, we need not suppose that the die-cutter was ignorant of the laws of gravity. The fact that two coins, of different dates, and of places so far apart as <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> and Velia, show this same strange position, is evidence of a set purpose. The only possibility is that Nike is swinging the fillet to and fro, during her flight, just as the incensorium is swung in the Roman Catholic Church. We may conjecture therefore that the die-cutter reproduced such a swinging movement.</p>
                     <p>This leads to the supposition that this fillet may be a swinging θνμιατήριον or incense-burner, the
<pb n="102"/>
bell-like ending being the burner. The existence of such thymiateria is known; and in the Museum of <placeName>Naples</placeName> there is a specimen formed by a box-like burner, hanging to a chain, very similar to the incensorium.<ref target="#CH1-n122">122</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the writer's collection there is another colt, but of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> (Cf. B. M. C., No. 334), on which, next to Athena's head, there is a flying Nike carrying a thymiaterion. We may deduce that this Nike is burning incense in honour of Athena, just as the Nike on the Ambracian coin does over the head of the Goddess. The only difference between the two would be that one Nike uses a standing thymiaterion and the other a swinging one.</p>
                     <p>Several colts of Anactorion have as symbol a thymiaterion and fillet. They all belong to the same epoch, and Imhoof-Blumer describes them under 96, 97, 98.<ref target="#CH1-n123">123</ref> These three coins are illustrated on Pl. XIX, 4, 5 and 6. The following cuts show the symbols on these coins enlarged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the usual thymiaterion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is a thymiaterion too, but with four knobs on the rod and a kind of flower-like burner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is the so-called fillet. On one end there is a ring to hold it, the same knobs are on the string; and at the lower end there is the same flower-like burner.</p>
                     <p>It is very likely that all these represent thymiateria, but of differing shapes. The only
<pb n="103"/>
distinction is that <hi rend="italic">b</hi> has a pedestal and is therefore a standing thymiaterion, while <hi rend="italic">c</hi> has a ring to hold it and is therefore a swinging one. The latter is the one we see Nike swinging over the helmet of Athena on the die P. 24. Several reverses of this
<figure xml:id="fig-4">

                        </figure>
group are beautiful specimens of the art of the Fifth Century, as P 26 and P 28, but coupled with the same obverse A 23, we find the reverse P 29 (Pl. IV) that shows a head of Athena that is really extraordinary for this period. If it were not coupled with the same obverse, nobody would have thought it could belong to the Fifth Century. This head is of the most awkward style, the eye bulgy, the chin large and the neck-guard too big for the helmet. If we were guided by style only in establishing the chronology of issues, this coin might be placed nearly a century after the staters, Nos. 38, 39 and 40.</p>
                     <pb n="104"/>
                     <p>The difference of style is such that we cannot suppose die A 23 had laid idle in the mint and then been used again. Besides the following die, P 30 (Pl. IV), although slightly better, shows a remarkable likeness of style; evidently the same die-cutter made the two dies—we can still see the same protruding eye and the same clumsy manufacture. Obverse A 24 coupled with this die, is practically identical with A 23, and only minute details permit us to see that it is another die.</p>
                     <p>Coin 42 is therefore not a chance coupling with an old die, but a coin that really belongs to this group. Consequently dies P 29 and P 30 are evidently the work of an unskilled die-cutter who followed good artists in the mint of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. This proves how misleading it is to rely on style alone in establishing the chronological sequence of an issue, and confirms once more the desirability of study of the die combinations.</p>
                     <p>A remarkable symbol is found on coin 43. It represents the sacred conical stone (βαιτύλιον) of the Apollo Ἀγυιεύς who was worshipped in <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n124">124</ref> We again find this obelisk of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, on the last silver issue of the mint, and afterwards it becomes the principal type of the bronze coins.<ref target="#CH1-n125">125</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>On coin 43 c in the Museum of <placeName>Athens</placeName>, there is a sort of crescent over the obelisk; probably it is accidental, as in all other particulars it corresponds to die P 30.</p>

                  <p>After the disaster of Olpai, <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> made a truce of one hundred years with her neighbours, the Amphilochians, and through not taking any direct part in all the wars that went on in Greece, she soon recovered from her losses and reestablished her former flourishing condition. This is proved by her beautiful coinage. The present period begins with the peace with the Akarnanians and ends with the fall of <placeName>Athens</placeName>, in 404 B.C.</p>
                  <p>Although we have no direct proofs, knowing that <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> was always faithful to the mother- city, we may suppose she stood by <placeName>Corinth</placeName> in the great war against <placeName>Athens</placeName>, whose fall must have been particularly pleasing to the Ambracians, and worthy of being recorded on an issue of coins. The wreathed staters that close this period may have been issued to commemorate this event.</p>

                     <p>In this group, we find some obverses on which the Pegasos is of very poor style. If it were not for the reverses P 29 and P 30, we would be rather at a loss to place them in sequence. A 26, Pl. IV, especially, shows a Pegasos that is a very ugly beast with thick legs and completely out of drawing. Evidently it is the work of the die-cutter responsible for P 29 and P 30. The very bad style of these dies may be explained by the hypothesis
<pb n="106"/>
that after the disaster of Olpai, the mint was obliged to employ a poor die-cutter, the only one they had at hand in that moment of crisis. The sequences of dies is surely established, the Pegasoi look all more or less related to each other, although of better style than A 26. A 25 stands alone, but the reverse coupled with it is P 31 that is generally found with A 26 and A 27.</p>
                     <p>Two obverse dies, A 27 and A 28, are found coupled with die P 26 which belongs to the previous group.</p>
                     <p>A remarkable peculiarity of this group is that there is no civic letter on the obverses, while in Period II there is always the A beneath the Pegasos. All the reverses have the same symbol, the kerykeion.</p>

                     <p>This group is connected with the previous one through A 31, which is very similar to A 29.</p>
                     <p>All the coins of this group show a deep incuse square, which is a sign of archaism. This technical peculiarity is abandoned in the following groups. Like the obverses of group A those of this group, too, have no civic letter beneath the Pegasos.</p>
                     <p>The reverses are all very similar, save for the change in symbols. We find a strung bow, an ivy- leaf, a running hound and a crane. They seem to be merely ornamental and are all placed in the
<pb n="107"/>
same way in front of the Athena's head. Owing to these symbols and to the omission of the civic initial under the Pegasos, several coins of this group have been attributed to other mints. No. 54 was ascribed by Imhoof-Blumer to <placeName>Alyzia</placeName>, because of the bow that is generally found on these coins, and No. 57 to <placeName>Argos</placeName> because of the dog.</p>
                     <p>Babelon repeats these attributions, but it escaped his attention that he was placing exactly the same coins under <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> too, when he was speaking of the specimens of the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum described by Head under this mint. This case is an interesting evidence in favour of the study of the die-combinations; and a glance at Pl.

                     <p>Although between groups <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> there are no direct links, the peculiarity of the missing civic initial on the obverses is enough to show that the two groups are related, as afterwards this A appears again; besides, we still find a very deep incuse square on some coins. The first obverse of this group A 32 (Pl. V) shows a Pegasos with a wing that is partly effaced—only the ends of the feathers can be seen. The second, on the contrary (A 33), shows the wing formed of three feathers in very high relief. One might be

tempted to think that the die has been awkwardly recut.</p>
                     <p>Reverse P 41 has a symbol representing a human figure. It is placed in front of the helmet and seems either to climb over it or to dance in front of it.</p>
                     <p>Reverse P 42 shows the same figure, but larger and better modelled. On this we can see a small tail. It therefore represents a Satyr.</p>

                     <p>The link between this group and the preceding is coin 64 (Pl. VI). The reverse P 43 is very like P 42. The style is identical, Athena's head and the symbol, again a little human figure, are of the same technique.</p>
                     <p>The Pegasoi on obverses A 35 and A 36 are radically different. Coin 65 (Pl. VI) is the coupling of dies A 35/P 44; we find coin 66 from dies A 35/P 43, P 43 being the previous reverse. This coin 65 has an owl for a symbol, and it is very likely that the other coins with the same symbol and coupled with obverse A 36 and A 37 belong to the same issue. Die P 43 has a remarkable symbol—a naked winged male figure, holding a taenia in his hands—can this be Eros? The other symbols are all apotropeia; the owl (Athena noctua), the fly and the crab.</p>

                     <p>The first obverse of this group, A 38, has exactly the same Pegasos as 39; it is merely smaller. Although the reverses are quite different, there is no doubt that coins 75 and 76 are closely related.</p>
                     <p>Reverse, P 50, is very interesting; a similar wreath of ivy leaves is found on a coin of Leucas (B. M. Cat. Pl. XXXIV, 15). Probably 75 inspired the coin of Leucas. The obverses A 39 and A 40, instead of having only the civic A, have AM beneath the Pegasos; and the reverses coupled with them have no longer the A only, but the full ethnic, AM or ΑΜΠ.</p>
                     <p>Coin 76 has the ethnic for the first time but retrograde. This inscription prompted Head to place the coin immediately after the archaic issues.<ref target="#CH1-n126">126</ref> This retrograde ethnic cannot be considered as a sign of archaism. It is more probable that it was made so because the die-cutter was not used to engraving inscriptions; the omega instead of omicron confirms it.</p>
                     <p>Coin 77, of which we know one specimen only, has a spike-fish as a symbol; it is possible to recognize its species. Probably it represents the Scorpena porcus that is still common in the Gulf of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>Coins 78 and 80 have reverses that seem different but are probably the same die. In front of the Athena's head P 53 has ΑΜΠ and P 54 AM and in the place of Π, a locust.</p>

                     <p>On the plate is illustrated the <placeName>Paris</placeName> specimen 80 c, but this is very poor and the locust looks like a flaw. Only on 79 in the de Sartiges collection can one distinctly see that P 53 and P 54 are probably the same die, on which a locust has been cut over the Π.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>This group is composed of three obverses that show very minute differences, the first two reverses coupled with A 41 still show a very deep incuse square—indeed, P 55 has a linear frame within the incuse square, and this is quite exceptional in the Ambracian series. Some of the reverses coupled with the same A 41, have, on the contrary, no trace at all of an incuse square: these have a wreath of laurel leaves round the Athena's head. The deep incuse square that we find on the first two coins of this group, 81 and 82 (Pl. VII), disappears completely afterwards. We may therefore infer that all these coins have been issued at about the time when the habit of making the reverse-dies on a square punch was abandoned.</p>
                     <p>It seems that the incuse square on <placeName>Greek</placeName> coins generally ceases after 400 B.C. Naturally it still remains on those coins that are deliberately made to look archaic.<ref target="#CH1-n127">127</ref> Regling brings down this date to the beginning of the fourth century.<ref target="#CH1-n128">128</ref>

                     <pb n="111"/>
                     <p>M. Vlasto, in his recent exhaustive study of the coinage of <persName>Alexander</persName>, son of <persName>Neoptolemos</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n129">129</ref> expresses the opinion that the above-mentioned wreathed staters may have been issued as a tribute to <persName>Alexander</persName>, during his stay in <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, before he sailed for <placeName>Italy</placeName> in 334 B.C. He bases his hypothesis chiefly on the symbol, the thunderbolt, which was the Molossian signet. In the first place we know that the mint of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> was closed in 338 B.C., therefore the coins would not have been issued after this date. Furthermore, all the coins of this group share the same obverses, and are therefore contemporary, so if we accept <persName>M. Vlasto's</persName> dating for the wreathed staters, we should have to bring down the coins with the incuse square to about the same date, which is certainly impossible.</p>
                     <p>Besides, if the thunderbolts on the staters with the wreath are similar to the Molossian badge, those on the two coins with the incuse square are certainly very different. Both parts of the thunderbolt on the Molossian coins are the same, while on the Ambracian dies P 55, P 56 and P 57 one part is formed by two volutes curled outwards and three waved flame-lines; the other part is shaped like a lily-bud. These thunderbolts look more like those we find on some coins of Olympia.<ref target="#CH1-n130">130</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our hypothesis is that the wreathed staters were probably struck to commemorate an im-
<pb n="112"/>
portant victory. The only event that can have left such a mark on the Ambracian currency is the fall of <placeName>Athens</placeName>. Although this was certainly not an Ambracian victory, the fact that this colony was always very closely related to the mother- city, and probably helped <placeName>Corinth</placeName> in the great war, explains that the Ambracians may have considered it as their own victory too. The grudge <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> must have had against <placeName>Athens</placeName> owing to the terrible defeat inflicted upon her by the Athenian <persName>Demosthenes</persName>, fully justifies her rejoicing at the fall of <placeName>Athens</placeName>, an event worth commemorating with an issue of coins.</p>
                     <p>We have already seen that the wreathed staters, 84, 85 and 86, have the obverses from the same die A 41, which is found coupled with the reverses still showing the incuse square, and that this disappears completely afterwards. All these coins must therefore have been issued at about 400 B.C., the date generally accepted for discontinuing the square punch for the reverses. This date would permit the belief that the wreath of laurel-leaves may commemorate the fall of <placeName>Athens</placeName>, and therefore we suggest for the end of this period the date of 404 B.C.</p>
                     <p>Coins 83 and 87 have a very small <hi rend="smallcaps">K</hi> between the thunderbolt and the helmet. This letter is so small that it can be seen on very fine specimens only. The size of the letter may suggest that it is the signature of an artist; this would be the first instance of a signed Ambracian colt.</p>

                  <p>After the end of the Peloponnesian war we know of no other event that might have left marks on <placeName>Ambracia's</placeName> coinage. Fixing the end of Period IV as 360 B.C. is more for the sake of convenience than because of any historical data.</p>
                  <p>In all the former periods, the symbols, with a few exceptions, are simple and inconspicuous. In this period many of them, especially in groups <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi>, are statuesque in form, and often on a comparatively large scale.</p>
                  <p>Neither in the coinage of the mother-city, nor in that of her colonies, do we find a series that can be compared with the colts of this period.

                     <p>The first obverse of this class, A 44, is found coupled with seven reverses. They differ considerably in style, and if the sequence of the dies did not prove it, one would not think they belonged to the same issue.</p>
                     <p>This obverse A 44 after the first two coins 90 and 91 (Pl. VII), begins to show small flaws under the Pegasos. Two small linear flaws near the A transform this letter in some cases, to a sign that
<pb n="114"/>
is very similar to the monogram of Anactorium,<ref target="#CH1-n131">131</ref> This coincidence accounts for the attribution by Head of coins 93 and 94 to the mint of Anactorium. For the same reason in the Cat. Hirsch, XXX, our 92 and in Cat. <persName>Egger</persName>, 1908, our 93 are given to the same mint.</p>
                     <p>Before noticing that these coins, 93 and 94, had their obverses from the same dies as other Ambracian staters, their general appearance and the large civic initial, the archaic A of peculiar shape, so characteristic of the Ambracian coins,<ref target="#CH1-n132">132</ref> prompted placing them under the coins of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>On coins 90, 91, 93, 94, 95 and 96, we find for the first time letters in addition to the civic initial. This is exceptional in the Ambracian mint and it is not clear what these letters mean. If they were magistrates' initials one does not understand why they should be only on these six reverses coupled with the same obverse die A 44. And why are they of different sizes and placed all round Athena's head? They look as if they did not belong to one name, but to different words.</p>
                     <p>On die P 61 under the Goddess' chin there is Δ, and behind the head <graphic url="NNM37_054.jpg"/>.</p>
                     <p>On die P 64 under truncation of neck AH, and over the helmet, to left, <graphic url="NNM37_056b"/>.</p>
                     <p>On die P 65 under the neck HA, and over the helmet the same large <graphic url="NNM37_056b.jpg"/>.</p>
                     <p>On dies P 66 and 67 before the civic initial,

almost in connection with it, a retrograde N.</p>
                     <p>The large <graphic url="NNM37_056b.jpg"/> situated opposite the civic A of about the same size, is certainly not a sigma but a M and belongs to the ethnic.</p>
                     <p>We have already found on die P 57 a small K that may be a signature initial, but the only ground to support this hypothesis is the size of the letter. But now on dies P 61, P 62 and P 65, we find a very minute A which is certainly the initial of an artist's signature.<ref target="#CH1-n131">131</ref> In this case there is not only the size to support this statement. The other letters on the coins, besides the civic initial, prove that it could not be a magistrate's initial. And the position chosen by the die-cutter for this small A, once in the folding of the neck-guard (P 61 and P 62) and once under the elbow of the little figure of Pan (P 65), leaves no doubt that it is really the signature of an artist.</p>
                     <p>These two A's are so small that they are hardly visible on the plate.</p>
                     <p>The symbol on P 63 generally described as a locust is really a cricket (<hi rend="italic">Grillus campestris</hi> or <hi rend="italic">domesticus</hi>); the size of the head and thorax and the short elytrae, make it easy to distinguish this insect.</p>
                     <p>The branch on P 64 was described by Head as a climbing plant,<ref target="#CH1-n133">133</ref> and by <persName>Babelon</persName> as an ivy-branch.<ref target="#CH1-n134">134</ref> But coin 176 (Pl. XVI) proves by the flower that this is a kind of thistle.</p>

                     <p>The Pan symbols on these coins prove that his cult was held in honour in <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, probably owing to herding of sheep and goats in the country.<ref target="#CH1-n136">136</ref>

                     <p>The link between the former group and this is given by coins 98 and 99. These have the reverses from dies P 64 and P 65 that belong to Group A, but have an obverse die A 46 that we find afterwards coupled with reverses P 68 and P 69 of quite different style and that have always been considered as belonging to an earlier epoch.<ref target="#CH1-n137">137</ref> That the sequence of dies P 64, P 65, P 68, P 69 is correct, is proved by the wear of die A 46. When coupled with P 65, it is fresh and the A beneath the Pegasos distinctly visible, when with P 68 and P 69, on all the 15 specimens we know, it is more or less effaced, and on some, of very good preservation, one would hardly suspect it ever existed.</p>
                     <p>It is certain therefore that the reverses of this group follow those of group A.</p>
                     <p>All these reverses show a constant type of Athena's head, which is of a peculiar style. The eye of the goddess is almond shaped and almost full-face, the neck-guard large and rounded.</p>
                     <p>They have an archaic aspect which is not in
<pb n="117"/>
accordance with the other details of a more advanced style.</p>
                     <p>Some earlier Leucadian staters<ref target="#CH1-n139">139</ref> show exactly the same head of Athena, and we may suppose the Ambracian heads were copied from Leucadian colts, (or vice versa) or that the heads may have been copied independently from a well-known statue or type of Athena. In any event, it is clear that these heads are purposely archaistic.</p>
                     <p>On coin 106 (Pl. X) we find a lovely girl, in a most realistic style, playing at kottabos. The contrast between this charming little figure and the full face eye of the goddess is striking. A great contrast of style exists too between the two sides of the coins of this group. Dies P 68 and P 69 are first found coupled with the above mentioned A 46, which shows a very poorly modelled Pegasos. The body is long and thin, the neck too long for the small head, and the extraordinarily long tail is almost as long as the body of the horse.</p>
                     <p>The other obverses improve by degrees and A 49 is the best of all. On this we find for the first time an A on the hind-quarters of the Pegasos. As we find beneath it the civic initial A, we are justified in supposing that this A may be an artist's signature, probably the same that made the beautiful reverses of this group.</p>
                     <p>We know only coin 108 with this obverse. This coin now in the writer's collection passed through two sales (Hirsch XXXI, and Naville VI) and
<pb n="118"/>
nobody noticed this peculiarity, although the A is very distinct.<ref target="#CH1-n140">140</ref> The dies of this group interchange frequently and thus establish the chronological sequence of the coins.</p>
                     <p>A remarkable peculiarity of this group is that almost all reverses have the ethnic inscribed at full length, but the variations of its spelling are surprising.</p>
                     <p>On die P 68 and P 69 there is:</p>
                  </div4>
               </div3>
               <div3 xml:id="d210e7758" type="subsection">

                  <p>On dies P 70 and P 73 the omicron is replaced by omega, and on die P 71 the B replaces the Π.</p>
                  <p>On die P 84 (Pl. XI), which we now find coupled with two obverses belonging to the following group but which we are convinced will be found some day coupled with the same obverses belonging to the present group, we read: ΑΜΠΡΑΚΙΩΤΑΝ, but the Π on coin 124 is larger and heavier than the other letters, and it looks as if it had been recut over another letter, probably B.</p>
                  <p>It is not easy to explain this variation in spelling on coins that are so similar. Dies P 68, P 69 and P 70 are certainly made by the same artist and dies P 71 and P 84 by another—Imhoof-Blumer remarked that these two last are probably the work of the same die-cutter.<ref target="#CH1-n141">141</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>We might suppose that this group of reverses was issued at the time of the change of the archaic O to Ω, but as we have on an earlier coin the full
<pb n="119"/>
retrograde ethnic spelled ΑΜΠΡΑΚΙΩΤΑΝ (76, Pl. VII), we are inclined to believe that the omicron intentionally replaces the omega on these two dies in order to be more in keeping with the archaistic head of Athena.<ref target="#CH1-n141a">141a</ref> Cousinéry had noted the use of B and Π on these coins, and he explains it.<ref target="#CH1-n142">142</ref> As there is only one die with B, and another, probably by the same artist, with a Π that seems to be cut over another letter, we may be justified in supposing that this B was a mistake of the die-cutter, who corrected it afterwards on another die.<ref target="#CH1-n143">143</ref> The mistake is easily comprehensible if we consider that the Π is pronounced nearly as B after M.</p>
                  <p>The first three symbols we find on the coins of this group, are the tripod, the lyre (chelys) and the flaming-torch. All three are attributes of Apollo Ἄκτιος, who was jointly worshipped by the Akarnanians and the Ambracians, in the famous temple of Aktion. He was considered as the protector of navigation,<ref target="#CH1-n144">144</ref> and therefore it was quite natural that <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> who owed her wealth chiefly to her commercial fleet, should honour Apollo Ἄκτιος.</p>
                  <p>The flaming-torch is not a usual symbol of Apollo,<ref target="#CH1-n144a">144a</ref> but on a coin of Akarnania,<ref target="#CH1-n145">145</ref> we see Apollo seated on a rock, and in front of him a flaming-torch, and this Apollo is undoubtedly the Apollo Ἄκτιος. The symbol is therefore not only an attribute of Apollo, but it proves that the coins
<pb n="120"/>
were issued under the protection of the God worshipped in Aktion.</p>
                  <p>Die 71 shows a symbol, that is one of the most remarkable and interesting that we find on a stater of Corinthian types.</p>
                  <p>Helbig has explained that the charming girl standing near the pole, is playing at kottabos.<ref target="#CH1-n146">146</ref> Head repeats this explanation, and says that the girl is balancing the scale or πλάστιγξ on the point of the rod that the players may throw their wine at it. Half way up the rod is a basin κοττάβειον to catch the wine, or perhaps the scale itself as it fell on being struck by the successful thrower.<ref target="#CH1-n147">147</ref> Imhoof-Blumer describes a vase where there is a maenad in the same attitude as the girl on the Ambracian colt, between two dancing satyrs who take part at the game with cups in their hands. He believes that the girl represents a nymph.<ref target="#CH1-n148">148</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The exquisite modelling of the girl, the graceful movement of her body and the pose of her lifted head, make of this charming little figure a real master-work. The contrast between this realistic figure and the conventional Athena's head is striking, as we have already observed, and is evidence that the coin cannot be placed at an earlier period.</p>
                  <p>Reverse P 74 on coin 111 (Pl. X) has an Athena's head similar to all the others of this group. The eye is still full-face. The symbol, the fore-part of a butting-bull, prompted Head<ref target="#CH1-n149">149</ref>
                     <pb n="121"/>
to connect this coin with 12 (Pl. I) of the second period, the butting-bull on top of Athena's helmet. The type of the Athena, and the obverse which is only a reduction of those preceding, are sufficient proofs that the coin belongs to this group.</p>
                  <p>No. 113, one of the last of the group, is rather a puzzling coin. If it were not that the obverse is from die A 52, the same found on 111 and 112, it would certainly not be placed here. The head of Athena is of a quite different style and the incuse square would indicate that this die belongs to an earlier period. But all the known specimens are found coupled with the obverse A 52; and although the coin is one of the most common colts of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, of which fifteen specimens are recorded, they all come from the same pair of dies.</p>
                  <p>To explain this anachronistic reverse, we may postulate that the die was made at an earlier epoch, and for some reason discarded or put aside. After a long time, in a moment of great need, the available dies being insufficient—perhaps to replace a broken die—it was used for the first time and in conjunction with the obverse-die in use at the moment. The symbol on this coin probably represents the prow of the vessels Argo (Ἀργώ) or Pelias (Πηλιάς), made from wood taken by Athena from the holy oak of Dodona, in which the sacred doves (πέλειαι) nested. It may therefore be considered as a totem of them.<ref target="#CH1-n150">150</ref>

                     <p>The three obverses of this group A 53, A 54 and A 55 are of the best style. The prancing Pegasos is well proportioned, the wing large and well drawn and in keeping with the beautiful reverses. The last two have an A on the Pegasos' hindquarters, such as we already found on die A 49, but the civic initial is no longer on the obverse. On the first die A 53, this A is not visible, but as this letter can be seen on very fine specimens only, and as our only examples so far have a rather worn obverse, it is highly probable that this die too has the same initial in the same place, the more so, that the other die A 56<ref target="#CH1-n151">151</ref> shows also the same letter on the Pegasos' hind-quarters.</p>
                     <p>All these obverses have no letter beneath the Pegasos. It is therefore possible that the civic initial has only changed its place in copying die A 49 on which it probably represented the artist's signature.</p>
                     <p>The link that relates group B to the present one is given by coins 106 and 115, which have reverses from die P 71 with the beautiful girl playing at kottabos. The sequence of the coins of this group is well established as the dies interchange frequently. We can trace the progression without interruption.</p>
                     <p>These colts are certainly the finest among all the staters of Corinthian types, and they are of
<pb n="123"/>
the greatest interest for the variety and importance of the symbols, which should no longer be called symbols, but, rather, Ambracian types, added to the conventional Corinthian types of the Pegasos and Athena's head.</p>
                     <p>The girl playing at kottabos is the first of these Ambracian types; the second is a very important one, representing the historical founder of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. Only two specimens are known with this reverse P 83. One coupled with A 54 was in the Rhousopoulos collection and we do not know where it now is. The other specimen, coupled with A 55, is in the Cabinet des Médailles in <placeName>Paris</placeName> (No. 127, Pl. XI). On this coin there is a fine naked male figure, wearing a conical pilos and supporting himself with a long staff. In front of the Athena head there is the inscription ΓΟΡΓΟΣ—no doubt the name of the hero represented. Owing to the head-gear this figure was taken for a Dioskouros, but <persName>R. Rochette</persName> recognized that it is <persName>Gorgos</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n152">152</ref> son of Kypselos, the leader of the Corinthian colonists. Writers designate this hero in different ways: Torgos, Gordios,<ref target="#CH1-n153">153</ref> Gorgias or <persName>Gorgos</persName>. This last, being on the coin, may be considered the correct one.</p>
                     <p>There is a very striking analogy between Tarentum and <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. In Tarentum the leader of the Lacedaemonian colonists was Phalanthos, the historical oekist of the town.<ref target="#CH1-n154">154</ref> But the mythic, eponymous, native oekist was
<pb n="124"/>
                        <persName>Taras</persName>, the son of <persName>Satyra</persName> and <persName>Poseidon</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n155">155</ref> In <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> the same condition holds. <persName>Gorgos</persName>, like Phalanthos, is the historical founder of the town, while <persName>Ambrax</persName>, son of <persName>Thesprotos</persName>, is the eponymous, native oekist. On the Ambracian colt we find <persName>Gorgos</persName> leaning on a long plain staff<ref target="#CH1-n157">157</ref> (σκῆπτρον), the royal staff, symbolizing his authority over the colony he has founded. On several Tarentine nomoi (Vlasto No. 14) we find Phalanthos with the same symbol of authority.<ref target="#CH1-n158">158</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>Dies P 78 and 78a on coins 116, 123 and 126 have another interesting Ambracian type, a youthful horned male figure, naked, seated on a bull's head. On die P 78a in front of Athena's head there is the inscription ΑΡΑΘΘΟΣ. On die P 78 the inscription is over the seated figure's head; and on specimen 116a in <placeName>Berlin</placeName> we can distinctly read APAT….</p>
                     <p>The two dies, P 78 and P 78a, although they have different inscriptions and are differently placed, are really the same. P 78 is the first state of the die and P 78a is the state after a modification has been made to it. This is proved by coins 126 a (Pl. XI) and 126g (Cf. Bement, 966). On the first, there is a little flaw under the chin of Athena; on the second, the die-break is larger and crosses the inscription, while on no specimen of 116 can we see a flaw. Furthermore, on all well preserved specimens with reverses from P 78a, one can distinctly see faint traces of the inscription above
<pb n="125"/>
the figure; and on specimen 126a, in the writer's collection, one can notice the A of the beginning of the inscription, examining the coin under a tangent light. We may therefore conclude that the inscription on die P 78 being found unsatisfactory, probably because of the mistake in spelling (T instead of Θ), was erased, and the correct one, in front of the Athena head, substituted.</p>
                     <p>Evidently the horned youth represents a rivergod; and since the name inscribed is that of the river flowing through <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, it is obvious that this river-god represents the Arachthos deified.</p>
                     <p>Imhoof-Blumer<ref target="#CH1-n159">159</ref> and Head<ref target="#CH1-n160">160</ref> explain this figure in the same way, but <persName>Babelon</persName>
                        <ref target="#CH1-n161">161</ref> says: "Sur ce statère le nom Ἄpaϑϑος est un nom de magistrat et non point celui du dieu-fleuve Aratthos qui est en symbole derrière la tète de Pallas. L'Aratthos est le flueve qui arrosait Ambracie; le magistrat appelé aussi Aratthos a pris naturellement pour symbole la figure du dieu-fleuve dont il portait le nom."</p>
                     <p>Babelon in this case, preoccupied only in finding a plausible confirmation of the "Magistrates'- signet theory," tried to find a roundabout explanation for the symbol, rather than to see in an objective way, the simple evidence of the name of the river inscribed over the head of the river-god.</p>
                     <p>Coin 128 (Pl. XI), of which we know only the specimen in <persName>Mr. Newell's</persName> collection, shows a winged male figure riding a dolphin. Head<ref target="#CH1-n162">162</ref> and
<pb n="126"/>
Riggauer,<ref target="#CH1-n163">163</ref> describing a later revival, of the same type (Pl. XIV, 150) are of the opinion that the figure represents an Eros, which is only natural as the figure has wings and rides a dolphin. Similar Erotes are often met at later dates. (Cf. <placeName>Berlin</placeName> cat., III, Taf, XIV, 209).</p>
                     <p>The three above mentioned dies, P 78a, P 83 and P 85, have striking analogies of style and composition—on all three the heads of Athena, and the general appearance is exactly the same; and on all three the civic initial is on the bowl of the helmet.</p>
                     <p>The symbols, of the same nature, are real Ambracian types. On the first two, P 78a and P 83, they are treated in the same way and placed similarly. Both dies have names opposite the symbols.</p>
                     <p>The two figures on dies P 78a and P 85 are in an attitude that is peculiar—both are clasping hands round the left knee. There can be little doubt that the three reverses are the work of the same artist.</p>
                     <p>We have seen how similar the reverses P 78 a, P 83 and P 85 are—this last has the winged dolphin-rider in place of <persName>Gorgos</persName> and Arachthos, which are on the other two. If this winged figure represents an Eros it would be out of place between the oekist and the river-god of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. We may therefore infer that he represents a local hero. It would not be surprising if on a more
<pb n="127"/>
complete specimen of 128, we were to find an inscription in front of Athena's face, as with ΓΟΡΓΟΣ on die P 83 and ΑΡΑΘΘΟΣ on die P 78a, which would explain the meaning of the winged dolphin-rider and give us his name.</p>
                     <p>As we have already said,<ref target="#CH1-n164">164</ref> die P 84 (Pl. XI) really belongs to the previous group. Athena's head is exactly the same as on die P 71. The youthful naked male figure, standing with his right hand raised to his head, is very similar to the girl playing at kottabos. Imhoof-Blumer had previously observed this likeness and suggested that the two dies were made by the same die- cutter, which is highly probable. He supposes that this die is a pendant of die P 71 and that the two complete each other. He says that this figure may represent a young Pan looking at the playing nymph.<ref target="#CH1-n141">141</ref> Head considers that it represents an athlete.<ref target="#CH1-n162">162</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the known specimens of this coin were more or less incomplete, the head of the figure always partially off-flan. This accounts for Imhoof-Blumer's and Head's suggestions. The only specimen that shows the complete figure is 125 f, in <placeName>Paris</placeName> (de Rothschild coll.), and this was not known to them. On 125 f, one can see that the handsome youth with long wavy curls wears a Corinthian helmet without crest or neck-guard. His r. hand is raised above the vizor in the attitude of taking off or putting on his helmet. This
<pb n="128"/>
figure may represent the copy of a statue of a local hero.</p>
                     <p>A naked figure with a helmet might represent Ares, but against this attribution is the fact that the god is never associated with Athena, who was known to be his enemy and the only one that could stand against him.<ref target="#CH1-n163a">163a</ref> Besides Ares in this epoch is generally represented either wearing a chlamys, or naked, with a crested helmet and a spear in his hand.</p>
                     <p>Babelon describing coin 125d in the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum says that the obverse has AM under the Pegasos while in reality there is no letter at all, the civic initial being on the hind-quarters, on both dies A 54 and A 55. This error is understandable because in the catalogue of the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum there is no indication at all on the obverses of 5 and 6; and as there is AM under the Pegasos of 4, he thought all three had AM.</p>
                     <p>The reverse from die P 82 on coins 120 and 129 shows a flying Eros (?) binding an olive-wreath round Athena's helmet. <persName>Babelon</persName> places this coin by mistake, under <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and supposes the wreath is of laurel and is meant to commemorate the victory of <placeName>Chaeronea</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n167">167</ref> But afterwards, in the posthumous part of his Traité, he describes the <placeName>London</placeName> specimen and repeats Head's explanation about the olive-wreath.<ref target="#CH1-n168">168</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reverse from die P 81 on coins 119, 131 and 133 has a symbol representing a Gorgon's head
<pb n="129"/>
placed sideways. The tongue instead of being downwards is towards Athena's neck.</p>
                     <p>Although this position is puzzling, the choice of the symbol is quite natural. Probably it is an allusion to the epithet of γοργοφόvος often given to Athena<ref target="#CH1-n169">169</ref> and is employed as a protection against evil influences, the Gorgon's head being known as one of the most powerful ἀποτρόπαια.<ref target="#CH1-n170">170</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>This die P 81 is the only Ambracian die with the civic initial A on the neck guard, the small A we find on coins 90 and 91 in the same place being a signature.</p>
                     <p>Die P 79 shows a bearded hero wearing a conical pilos and armed with sword and shield. Only on the specimen 117g (Pl. X) can this symbol be seen completely. On all others, the shield is partially off-flan, and looks like a bow.</p>

                  <p>As we have already stated, the date for the beginning of the present period is only conjectural. The reverses have still the same kind of Ambracian types for symbols but a new type of Pegasos marks the commencement of the period.

                     </head>
                     <p>The first Pegasos of this group is a new type, and entirely different from all the others of the series. It looks like a "revival" of the archaic Pegasos with curled wing, but instead of flying, he is walking. There is an exergual line. A similar Pegasos is found on a corresponding issue of Corinthian staters, of which we illustrate six specimens on Pl. XIX.</p>
                     <p>These staters were considered as belonging to the fifth century,<ref target="#CH1-n171">171</ref> which is certainly a mistake. The style of the reverses is of much later date, and it is more likely that they, as well as the Ambracian coins of this group, belong to the middle of the fourth century.</p>
                     <p>The archaism of this walking Pegasos is undoubtedly intentional, and is evidently copied from a well-known Corinthian work of art. The style of the Ambracian reverses coupled with die A 57 (Pl. XII) and the following Pegasos with pointed wing that we find on die A 58 coupled with some of the same reverses, proves sufficiently that this archaistic Pegasos belongs to this group. These two Pegasoi although different in design, show a head in the very same pose. On both it is slightly turned to l. and is not quite in profile.</p>
                     <p>The Pegasos on die A 58 (Pl. XIII) shows a remarkable peculiarity found in this and the following group only. The wing is composed of three rows of feathers, one of long and two of small
<pb n="131"/>
feathers. This very characteristic feature permits us to establish the sequence of the following group. Die A 57 after the first coin, 135 (Pl.XII), shows a flaw on the exergual line which is very small on coins 136 and much larger on coins 137 and 138 (Pl. XII). This flaw gives us the possibility of establishing the exact chronological sequence of dies P 86, P 87, P 88 and P 89. Die P 86, the first of the present group is in fact very similar to the previous reverses, with the same kind of Ambracian type; and the obverse coupled with it is fresh and shows that it comes from a new die (see coins 135b and 135i, Pl. XII).</p>
                     <p>Dies P 86 and P 87 are very similar—only the symbols change, but P 88 and P 89 are of completely different style—they look older, and the symbols too are of a simple nature, as we find on earlier coins. Judging only by the appearance, they should have been placed in an earlier period.</p>
                     <p>Coin 135 is a very interesting one, the symbol on the reverse is a real "<hi rend="italic">tableau de genre"</hi> and one of the Ambracian type that we have seen in the previous group. Head,<ref target="#CH1-n172">172</ref> having only the specimen of the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum where half the symbol is off-flan, could not see what it really was and gives therefore the following very ingenious explanation: "Naked male figure, perhaps Ambrax the traditional founder, seated on rocks, while on the other side of the principal type a
<pb n="132"/>
swan swims to the left, this type symbolizing perhaps the city of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, the acropolis of which occupied a rocky height at the foot of which the river Arachthus, indicated by the swan, flowed through a fertile plain towards the Ambracian gulf."<ref target="#CH1-n160">160</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the splendid specimen of the same coin from the Imhoof-Blumer collection, we can distinctly see that what was taken for a swan is really the very same symbol we have already seen on the coins of the second period beneath the Pegasos (Pl. I, 12, 13 and Pl. II, 14 to 20). It represents a serpent coiled round a land-tortoise and striking at it.<ref target="#CH1-n173">173</ref> Head's suggestion that the naked figure represents Ambrax is very probable and the staff that the figure holds in his left hand, a symbol of authority, seems to confirm that this is the mythical oekist of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>We may reconstruct Head's explanation taking into consideration our own exegesis of the symbol wrongly described as a swan. Ambrax, the eponymous oekist of the town, seated, with the staff as symbol of his authority in his hand, is witnessing the destruction of the "turtle" by Erichthonios.</p>
                     <p>The serpent-turtle symbol first appeared on coins issued just after the stoppage of the Aeginetan "turtles." At the time, as we stated, it was probably an allusion to the disappearance of a strong competitor of the "colts" and was a sort of
<pb n="133"/>
prevision of the consequences that this would have on the diffusion of the "colts." It may be surprising to find the same symbol on coins of an epoch in which <placeName>Aegina</placeName> was again striking coins, but before 456 B.C. the "turtles" were almost a Peloponnesian currency and a dangerous competitor of the Corinthian staters, while after the fall of <placeName>Athens</placeName>, the coins of <placeName>Aegina</placeName> were only a local currency, no longer interfering with the Corinthian influence.</p>
                     <p>Coin 136, immediately following the above, has a symbol always described as "Infant Heracles strangling serpents," and it is really surprising that nobody should have noticed there were no serpents to be found in the boy's hands! The mistaking of the serpent-turtle symbol for a swan is quite comprehensible as the symbol is often partly off-flan. The tortoise looks like the back of the swan and the serpent like its neck, but the symbol on coin 136 is always complete, and nothing can be mistaken for serpents, although Head, <persName>Babelon</persName>, Grose and others, seem to have detected them.</p>
                     <p>This plump little boy is certainly not the infant Heracles. He is in a squatting attitude, the right knee slightly higher than the left, as if he were raising himself. With his left hand he supports himself on the ground—his right is raised as if pointing at something.</p>
                     <p>On an Apulian vase in the R. Museum of Bo-
<pb n="134"/>
logna, there is a similar plump boy, with a thyrsos in his right hand; he is in the same squatting attitude.<ref target="#CH1-n175">175</ref> Above him is inscribed Διονύσος,<ref target="#CH1-n174">174</ref> and to the left there is the head of Persephone- Kore. Gerhard<ref target="#CH1-n176">176</ref> illustrated this vase and identified the child as Iacchos, the mystic offspring of Kore.</p>
                     <p>Evans,<ref target="#CH1-n177">177</ref> speaking of a small Tarentine gold coin with a similar boy, but with a distaff in his right hand and a spool of wool in his left, describes the same vase and says that the child on the coin may be regarded as the infantile representation of Taras, and the comparison with the boy on the vase marks the influence of a prevalent Chthonic cult on that of the eponymic founder.</p>
                     <p>Iacchos was often represented as a handsome boy, ὡραῖoς Θ έος,<ref target="#CH1-n178">178</ref> and his place near Athena's head could perhaps be explained by the version that he was saved by Dionysos and given to Athena who nursed him.<ref target="#CH1-n179">179</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>As Gerhard's identification of the boy on the above mentioned vase is generally accepted, we may be justified in thinking that the symbol on the Ambracian stater represents Iacchos; and, if so, it is probably to be connected with the annual Eleusinian festivals.</p>
                     <p>The symbol we find on coins 137, 138, 142 and 143, is an androcephalous bull, full-face and in profile. The head in profile is similar to the
<pb n="135"/>
symbol found on the colts of <placeName>Stratos</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n180">180</ref> which evidently represent the river-god <persName>Acheloüs</persName>. <persName>Oberhummer's</persName>
                        <ref target="#CH1-n181">181</ref> opinion that this head on the Ambracian staters may represent the river-god Aracthos is to be discarded; we have already seen that Aracthos was represented as a youth, while this is the bearded face of an elderly man and therefore certainly an <persName>Acheloüs</persName> head. The cult of this river-god was not localized in the country through which the greatest of the <placeName>Greek</placeName> rivers passed, but was general over all Greece.<ref target="#CH1-n181">181</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <persName>Acheloüs</persName> was not only the river-god, he was also the personification of the liquid element and was therefore an important part of the cult of Dodona,<ref target="#CH1-n182">182</ref> where Zeus had the surname of Náïoς and the oracles delivered there began generally with: Ἀχελώῳ θύειν.<ref target="#CH1-n181">181</ref> We may therefore conclude that these symbols on the Ambracian colts not only represent <persName>Acheloüs</persName>' head, but are closely related to the famous temple of Dodona.</p>
                     <p>The symbol we find on 144 is a flying dove (Pl. XIII); next to it, there is NI. A similar bird is found on two other coins of the series, 148 and 181 (Pl. XIII and Pl. XVI), this last one with the inscription ΝΙΚΟΣΘΗ…. This dove is probably one of the Peleiai (Πέλειαι), the sacred birds of Dodona, that nested in the holy oak. From the flight of these doves, and the places where they perched, the priestess, Peleias, interpreted the oracle of Zeus.<ref target="#CH1-n183">183</ref> This is therefore
<pb n="136"/>
probably another Dodonian symbol employed as an ἀποτρόπαιον.<ref target="#CH1-n184">184</ref>

                     <p>Coins 139 and 140 (Pl. XIII), also have a very interesting symbol—a beautiful little figure of Zeus, striding to right and hurling a thunderbolt. This small Zeus examined under a magnifying glass, shows the most perfect features and anatomy. The well-proportioned body and great accuracy in the smallest details make this a marvellous figure. Few <placeName>Greek</placeName> coins can show so nearly perfect workmanship in such a reduced size.</p>
                     <p>This Zeus is certainly not the creation of the artist who made Athena's head, which, although good, shows certain weaknesses. The helmet is too small for the head and there is a general flatness to the whole. It is probable that he carefully copied the Zeus from a well-known and celebrated work of art. As the previous symbols refer to Dodona, it would not be impossible that this is the statue of the famous Dodonian Zeus.</p>
                     <p>It is regrettable that the best known specimen, illustrated on Pl. XIII, although very good, is not in mint state. If it were, we might perhaps discover round the Zeus' head the wreath of oak- leaves.</p>
                     <p>An argument in favour of our hypothesis is the little bronze found in Dodona and now in the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> Museum.<ref target="#CH1-n185">185</ref> This, although of very rough style shows a Zeus in exactly the same attitude.
<pb n="137"/>
He is striding to right and hurling a thunderbolt with his right hand, while the left is outstretched. Arms and legs are in the same pose. It is possible that this bronze is a rough copy of the same statue. Considering that <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> was on the easiest route to the famous sanctuary of Dodona, while from the coast opposite Corcyra the way was very steep and difficult, and several parallel chains of mountains had to be climbed before reaching the town,<ref target="#CH1-n186">186</ref> it is natural that a continuous flow of pilgrims should have passed through <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> so that she was constantly in contact with Dodona. This would explain the reason for frequently choosing Dodonian symbols for her coins.</p>
                     <p>The two reverses, P 90 and P 97, have heads of Athena that look to be from the same die. The dolphin under the neck of the Goddess and the A over the Zeus are perhaps added afterwards.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>The most interesting coin of this group is that with a naked figure kneeling under the Pegasos, examining its hoof. This obverse A 61 (Pl. XIII), is different from all other obverses of the whole series; it stands quite isolated. We are able to place it here owing to the kindness of <persName>Sir Charles Oman</persName>, who kindly sent me a cast of the remarkable and probably unique stater in his collection, with Pegasos flying over a running
<pb n="138"/>
Chimaera (145, Pl. XIII). This coin is the link between the previous group and the present. The Pegasos on the obverse A 60 is very similar to that on die A 58; the only difference is that one is slightly smaller than the other. Both Pegasoi have their heads and wings of the same shape. As we have already remarked, all wings previously have had only two rows of small feathers—these two have three rows.</p>
                     <p>The Pegasos following on die A 61, although standing instead of flying, is very similar. It has the same head, and the wing is also composed of three rows of small feathers. This would be enough to show that A 60 and A 61 follow each other, but both obverses are coupled with the same reverse, P 94, therefore it is evident that the two coins 145 and 146 belong to the same issue. Coin 145, now published for the first time, has on the obverse as we have noted, a running chimaera under the flying Pegasos. Nos. 146 and 147 have the same obverse, A 61, on which we see, under the standing Pegasos, a little figure holding the right hoof in his hand and examining it.</p>
                     <p>Nowhere else in this series, excepting the coins of the second period with the serpent-turtle symbol on the obverses (Pl. I and II), do we find symbols on the Pegasos die.</p>
                     <p>Dies A 60 and A 61 seem exceptions, but it is evident they are not symbols. Neither the chi-
<pb n="139"/>
maera nor the little figure are independent of the principal type—they are integral parts of the myth of Pegasos. On the first it is obvious that the Pegasos flying over the chimaera is an allusion to the fight of Bellerophon with that monster.</p>
                     <p>The second obverse is less easy to understand and has been interpreted variously. Mionnet thought it represented a satyr, owing to a small tail he imagined he saw.<ref target="#CH1-n187">187</ref> Head described this little figure as a naked youth sitting on a low stool and examining the hoof of Pegasos; he supposed this coin to have been inspired by a contemporary didrachm of Tarentum<ref target="#CH1-n188">188</ref> (Evans type C—Period IV) which has exactly the same figure under the horse. Evans described it as "a naked boy picking a pebble from the horse's hoof."<ref target="#CH1-n189">189</ref>
                        <persName>Babelon</persName>, too, states that the Ambracian colt has been copied from the Tarentine coin, and adds that these kinds of reproductions of types are due to the fancy of the die-cutters or mint-magistrates who <hi rend="italic">"s'en sont fait un jeu et un amusement</hi>."<ref target="#CH1-n190">190</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>The numismatists who have described this coin have had only one or two specimens at their disposal, and as the little figure is very small, and often badly struck or blurred, their descriptions are not always exact.</p>
                     <p>We have carefully examined fourteen casts from the same die, and have ascertained the following points:</p>
                     <pb n="140"/>
                     <p>1. The figure does not represent a boy, but a strong muscular man; and the face, very clear on some specimens, is not that of a boy.</p>
                     <p>2. He has no tail. On some specimens (e.g., 146b) a small tail-like flaw can be seen, but on others (like 147a) this is much larger and can no longer be taken for a tail. On others, again (146d), the flaw does not exist.</p>
                     <p>3. He is not sitting on a stool, but sits on his right heel; the left foot can be seen beneath the right knee.</p>
                     <p>4. He holds the hoof with his left hand, while his right is above it. The attitude is of attentive examination.</p>
                     <p>From these observations we may conclude that the figure is not a satyr or a young boy as on the Tarentine nomos.</p>
                     <p>Babelon's hypothesis of a die-cutter or magistrate amusing himself by imitating another coin that represents <hi rend="italic">"a boy picking a pebble out of a horse's hoof"</hi> is highly improbable—the <placeName>Greek</placeName> mentality was far too subtle to indulge in such "pastime."</p>
                     <p>Eckhel, in his Numi Veteres Anecdoti, suggested an explanation that has been forgotten. With the support of some verses of Dionysos Periegetes and comments of the Scholiast Eustathios, where it is recorded that Pegasos before reaching Tarsos had lost a hoof,<ref target="#CH1-n191">191</ref> he says that the little figure represents Bellerophon examining the injured foot of
<pb n="141"/>
Pegasos.<ref target="#CH1-n192">192</ref> This is a very probable explanation and our observations exactly correspond with it. Furthermore, it receives confirmation from the obvious meaning of obverse A 60 on coin 145 of the same issue.</p>
                     <p>As stated above, both coins have therefore obverses representing an incident of the myth of Pegasos.</p>
                     <p>Consequently we may conclude that this Ambracian colt has mythological significance, and that the Tarentine nomos has not. It is therefore but reasonable that this last one should have been inspired by the first and not vice-versa, as has been supposed. The colts circulated freely in South <placeName>Italy</placeName>, and may have tempted a Tarentine die-cutter to copy them. The nomoi of Tarentum of lighter weight were certainly not frequently to be met in <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. Consequently, the Ambracian coin is earlier than the Tarentine. The better style of the latter is not surprising if we consider that the mint of Tarentum possessed such famous artists, as ΦΙ and ΚΑΛ at the time.<ref target="#CH1-n193">193</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>On coins 148 and 149 (Pl. XIII-XII) we see again a sacred πέλεια of Dodona, such as we have already found on die P 93.</p>
                     <p>On coin 151 there is a serpent, another effective άποτ ρόπαιον.<ref target="#CH1-n194">194</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>Die P 97 on the rare coin 150 is a revival of die P 85 (Pl. XI). The head is larger—the A is no longer on the bowl of the helmet, but under the
<pb n="142"/>
neck truncation, The dolphin-rider, larger too, is in the same attitude—clasping his hands round the left knee.</p>
                     <p>This is the only case of a revival of an old type in all the Ambracian series, and seems to confirm our opinion that the dolphin rider is not intended for the usual Eros. As we already stated, it is probable that it represents a local hero, whose name we may learn some day.</p>
                     <p>Head suggested that this type was also inspired by the Tarentine nomoi.<ref target="#CH1-n147">147</ref> This was natural enough as he believed that the type found on coin 146 was borrowed from the same mint. But if coin 150 were the only coin having such faint resemblance to the Tarentine coinage, we are sure he would never have suggested that the winged-hero was borrowed from Tarentum.</p>
                     <p>Coins 152, 153, 155, 156 and 159 are the simplest colts of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. After the interesting and elaborate dies we have been considering, they make a strange contrast.</p>
                     <p>Like dies P 94 and P 95, die P 99 has only the civic initial, but in the first two it was only natural that they should be simple, as they were coupled with a very pictorial obverse, while in this very simple coin there are just the standard Corinthian types.</p>
                     <p>Die P 100 (153, 155 and 156, Pl. XIV) is still simpler—merely Athena's head. This is certainly the least interesting of the series.</p>
                     <pb n="143"/>
                     <p>Die P 101 (154 and 157) and P 102 (158), on the contrary, are very remarkable. The heads are exactly the same—as though they were from the same die—but the symbols are different. Naturally it would be possible that the shrimp might have been cut over the dolphin, but it does not seem in exactly the same place.</p>

                     <p>From this moment to the closing of the mint, the wing of Pegasos shows a marked tendency to curl upwards. This peculiarity of the wing is common to all late staters of Corinthian types. In this group this peculiarity is just perceptible, but in the following it is more accentuated.</p>
                     <p>The Pegasoi on the five obverses composing this group are all very similar. The first four reverses have Olympian symbols—they are all evidently derived from the staters of Olympia.</p>
                     <p>Die P 103 has a thunderbolt of a very uncommon shape, the upper part composed of two wings and a central dart. These wings are not symmetrically disposed; the left one overlaps the dart to right. A similar thunderbolt is found on certain coins of Olympia<ref target="#CH1-n195">195</ref> (Seltman, 166, die δϑ, Pl. V). We know only one specimen of coin, 160, Pl. XIV, with this symbol. It is, we believe, hitherto unpublished.</p>
                     <p>Die P 104 has an eagle with spread wings standing on a ram's head; this too is very similar to a
<pb n="144"/>
coin of Olympia (Seltman, 320, die i ϑ, XI). The resemblance to the Olympian coins is so strong that <persName>E. Curtius</persName>
                        <ref target="#CH1-n196">196</ref> supposed Elis had also struck coins of Corinthian types and that our 157 might be a colt of this town.</p>
                     <p>Die P 105 shows an eagle with spread wings holding a serpent in its beak, similar to the eagle of another Olympian stater (Seltman 123, die BH, Pl. IV). P 106 has another symbol of the same kind, an eagle standing upright as on <persName>Seltman</persName> 312 (die ϑω, XI).</p>
                     <p>All four reverses are found coupled with the same obverse. They are all very rare, and but few specimens are known of each. They must have been in use for a short time only.</p>
                     <p>These symbols are too numerous and too similar to the coins mentioned to be considered as a casual coincidence. They are certainly taken from the Olympian types and must have been chosen to commemorate an Ambracian event in connection with Olympia. What this event could have been is rather difficult to conjecture; certainly it was not political. Perhaps it was the admission of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> to the Olympian games, or rather some important agonistic victory obtained there.</p>
                     <p>The other reverses of this group which share obverses with the previous, have another characteristic that is distinctive—the helmet of Athena has a crest. To our knowledge, this crested helmet is found on these colts and on some of Anacto-
<pb n="145"/>
rium and Leucas. The combination of dies of coins with the crested helmet and those with the Olympian symbols proves that they follow each other. The symbol found with the crested helmet is always a spear-head, a characteristic Aeakid badge, which became at a later period a recognized badge of the autonomous Epirote mints.<ref target="#CH1-n197">197</ref>

                     <p>The coins that form this group all have the Pegasos with the wing curled upwards. Their style is rather poor and clearly shows the beginning of decadence. The two obverses, A 76 and A 77 (Pl. XV—XVI), must have been used for a long time. The first we find coupled with four reverses, the second with eight.</p>
                     <p>On the obverse of coin 173 there are such large flaws that the Pegasos is completely disfigured. It is astonishing that such a damaged die should still have been used. No coins without these flaws are known.</p>
                     <p>The following die A 77 has also large flaws but we can follow the progression of the fracture of the die from the beginning. No. 174 is the first coin we find with, this obverse and the flaw is very small near the Pegasos' right hind-leg.</p>
                     <p>Reverse P 114 is almost the same as P 115; but very small differences enable us to see that they are not the same die. This coin is the link between the two obverses and proves that A 77
<pb n="146"/>
replaces A 76 when this was completely broken. The small flaw we see on the above mentioned coin progressively augments in size, until on coin 181 the die shows a large lump that covers the hind-legs of the Pegasos. The chronological sequence of the seven reverses can therefore easily be established.</p>
                     <p>The continued use of the two obverses so damaged is almost unique in the <placeName>Greek</placeName> series; either very bad metal was employed in making the dies,<ref target="#CH1-n197a">197a</ref> or they had great difficulties in making new ones. Anyhow, although this may sound incredible, it seems that only one pair of dies was in use at the time and that one die replaced the other when this could no longer be used.</p>
                     <p>We think it necessary to remark for the sake of accuracy that the fractures show practically the same state of progression on all the specimens of the same couplings. We have not chosen extremes to illustrate on the plates, but just the best available specimens. Thus, for instance, all three specimens of 181 show the obverse in the same state of fracture.</p>
                     <p>A very strange circumstance is that of all the eleven reverses found coupled with these two obverses, but one (P 112) shows a small fracture. It has always been thought the reverses wore more quickly than the obverses, and the greater number of them seems to prove it. But if this be so, how is it that the surviving coins do not show traces of
<pb n="147"/>
wear? The only explanation would be that they were changed frequently and as soon as a fracture appeared; but, if so, why were not the obverse dies changed too, when they were in such a state—for example the obverses on coins 170, 173, 180 and 181?</p>
                     <p>Dies P 111 and P 112 have a thymiaterion for symbol. Here we can see that the burner is very small and shaped like an acorn. This shows that the ending of the swinging thymiaterion, of which we have spoken on p. 102, is not too small for a burner. Dies P 113 and P 114 have Athena's head from the same die, but P 114 has a bunch of grapes added afterwards to the die. It may be that this bunch of grapes has been added to hide a fracture of the die.</p>
                     <p>On die P 117 there is a branch of thistle for symbol. <persName>Babelon</persName> described it as a poppy—probably he did not notice the flower or that the leaves had thorns.</p>
                     <p>Dies P 118, 119, 120, 121 and 126 all have the same symbol—the obelisk of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, which we have already found on coin 43 (Pl. IV) of the II Period.<ref target="#CH1-n124">124</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>Coin 181 is very interesting. We know only three specimens of it. On the <placeName>London</placeName> specimen there are five letters, ΝΙΚΟΣ; on the specimen in the writer's collection the inscription is more complete, ΝΙΚΟΣΘΕ …, but some letters are obviously missing. Probably the complete inscrip-
<pb n="148"/>
tion is Nikosthenes. If this is the name of a magistrate, it would be the only Ambracian colt with a magistrate's name. The symbol of this very late coin is a dove, such as we found on coin 144 (Pl. XIII) on which, near the dove, we find NI.</p>
                     <p>As we know no other Ambracian colt with a magistrate's name, we are more inclined to believe that ΝΙΚΟΣΘΕ … does not represent the name of a magistrate but a name of a local hero like ΓΟΡΓΟΣ.</p>
                     <p>Die P 124 is again inscribed ΑΜΠΡΑ, which is a very remarkable feature for such a late coin.</p>
                     <p>Head places 183 at a very early period, probably owing to the ethnic, but there is no doubt that it is one of the last colts of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>. The Pegasos' wing curled upwards is a very sure feature of a late issue, and it is never found before the fifth period. Besides, the style of Athena's head is very bad too and certainly has nothing in common with the archaistic style of our 100, 101, 102 (Pl. IX) and 106 (Pl. X), among which the coin was placed in the Catalogue of the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum.<ref target="#CH1-n198">198</ref>

                     <p>This coin, like the two following, has the obverse from the same die A 78, with AM beneath the Pegasos; 183 and 184, illustrated on Pl. XVI, have this M off-flan, but on 182 it is visible. The M near the A was probably necessary at the time to distinguish the colts of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> from those of <placeName>Argos</placeName>, this mint having started to employ the
<pb n="149"/>
civic initial A as <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> had always done before.</p>
                     <p>Nos. 184 and 182 are both known by one specimen only—the first in the writer's collection and the second in <placeName>Paris</placeName>, where it is among the colts of uncertain mints. This coin has a very peculiar symbol; the very careful and realistic reproduction permits us to establish that it does not represent the common locust which we often find used as a symbol on <placeName>Greek</placeName> coins, but the female of <hi rend="italic">Locusta viridissima</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cantans</hi>, bearing eggs, which accounts for the abnormal size of the abdomen.</p>

                     <p>The coin's under this heading are generally considered as belonging to <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>
                     <p>They are of three distinct groups. To the first belong 186, 187, and 188; they are of a quite peculiarly coarse style—the Pegasos on the only obverse found coupled with the three reverses is of very rough workmanship. We meet with nothing similar in all the Ambracian series, but on some colts of South <placeName>Italy</placeName> (Locri) we do find a style approaching this. The heads of Athena are very flat and they seem to be the work of an unskilled die-cutter.</p>
                     <p>This group with the large A on the reverses can hardly be accredited to a mint other than <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, but because of the style and the fact that
<pb n="150"/>
these coins stand quite isolated, we place them under the "Uncertain Mints." We are inclined to believe that they may be imitations of Ambracian Colts, made in Southern <placeName>Italy</placeName>, where they are generally found.</p>
                     <p>The second group is composed of a single reverse die, with two obverses. If this coin (190, Pl. XVII) is of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, it would stand quite isolated in the established sequence. The style of the reverse is good, but the obverses with which we find it coupled are of very bad style; the first is similar to A 80, but the second has a Pegasos of the peculiar type that is found on very late colts only. The olive-wreath placed on the helmet below the bowl, and the long flowing loose locks visible on both sides of the neck as though a strong wind were blowing from behind the Athena's head, give to the coin a very peculiar appearance. We are tempted to believe it belongs to another mint, perhaps Apollonia or Anactorium, the lyre and the wreathed helmet being often met on coins of this last mint.</p>
                     <p>To the third group belong the coins 191 and 192 (Pl. XVII). The style of reverses P 131 and P 132 can be considered as very good for such late coins, but the modelling is very flat and too sweet and conventional. One can clearly see that the preoccupation of the die-cutter was with making something pretty. A strikingly similar style is found on the Pyrrhic coins, made in <placeName>Sicily</placeName>.
<pb n="151"/>
These coins are perhaps the only colts struck in <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> after the closing of the mint. We conjecture that they were struck at the time when Pyrrhus made <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> his capital.<ref target="#CH1-n199">199</ref> Their rarity seems to confirm that they were soon replaced by the currency of the Epirote ruler.</p>
                     <p>Coins 193 and 194, illustrated on Pl. XVII, both in <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, are barbarous imitations. On the first, the shape of the letter behind the Athena's head is noteworthy. The die-cutter did not understand the peculiar shape of the Ambracian A<ref target="#CH1-n132">132</ref>; he thought it was an ornamental device and copied it as a triangle Δ. This seems to be the coin il lustrated by Cousinéry.<ref target="#CH1-n200">200</ref>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second has a reverse that is rather closely copied from die P 113 (Pl. XV), but the obverse shows a Pegasos that we never find on colts of a <placeName>Greek</placeName> mint. Only on Syracusan colts do we sometimes find the Pegasos with both wings visible.</p>
                     <p>A third coin illustrated on the same plate (195) is an ancient imitation too; the reverse is copied from die P 65 (Pl. IX) and the reverse is copied from a die of Leucas (cf. B. M. C., Pl. XXXIV, 8). Such a Pegasos with curled wing is not known as yet in the Ambracian series. This coin is very light; it weighs grm. 6.70 only, but it is certainly genuine. Unfortunately enough the coin that was kindly sent to me by Count Chandon de Briailles has been lost in the mail.</p>
                     <pb n="152"/>
                     <p>Coin <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, illustrated on Pl. XVII, is in <placeName>Naples</placeName> in the Santangelo Collection; there is no doubt that the inscription at full length is a modern addition.</p>
                     <p>Cousinéry illustrates on Pl. IV, 9, a similar coin inscribed in full on the obverse, over the Pegasos; both coins have an A on the Pegasos' hind-quarters; they are of exactly the same technique. The A is very heavy and was probably made by cutting away the horse's thigh. These coins are certainly forgeries, and as they look very similar it is probable that they come both from the same counterfeiter.</p>
                     <p>Several catalogues illustrate coins of Gela, Agrigentum, Messana and even colts, with pellets and extraordinary symbols added to common coins by clever soldering. There was an engraver in Catania, a certain Geremia, who made a specialty of this kind of falsification, and although we do not know of any such forgeries for <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, we think it of interest to describe some colts that passed through public sales with the addition of spurious symbols.<ref target="#CH1-n202a">202a</ref>

               <head>REMARKS ON DIES</head>
               <p>The following table gives the number of all recorded specimens for each die. The dies are divided by periods and groups so that it is possible to see the peculiarities of each group.</p>
               <p>A similar table has been established by <persName>L. O. Th. Tudeer</persName> for the tetradrachms of <placeName>Syracuse</placeName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n202">202</ref> and by <persName>W. Schwabacher</persName> for the tetradrachms of Selinus.<ref target="#CH1-n204">204</ref> We think it of some interest to compare the three tables.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Syracuse</placeName> 709 specimens, 43 A-dies, 80 P-dies. Selinus 262 specimens, 14 A-dies, 35 P-dies. <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> 619 specimens, 79 A-dies, 126 P-dies.</p>
               <p>The maximum number of specimens from the same die are:</p>
               <p>For <placeName>Syracuse</placeName> 53 from A-dies, 38 from P-dies.</p>
               <p>For Selinus 59 from A-dies, 19 from P-dies.</p>
               <p>For <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> 44 from A-dies, 22 from P-dies.</p>
               <pb n="154"/>
               <p>The exceptionally high number of specimens from the same A-die in Selinus may perhaps be explained if we consider that probably the greatest number of the recorded coins come from one hoard. The die must have been in use for a long time, as several coins show a very large fracture.</p>
               <p>In <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, also, the maximum number of specimens from the same A-die is proportionately much larger than in <placeName>Syracuse</placeName>.</p>
               <p>It seems that in the mint of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> they did not mind using a broken die for the obverse, but they were very particular about changing the P-dies as soon as a small fracture appeared. We know only a few reverses with flaws, and these are very small, while some obverses are badly fractured. Perhaps in <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> the A-dies were fastened to the anvil, and therefore even if they were broken they could still be used, while the P-die, used as a punch, received the blow. If damaged, it could not have stood the hammering, and they were therefore obliged to change it as soon as it was damaged (cf. page 146).</p>
               <p>The average of the number of A-dies in relation with P-dies is the following in the three series:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Syracuse</hi> 10 to 18,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Selinus</hi> 10 to 25,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ambracia</hi> 10 to 15.</p>
               <p>For this last series the average is misleading. Even if we do not consider the abnormal proportion of the two dies that we have already re-
<pb n="155"/>
marked for the first period (p. 85), the ratio between the two dies is variable even between two groups of the same period.</p>
               <p>We have for instance in groups A and B of period II</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">10 to 12</hi>,</p>
               <p>and in group C of the same period we have 3 A-dies for 9 P-dies, or proportionally</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">10 to 30</hi> (!),</p>
               <p>and in group B of period V</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">10 to 8</hi>,</p>
               <p>while in group D of the same period 4 A-dies for 16 P-dies, or proportionally</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">10 to 40</hi>.</p>
               <p>Such discrepancies are difficult to explain. A possible hypothesis would be that the coins of groups C/II and D/V may perhaps have come from one or two finds composed of coins of the same issue, being couplings of a large number of reverses (P-die) with the same obverse (A-die), while those of groups A—B/II and B/V have been found singly. Perhaps in the last-named groups many other reverses existed of which no specimens have survived. This is mere conjecture, and for the present cannot be substantiated as no record of a find of colts exists.</p>
               <p>We may conclude that the original ratio between obverses and reverses was certainly much larger than the average of <hi rend="italic">10 to 15.</hi>

               <head>THE WEIGHT STANDARD</head>
               <p>One of the chief factors of the success of the Corinthian currency was certainly the standard adopted. Although it was really the Euboїc- Attic standard, the system of division by 3 and 6 permitted an exchange with the money of the Aeginetic-standard. Thus a Corinthian stater corresponded to an Attic didrachm and a Corinthian drachm or 1/3 stater to an Aeginetan hemidrachm or 1/4 stater. Head indicates the weight of the standard of the Corinthian stater as 8.74 grm. (135 grs.).<ref target="#CH1-n206">206</ref>
                  <persName>Babelon</persName> brings this weight to grm. 8.72.<ref target="#CH1-n207">207</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="161"/>
               <p>These are higher than the weights we have obtained with the frequency-table, established by the Hill-Robinson method.<ref target="#CH1-n208">208</ref> Results obtained with this method are certainly truer than those obtained with the averaging system where exceptionally heavy coins or especially light ones may greatly influence the figures obtained.</p>
               <p>A first frequency-table established with the coins of the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum gave us a frequency- summit of 8.55 grm. Adding 1 per cent, for loss of weight by circulation, we obtain a normal weight of grm. 8.63, which, given the good condition of the coins of the B. M., must be very near the Corinthian standard. From another table established with 135 coins in my own collection, we obtained a norm of grm. 8.58. The difference of grm. 0.05 is probably due to the better condition of the coins of the B. M.</p>
               <p>A table established with the coins of the different towns of Akarnania, recorded by Imhoof- Blumer, and 110 specimens of my own collection, gave us the highest point of grm. 8.50; adding 1 per cent, we obtain a norm of grm. 8.58 for the staters of Akarnania.</p>
               <p>Another table with all the Ambracian staters here recorded, 496 specimens, gives us the highest point grm. 8.45 plus 1 per cent, norm grm. 8.53.</p>
               <p>In working out this table we observed that the weights seemed to augment towards the end of the series; this induced us to make three separate tables and we obtained the following results:</p>
               <pb n="162"/>
               <p>I–II–III Per… Summit 8.35 grm. plus 1 %, norm grm. 8.42.</p>
               <p>IV Per Summit 8.45 grm. plus 1 %, norm grm. 8.53.</p>
               <p>V Per Summit 8.50 grm. plus 1 %, norm grm. 8.58.</p>
               <p>From these results we may draw the following conclusions:</p>
               <p>1. That the Colonies of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> seem to have had a lower standard than their mother-city, and that this must have been very near to 8.58 grm.</p>
               <p>2. That the standard of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> was lower than that of the other colonies.</p>
               <p>3. That not only the standard of the colts did not drop at about the fourth century, as <persName>Prof. P. Gardner</persName> says,<ref target="#CH1-n209">209</ref> but on the contrary, at least for <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>, it rose at that time and reached the level of the coins of Akarnania.</p>

               <head>ERRONEOUS ATTRIBUTIONS</head>
               <p>In many public and private collections there are often colts inscribed A and therefore placed under <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> which do not belong to this mint. We think it useful to illustrate these coins on Pl. XVII and XVIII, although many of them have already been attributed to other mints, by Imhoof- Blumer, but not being illustrated, they are often misplaced.</p>
               <p>A great number of these coins are of very late style, and certainly posterior to the closing of the mint of <placeName>Ambracia</placeName>.</p>

                  <p>Coin 1 (Pl. XVII) in <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, from the Prokesch- Osten collection, is certainly of this mint. A specimen in the writer's cabinet has the reverse from the same die and the inscription ΑΛΤ is clearly visible in front of the Athena's head, while on the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> specimen only A and the lower part of the other two letters can be seen. This coin corresponds to Imhoof-Blumer No. 5.<ref target="#CH1-n210">210</ref> Coin 2 (Pl. XVIII) in <placeName>Athens</placeName> belongs to the same mint; the obverse is from the same die as the coin of <placeName>Alyzia</placeName> in <placeName>Paris</placeName>, illustrated by <persName>Babelon</persName> (Tr., t. IV, pl. CCLXXII, 20). The symbol, a quiver and a bow, confirms this attribution.</p>

                  <p>Coin 3 (Pl. XVIII) in <placeName>Paris</placeName> and 4 in <placeName>Berlin</placeName> are undoubtedly from this mint. The AM in front of the Athena's helmet is not the beginning of the Ambracian ethnic, but of ΑΜΦΙΛΟΧΩΝ. This can be seen on the coins of the same mint (Imhoof-Blumer 28 to 38)<ref target="#CH1-n211">211</ref> on which the ethnic is ΑΜΦΙΛΟ, ΑΜΦΙΛ, ΑΜΦΙ, ΑΜΦ and afterwards, AM only.

have AP and a shield for symbol; this coin corresponds to Imhoof-Blumer 16. Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 under <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> in several public and private collections are of <placeName>Argos</placeName> and can be found in Imhoof-Blumer too. Nos. 10 to 13 in <placeName>Munich</placeName>, <placeName>Glasgow</placeName> and <placeName>London</placeName> are of the same mint and were ascribed to <placeName>Argos</placeName> by Imhoof-Blumer owing to their fabric.<ref target="#CH1-n213">213</ref> Although placed under <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> in the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum Catalogue, Head doubted they were really of this mint.<ref target="#CH1-n214">214</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>On all these coins of very flat fabric and of late style, the Athena's hair is distinctively treated. On all the Ambracian staters it flows down from beneath the helmet and neck-guard, while on these coins it goes back over the neck-guard in ungainly heavy curls of a very conventional shape. <persName>Prof. Oman</persName>, in his recent study on the "Late Coinage of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>," remarked the same peculiarity on the late Corinthian issues.<ref target="#CH1-n215">215</ref> These conventional curls which look like hooks stuck on the neck-guard never occur on the Ambracian colts. They are, however, met sometimes on late coins of Anactorium and Leukas, but are generally present on the late colts of mints that continued to strike colts after the Macedonian invasion—such as <placeName>Argos</placeName>, Astakos, Coronta(?), Metropolis, Thyrreion—and on the colts of the Akarnanian league.</p>

               <p>Athena's head, the constant type of all the colts, has received different names. <persName>Fr. Lenormant</persName> (Rev. Num., t. XI, p. 73) thought it might represent the armed Aphrodite of which Pausanias saw a statue in the Acrocorinth (Paus., II, 4, 6). <persName>E. Curtius</persName> supported this opinion. Imhoof-Blumer (Die Münzen Akarnaniens, p. 4) discusses it and says that an Aphrodite with a helmet has never existed and the only arms that the armed Aphrodite had, was a shield, which she used as a mirror, as can be seen on later bronze coins. He states that the head is undoubtedly the head of Athena.</p>
               <p>Babelon (Tr., t. I, c. 809-810) follows the same opinion and says that Ἀφροδίτη ὡπλισμένη does not mean Aphrodite with a helmet. He sees in the head, Athena χαλινῖτis, who had a temple on the market square in <placeName>Corinth</placeName>. This goddess appeared to Bellerophon and gave him a golden bridle with which he mastered Pegasos, therefore her surname χαλινῖτis, the goddess with the bridle. This explanation connects the type of the reverse with that of the obverse.</p>

               <p>The Pegasos is always found on the obverse of the coins of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and her colonies. On the colts of South <placeName>Italy</placeName> and <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, it is sometimes on the reverse. This is comprehensible as for these countries the Pegasos had not the same importance as for <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, the issues being only a kind of secondary currency, made to satisfy the demands of trade.</p>

                  <persName>G. Macdonald</persName>, op. cit., p. 125, says: "Probably it was due to the widespread popularity of her 'colts' that the Pegasos maintained its position on the obverse, even after the helmeted head of Athena had joined it as a companion," and at p. 136: "… the (Athena's) head succeeds to a place that was vacant, only a single type having been used there previously."</p>

               <p>Up to date great importance has been given to the symbols, for the classification of the colts. The cases described on pp. 9 and 10 prove how dangerous this is.</p>

               <p>When in 1878 Imhoof-Blumer wrote his exhaustive study "Die Münzen Akarnaniens" (Num. Zeitsch., X) he saw how difficult it is to classify the colts, chronologically, according to their appearance, and how necessary it would be, for this kind of attempt, to collect as many originals and casts as possible in order to examine and compare all the dies (p. 69).</p>
               <p>This, in an epoch when nobody thought of studying the coins through their die-combinations, is quite remarkable and Imhoof-Blumer should therefore be considered as the precursor of the system.</p>

               <p>That these fillets were made of wool is confirmed by some bronze coins of Phocis (cf. <persName>Babelon</persName> Tr., pl. CCV, 17 and 20), on which we see a fillet, no doubt the Delphic one, tied round the bull's horns and hanging down on both sides of the head.</p>
               <p>This fillet corresponds probably to the red woollen fillet of the same shape that is still in use in southern <placeName>Italy</placeName> round the horns of the oxen, employed as a protection against the evil eye—a survival of the <placeName>Greek</placeName> apotropeion.</p>

We have seen that the instrument was used by swinging it to and fro; this would not be the best way to make it ring. If the end of the fillet was a bell it would have been more convenient to have it tied to a rigid rod, and the greatest ringing effect would have been obtained by shaking it, rather than by a swinging movement.</p>

               <p>This peculiarly shaped alpha is generally found on archaic coins only. In <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> on the contrary some of the archaic colts have the usual civic initial A with the straight crossbar (see 1, 2 and 3, Pl. I) and
<pb n="176"/>
not until later is the crossbar slanting—sometimes upwards to left and sometimes upwards to right.</p>
               <p>This archaic letter A is found often even on very late colts; it can be considered as a local form of the civic initial.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable that <placeName>Ambracia</placeName> should have employed for this purpose an archaic letter, copying even in this her mother-city.</p>
               <p>This A corresponds to the 9 (koppa) that is found on all the coins of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and that is still her characteristic initial long after this archaic letter had been abolished and replaced by the K.</p>

               <p>Vlasto in his ΤΑΡΑΣ ΟΙΚΙΣΤΗΣ, Num. Notes and Monographs 15, p. 130, illustrates a nomos of his collection inscribed TARANTINON on the obverse and ΤΑΡΑΝΤΙΝΩΝ on the reverse. It is remarkable that one side should have both the archaic R and O while the other side has P and Ω. This case proves how little we can rely on epigraphic considerations for the dating of coins.</p>

               <p>In the catalogue of the Pozzi Coll., 1783 (from the Hirsch sale, XXXI), the Pegasos is described as having AY on its hind-quarters. This is certainly a mistake; there is only an A, which stands for the civic initial, as does the 9 on some Corinthian staters, placed in the same way (B. M. Cat., pl. IV, 10).</p>

               <p>The breaking of these dies is probably due to the fact that the metal was brittle owing to insufficient annealing of the tempered steel. (Cf. <persName>S. W. Grose</persName>, A Decadrachm by <persName>Kimon</persName>, Num. Chr., IV ser., 1916, p. 130.)</p>

               <p>In <placeName>Paris</placeName> there is another coin (<placeName>Corinth</placeName> 366 a) which is really a coin of <placeName>Argos</placeName>, with the same head wearing a conical pilos, added to the reverse.</p>

               <p>A typical instance of the danger of this kind of forgeries is given by the tetradrachm of Gela formerly in the Pozzi collection (435). This coin, a common one, of well-known dies, has three large pellets, added by the same man, on the reverse. Nobody doubted that these pellets were genuine and <persName>Mr. Giesecke</persName> in his "Sicilia Numismatica" illustrates the coin on pl. 9, 5, and at p. 12 says: "These three pellets, undoubtedly marks of value, mean that this tetradrachm corresponds to three heavy diachms of the Euboic towns, and considerations based on this premise follow."</p>
