            <p>Many of the war medals and decorations of the South American Republics are concerned with their struggle for independence from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>. Some knowledge of the causes of this struggle is fitting—the difficulties of stating these causes briefly will be obvious, but the necessity for such a statement as a starting point must suffice as a reason for attempting it. The success of the revolution of the thirteen colonies in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name> seems to have had less direct influence in initiating the struggle for independence than the conditions in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>. In 1808, upon the abdication of <name type="pname">Charles IV</name>, <name type="pname">Ferdinand VII</name> was proclaimed king in each Spanish-American capital. Shortly thereafter however, and in some places before the proclamation of <name type="pname">Ferdinand's</name> accession, emissaries arrived with letters from the Ministers and Council of the Indies, announcing the abdication of <name type="pname">Ferdinand</name>, and the confirmation of all the governors and officials by <name type="pname">Joseph Napoleon</name>, the new king. This aroused intense opposition. The <name type="place">French</name> successes in the <name type="place">peninsula</name>, however, left the colonies with the suspicion that Spanish power had disintegrated, and the subsequent action of the royalists of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> and the Spanish Cortes only added to the confusion. A number of leaders who had been
<pb n="2"/>
working toward independence were quick to seize the opportunity, and in first one capital and then in another, organizations were effected and revolutionary agencies set in motion.</p>
            <p>The Spanish rule was centered in important cities in which Viceroys appointed by <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> were in authority, supported by garrisons of soldiery. The body of citizenry aside from the native Indians was composed largely of European <hi rend="italic">emigrés</hi>, many of whom had long been settled in the country and some of whom had inter-married with Negro blood. This Creole population exploited the Indian natives wherever possible and in consequence the natives looked to the Spanish authority for what redress it was possible for them to obtain, and remained sympathetic to the Spanish rather than to the revolutionary cause in most districts. Climatic and geographical surroundings played an important part in the ultimate division of the continent into republics—frequently a nationalistic division would have been hard to discover. The struggle in the south was successful earlier than that in the equatorial section where the leadership of <name type="pname">Bolivar</name>, after countless reversals, was to be triumphant.</p>
            <p>After the achievement of the independence from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> there were frequent upheavals. Many were of a purely local nature, some being due to individual ambition or assertiveness and some being little more than neighborly quarrels over boundaries or privileges. Occasionally the struggles were bloody

ones, but the distances to be overcome sufficiently increased the difficulties of warfare under tropical or semi-tropical conditions to prevent many movements on a large scale. In addition, the problems of financing any prolonged conflict wielded an even greater influence.</p>
            <p>The decorations issued under such circumstances are of necessity of a more or less makeshift nature, and the record of them is often difficult to obtain, and is sometimes to be had only from the decoration itself. As more stable conditions were brought about the record becomes clearer. It will be seen, that accuracy of statement with regard to some of these decorations is impossible, and that difference in descriptions of awards is to be expected. In the following accounts of decorations awarded by South American republics, a citation is made of the authority responsible for the statements recorded, and this is supported wherever possible by photographic reproduction of the respective medals.</p>
            <p>The object of this monograph is to treat <hi rend="italic">only</hi> of the medallic awards—those which were made to be worn on the person—and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the embroidered insignia of honour given by some governments of Latin <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>.</p>
            <p>Many of the Spanish-American countries awarded to their military heroes, in place of a medal, an <hi rend="italic">Escudo</hi> or embroidered shield or plaque. These varied in size, design and colour, but all were excellently executed, being usually embroidered in gold

thread on a brilliant background of silk, such as light or dark blue, or red; and sometimes on a white or black ground. The contrast of the gold on the coloured silk made quite as distinguishing a decoration as a silver or gold medal such as many of the European countries bestow.</p>
            <p>One of the earliest of such <hi rend="italic">escudos</hi> was awarded by the government of <name type="place">Buenos Aires</name> for the troops taking part in the battle of Tupiza in Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name> November 7, 1810. It was an oval, 2 × 2½ inches, of white silk embroidered with a silver corded edge, within which was the inscription also in silver cord, <hi rend="italic">LA PATRIA A LOS VENCEDORES DE TUPIZA</hi>.</p>
            <p>Another attractive <hi rend="italic">escudo</hi> is that given by the same authority for the battle against the Spanish forces at the estate called "<name type="place">La Florida</name>," on the banks of the river Piray in Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name> on November 9, 1814. This too is of white silk, heart-shaped, 2¾ inches, × 2½ embroidered with light blue silk. The outer edge represents a laurel wreath, then the motto <hi rend="italic">A LOS VENCEDORES EN LA <name type="place">FLORYDA</name>,</hi> then a corded border. In the centre are two crossed palm branches and three stars, the whole making a most attractive insignia of honour, when sewed on the breast of the uniform coat.</p>
            <p>This form of decoration varied in size from an oval 2 × 1½ inches to 3½ × 2¾ inches. As they were attached to the uniform they naturally soiled easily and were not well preserved; hence they are not

often to be found by the collector, even though awarded as late as 1872. (<name type="pname">Rosa, <hi rend="italic">Leyes</hi>
               </name>, p. 130.)</p>
            <p>Some of these shields or <hi rend="italic">escudos</hi> were made of metal and worn on the uniform's coat-sleeve. These were generally awarded to the troops. It is the intention to include herein all such metallic awards, where information is obtainable.</p>
            <p>During the Spanish Colonial period in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> many medals and decorations of honour were awarded to the royalist troops. Some of these were authorized by the home government in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, such as the Order of St. <name type="pname">Ferdinand</name>, the Order of <name type="pname">Isabella</name> the Catholic, the Cross for <name type="place">Carthagena</name> de las Indias and many others for <name type="place">Cuba</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</name>. These will not be included here, having already been described in Spanish Orders of Chivalry and Decorations of Honour.</p>
            <p>The intention of the writer is to include herein only those decorations for military services which were issued in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</name>, first by the local Spanish authorities and later by the several republics, after they had obtained their independence. Before the separation of the several colonies, many medals and <hi rend="italic">escudos</hi> were authorized by the various Viceroys and Captains General, who apparently did not need the sanction of the home government to reward the royalist forces. Most of these were designed and executed within the several colonies, and but little information concerning them is obtainable. Possibly the records were destroyed
<pb n="6"/>
during or after the various wars for independence; it would be natural that the patriots should wish to obliterate all reminders of the Spanish regime, under which they had suffered.</p>
            <p>In preparing a record such as this, one succeeds only with the help of one's friends. To the officers of South American countries who have provided information, and to the consular officers of the United States who have aided, grateful acknowledgement is hereby made. To <name type="pname">Charles H. Roberts</name>, Esq., of <name type="place">Buenos Aires</name>, I would express deep appreciation for valuable assistance. To Mr. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Sydney P. Noe</name> I am deeply indebted—without his help these pages might never have been completed.</p>

            <p>The territory of <name type="place">Argentina</name> was discovered by the Spaniards, and settled in the 16th century. In the last quarter of the 18th century the <hi rend="italic">Colonies of the Plata</hi> included all of the country now known as <name type="place">Argentina</name>, <name type="place">Bolivia</name>, <name type="place">Uruguay</name>, <name type="place">Paraguay</name>, and the <name type="place">Pacific</name> provinces later ceded to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</name> by <name type="place">Bolivia</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>. The capital was <name type="place">Buenos Aires</name>. The revolution for freedom from Spanish rule was started May 25, 1810, under a provisional junta, and six years later the independence of the <hi rend="italic">United Provinces of the Rio de La Plata</hi> was proclaimed. In January, 1825, these became the <name type="place">Argentine</name> Republic or Confederation. From 1835 to 1852, part of the country was under the Dictatorship of <name type="pname">Juan Manuel de Rosas</name>. <name type="place">Buenos Aires</name> separated itself from the Confederation in 1852; seven years later, however, it rejoined the Republic of <name type="place">Argentina</name>. By the treaty of 1881, <name type="place">Patagonia</name> and <name type="place">Terra-del-Fuego</name> were divided between <name type="place">Argentina</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</name>.</p>
            <p>The Republic of <name type="place">Argentina</name> authorized many awards to officers and soldiers—embroidered shields or plaques, cordons and other evidences of honour; these are omitted from this paper as the intention is to treat only of the medallic awards worn on the person, and conferred for military services.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR <name type="pname">PERDRIEL</name>. This was authorized September 5, 1806, for those who took part in the

engagement at the village of <name type="pname">Perdriel</name>, 22 km. from the Capital. The English forc.es under General <name type="pname">William Beresford</name> attempted to seize <name type="place">Buenos Aires</name> in June and July of that year. It is a cast, oval medal, 32 × 22 mm., surmounted by a ribbon or fillet of the same metal.

This attempt was brought about through the alliance of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> against <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, following the <name type="place">French</name> Revolution, when British commerce with <name type="place">Buenos Aires</name> was interrupted.</p>
            <p>The medal, of gold or silver, is oval in shape, 49 × 30 mm.; it bears on the obverse the head of the Spanish king facing to the right, and the inscription <hi rend="italic">FERNANDO VII REY DE ESPANA Y DE LAS INDIAS</hi> 1808.</p>

               <p>MEDALS FOR <name type="place">CERRITO</name> and <name type="place">MONTEVIDEO</name>, 1812–1814. After the <name type="place">Buenos Aires</name> declaration of independence in 1810, the Spanish forces made their headquarters in <name type="place">Montevideo</name>.

In the Spanish Colonial period it was called Upper <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>, and was part of the vice-royalty of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>. <name type="place">Bolivia</name> became independent in 1829, and was united with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name> from 1836 to 1839; a separation was forced by <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</name> who feared the federation. <name type="place">Bolivia</name> was attacked by <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</name> in 1879, and for four years carried on a war in which she was assisted by <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>.</p>
            <p>Because of <name type="place">Bolivia's</name> connection with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>, some writers have classed as <name type="pname">Bolivian</name> certain medals which we believe to belong to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>, and the reader is referred to those recorded under the latter country for an inclusive list.</p>
            <p>The geographical position of <name type="place">Bolivia</name> imposed on that country all of the disadvantages of isolation, even in times of peace. In consequence, we find that decorations of the country bear evidences that they are of native manufacture and not highly finished. Most of them seem to have been made at the national mint at <name type="place">Potosi</name>. They partake of the nature of the coins issued there, in the making of which the <name type="place">Potosi</name> mint had long been engaged.</p>
            <p>In the Cabinet of the American Numismatic Society there is a collection of seal impressions from medal-dies still in possession of the <name type="pname">Bolivian</name> mint
<pb n="43"/>
and from these it is possible to deduce something about the making of these medals. The illustration of the Medal for <name type="place">Socabaya</name> will disclose a radiant star, silver gilt, and a planchet of silver bearing the same star from the same dies. This star must have been struck first in the circular form and the plain segments then cut away, leaving the star as it is now seen. Another medal in which the same procedure seems to have maintained is the decoration for <name type="place">Ingavi</name>. It is not certain whether the medals were issued in the round form and later cut out by the individuals to whom they were awarded or whether there may have been no intention of having them altered from the original rounded form. It is hoped that further details regarding this procedure may be brought to light.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR AYOHUMA, 1815. The battle of Ayohuma, near <name type="place">Potosi</name>, was one of the engagements lost by the revolutionists during the struggle for independence. General <name type="pname">Manuel Belgrano</name> (1770–1820), led the <name type="place">Bolivian</name>-<name type="place">Argentine</name> forces against those of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>. The Spanish medal for this engagement, awarded by General <name type="pname">Joaquin de la Pezuela</name>, is a silver rhomboid, 54 × 39 mm., having around the sides <hi rend="italic">RECUPERO LAS PROV D <name type="place">POTOSI</name> Y CHARCAS<ref target="#CH3-n1a">1</ref> EN LA BATALLA</hi>, and in the center is <hi rend="italic">A YOHUMA 14 DE NOVRE DE 1815</hi>.</p>

            <p>ORDER OF THE SOUTHERN CROSS. This decoration was first instituted on December I, 1822, by <name type="pname">Dom Pedro I</name>. (1778–1834) and given the name of the Constellation of the South, or Southern Cross. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</name> was first called the Land of the Holy Cross because of this constellation. It was discontinued at the time of the revolution of 1889, when the empire was overthrown, but revived on May 22,1890, by the republican government as a reward of merit. There are four classes, Grand Cross, Commanders, Officers and Chevaliers. The first decoration was a ball-tipped, double-pointed, five-armed cross of white enamel surmounted by an imperial crown and superimposed upon a wreath of tobacco and coffee plant leaves. On the light blue centre medallion is a cross of stars encircled by a dark blue band inscribed <hi rend="italic">BENE MERENTIUM PRAEMIUM</hi>.

               </hi>. When the order was revised in 1890, the style of the cross in the centre was changed to five stars, arranged as they appear in the Southern Cross constellation, and the crown was replaced by a five-pointed star on a wreath. On the reverse the centre medallion bears a female head of Liberty encircled by the inscription <hi rend="italic">ESTADOS UNIDOS DO <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</name>

               <p>The city was founded in 1552, and named for <name type="pname">Pedro de Valdivia</name>, a Spanish soldier and the conqueror of this section of the country. It was occupied by the Spaniards until February, 1820, when it was captured by the patriots under Cochrane after a three day fight. The decoration is of gold and of two sizes in silver. The gold form has a six-pointed star with rays in the angles, surrounded by a green-enamelled wreath of laurel, the whole suspended from a ribbon bar in the form of an oval laurel wreath. The star has a white-enamelled rim bearing the inscription <hi rend="italic">RESTAURADOR DE LA PATRIA</hi>. The field is divided horizontally— above are the remains of a ruined fort, below quills and an ink well on a book at the left and a mailed arm holding a sword upright to the right. The silver form of this medal is of two sizes (45 and 40 mm.) at the greatest width. The inscription and the arms on the star are the same but there is no enamelling of the silver star. It has ball tips, and the rays completely fill the angles between the points.

               <p>The first naval engagement took place at <name type="place">Iquique</name>, in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>, when the Chilean ships, "<name type="pname">Esmeralda</name>" and "Covadonga" essayed to blockade that port.

The "<name type="pname">Esmeralda</name>" was sunk by the "Huascar" and the "Independencia" ran ashore while pursuing the "Covadonga." Later the "Huascar" was captured by the "Covadonga" (October 8, 1879) near Puerto Lamar, <name type="place">Antofagasta</name>, and the Peruvian navy ceased to exist.</p>
               <p>To reward their seamen, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</name>, by a decree of September 12, 1879, authorized this medal of gold or silver, in the form of a shield framed in green-enamelled laurel branches, bearing on the obverse a vessel, the whole being superimposed on an anchor and flanked by flags.</p>

            <p>The Spaniards discovered this region in the 15th century and soon thereafter commenced its settlement. Various adventurers assumed control over sections of the country. In 1514 these districts were united into the province of Tierra-Firma. In 1564 the Spanish monarch, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii_spain">Philip II</name> (1556-1598) styled it <name type="place">New Granada</name>, which name was continued until the overthrow of Spanish rule in the early part of the 19th century. Included in this title was the present territory of <name type="place">Colombia</name>, <name type="place">Ecuador</name> and <name type="place">Venezuela</name>. Under the leadership of <name type="pname">Simon Bolivar</name>
               <ref target="#CH6-n1a">1</ref> after declaring their independence in 1819, the three sections were united as the Republic of <name type="place">Colombia</name>. <name type="place">Venezuela</name> withdrew in 1829 and <name type="place">Ecuador</name> in 1830, and soon after the Republic of <name type="place">New Granada</name> was established.

In 1886 the Republic of <name type="place">Colombia</name> was formed. <name type="place">Panama</name> seceded in 1903 and declared itself free and independent.</p>
            <p>The history of <name type="place">Colombia</name> is linked up with that of <name type="place">Venezuela</name> and <name type="place">Ecuador</name>, and with the viceroyalty of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>, so decorations and war medals issued prior to 1831 are seldom to be distinguished.

            <p>The Cross for Junin and the Medal for Junin will be found described under those of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>, although the Congress of <name type="place">Colombia</name> decreed on February II, 1825, that special honours and insignia be accorded to <name type="pname">Bolivar</name> and to <name type="place">Sucre</name>, and awarded similar pieces to those of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name>.

<pb n="129"/>
1819 this cross was created August 8, 1919, by Decree No. 1667 and awarded to the officers and men of the army of <name type="place">Colombia</name>. It is a Maltese cross of 50 centimeters diameter, having on the obverse the flag of the republic, enamelled in colours, encircled by a gold band inscribed <hi rend="italic">CEN-TENARIO DE <name type="place">BOYACA</name>
               </hi> and on the reverse 1819–1919. The ribbon is light blue. The cross was of silver for officers and of bronze for the troops. On April 17, 1922, the award was modified and its award to eminent foreigners was permitted. The decoration was altered to three classes, gold, silver and bronze. On the obverse the bust of the liberator (<name type="pname">Bolivar</name>) replaced the national flag and the inscription was changed to <hi rend="italic">

The first class of gold was to be awarded to ministers, diplomats and generals, both native and foreign. The second class of silver to lesser officials. Later the same year a still further change was to have been made, creating five classes, similar to the Order of the Legion of Honour of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> and similar orders, but no confirmation of this has been obtained.</p>

From 1710 until 1722 it was part of the viceroyalty of Santa Fé, but it was restored to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name> in 1723. The people of <name type="place">Ecuador</name> with <name type="pname">Bolivar</name>'s aid succeeded in securing their independence in 1822, after the battle of <name type="place">Pichincha</name>. In 1819 a confederation had been effected between <name type="place">New Granada</name> (<name type="place">Colombia</name>), <name type="place">Venezuela</name> and <name type="place">Ecuador</name>. This was known as the Republic of <name type="place">Colombia</name>. In 1828 political differences arose with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name> and these resulted in the occupation of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3658666">Cuenca</name> and <name type="place">Guayaquil</name> by Peruvian troops; but after the Ecuadorian victory at <name type="place">Tarqui</name> in the following year, peace was restored. In 1829 <name type="place">Venezuela</name> withdrew from this triple alliance, and the following year the present Republic of <name type="place">Ecuador</name> was established.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR <name type="place">PICHINCHA</name> 1822. While <name type="place">Ecuador</name> was under the government of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name> and during the wars for independence, a battle was fought, May 24, 1822, on the side of Mount <name type="place">Pichincha</name> near <name type="place">Quito</name>, at an elevation of 10,200 feet. The people of <name type="place">Guayaquil</name> led by <name type="pname">Antonio José de Sucre</name> (sent by <name type="pname">Bolivar</name>) and reinforced by <name type="place">Argentine</name>, <name type="place">Peruvian</name> and Chilean troops defeated the Spanish

forces. Two days after this battle the Spanish general, Don Melchor de Aymeric, capitulated and the independence of <name type="place">Ecuador</name> was assured. On May 29, 1822, the municipality of <name type="place">Quito</name> created this decoration, of gold for the officers and of silver for the troops. The medal, 35 mm. in diameter, bears a twelve-armed star the arms of which are interlaced with a laurel wreath. The obverse medallion has in the centre three mountain peaks surmounted by a radiant sun, above which is <hi rend="italic">LIBERTADOR DE <name type="place">QUITO</name>

            <p>A variant is oval in form, 38 × 42 mm., displaying on the obverse within laurel branches, a shield crowned with a liberty cap, bearing a sun-burst, flags and a horn of plenty and inscribed <hi rend="italic">A LOS LIBERTADORES DE <name type="place">QUITO</name>

               <p>CROSS FOR INDEPENDENCE. What is believed to be an Ecuadorean decoration is in the writer's cabinet, though no authority has been found describing it. A white-enamelled gold cross, double-pointed and ball-tipped, is surmounted by two green-enamelled scrolls attached to the suspension ring. On the white medallion in figures of gold is 1831, presumably the year of its creation. Encircling this is a blue enamelled band inscribed in gold letters GUERRA DE INDEPENDENCIA<hi rend="sub">*</hi>.</p>
               <p>If this is of <name type="place">Ecuador</name>, it was probably created in 1831 to commemorate the final independence of the present republic.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF MERIT. This is awarded for civil and military acts of distinction, and has three classes. The first is a gold medal with a yellow ribbon; the second of silver with blue ribbon and the third class medal is bronze suspended by a red ribbon.</p>
               <p>The decoration is circular in form, composed of twelve rays, interlaced with a laurel wreath and suspended from an oval wreath for the ribbon. On the centre medallion are the arms of the republic in relief (three mountains and a radiant sun) encircled by a band inscribed <hi rend="italic">REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR—AL MERITO</hi>.</p>

            <p>This interior republic of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</name>, first settled by the Spaniards in 1536, was attached to the viceroyalty of <name type="place">La Plata</name> in 1776. The colony declared its independence of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> in 1811, but refused to join the <name type="place">Argentine</name> Confederation. It was under various dictatorships from 1814 to 1865. The last was that of <name type="pname">Francisco Solano Lopez</name> (1826–1870) who brought on the war against <name type="place">Argentina</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</name> and <name type="place">Uruguay</name>, which ended so disastrously for <name type="place">Paraguay</name>. The constitution of the present republic was adopted in 1870.</p>
            <p>The six war-medals issued by the government of <name type="place">Paraguay</name> described here were all created by the Dictator <name type="pname">Lopez</name>, for engagements in the war against the Triple Alliance. <name type="pname">Lopez</name> and his country were completely shut off from the outside world and were compelled to make such medals as were authorized. Some of the decorations were engraved, and one was cast, supposedly in his arsenal, by <name type="pname">Charles</name>, whose name appears on one medal as the designer. In consequence, the <name type="place">Paraguayan</name> decorations are seldom pretentious—their rarity is some compensation for their lack of finish.</p>
            <p>The writer is indebted to <name type="pname">Mr. Charles H. Roberts</name> of <name type="place">Buenos Aires</name> for much of the information of the <name type="place">Paraguayan</name> medals contained herein.</p>
            <p>NATIONAL ORDER OF MERIT. This was created at <name type="place">Asuncion</name>, April 8, 1865, by <name type="pname">Lopez</name>, the
<pb n="137"/>
               <name type="pname">Marshal</name>-President of the Republic and Commander-in-Chief of the Army. It was intended to have several grades with an enamelled decoration, but owing to the isolation of the country this was impossible, and the only known specimens are of chased gold, though some recipients are said to have painted theirs. The decoration is a five-pointed ball-tipped star with crossed cannon in the angles, superimposed on a laurel wreath and surmounted by a similar wreath, tied with a knot of ribbon. On the medallion is a star encircled by <name type="pname">HONOR ET GLORIA</name> and on the reverse <hi rend="italic">PREMIUM MERITI</hi>. The ribbon was purple with three narrow stripes of red, white and blue each side. This award was for military merit during the five years' war against the Triple Alliance. The plaque, without the suspension wreath, is about double the size of the cross.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR RIACHUELO.

Although the independence of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</name> was declared in 1821, the Spanish retained control of some sections in the interior of the country for a considerable time. <name type="pname">Simon Bolivar</name> had come from <name type="place">Colombia</name> to aid the Peruvians who were commanded by General <name type="pname">José de Lamar</name>. The Spanish forces consisted of 9000 troops under the <name type="pname">Viceroy La Serna</name>, while the patriots had but 5780 men under General <name type="place">Sucre</name>. The final battle in this campaign was fought at <name type="place">Ayacucho</name> (<name type="place">Ayacucho</name> was formerly called Huamanga or Guamango) on December 9, 1824, and lasted about one hour.

            <head>INDEX</head>
            <p>In the index which follows the names of the medals described in this monograph are listed in a single alphabet. Names of the countries in which the medals are believed to have originated are indicated by abbreviations in the parentheses following the name of the medal or decoration. The asterisk signifies that the piece so indicated is illustrated on the plates—usually on the plate immediately preceding or immediately following the page indicated. When several medals or decorations have been issued for the same battle or the same city (e. g. <name type="place">Abtao</name>), the order is alphabetical by countries rather than chronological. Medals whose origin is in controversy are listed under the countries to which they are attributed in this monograph.</p>
