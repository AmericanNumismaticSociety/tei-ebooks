            <p>Many of the war medals and decorations of the South American Republics are concerned with their struggle for independence from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. Some knowledge of the causes of this struggle is fitting—the difficulties of stating these causes briefly will be obvious, but the necessity for such a statement as a starting point must suffice as a reason for attempting it. The success of the revolution of the thirteen colonies in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> seems to have had less direct influence in initiating the struggle for independence than the conditions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. In 1808, upon the abdication of <persName>Charles IV</persName>, <persName>Ferdinand VII</persName> was proclaimed king in each Spanish-American capital. Shortly thereafter however, and in some places before the proclamation of <persName>Ferdinand's</persName> accession, emissaries arrived with letters from the Ministers and Council of the Indies, announcing the abdication of <persName>Ferdinand</persName>, and the confirmation of all the governors and officials by <persName>Joseph Napoleon</persName>, the new king. This aroused intense opposition. The <placeName>French</placeName> successes in the <placeName>peninsula</placeName>, however, left the colonies with the suspicion that Spanish power had disintegrated, and the subsequent action of the royalists of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and the Spanish Cortes only added to the confusion. A number of leaders who had been
<pb n="2"/>
working toward independence were quick to seize the opportunity, and in first one capital and then in another, organizations were effected and revolutionary agencies set in motion.</p>
            <p>The Spanish rule was centered in important cities in which Viceroys appointed by <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> were in authority, supported by garrisons of soldiery. The body of citizenry aside from the native Indians was composed largely of European <hi rend="italic">emigrés</hi>, many of whom had long been settled in the country and some of whom had inter-married with Negro blood. This Creole population exploited the Indian natives wherever possible and in consequence the natives looked to the Spanish authority for what redress it was possible for them to obtain, and remained sympathetic to the Spanish rather than to the revolutionary cause in most districts. Climatic and geographical surroundings played an important part in the ultimate division of the continent into republics—frequently a nationalistic division would have been hard to discover. The struggle in the south was successful earlier than that in the equatorial section where the leadership of <persName>Bolivar</persName>, after countless reversals, was to be triumphant.</p>
            <p>After the achievement of the independence from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> there were frequent upheavals. Many were of a purely local nature, some being due to individual ambition or assertiveness and some being little more than neighborly quarrels over boundaries or privileges. Occasionally the struggles were bloody
<pb n="3"/>
ones, but the distances to be overcome sufficiently increased the difficulties of warfare under tropical or semi-tropical conditions to prevent many movements on a large scale. In addition, the problems of financing any prolonged conflict wielded an even greater influence.</p>
            <p>The decorations issued under such circumstances are of necessity of a more or less makeshift nature, and the record of them is often difficult to obtain, and is sometimes to be had only from the decoration itself. As more stable conditions were brought about the record becomes clearer. It will be seen, that accuracy of statement with regard to some of these decorations is impossible, and that difference in descriptions of awards is to be expected. In the following accounts of decorations awarded by South American republics, a citation is made of the authority responsible for the statements recorded, and this is supported wherever possible by photographic reproduction of the respective medals.</p>
            <p>The object of this monograph is to treat <hi rend="italic">only</hi> of the medallic awards—those which were made to be worn on the person—and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the embroidered insignia of honour given by some governments of Latin <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Many of the Spanish-American countries awarded to their military heroes, in place of a medal, an <hi rend="italic">Escudo</hi> or embroidered shield or plaque. These varied in size, design and colour, but all were excellently executed, being usually embroidered in gold
<pb n="4"/>
thread on a brilliant background of silk, such as light or dark blue, or red; and sometimes on a white or black ground. The contrast of the gold on the coloured silk made quite as distinguishing a decoration as a silver or gold medal such as many of the European countries bestow.</p>
            <p>One of the earliest of such <hi rend="italic">escudos</hi> was awarded by the government of <placeName>Buenos Aires</placeName> for the troops taking part in the battle of Tupiza in Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> November 7, 1810. It was an oval, 2 × 2½ inches, of white silk embroidered with a silver corded edge, within which was the inscription also in silver cord, <hi rend="italic">LA PATRIA A LOS VENCEDORES DE TUPIZA</hi>.</p>
            <p>Another attractive <hi rend="italic">escudo</hi> is that given by the same authority for the battle against the Spanish forces at the estate called "<placeName>La Florida</placeName>," on the banks of the river Piray in Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> on November 9, 1814. This too is of white silk, heart-shaped, 2¾ inches, × 2½ embroidered with light blue silk. The outer edge represents a laurel wreath, then the motto <hi rend="italic">A LOS VENCEDORES EN LA <placeName>FLORYDA</placeName>,</hi> then a corded border. In the centre are two crossed palm branches and three stars, the whole making a most attractive insignia of honour, when sewed on the breast of the uniform coat.</p>
            <p>This form of decoration varied in size from an oval 2 × 1½ inches to 3½ × 2¾ inches. As they were attached to the uniform they naturally soiled easily and were not well preserved; hence they are not
<pb n="5"/>
often to be found by the collector, even though awarded as late as 1872. (<persName>Rosa, <hi rend="italic">Leyes</hi>
               </persName>, p. 130.)</p>
            <p>Some of these shields or <hi rend="italic">escudos</hi> were made of metal and worn on the uniform's coat-sleeve. These were generally awarded to the troops. It is the intention to include herein all such metallic awards, where information is obtainable.</p>
            <p>During the Spanish Colonial period in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> many medals and decorations of honour were awarded to the royalist troops. Some of these were authorized by the home government in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, such as the Order of St. <persName>Ferdinand</persName>, the Order of <persName>Isabella</persName> the Catholic, the Cross for <placeName>Carthagena</placeName> de las Indias and many others for <placeName>Cuba</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</placeName>. These will not be included here, having already been described in Spanish Orders of Chivalry and Decorations of Honour.</p>
            <p>The intention of the writer is to include herein only those decorations for military services which were issued in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</placeName>, first by the local Spanish authorities and later by the several republics, after they had obtained their independence. Before the separation of the several colonies, many medals and <hi rend="italic">escudos</hi> were authorized by the various Viceroys and Captains General, who apparently did not need the sanction of the home government to reward the royalist forces. Most of these were designed and executed within the several colonies, and but little information concerning them is obtainable. Possibly the records were destroyed

during or after the various wars for independence; it would be natural that the patriots should wish to obliterate all reminders of the Spanish regime, under which they had suffered.</p>
            <p>In preparing a record such as this, one succeeds only with the help of one's friends. To the officers of South American countries who have provided information, and to the consular officers of the United States who have aided, grateful acknowledgement is hereby made. To <persName>Charles H. Roberts</persName>, Esq., of <placeName>Buenos Aires</placeName>, I would express deep appreciation for valuable assistance. To Mr. <persName corresp="#numismatics_noe">Sydney P. Noe</persName> I am deeply indebted—without his help these pages might never have been completed.</p>

            <p>The territory of <placeName>Argentina</placeName> was discovered by the Spaniards, and settled in the 16th century. In the last quarter of the 18th century the <hi rend="italic">Colonies of the Plata</hi> included all of the country now known as <placeName>Argentina</placeName>, <placeName>Bolivia</placeName>, <placeName>Uruguay</placeName>, <placeName>Paraguay</placeName>, and the <placeName>Pacific</placeName> provinces later ceded to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</placeName> by <placeName>Bolivia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>. The capital was <placeName>Buenos Aires</placeName>. The revolution for freedom from Spanish rule was started May 25, 1810, under a provisional junta, and six years later the independence of the <hi rend="italic">United Provinces of the Rio de La Plata</hi> was proclaimed. In January, 1825, these became the <placeName>Argentine</placeName> Republic or Confederation. From 1835 to 1852, part of the country was under the Dictatorship of <persName>Juan Manuel de Rosas</persName>. <placeName>Buenos Aires</placeName> separated itself from the Confederation in 1852; seven years later, however, it rejoined the Republic of <placeName>Argentina</placeName>. By the treaty of 1881, <placeName>Patagonia</placeName> and <placeName>Terra-del-Fuego</placeName> were divided between <placeName>Argentina</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Republic of <placeName>Argentina</placeName> authorized many awards to officers and soldiers—embroidered shields or plaques, cordons and other evidences of honour; these are omitted from this paper as the intention is to treat only of the medallic awards worn on the person, and conferred for military services.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR <persName>PERDRIEL</persName>. This was authorized September 5, 1806, for those who took part in the
<pb n="10"/>
engagement at the village of <persName>Perdriel</persName>, 22 km. from the Capital. The English forc.es under General <persName>William Beresford</persName> attempted to seize <placeName>Buenos Aires</placeName> in June and July of that year. It is a cast, oval medal, 32 × 22 mm., surmounted by a ribbon or fillet of the same metal. The obverse displays the arms of the city of <placeName>Buenos Aires</placeName>, two sailing ships, with a dove of peace in the upper field and an anchor in the lower. On the ribbon is <hi rend="italic">U<hi rend="sup">a</hi>T<hi rend="sup">s</hi> RC<hi rend="sup">o</hi>Q<hi rend="sup">s</hi>T<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> de B<hi rend="sup">s</hi> A<hi rend="sup">a</hi>

               <p>MEDALS FOR <placeName>CERRITO</placeName> and <placeName>MONTEVIDEO</placeName>, 1812–1814. After the <placeName>Buenos Aires</placeName> declaration of independence in 1810, the Spanish forces made their headquarters in <placeName>Montevideo</placeName>.

In 1808, the governor of that section had established an independent junta. During the royalist occupation of the city many attempts were made by the patriots to drive them from the stronghold. The first medal of award for the <placeName>Argentine</placeName> troops was an oval of silver, 41 × 31 mm., having on the obverse the engraved legend <hi rend="italic">LA PATRIA A LOS VENCEDORES DEL 31 DE DICIEMBRE DE 1812 Y LIBERTADORES DE <placeName>MONTEVIDEO</placeName> EN JUNIO DE 1814</hi>, encircled by laurel and palm branches.

               <p>The medals for <placeName>Cerrito</placeName> are ovals, gold plated or of silver, 32 × 30 mm. The medal proper is surmounted by a knot of ribbon, the loop of which serves as a suspension ring. The medal has as its design the rock from which the engagement takes its name, surmounted by a radiant sun. Encircling this is <hi rend="italic">LA PATRIA RECONCIDA A LOS LIBERTADORES DE <placeName>MONTEVIDEO</placeName>
                  </hi>. For the second battle of <placeName>Cerrito</placeName>, a medal 39 × 31 mm. is inscribed as above with the addition of <hi rend="italic">DIC 31 DE 1813</hi>. For the later engagements an oval silver medal, 24 × 22 mm., with laurel branches below and a double

            <p>The earlier history of <placeName>Bolivia</placeName> is inseparable from that of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>. In the Spanish Colonial period it was called Upper <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>, and was part of the vice-royalty of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>. <placeName>Bolivia</placeName> became independent in 1829, and was united with <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> from 1836 to 1839; a separation was forced by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</placeName> who feared the federation. <placeName>Bolivia</placeName> was attacked by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</placeName> in 1879, and for four years carried on a war in which she was assisted by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Because of <placeName>Bolivia's</placeName> connection with <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>, some writers have classed as <persName>Bolivian</persName> certain medals which we believe to belong to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>, and the reader is referred to those recorded under the latter country for an inclusive list.</p>
            <p>The geographical position of <placeName>Bolivia</placeName> imposed on that country all of the disadvantages of isolation, even in times of peace. In consequence, we find that decorations of the country bear evidences that they are of native manufacture and not highly finished. Most of them seem to have been made at the national mint at <placeName>Potosi</placeName>. They partake of the nature of the coins issued there, in the making of which the <placeName>Potosi</placeName> mint had long been engaged.</p>
            <p>In the Cabinet of the American Numismatic Society there is a collection of seal impressions from medal-dies still in possession of the <persName>Bolivian</persName> mint
<pb n="43"/>
and from these it is possible to deduce something about the making of these medals. The illustration of the Medal for <placeName>Socabaya</placeName> will disclose a radiant star, silver gilt, and a planchet of silver bearing the same star from the same dies. This star must have been struck first in the circular form and the plain segments then cut away, leaving the star as it is now seen. Another medal in which the same procedure seems to have maintained is the decoration for <placeName>Ingavi</placeName>. It is not certain whether the medals were issued in the round form and later cut out by the individuals to whom they were awarded or whether there may have been no intention of having them altered from the original rounded form. It is hoped that further details regarding this procedure may be brought to light.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR AYOHUMA, 1815. The battle of Ayohuma, near <placeName>Potosi</placeName>, was one of the engagements lost by the revolutionists during the struggle for independence. General <persName>Manuel Belgrano</persName> (1770–1820), led the <placeName>Bolivian</placeName>-<placeName>Argentine</placeName> forces against those of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. The Spanish medal for this engagement, awarded by General <persName>Joaquin de la Pezuela</persName>, is a silver rhomboid, 54 × 39 mm., having around the sides <hi rend="italic">RECUPERO LAS PROV D <placeName>POTOSI</placeName> Y CHARCAS<ref target="#CH3-n1a">1</ref> EN LA BATALLA</hi>, and in the center is <hi rend="italic">A YOHUMA 14 DE NOVRE DE 1815</hi>.</p>

The same year —April 22, 1500—the Portuguese navigator <persName>Pedro Alvarez Cabral</persName>, took possession of the land under a dictum of the Pope, who had assigned the territory to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName>. It was a colony of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName> until 1807, when <persName>Joan VI</persName> and <persName>Queen Maria I</persName> (having established a regency in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2267057">Lisbon</placeName>) fled from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName> with their governmental staff and here established their kingdom during the Napoleonic wars in the <placeName>Peninsula</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Independence from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName> was declared September 7, 1822, and an Empire formed by <persName>Dom Pedro I</persName>. (<persName>Antonio-Pedro</persName> de Alcantara of <placeName>Bourbon</placeName>, 1798–1834). He was compelled to resign in 1831 in favour of his son <persName>Pedro II</persName>. (1825–1891).<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
            </p>

            <p>Several of the orders of chivalry which had been established in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName> for several centuries, were transferred to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName>, and established there by laws of October 20, 1823 and revised or reorganized by the decree of September 9th, 1843.

            <p>THE ORDER OF <placeName>CHRIST</placeName> consisted of three classes: Grand Cross, Commanders and Chevaliers. The decoration was a red-enamelled cross with expanded and flattened ends, on which is superimposed a cross of white enamel; the whole being suspended from a radiant star bearing a flaming heart. The ribbon is bright red, edged with light blue.</p>
            <p>THE ORDER OF AVIS, consisted of a green-enamelled cross with elongated fleur-de-lys ends, suspended from a radiant star bearing a flaming heart, save the lowest grade which was a plain cross. The ribbon is dark watered-green edged with red.</p>

            <p>ORDER OF <persName>SAINT JAMES</persName> OF THE SWORD. This decoration, of three classes, was a red-enamelled cross (similar to the Cross of Avis), save that the lower arm was shaped like a two-edged sword. The first class plaque bore a replica of the cross on a radiant star of silver. The second class decoration was surmounted by a star bearing the flaming heart and that for the third class was a plain cross as above described. The ribbon was dark purple edged with light blue.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE TOWER AND SWORD. This fifteenth century Portuguese decoration was likewise taken to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName> by the royal family when they fled to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</placeName>, and it was officially revived in that country on May 13th, 1808. It was discontinued on the establishment of the Republic in 1891. The decoration is a five-pointed white-enamelled star, ball-tipped, superimposed on a green-enamelled wreath, with a gilt tower above. On the white-enamelled centre medallion is a green wreath with a sword, encircled by a blue-enamelled band inscribed VALOR E LEALDADE.

            <p>ORDER OF THE SOUTHERN CROSS. This decoration was first instituted on December I, 1822, by <persName>Dom Pedro I</persName>. (1778–1834) and given the name of the Constellation of the South, or Southern Cross. <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName> was first called the Land of the Holy Cross because of this constellation. It was discontinued at the time of the revolution of 1889, when the empire was overthrown, but revived on May 22,1890, by the republican government as a reward of merit. There are four classes, Grand Cross, Commanders, Officers and Chevaliers. The first decoration was a ball-tipped, double-pointed, five-armed cross of white enamel surmounted by an imperial crown and superimposed upon a wreath of tobacco and coffee plant leaves. On the light blue centre medallion is a cross of stars encircled by a dark blue band inscribed <hi rend="italic">BENE MERENTIUM PRAEMIUM</hi>. The reverse medallion of gilt bears the head of the emperor facing to the left encircled by a dark blue band inscribed <hi rend="italic">PETRUS I BRASILIAE IMPERATOR.<hi rend="sup">D</hi>
               </hi>. When the order was revised in 1890, the style of the cross in the centre was changed to five stars, arranged as they appear in the Southern Cross constellation, and the crown was replaced by a five-pointed star on a wreath. On the reverse the centre medallion bears a female head of Liberty encircled by the inscription <hi rend="italic">ESTADOS UNIDOS DO <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName>

The decoration is a five-pointed, ball-tipped, white-enamelled star surmounted by an imperial crown, with gold rays in the angles. On the centre medallion of white enamel is a gold phoenix, rising from a crown, and holding (in its claw) an ancient crown. On the breast is a shield bearing the initials <hi rend="italic">P.

               <p>The city was founded in 1552, and named for <persName>Pedro de Valdivia</persName>, a Spanish soldier and the conqueror of this section of the country. It was occupied by the Spaniards until February, 1820, when it was captured by the patriots under Cochrane after a three day fight. The decoration is of gold and of two sizes in silver. The gold form has a six-pointed star with rays in the angles, surrounded by a green-enamelled wreath of laurel, the whole suspended from a ribbon bar in the form of an oval laurel wreath. The star has a white-enamelled rim bearing the inscription <hi rend="italic">RESTAURADOR DE LA PATRIA</hi>. The field is divided horizontally— above are the remains of a ruined fort, below quills and an ink well on a book at the left and a mailed arm holding a sword upright to the right. The silver form of this medal is of two sizes (45 and 40 mm.) at the greatest width. The inscription and the arms on the star are the same but there is no enamelling of the silver star. It has ball tips, and the rays completely fill the angles between the points. From <persName>Medina's</persName> illustration it seems possible that the silver medals may have been issued in circular form without having been cut out just as appears to have been the practice in <placeName>Bolivia</placeName>, compare page 42.</p>

               <p>NAVAL MEDAL FOR <placeName>IQUIQUE</placeName>. In 1879, the <placeName>Bolivian</placeName> authorities seized some property of the Chilean Nitrate Company in <placeName>Antofagasta</placeName>, then a part of the <placeName>Bolivian</placeName> province of <placeName>Atacama</placeName>. This brought about a war in which <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> sided with <placeName>Bolivia</placeName>. It was known as the War of the <placeName>Pacific</placeName>,
<pb n="114"/>
or the Nitrate War. At its close <placeName corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</placeName> took possession of all the Bolivian sea-coast (the provinces of <placeName>Tacna</placeName> and <placeName>Arica</placeName>) and the Peruvian province of <placeName>Tarapaca</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The first naval engagement took place at <placeName>Iquique</placeName>, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>, when the Chilean ships, "<persName>Esmeralda</persName>" and "Covadonga" essayed to blockade that port. The Peruvian vessels, "Huascar" and "Independencia" attempted relief. The "<persName>Esmeralda</persName>" was sunk by the "Huascar" and the "Independencia" ran ashore while pursuing the "Covadonga." Later the "Huascar" was captured by the "Covadonga" (October 8, 1879) near Puerto Lamar, <placeName>Antofagasta</placeName>, and the Peruvian navy ceased to exist.</p>
               <p>To reward their seamen, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</placeName>, by a decree of September 12, 1879, authorized this medal of gold or silver, in the form of a shield framed in green-enamelled laurel branches, bearing on the obverse a vessel, the whole being superimposed on an anchor and flanked by flags.</p>
               <p>On the reverse is, <hi rend="italic">

            <p>The Spaniards discovered this region in the 15th century and soon thereafter commenced its settlement. Various adventurers assumed control over sections of the country. In 1514 these districts were united into the province of Tierra-Firma. In 1564 the Spanish monarch, <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii_spain">Philip II</persName> (1556-1598) styled it <placeName>New Granada</placeName>, which name was continued until the overthrow of Spanish rule in the early part of the 19th century. Included in this title was the present territory of <placeName>Colombia</placeName>, <placeName>Ecuador</placeName> and <placeName>Venezuela</placeName>. Under the leadership of <persName>Simon Bolivar</persName>
               <ref target="#CH6-n1a">1</ref> after declaring their independence in 1819, the three sections were united as the Republic of <placeName>Colombia</placeName>. <placeName>Venezuela</placeName> withdrew in 1829 and <placeName>Ecuador</placeName> in 1830, and soon after the Republic of <placeName>New Granada</placeName> was established. Civil wars were frequent among the various departments but these terminated in 1861, when at the Congress of Bogata the <placeName>United States of Colombia</placeName> was established. In 1886 the Republic of <placeName>Colombia</placeName> was formed. <placeName>Panama</placeName> seceded in 1903 and declared itself free and independent.</p>
            <p>The history of <placeName>Colombia</placeName> is linked up with that of <placeName>Venezuela</placeName> and <placeName>Ecuador</placeName>, and with the viceroyalty of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>, so decorations and war medals issued prior to 1831 are seldom to be distinguished. Likewise,
<pb n="124"/>
several of the medals attributed to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> may also be classed with those of <placeName>Colombia</placeName>; but these have been treated under the respective countries and will be found elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The Cross for Junin and the Medal for Junin will be found described under those of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>, although the Congress of <placeName>Colombia</placeName> decreed on February II, 1825, that special honours and insignia be accorded to <persName>Bolivar</persName> and to <placeName>Sucre</placeName>, and awarded similar pieces to those of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>. At the same time decorations were awarded to the troops from Colombia taking part in the victory at Junin in August, 1824.

It was of gold for the officers and silver for the men, and is a green-enamelled cross with triple-pointed arms, ball-tipped at the centre points. On the obverse medallion is a gold head of the king, encircled by a white band inscribed <hi rend="italic">A SU REY <persName>FERNANDO</persName> CONSTANCIA Y FIDELIDAD</hi>, and on the reverse white medallion is <hi rend="italic">VENCEDORES DE <placeName>CARTAGENA</placeName> DE INDIAS</hi>.

<pb n="129"/>
1819 this cross was created August 8, 1919, by Decree No. 1667 and awarded to the officers and men of the army of <placeName>Colombia</placeName>. It is a Maltese cross of 50 centimeters diameter, having on the obverse the flag of the republic, enamelled in colours, encircled by a gold band inscribed <hi rend="italic">CEN-TENARIO DE <placeName>BOYACA</placeName>
               </hi> and on the reverse 1819–1919. The ribbon is light blue. The cross was of silver for officers and of bronze for the troops. On April 17, 1922, the award was modified and its award to eminent foreigners was permitted. The decoration was altered to three classes, gold, silver and bronze. On the obverse the bust of the liberator (<persName>Bolivar</persName>) replaced the national flag and the inscription was changed to <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName>COLOMBIA</placeName>—CENTENNIAL OF <placeName>BOYACA</placeName>
               </hi>. The reverse was also changed and the inscription read <hi rend="italic">1819—7 DE AGOSTO DE 1919</hi>. A third change was made in 1927 when the third class was discontinued. The first class of gold was to be awarded to ministers, diplomats and generals, both native and foreign. The second class of silver to lesser officials. Later the same year a still further change was to have been made, creating five classes, similar to the Order of the Legion of Honour of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and similar orders, but no confirmation of this has been obtained.</p>

            <p>From the time <persName>Francois Pizarro</persName> (1471–1541) discovered <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> in 1530 and the Spaniards occupied the seacoast, <placeName>Quito</placeName> and its adjacent territory remained part of the viceroyalty of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>. From 1710 until 1722 it was part of the viceroyalty of Santa Fé, but it was restored to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> in 1723. The people of <placeName>Ecuador</placeName> with <persName>Bolivar</persName>'s aid succeeded in securing their independence in 1822, after the battle of <placeName>Pichincha</placeName>. In 1819 a confederation had been effected between <placeName>New Granada</placeName> (<placeName>Colombia</placeName>), <placeName>Venezuela</placeName> and <placeName>Ecuador</placeName>. This was known as the Republic of <placeName>Colombia</placeName>. In 1828 political differences arose with <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> and these resulted in the occupation of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3658666">Cuenca</placeName> and <placeName>Guayaquil</placeName> by Peruvian troops; but after the Ecuadorian victory at <placeName>Tarqui</placeName> in the following year, peace was restored. In 1829 <placeName>Venezuela</placeName> withdrew from this triple alliance, and the following year the present Republic of <placeName>Ecuador</placeName> was established.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR <placeName>PICHINCHA</placeName> 1822. While <placeName>Ecuador</placeName> was under the government of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> and during the wars for independence, a battle was fought, May 24, 1822, on the side of Mount <placeName>Pichincha</placeName> near <placeName>Quito</placeName>, at an elevation of 10,200 feet. The people of <placeName>Guayaquil</placeName> led by <persName>Antonio José de Sucre</persName> (sent by <persName>Bolivar</persName>) and reinforced by <placeName>Argentine</placeName>, <placeName>Peruvian</placeName> and Chilean troops defeated the Spanish

forces. Two days after this battle the Spanish general, Don Melchor de Aymeric, capitulated and the independence of <placeName>Ecuador</placeName> was assured. On May 29, 1822, the municipality of <placeName>Quito</placeName> created this decoration, of gold for the officers and of silver for the troops. The medal, 35 mm. in diameter, bears a twelve-armed star the arms of which are interlaced with a laurel wreath. The obverse medallion has in the centre three mountain peaks surmounted by a radiant sun, above which is <hi rend="italic">LIBERTADOR DE <placeName>QUITO</placeName>
               </hi> and below <hi rend="italic">ANO DE 1822</hi>. The reverse is inscribed <hi rend="italic">EL CABILDO DE <placeName>QUITO</placeName>
               </hi>. The medal is surmounted by an oval laurel wreath for the ribbon, which has equal stripes of red, blue, and yellow.</p>
            <p>A variant is oval in form, 38 × 42 mm., displaying on the obverse within laurel branches, a shield crowned with a liberty cap, bearing a sun-burst, flags and a horn of plenty and inscribed <hi rend="italic">A LOS LIBERTADORES DE <placeName>QUITO</placeName>

               <p>CROSS FOR INDEPENDENCE. What is believed to be an Ecuadorean decoration is in the writer's cabinet, though no authority has been found describing it. A white-enamelled gold cross, double-pointed and ball-tipped, is surmounted by two green-enamelled scrolls attached to the suspension ring. On the white medallion in figures of gold is 1831, presumably the year of its creation. Encircling this is a blue enamelled band inscribed in gold letters GUERRA DE INDEPENDENCIA<hi rend="sub">*</hi>.</p>
               <p>If this is of <placeName>Ecuador</placeName>, it was probably created in 1831 to commemorate the final independence of the present republic.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF MERIT. This is awarded for civil and military acts of distinction, and has three classes. The first is a gold medal with a yellow ribbon; the second of silver with blue ribbon and the third class medal is bronze suspended by a red ribbon.</p>
               <p>The decoration is circular in form, composed of twelve rays, interlaced with a laurel wreath and suspended from an oval wreath for the ribbon. On the centre medallion are the arms of the republic in relief (three mountains and a radiant sun) encircled by a band inscribed <hi rend="italic">REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR—AL MERITO</hi>.</p>

            <p>This interior republic of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</placeName>, first settled by the Spaniards in 1536, was attached to the viceroyalty of <placeName>La Plata</placeName> in 1776. The colony declared its independence of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> in 1811, but refused to join the <placeName>Argentine</placeName> Confederation. It was under various dictatorships from 1814 to 1865. The last was that of <persName>Francisco Solano Lopez</persName> (1826–1870) who brought on the war against <placeName>Argentina</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName> and <placeName>Uruguay</placeName>, which ended so disastrously for <placeName>Paraguay</placeName>. The constitution of the present republic was adopted in 1870.</p>
            <p>The six war-medals issued by the government of <placeName>Paraguay</placeName> described here were all created by the Dictator <persName>Lopez</persName>, for engagements in the war against the Triple Alliance. <persName>Lopez</persName> and his country were completely shut off from the outside world and were compelled to make such medals as were authorized. Some of the decorations were engraved, and one was cast, supposedly in his arsenal, by <persName>Charles</persName>, whose name appears on one medal as the designer. In consequence, the <placeName>Paraguayan</placeName> decorations are seldom pretentious—their rarity is some compensation for their lack of finish.</p>
            <p>The writer is indebted to <persName>Mr. Charles H. Roberts</persName> of <placeName>Buenos Aires</placeName> for much of the information of the <placeName>Paraguayan</placeName> medals contained herein.</p>
            <p>NATIONAL ORDER OF MERIT. This was created at <placeName>Asuncion</placeName>, April 8, 1865, by <persName>Lopez</persName>, the
<pb n="137"/>
               <persName>Marshal</persName>-President of the Republic and Commander-in-Chief of the Army. It was intended to have several grades with an enamelled decoration, but owing to the isolation of the country this was impossible, and the only known specimens are of chased gold, though some recipients are said to have painted theirs. The decoration is a five-pointed ball-tipped star with crossed cannon in the angles, superimposed on a laurel wreath and surmounted by a similar wreath, tied with a knot of ribbon. On the medallion is a star encircled by <persName>HONOR ET GLORIA</persName> and on the reverse <hi rend="italic">PREMIUM MERITI</hi>. The ribbon was purple with three narrow stripes of red, white and blue each side. This award was for military merit during the five years' war against the Triple Alliance. The plaque, without the suspension wreath, is about double the size of the cross.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR RIACHUELO. Instituted at the army headquarters of <placeName>Humaita</placeName>, July 2, 1865, for those taking part in the engagement against the allied navy at Riachuelo on the <placeName>Parana</placeName> River near <placeName>Corrientes</placeName>, on June 11–13, 1865. It is a cast medal 30 mm. in diameter, bearing in the obverse center <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>EL MARISCAL</persName> PRESIDENTE,</hi> encircled by <hi rend="italic">AL 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> REGIMENTO DE ARTILLERIA A CABALLO,</hi> with two crossed cannon and cannonballs below. The whole is encircled by a laurel wreath. On the reverse, within a laurel wreath is

               <hi rend="italic">RIACHUELO 11 Y 13 JUNIO 1865</hi>. The ribbon is black with blue edges. The medal was of gold for the superior officers, of silver for junior officers, and of copper for soldiers.</p>
            <p>CROSS FOR CORRALES. Authorized by <persName>Lopez</persName> by a decree issued at army headquarters at Paso de la Patria, February 13, 1866, for the troops taking part in the engagement near <placeName>Corrientes</placeName> on January 31st. The decorations were engraved sheets of silver for officers and similarly made pieces of copper for soldiers, in the form of a cross with trefoil ends. These crosses were about 58 × 42 mm. in size. On the obverse is engraved <hi rend="italic">VENCIO EN CORRALES 31 ENERO 1866</hi>. The reverse is plain and the ribbon is blue with a white stripe in the centre, and is attached to a ring affixed to the back of the cross.</p>
            <p>MEDAL FOR TUIUTI, 1867. Created by decree of November 15, 1867, issued from headquarters at Paso Pacú. At the second battle of Tuiuti on the third of November, 1867, although the forces of <persName>Lopez</persName> were defeated by the allied armies, this medal was authorized to reward his surviving soldiers. It is of bronze, 35 mm. in diameter, having on the obverse centre military trophies encircled by the inscription <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>EL MARISCAL LOPEZ</persName> A LOS BRAVOS DE TUIUTI,</hi> and on the reverse, within a laurel wreath <hi rend="italic">3 DE NOVIEMBRE 1867,</hi> below which is <persName>

            <p>This part of the Empire of the Incas was conquered by the Spaniards in 1533–34 under <persName>Francisco Pizarro</persName> (1471–1541); the viceroyalty of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> was established at <placeName>Lima</placeName> in 1535.

               <p>THE ORDER OF THE SUN. When General <persName>José de San Martin</persName>, the <placeName>Argentine</placeName> liberator of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3895114">Chile</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>, reached <placeName>Lima</placeName>, he created this order by a decree dated at the <hi rend="italic">Palacio Protectoral de <placeName>Lima</placeName>
                  </hi>, October 8, 1821, for the purpose of rewarding those who had especially distinguished themselves in that campaign and in order to replace the Spanish Order of <persName>Isabella</persName> the Catholic. The decoration (uniface) was of gold or silver, 33 mm. in diameter, in the form of a radiant sun, having in the center a circular enamelled band enclosing a circular boss. The upper part of the band is white and is inscribed in red <hi rend="italic">EL <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName>;</hi> the lower part of red is inscribed in white <hi rend="italic">A SUS LIBERTADORES</hi>. The ribbon is white. This decoration was awarded to those who had rendered distinguished service in the campaign, including <placeName>Argentine</placeName> and Chilean officers—in consequence, it is sometimes classed with the decorations of

those countries. (The order was discontinued by a decree of March 9, 1825.)</p>
               <p>The ORDER OF THE SUN was reëstablished by a presidential decree of April 14, 1921, to be awarded to Peruvians as well as foreigners, for both civil and military merit.</p>
               <p>While article 7 of the decree states that "The insignia shall be determined," no official information has come to our notice, of its ever having been actually issued; although <persName>Guadagnini</persName> states the order had five classes and illustrates the plaque and officer's decoration. The latter is in the form of a radiant sun of eighteen gilt rays surmounted by a green-enamelled laurel wreath. On the centre is a medallion within a similar wreath and the inscription. The ribbon is coloured magenta.</p>

Although the independence of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3932488">Peru</placeName> was declared in 1821, the Spanish retained control of some sections in the interior of the country for a considerable time. <persName>Simon Bolivar</persName> had come from <placeName>Colombia</placeName> to aid the Peruvians who were commanded by General <persName>José de Lamar</persName>. The Spanish forces consisted of 9000 troops under the <persName>Viceroy La Serna</persName>, while the patriots had but 5780 men under General <placeName>Sucre</placeName>. The final battle in this campaign was fought at <placeName>Ayacucho</placeName> (<placeName>Ayacucho</placeName> was formerly called Huamanga or Guamango) on December 9, 1824, and lasted about one hour. The Viceroy and all his officers were captured and Spanish power in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</placeName> was at an end.</p>

               <p>MEDAL FOR <placeName>CALLAO</placeName>, 1826.

The first European settlers in this country were the Spanish Jesuits, who arrived in the 17th century.

The city was defended by General <persName>Paz</persName>, who was also assisted by <persName>Giuseppe Garibaldi</persName>, the great Italian patriot, who had gone to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</placeName> about the middle of the century. <persName>Garibaldi</persName> led his "Legion" in the battle of <placeName>San Antonio</placeName>, near <placeName>Salta</placeName>, in northern <placeName>Uruguay</placeName>, in February, 1846, for which, by decree of February 25, 1846, their standard was inscribed in letters of gold, <hi rend="italic">"Hazana del 8 de Febrero de 1846 realizada por la Legion Italiana a las ordens de <persName>Garibaldi</persName>."</hi>

            <p>In the index which follows the names of the medals described in this monograph are listed in a single alphabet. Names of the countries in which the medals are believed to have originated are indicated by abbreviations in the parentheses following the name of the medal or decoration. The asterisk signifies that the piece so indicated is illustrated on the plates—usually on the plate immediately preceding or immediately following the page indicated. When several medals or decorations have been issued for the same battle or the same city (e. g. <placeName>Abtao</placeName>), the order is alphabetical by countries rather than chronological. Medals whose origin is in controversy are listed under the countries to which they are attributed in this monograph.</p>
