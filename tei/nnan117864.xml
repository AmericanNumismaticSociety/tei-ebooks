            <p>The little hamlet of <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName>, closely surrounded by ancient hüyüks and other vestiges of pre-classical as well as classical remains,<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> is situated just across the <placeName>Eyghri Özü</placeName> river in a southwesterly direction from the modern town of Köhne, Vilayet of <placeName>Yozgat</placeName>, in central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Anatolia</placeName>. There, sometime in the early part of 1930, was unearthed by persons unknown a small earthenware pot containing twenty-eight ancient silver coins dating from the last half of the Fourth Century B.C. These coins had been variously struck in the mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>. The hoard was seized by a member of the local Turkish Gendarmerie who transmitted it into the hands of his superior officer stationed at Köhne. There the hoard was seen and secured by <persName>Dr. H. H. von der Osten</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> in charge of the Anatolian Expedition of the Oriental Institute of the University of <placeName>Chicago</placeName>. The coins were then cleaned of their accumulated dust and, together with the fragments of the pot, photographed. Eventually the entire hoard was taken to <placeName>Ankara</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> and delivered by <persName>Dr. von der Osten</persName> to His Excellency <persName>Aziz Bey</persName>, Director of Antiquities of the Ministry of Public Instruction.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>The earthenware vessel, which once contained our little hoard, was indeed badly smashed by its finder, but fortunately enough of the fragments remain to allow of a partial reconstruction which gives an idea of its original shape and size (cf. Plates I and II). The measurements and description are as follows:</p>

uniformly fine condition, that is, only slightly circulated or not at all, and with surfaces untouched by corrosion. Obviously the coins had circulated from hand to hand but little before being consigned by their former owner to the clay receptacle in which they were ultimately found.</p>
               <p>The four coins (nos. 1–4) from the mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName> require little comment except to remark in passing that only two of them have been tested in antiquity for a suspected copper core. This may mean something in the light of the present writer's own collection, whose ten Amisian sigli show no test cuts whatever. Similarly, in the <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi>, of the two hundred and twenty-six <ref target="#CH7-n7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref> specimens there described (nos. 1–6) no less than two hundred and thirteen are without chisel cuts and only thirteen with. Even if the compilers were not always scrupulously exact<hi rend="sup">7</hi> this great disproportion between the tested and the non-tested pieces is very striking indeed. As we shall see, the Amisian issues would appear to have enjoyed a higher reputation in ancient times for their honesty than the contemporaneous ones of either <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Wroth, in the British Museum Catalogue, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pontus">Pontus</placeName>, etc., p. 13, divides the early inscribed issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName> into two groups which he dates <hi rend="italic">"circ.</hi> B.C. 400–360" and "after <hi rend="italic">circ.</hi> B.C. 360" respectively. Our nos. 1–4 all belong to Wroth's second group. He is surely right in thus dis-
<pb n="8"/>
tinguishing two styles, and his dating for coins similar to ours cannot be far wrong as indicated by their presence in the <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> hoard. The <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> more vaguely assigns them all, without distinction of style, to "<hi rend="italic">IV<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Siècle avant J.C</hi>."</p>
               <p>The fourteen specimens from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> mint in our hoard fall into two groups. The earlier is represented by but one example, no. 5. This particular group is characterized by the absence of the <hi rend="italic">aplustre</hi> symbol on the obverse and, following the <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi>,<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> may be assigned to the first part of the Fourth Century B.C. With regard to the actual specimen in the <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> hoard, its general style is so poor, the details thick, clumsy and ugly, the letters uncertain, uneven and so badly made that the coin may well be considered as a barbaric copy of the genuine issue. Even in ancient times its authenticity seems to have been especially questioned as it is the only coin in the entire hoard that has been disfigured by two chisel cuts. One cut was deemed sufficient to prove the honesty of the remaining pieces.</p>
               <p>The thirteen other drachms from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> all belong to the group bearing the <hi rend="italic">aplustre</hi> symbol and further characterised by the triple pendant to the nymph's earring.

               <p>The thirteen specimens of the group before us bear the names of eight magistrates, unfortunately however not including that of IKEᓬIO (<persName corresp="#nomisma_hikesios_maroneia">Hikesios</persName>, father of Diogenes the Cynic), the presence of whose name on this series was the determining factor in persuading the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> to revise the datings of this group.<ref target="#CH1-n13">

               <p>Three of the fourteen drachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> before us lack chisel cuts.

The appearance and condition of the four specimens in the <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> hoard support although they do not necessarily prove the contention. Really definite proof of a post-Alexandrine date for these Athena staters is to be found in the position of Baaltars' legs. They are not placed parallel to each other as on all earlier coinages as well as on the earliest issues of Alexander himself, but the right leg, from the knee

                  </ref> Much earlier than that date the Athena type Persic staters could not well be, and they therefore represent the latest coins in our hoard which can be closely dated. As two of them, nos. 25 and 27, display some faint signs of abrasion on their highest points, i.e. on the helmet visor as well as on the nose and lips of Athena, these particular specimens must have been in circulation for at least a little time before their burial. Taking all of these factors into consideration we appear justified in placing the burial of the hoard somewhat roughly between <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 325 and 320 B.C. By the last of these dates the leading authorities are now agreed that the sigli of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName>, the drachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> and the staters of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName> had all alike ceased to be coined.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the acceptance of such a date for the interment of the <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> hoard causes certain interesting if minor anomalies to appear. Particularly noticeable is the fact that it contained no coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>, although his important mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>—the most natural source of coinage supply for the lands to the north of the <placeName>Taurus Mountains</placeName>—had commenced coining with the new types immediately after his arrival in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cilicia">Cilicia</placeName> in the spring of 333 B.C.<ref target="#CH1-n20">

to be in any general circulation there. The circulating medium during the reign of <persName>Ariarathes I</persName> would obviously still remain just the type of coins which our burial-pot contained—coins which for years had constituted the accustomed media of exchange along the inland highroads<ref target="#CH1-n25">

The mere absence from our hoard of any coins bearing <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> name and types does not therefore necessarily imply that the hoard must have been buried before the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> arrival in Asia Minor.</p>
               <p>More surprising appears to be the total absence of the half staters (Persian sigli) bearing the types of Baal Gazur on the obverse and the griffin attacking the stag on the reverse which <persName>Ariarathes I</persName> struck in his capital of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gaziura">Gaziura</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n26">

               <p>Three possible assumptions to explain these discrepancies are open to us. Either the hoard was
<pb n="14"/>
buried before <persName>Ariarathes I</persName> became sufficiently independent to dare to assume coinage rights, or the coins in question were not struck by <persName>Ariarathes I</persName> but by his son and eventual successor <persName>Ariarathes I</persName>I, or—if the latter supposition be considered absolutely untenable—there may have existed some special reason why the former owner of our <hi rend="italic">peculium</hi> saw fit to reject from it the issues of his lord and master in favor of the more widely circulating coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Before discussing and eventually adopting one or the other of these three explanations we should consider, very briefly, the probable regnal years of <persName>Ariarathes I</persName>, as they have some bearing upon the subject. Most historians follow the opinion that he ruled Pontic Cappadocia (either as local dynast or Persian Hyparch with his capital at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gaziura">Gaziura</placeName>) from the days of <persName>Artaxerxes Ochus</persName> down to <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 331 B.C. when, during the confused times attending <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> invasion of Asia, he was successful in adding to his dominions also the territories of <placeName>Southern Cappadocia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n28">

<pb n="15"/>
gard to the commencement of <persName>Ariarathes</persName>' reign it would appear preferable to follow the majority opinion according to which <persName>Ariarathes I</persName> was indeed the octogenarian of <persName>Lucian's Macrobii</persName>, having been born <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 404 B.C., that he ruled for many years at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gaziura">Gaziura</placeName> in Pontic Cappadocia and that later, taking advantage of the troublous conditions brought about by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> expedition, he acquired Southern or <placeName>Tauric Cappadocia</placeName>, which he ruled until his death in 322 B.C.</p>
               <p>Because of the conflicting views of his historians the coins of <persName>Ariarathes</persName> have been assigned to extremely divergent periods of his reign. <persName>W. H. Waddington</persName>

               <p>In examining the arguments of these various students one fact soon becomes apparent, namely that without exception they all appear to assume—most of them categorically, a few with somewhat veiled hesitancy—that the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName>an types of <persName>Ariarathes</persName>, as well as the similar coins of his unknown predecessor, one <persName>Abdssn</persName>, were all actually produced at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> itself. Considerations of style and fabric make any such supposition appear highly problematical to the present writer.. The second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> does, however, make an important stride forward when it discards the quite impossible earlier opinion that the autonomous drachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> which bear the aplustre ornament on their obverses <hi rend="italic">succeeded</hi> the similar issues with Aramaic inscriptions of <persName>Abdssn</persName> and <persName>Ariarathes</persName>. Every criterion of style proves clearly that the hard, dry, lifeless and rather weak die-cutting of the latter can only be explained by supposing that they were produced in imitation of the much finer autonomous Sinopean coins. Compare figs. 1, 2, and 3 (representing typical specimens of these Aramaic coins in the writer's collection) with the true Sinopean examples from our hoard illustrated on Plates III and IV. If these Aramaic coins had been produced immediately preceding or im-
<pb n="17"/>
mediately succeeding the true issues and at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> itself—as previous writers all suppose—there seems to be no valid reason why the former should not have been similar in style and the equal in excellence of the latter. The Sinopean issues of the Persian Datames present a case in point. His issues,<ref target="#CH1-n39">

imitation of the well known and widely accepted coinages of that city. The employment of Aramaic instead of Greek letters for the inscriptions—in comparison with the procedure of Datames in a similar case—suggests if it does not actually prove our contention that the former coins were made by non-Greek die cutters and at some other mint or mints.</p>
               <p>It seems clear that the Sinopean autonomous issues which bear the <hi rend="italic">aplustre</hi> in the field, in front of the nymph's head wearing a triple pendant earring, must immediately follow <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 350 B.C.) the latest issues of the plain type as described by <persName>Mr. Robinson</persName> on pp. 14–5 of his article mentioned above. How long this <hi rend="italic">aplustre</hi> series lasted can hardly as yet be definitely determined. In view of the fact that the names of at least thirty-five different magistrates are known to have signed the coins we may safely follow the <hi rend="italic">Recueil</hi> in continuing them down to at least <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 320 B.C. In the meanwhile, the petty dynasts or aspiring satraps <persName>Abdssn</persName> and <persName>Ariarathes</persName>, desiring to issue money of their own, did so—employing types which did not need advertising or explanations. Theirs was an obvious procedure of which countless similar instances are known in the coinages of all ages and climes.</p>
               <p>With regard to <persName>Ariarathes</persName>, the obvious supposition lies to hand that he imitated the contemporaneous issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> while he was still petty
<pb n="19"/>
dynast or Persian Hyparch of Pontic Cappadocia at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gaziura">Gaziura</placeName>. This imitative coinage would have commenced before his acquisition of Southern <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cappadocia">Cappadocia</placeName> and may even have continued for a little while after that important event. These coins were then followed by his more pretentious Baal Gazur half staters, after he had widened his dominions so as to embrace all <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cappadocia">Cappadocia</placeName>. These royal coins were of course direct imitations of the satrapal issues of <placeName>Mazaeus</placeName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName>, which latter coins our hoard proves were still circulating in central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Anatolia</placeName> as late as the last quarter of the Fourth Century B.C.</p>
               <p>Our reasoned opinion has been stated above that the contents of the pot found near <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> indicate that it could not have been buried before 333 B.C., probably nearer 325–320 B.C. Hence it must have been interred after the first appearance of <persName>Ariarathes</persName>' Sinopean imitations. All modern numismatists, with the single exception of the historian Droysen,<ref target="#CH1-n40">
                     <hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                  </ref> are agreed in assigning these coins to <persName>Ariarathes I</persName> rather than to the second of that name who ruled from 301–280 B.C. The same is true of the Baal Gazur type, which would hardly have been adopted as late as <persName>Ariarathes I</persName>I's reign, by which time the prototypes of Mazaeus at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName> must surely have all but totally disappeared from commerce in favor of the now rapidly spreading Alexandrine coinages. Thus two of the three possible explanations en-
<pb n="20"/>
visaging the curious absence from the hoard of <persName>Ariarathes</persName>' own coins have been removed.</p>
               <p>There remains then the third alternative, namely that the former owner of the hoard must have had some special reason for eliminating <persName>Ariarathes</persName>' issues from his pot. Now it is a well known fact, commented upon by scholars,<ref target="#CH1-n41">

specimens in the writer's collection, give a grand total of grammes 97.63 for the nineteen examples, or an average of grammes 5.138 per coin. If then we take the average of 5.144 for <persName>Ariarathes</persName>' Sinopean imitations and the 5.138 for his Baal Gazur half staters and, further, compare these with the 5.821 for the standard drachm of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> and the 5.502 for the standard siglos of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName>—we discover a very good and sufficient reason why the original owner of the <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> hoard should have retained for daily use such Cappadocian coins as he happened to possess, the while he buried for future purposes his coins of fuller weight and wider currency. If we should further assume that the hoard may have actually been deposited in 322 B.C., during or just after the disastrous defeat of <persName>Ariarathes</persName>, we can practically envisage the thoughts of its owner. To him it would be much to be feared that henceforth the light weight Cappadocian coins might no longer be of any other than bullion value and that therefore he might better keep them to hand either to melt down or otherwise get rid of at the earliest possible moment. More acceptable coins, such as the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName> issues which would surely still retain their circulating value, he could cheerfully consign to the comparative safety of Mother Earth. In other words, we see before us a typical example of the working out of <persName>Gresham's</persName> well known law. Thus the absence from the
<pb n="24"/>
                  <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> hoard of any specimens of <persName>Ariarathes</persName>' coinages is neither very strange under the circumstances, nor does it in any way invalidate our supposition that the hoard itself was buried at some period in the decade after 333 B.C.</p>
               <p>A burial somewhere between the years 325 and 320 B.C. has been indicated on page 11. Not content with this, the further suggestion was hazarded that the burial actually took place in and around the year 322 B.C. in direct consequence of the troublous times accompanying the downfall and death of <persName>Ariarathes I</persName> in the spring or early summer of that year. This estimate is determined, on the one hand, by their state of preservation and by the presence in the hoard of the Athena staters of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName> which stylistic and technical criteria show cannot have been struck before 327 B.C., and probably first appeared <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 325 B.C. On the other hand, the total absence of any coins of Alexander the Great clearly indicates that the hoard could hardly have been put away long after the conquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cappadocia">Cappadocia</placeName> by <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_i">Perdiccas</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_philetaerus">Eumenes</persName>. The immediate consequence of the acquisition of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cappadocia">Cappadocia</placeName> would surely be the introduction therein of coins <ref target="#CH1-n45">

                  </ref> of Alexandrine types to pay such Macedonian troops as Eumenes retained and to link the new province commercially with the remainder of the empire. After 320 B.C. Alexandrine coins must have become familiar sights along the highroads of 
<pb n="25"/>
commerce and military administration which crossed the province from north to south and from east to west. In 320–19 B.C. the invasion of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cappadocia">Cappadocia</placeName> by <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonus</persName> with a powerful army, his marches and countermarches during his struggle with <persName corresp="#nomisma_philetaerus">Eumenes</persName> which culminated in the famous siege of Nora, must all have helped to disseminate coins of Alexandrine types far and wide throughout the province. The total absence of any such coins would therefore appear significant and would tend to confine the burial of the hoard to the years before <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 320 B.C. So far as our scanty historical sources allow any conclusion, the years following <persName>Ariarathes</persName>' acquisition of <placeName>Tauric Cappadocia</placeName> and its amalgamation by him with his dominions in Pontic Cappadocia appear to have been entirely peaceful until the day of the Macedonian irruption in 322 B.C. There therefore would seem to be nothing unlikely about our further belief that the <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> hoard was buried during, or as an immediate consequence of, the devastating invasion of the country by the Macedonian forces in that year.</p>
               <p>The all too brief account of <persName>Diodorus</persName>, partially supplemented by those of <persName>Plutarch</persName> and <persName>Nepos</persName>, does not permit us to follow the strategical details of the actual invasion or to determine the sites of the two battles—in the last one of which over four thousand Cappadocians are said to have perished 
<pb n="26"/>
and <persName>Ariarathes</persName>, together with his family, fell into the hands of the victors. <persName>Emil Reich</persName> on map XIV of his <hi rend="italic">Atlas Antiquus</hi> indicates, in a general way, his conception of the route from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> necessarily followed by Perdiccas' army along the Euphrates, across that river at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_zeugma">Zeugma-Apamea</placeName>, thence following the old highroad that led past <placeName corresp="#nomisma_doliche">Doliche</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_ad_taurum">Antiochia ad Taurum</placeName> (the later Germanicia) and so into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cappadocia">Cappadocia</placeName> to the important town of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_comana">Comana</placeName>. Thereafter the army's marches together with the moves of their Cappadocian opponents are indicated, to be sure, but they must remain, for the present at least, purely suppositional.</p>
               <p>From a geographical standpoint the find spot of our hoard does not lack a certain amount of interest. As stated above, the hamlet of <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> lies in the immediate vicinity of Köhne. Now Köhne is today—as its predecessor was in antiquity—situated near the crossroads of two very important roads which date back certainly to the Hellenistic period and probably to far earlier times. From <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tavium">Tavium</placeName> (now Büyük Nefez Köi) a highroad ran (cf. map), and still runs, easterly through <placeName>Corniaspa</placeName> (modern <placeName>Yozgat</placeName>

                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gaziura">Gaziura</placeName> (modern Turkhal); the other and more southerly road running from Köhne via the later <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sebasteia_heracleopolis">Sebastopolis</placeName> (modern Zulu Serai) to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_comana">Comana Pontica</placeName>. The important south-north highroad, close to which <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> is situated, crossed the west-east road at Köhne. Of this south-north road, according to <persName>Dr. von der Osten's</persName> personal assurance to the present writer, there still exist everywhere important traces and actual remains. Commencing at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tarsus">Tarsus</placeName> this highroad ran through the famous "Cilician Gates" to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyana">Tyana</placeName> and thence to <placeName>Mazaca</placeName> (the later <placeName corresp="#nomisma_caesareia_cappadocia">Caesarea</placeName> and the modern <placeName>Kayseri</placeName>). Continuing thence in a northerly direction it crossed an important branch of the <placeName>Konak Su</placeName> at <placeName>Boghazlajan</placeName>, then the <placeName>Konak Su</placeName> itself either by a ford situated between the modern <placeName>Kadilli</placeName>

                  </ref> and thence northwards to Köhne. From Köhne it continued in a generally northerly direction to the modern Çorum where it divided, the western branch running north by west to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> (modern Sinop) on the Black Sea, the eastern branch running north by east to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amisus">Amisus</placeName> (modern Samsun) also on the Black Sea.</p>
               <p>It is most interesting, therefore, to note that our hoard was found in close proximity to a location of great strategic and commercial importance, 
<pb n="29"/>
namely the crossing point of the two most important routes in all this district. Furthermore, the hoard is notable for containing specimens of the coinages of each of the three ultimate termini of the great south-north road. Was its owner a merchant engaged in the carrying trade between these three important centres of commerce, or is it only a pure coincidence that his savings should have comprised issues of these three, and only of these three, mints? Was our hoarder, perhaps, the owner of a much-frequented <hi rend="italic">han</hi> where were accustomed to sojourn the traders, merchants and caravans passing along these busy routes with their goods? Who can tell?</p>
               <p>In any event, the <placeName>Küchük Köhne</placeName> hoard proves to be a most interesting relic from the early beginnings of an independent Cappadocian kingdom. Above all it offers us an indication of just what kinds of money constituted the most acceptable media of exchange in central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Anatolia</placeName> just preceding its invasion by the ubiquitous coinages of the Alexander type.</p>
