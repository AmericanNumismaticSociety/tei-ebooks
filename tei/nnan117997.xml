            <p>The difficulties inherent in establishing the chronology of the moneyers of the Roman Republic are only too well known. It is hardly necessary to
               present an account of the work done over the last century, or to remark that at many points certainty seems as far removed as ever. Only three
               years ago we saw that Broughton at any rate felt that whatever work had been done on the problem had achieved results only conjectural at best.
               For he excluded the moneyers from his annual arrangement of magistrates and relegated the lot to an appendix in the second volume, listing them
                  alphabetically.<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Pink has constructed a scheme covering the entire period, but his publication wants the essential argumentation which could establish his
               results as permanent.<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> In fact, they are already being challenged.<ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> Any work, then, which can cast the smallest light on the problemâgranted that there be light rather than the generation of more heatâought
               to be of some value.</p>
            <p>Yet, although the problem be justly attacked, one may question whether the fine detail given below is really necessary to the presentation of the
               solution. The answer is twofold. First, obviously the problem could be stated, the method briefly described, and the solution revealed. But in no
               way would the final position be any stronger than the author's word. Without the solid foundation of proof pre- <pb n="viii"/> sented, the
               solution would become, for the reader, simply one more amid the dozens of conjectures. One may witness the attacksâjustifiable attacksâon both
               Pink and Sydenham,<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> both of whom might have been able to make a stronger case for a given attribution if space had been available for the publication of their
               reasoning. The method of this monograph will be to arrive at a solution scientifically, insofar as that is possible; thus the facts determined by
               the method and leading to the solution should be presented fully.</p>
            <p>Second, regardless of the problem at hand, the method itself, may it be suggested, is worthy of consideration. The description of die links as a
               guide to chronology is well known. Many authors have arranged a given mass of coin in sequence by means of the study of the dies used in common
               by two or more pieces.<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> Generally, the number of coins is so great that the individual piece is granted no especial study. Nor need it be. If one proves that,
               say, obverse X is struck only to reverses 4 and 5, it will matter little, in establishing the chronology, if we have a hundred examples of X/4
               and only three of X/5. Similarly, it matters little to prove that the sequence can be X/4, X/5, X/4 <hi rend="italic">bis,</hi> X/5 <hi rend="italic">bis.</hi> For while some importance may reside herein, the one necessary fact is established: that obverse X was used after
               reverses 1, 2, and 3 were consumed, and before 6, 7, or 8 were conceived. <pb n="ix"/> Whatever the significance of the hundred examples of X/4
                  <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> the three of X/5, the chronological sequence remains the same.</p>
            <p>For this reason very little work has been done with the individual piece, with the arrangement <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> of the hundred
               pieces struck from the dies X/4. In that context the results would be almost without value. And the examples of this approach which spring to
               mind are to be found not in the study of ancient coins, but in that of early American.<ref target="#CH1-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> Such fineness in detail may be considered unnecessary; in the problem to be discussed in this paper it is essential. For if it can be
               shown that the sequence X/4, X/5, X/6 is valid, while X/4, X/5, X/4, X/6 is not, the entire result of the paper is altered. For the number 4 or 5
               or 6 will represent here not simply another reverse die, but the reverse die of another moneyer.</p>
            <p>It is essential then that each coin to be considered below be minutely examined. And if the method be seen to have any usefulness, it must then
               be applied more widely to the problem of the arrangement of the Roman moneyers. To be sure, in the latest series the moneyers rarely share a die;
               but the earliest silverâanonymous, or bearing a monogram or symbol, â can ultimately be conquered only thus. If the dies of the period can be
               collected and examined, eventually they must yield the solution for which we have been searching so long. AlfÃ¶ldi, preferring an examination of
               style rather than of die links, has already suggested the same approach.<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> One can hardly conceive how many thousands of coins would have to be examined. Yet if anything is accomplished in this manner, the results
               will stand, permanently, against theory and conjecture. Similarly, the results of this paper are, at <pb n="x"/> least in part, permanent. They
               have been suggested before; they have never before been proved.</p>

               the Cajazzo find and the conclusions of the German scholars. Thus Grueber continued in the old opinion, separating the moneyers into two groups
               and dating them relatively late, Mussidius and Regulus to 39 B.C., <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> and Varus to 38.<ref target="#CH1-n19">

               than that of Mussidius and Regulus. Yet Grueber, writing thirty-three years after the discovery of the Cajazzo hoard, could say, "The addition of

            <p>Cesano followed Grueber in his dating, arguing that the reverse type of the gold struck for <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> by <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>âthe figure of "Pantheus"âcould only
               refer "alla sottomissione ed al dominio pacifico dell' Oriente per opera di Antonio stesso," a work which must date to 39 and 38, if not

                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
               </ref> Yet again, the second and most recent English catalogue disperses the moneyers so as to date Mussidius and Regulus to 42 B.C., <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> to 41, and Varus still later to 39.<ref target="#CH1-n26">

               </ref> Sydenham's catalogue includes relatively little discussion of the reasons behind an attribution; no argument is presented to sustain this
               division and dating. Mattingly, in a note on Sydenham's arrangement, restates the other view: "C. Vibius Varus makes a fourth moneyer with
               Longus, Regulus, and <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> in 43 to 42 B.C."<ref target="#CH1-n27">
                  <hi rend="sup">27</hi>
               </ref> Finally, UlrichBansa has assigned to 42 B.C. a college composed of Longus, Regulus, P. <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> Vestalis (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>âP. <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> or C. <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> Vestalis?), and L.

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The point, it appears, remains to be proved one way or the other. It is evident that current opinion has tended toward two positions: 1) The four
               moneyers are to be dated together, as one college; 2) The college did not exist but the issues of the four are very alike. Even so with respect
               to the date of the moneyers: whether they formed a college or no, it is generally agreed that they struck either around 43/2 or about 39/8.
               Neither of the two familiar means of approach has succeeded in establishing the solution, although either <pb n="5"/> might have suggested it.
               Grueber's reliance on non-numismatic evidence as a means of identifying, and thus dating, the moneyers breaks down here on his own admission. For
               three of the four officials are altogether unknown; for Regulus alone can he so much as hazard a guess.<ref target="#CH1-n29">

               </ref> On the other hand, Pink's arrangement of the four as one college is at least partly fallacious, as will be elaborated below, and stands
               ultimately only as long as his entire structure stands.</p>
            <p>This study could marshal and examine the evidence, review the opinions of the past, and assert itself in support of one or the other. But no
               final solution would have been attained; the problem would still remain, to be attacked again and again. It would seem preferable, rather, to
               begin at the beginning, to attempt to approach the problem from an entirely new point of view, to invoke evidence never before considered, and to
               attempt to reach an answer without recourse to either the historical or the <hi rend="italic">Aufbau</hi> method. Each of these will be invoked
               in its turn, but the method of this investigation is to be the study of the coins themselves. Considering them simply as metallic evidence of
               things past, we shall inquire whether they can reveal to us anything pertaining to the function of the moneyer or the pattern of the coinage
               which we do not already know.</p>

            <p>The coins to be considered represent only a fraction of the total output of their respective moneyers. All struck silver of private types.<ref target="#CH1-n30">

               denarii of <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> (as had the moneyers of 44, and Gracchus and Vitulus in 43); <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, Regulus, and Varus struck denarii portraying <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>; while <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> was similarly honored on
               silver of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> and Varus. The purpose of these issues needs not be

            <p>The private types of each moneyer were peculiarly his own. The portrait coinage must then be the closest connection between the officials. But
               the series are not complete; Mussidius apparently struck no portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> or <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> in silver. And while an argument based generally on style can be drawn to some fineness it
               involves a subjective criticism which may not be accepted everywhere. The comparison of these portraits by style will be considered incidentally
               below, but the argument is not strong enough to carry off the victory in the principle struggle: did these moneyers, or any two or three of them,
               pertain to the same college?</p>
            <p>The story of the coinage in gold is much the same. Each moneyer struck private types; indeed all but Regulus struck two.<ref target="#CH1-n32">

            <p>The reverse type is that of Mars disarmed, signaling the cessation of war. Perhaps the Roman actually accepted the symbol, in the hope that the
               proscriptions had ended once for all the divisions in the state. But one is reminded of the types of Hilaritas, Securitas, and Concordia, so
               common in <pb n="12"/> the third century A.D., occuring most often precisely at those times when they meant the least.</p>
            <p>The obverse legend is constant for the <hi rend="italic">triumvir,</hi> the only varieties consisting in punctuation and spacing. All are read
               inward, and all begin at the lower left save for those of dies O.III and O.IV<ref target="#CH1-n44">
                  <hi rend="sup">44</hi>
               </ref> which begin upper right. The reverse legends begin at various points and are all read across or inward, except for those of dies C.Aa,
               C.Ba, and R.Bo which are read outward. It is to be noted that the reverse legends vary: Varus never includes IIII. VIR. A.P.F, <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> and Regulus always do, Mussidius does in the one series but not in the
               other. The position of the dies usually approximates ââ or ââ â rarely ââ or ââ â but the dies were not fixed.</p>
            <p>Granted that all the coins described above portray all the <hi rend="italic">triumviri,</hi> one may yet inquire what justification can be
               offered for the joint consideration of several series of coin struck by moneyers who may very well not have been colleagues. The answer is that,
               in the first place, the obverse types, the portraits, are not common in series; a series of coin portraying each of the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi> is known in only one other instance. We have a group of aurei, certainly not struck at Rome and attributed by Grueber and
               Sydenham to Gaul, which falls into two parts.<ref target="#CH1-n45">
                  <hi rend="sup">45</hi>
               </ref> The first consists of those coins bearing the portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> on one face and
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> on the other, the second, of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> on one face and <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> on the other. The aurei are quite rareâno denarii
               of these types are knownâand no other series can be found which portrays all the <hi rend="italic">triumviri.</hi> Returning to our gold, it
               seems inherently unlikely that several moneyers at random, over a period of years, should have hit on the idea of striking these types in series.
               They much more reasonably must have struck together.</p>
            <pb n="13"/>
            <p>Nor need we rely on a conjectural, or even a stylistic comparison, for a closer connection than type or style has been discovered between the
               series. The <hi rend="italic">terminus</hi> from which we depart was suggested thirty years ago by Bahrfeldt. In assembling and arranging the
               material for us to use, Bahrfeldt discovered a coincidence of cardinal importance: these moneyers, in their gold coinage for the <hi rend="italic">triumviri,</hi> in some cases made use of the same obverse portrait dies.

               </ref> Sydenham apparently knew nothing of this die coincidence, for it would seem to invalidate his dating altogether. Yet one might argue, and
               it would be impossible at this point to disprove, that a number of dies might have been left over at the mint, to be used in some later year by
               another moneyer. That is, although it be very likely that the sharing of one die by two moneyers indicates that they struck in the same college,
               yet the coincidence is of itself no certain proof. Some further evidence would be welcomed.</p>

               <p>This reverse type appears to have been entirely unknown, with any of the three portraits, before the discovery of the Cajazzo hoard in 1878.

                  be the significance of the ninth of October? The date of the meeting near Bononia is not known, but it appears to have fallen at the end of

            <p>Once the study of die linkage is undertaken as a method of chronological arrangement, one must pass beyond the stated coincidences. To ascertain
               not only which coins shared a given die, but the order in which they struck, would be a long step toward the solution of the problem. Although no
               one of the moneyers would be dated to any given year, their relative order might be established. For this reason an exacting study of the dies
               was undertaken. All the coins attributed in the Catalogue to <placeName>New York</placeName>, <placeName>London</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, the <placeName>Vatican</placeName>, and <placeName>Naples</placeName> were studied in the original
               specimen. Casts were obtained of those in <placeName>Glasgow</placeName>, <placeName>the Hague</placeName>, <placeName>Paris</placeName>,
                  <placeName>St. Florian</placeName>, <placeName>Vienna</placeName>, and <placeName>Budapest</placeName>, as well as nos. 41.6, 44.1 and .2,
               47.11 and .12, and 48.7 and .14. The remaining specimens, about one quarter, were studied through photographs. Each coin was examined in the most
               minute detail. The progression of faults and breaks of each die was charted to reveal the chronological sequence of the coins struck from that
               die. The study was not always successful: in some cases the coins could be separated only into groups, not classified individually. In a few
               cases, particularly with respect to reverse dies, no separation was possible. But usually some distinctions could be drawn.</p>
            <p>When each die had been individually considered, the reverse dies were studied together. Something of the mint organization might be revealed by
               their sequence. Clearly, reverse dies could not have been traded about between the moneyers, for they were the signature dies; they could not
               indicate ties between the officials. But they might indicate how each official worked. Several dies offer us no information, either in not
               exhibiting progressive damageâe.g. <pb n="15"/>
               <persName>M.Ec</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n48">
                  <hi rend="sup">48</hi>
               </ref>âor in being paired with only one die, itself not found elsewhereâe.g. R.Boâor in occurring on but a single exampleâe.g. A.VII. These dies
               will not be discussed below, save for the reverse dies of Varus, <hi rend="italic">exempli gratia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reverse dies of C. Vibius Varus are of no assistance. The coins are too rare at presentâwe have only eight examples of this series for the
                  <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi> togetherâand the die arrangement is indecisive. Die V.A was employed with one portrait die of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> and one of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian.</persName> In either
               combination the breaks of V.A are the same, when the area in which they occur is not off the flan altogether. Die V.B occurs only with one
               portrait die of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony.</persName> Only one stage in the life of the die can be assumed for the three
               examples which we possess.</p>
            <p>The reverse dies of L. Mussidius Longus with cornucopia as type are more revealing. The known examples of reverse M.Ac show clearly that obverse
               O.II was struck with this reverse before obverse A.II. Moreover, die M.Bc began, insofar as our examples can indicate, with obverse A.III as
               mate, followed by O.II. The damage suffered by the reverse under the hammer marks the progression clearly. The latest pieces are struck with L.IV
               and, again, A.III. Similarly in <pb n="16"/> the case of reverse die M.Cc, the occurrences of obverses L.V and O.I intertwine in time.</p>
            <p>The second series of Mussidius, nos. 50â2, with Mars as the reverse type, offers a similar variation in the pairing of obverse dies. The gold
               struck to both M.Am and M.Bm may present examples of the random selection of obverse dies, as did those of M.Bc and M.Cc above. Until it is
               possible to divide the coins into smaller groups their exact sequence cannot be established. Certainly the pieces struck from die M.Bm appear to
               have been struck first to the portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName>, then to that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName>, and finally to the head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian.</persName> A
               further point of importance is to be noted: the sequence indicates that obverse portrait A.I, in some cases at least, was used before A.II, an
               element to be considered below in establishing the overall sequence of obverse dies. The evidence of reverse die M.Am exactly contradicts that of
               M.Bm; the sequence of obverse portraits begins with <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>, continues with <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName>, and ends with <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus.</persName>
            </p>
            <p>The reverse dies of Publius <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> add little to the study up to this
               point. None of them occurs with the portrait of more than one <hi rend="italic">triumvir,</hi> for the reverse type was cut with reference to the
               obverse die. Even within these limits only one sequence can be demonstrated. Die C.Al, of which we know only two impressions, was used with, at
               least, two <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> portrait dies. In this case die L.I was employed before L.II. The two
               reverse dies cut for <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName>, as well as the two for <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>, occur each with only one obverse die.<ref target="#CH1-n49">
                  <hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            </p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>Finally, the reverse dies of L. Livineius Regulus. Again, only one of the seven dies is known in combination with more than one portrait die.<ref target="#CH1-n50">
                  <hi rend="sup">50</hi>
               </ref> Reverse R.Ca occurs with three, <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> portraits A.IV, A.V, and A.VI. Clearly A.VI was
               the latest to be paired with R.Ca, in two cases at least. Whether the point can be made in the third case, for no. 48.5, is not clear, nor is the
               relative dating of dies A.IV and A.V yet established.</p>
            <p>Thus far only the production of the individual moneyer has been presented; no connections between the officials have been established. These
               connections will present themselves with the consideration of the portrait dies of the <hi rend="italic">triumviri.</hi> The five series of gold
               consumed in all, as far as we know, seven portrait dies of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName>, seven of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName>, and four of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian.</persName> Of the total of

            <p>Bahrfeldt himself compared a part of the coins which he <pb n="18"/> listed, so that he was able to account for about half of the above
               links.</p>
            <p>Portrait die L.III is found only in the Mussidius series with Mars reverse. Four examples are known, with which appear three reverse dies. The
               order of the moneyer's signature dies may here be traced from the obverse damage: M.Am was the first to be used, M.Cm the second, and M.Bm the
               last. If this order can be shown to be consistent, this evidence may in its turn determine the order of other portraits struck to one or more of
               these reverses.</p>
            <p>The fourth portrait dies of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> occurs with but two reverse dies, V.A and M.Bc. The
               correct order of each moneyer's signature dies will be considered below; that is not to be found here. There is no doubt, however, that in this
               case at any rate Varus used the portrait die before Mussidius. After Varus had struck the one example which we possess, the die broke between the
               forehead of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> and the legend, and that break is to be seen on the three examples
               struck by Mussidius. Immediately Grueber's chronology is wrong, for he had dated Varus to the year after Mussidius' term of office. Similarly,
               Sydenham's dating, Mussidius to 42, Varus to 39, cannot be accepted.</p>
            <p>Die L.V occurs with two Mussidius reverses of the cornucopia type, M.Cc and M.Ec. The obverse damage makes clear that the two dies were used in
               that order. The coins struck from L.VI are relatively common, but the reverse die is the same in all cases, R.Al.</p>
            <p>The portrait dies of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> are equally helpful. Die A.I occurs in two series, those of
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> and Mussidius with Mars as reverse type. Two reverse dies of
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> were paired to the portrait. Unfortunately, only the
                  <placeName>British</placeName> Museum example of the first pairing, A.I and C.Aa, can easily be read; the only other piece known is
               illustrated in Riccio's catalogue, whose electrotype impressions are too crude for more than simple recognition. The one legible example was
               clearly <pb n="19"/> struck before the remaining <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> pieces produced by <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, which bear reverse die C.Ba. The latter form a group which cannot
               easily be broken down into smaller segments.</p>
            <p>All the examples of A.I with a reverse die of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> preceded those
               with the signature of Mussidius. On the coins which we have the line of demarcation is very clear: on all the examples signed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> the area enclosed by the upper parts of the letters NIV, on the obverse
               die, is totally corrupt. All save no. 45.7 have a clean break from the upper curve of the final C to the dotted edge. In the later series the
               first massive break has been repaired. Some traces remain, but two new breaks are now to be seen between TO and ON. The area about the end of the
               inscription has also been reworked to remove the break observed there: note that on the nos. 45 the dotted edge contains four dots from
               immediately above the vertical of P to above the upper tip of C. When this area was reworked the dotted edge was cut anew, so that five dots
               appear in the place of four on all the examples struck by Mussidius from this die.</p>
            <p>Antony's portrait A.I was paired by Mussidius with three reverse dies, M.Am, M.Bm, and M.Cm. Again, as in the case of the reverses of L.III, M.Am
               is earlier than M.Bm. The position of M.Cm is not clear, for the die was apparently used concurrently with M.Bm.</p>
            <p>The above evidence demonstrates that a second of Grueber's datings must be rejected, for Mussidius is assigned to 39 B.C. in his catalogue,
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> to 38. In accordance with the destruction of die A.I,
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> must have struck his series of gold honoring the <hi rend="italic">triumviri r.p.c.</hi> before the production of the Mussidius series with Mars reverse. So too Sydenham's arrangement is in
               error; it is not possible to agree that Mussidius struck in 42, <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>
               in 41.</p>
            <p>Die A.II is found in three of the five series, the Mussidius series with Mars reverse, the Varus coinage, and the Mussidius series with
               cornucopia reverse. Only one reverse die is <pb n="20"/> found in combination with A.II from each series. The evidence confirms that which is
               presented above under L.IV, that Varus can no longer be dated later than Mussidius.</p>
            <p>Die A.III is found only in the Mussidius series with cornucopia reverse. It appears with three reverse dies, M.Bc, M.Dc, and M.Ec, in that order.
               The latest examples, nos. 42.2 and .6, are again struck from a pairing of A.III and M.Bc. This is one of only two cases in the five series of the
               recurrence of a reverse die; the other lies in the combination of A.I and M.Bm.</p>
            <p>Obverse die A.IV is known in eight impressions, six of them with Regulus' reverse R.Ba. The latest of the eight, no. 48.9, bears reverse R.Ca,
               thus establishing the relation of those two signature dies. The reverse of no. 48.14, die R.Aa, is otherwise unknown. It clearly preceded some of
               the examples of R.Ba, and probably should be taken as the earliest reverse of its type.</p>
            <p>Die A.V is found on only one coin; from its reverse die, R.Ca, it was determined above that it preceded at least two examples of A.VI. Portrait
               die A.VI occurs only with reverse R.Ca, the consideration of which demonstrated that this obverse must have followed A.IV.</p>
            <p>Of the four portrait dies of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>, O.I is shared by two moneyers, <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> and Mussidius in the cornucopia series. Only two coins are known of
                  <persName>Clodius'</persName> production for <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>, each with its distinctive reverse die.
               The reverse dies, of course, occur nowhere else, and the condition of the obverse in each case is not sufficiently distinctive to allow an
               opinion as to the priority of the striking. Both coins fall before the pieces struck by Mussidius from this obverse. In this group only one
               pairing occurs, with reverse M.Cc.</p>
            <p>Die O.II is found in three series, first with the Mussidius reverse bearing Mars as the type, latterly with a die of Varus and both Mussidius
               types. This large second group can be no further reducedâdie O.II was unusually sturdyâbut the <pb n="21"/> overall pattern follows that set
               above in the consideration of portrait A.II: some of the coins struck to Mussidius' Mars type are earlier than both the Varus pieces and the
               Mussidius cornucopia specimens. Whether or not one wishes to date all the Mussidius Mars reverses before the remaining types, that arrangement
               obtains in at least a number of cases, and we have found no evidence to contradict it.</p>
            <p>With respect to the reverse dies paired with obverse O.II, the three earliest specimens occur with M.Am, while the coins of this series in the
               second group are all found with M.Bm. The evidence of L.III and A.I above, that this was the order of consumption of the two reverse dies, is
               here confirmed. The Varus reverse is the same in all cases, V.A. The usage of the cornucopia dies of Mussidius, M.Ac and M.Bc, cannot be
               disentangled at this point.</p>

               <p>The reader will wish to consult the two tables below, pp.45 and 54, for the linkage and the chronology of each obverse and reverse die. It
                  must be observed that the die designations are, for the moment, completely arbitrary. The obverse dies are identified by the initial of the
                     <hi rend="italic">triumvir</hi> and a Roman numeral: e.g., the four portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>
                  are given as O.I through O.IV. The reverse dies are identified by the initial of the moneyer âV(arus), M(ussidius), C(lodius), and
                  R(egulus)âand a capital letter. Thus, Varus' two reverse dies are V.A and V.B. Since two series were struck by Mussidius, a third, minuscule
                  letter distinguishes between them: M.Cc is the third die of Mussidius in the cornucopia series, M.Am, the first in the series with Mars
                  reverse. Both <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> and Regulus used especial reverses to suit the
                  individual <hi rend="italic">triumvir</hi>: R.Bo designates Regulus' second die for <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>,
                  R.Ca, his third die for <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName>, C.Al, <persName>Clodius'</persName> first die for
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus.</persName> The designations "first die" or "third die" are arbitrary and have as yet no
                  bearing on the chronological arrangement of the dies.</p>

               <p>The paucity of this series of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>' gold is the more to be
                  regretted in that the reverses cut for <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> are of the finest workmanship. Die C.Ao is an
                  example of the best in Roman die engraving of the period. The technique is impeccable: the relief is high, the figures finely proportioned.
                  And, more important, the concept is impeccable. The type is designed to adorn a circular field, it is not cut at random. The curve of Cupid's
                  wing and Venus' head exactly parallels the border of dots. The artist has emphasized the primary importance of the harmony of type, legend and
                  border by breaking the legend at an unexpected point, the better to fit it into the whole. (Cf. the reverse of the Concordia-Cloacina denarius
                  of Mussidius [Grueber, I, nos. 4242-7]: the type is overpowered by the legend. Cf. also reverse die R.Bo: the legend is artifically forced
                  about the figures so as to deny the circular nature of the field.) Unfortunately, the single coin known from die C.Ao is badly battered and
                  holed as well.</p>

            <p>The material in the foregoing chapter having been assembled, it now becomes possible to render an assessment of it, in the hope that some
               conclusions of fact can be reached which will surpass the suppositions of earlier years. Let us begin with the sequence of the signature dies of
               each moneyer as established by the corruption of the obverse dies.</p>
            <p>Varus' two reverse dies are never paired with the same portrait, so that no sequence can be established. But three lines can be traced in the
               Mussidius series with cornucopia reverse. First, obverse die A.III established that reverse M.Bc was followed first by M.Dc, then by M.Ec. M.Bc
               appears a second time after M.Ec. Second, reverse M.Ec was also preceded at some point by die M.Cc, as obverse L.V proves. M.Cc, however, must
               follow M.Bc, for the latter is not found paired with L.V as are both M.Cc and M.Ec. Third, reverse M.Ac is one of the earliest of the series, for
               it is paired to O.II even as is M.Bc. There the order of the two reverse dies cannot be determined. But since M.Bc precedes M.Dc and M.Ec, then
               M.Ac must precede them as well. But M.Bc, M.Dc, and M.Ec are all struck to obverse A.III, while M.Ac was paired with A.II. Therefore M.Ac
               precedes the lot. The final stemma of the cornucopia dies then should be: 1. M.Ac; 2. M.Bc; 3. M.CcâM.Dc; 4. M.Ec; 5. M.Ac <hi rend="italic">bis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not to imply that M.Cc and M.Dc were necessarily used concurrently. That the dies tend to fall into a one by one sequence opposes such a
               conclusion. But it is hardly safe to attempt to reduce the stemma any further. This sequence, established by the examination of the portraits, is
               confirmed by the style of the reverse types. For the two earliest cornucopiae are delicate and graceful, while the lower tips curve <pb n="23"/>
               back to the left and terminate no farther to the right than the axial line of the whole. The cornucopiae of M.Cc and M.Ec have deviated from this
               standard: the body is rather larger than need be, and the whole is thrown off balance in that the tip curves much too far to the right. The dumpy
               and graceless cornucopia of M.Dc is even worse.<ref target="#CH1-n51">
                  <hi rend="sup">51</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>One conclusion to be drawn from this evidence is, that the striking was not organized from the obverse portrait. That is, we might have assumed
               that any authority claimed by a moneyer was but nominal. We know that the <hi rend="italic">aerarium</hi> must have been primary in the thoughts
               of the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi>âeven thus <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> had seized it as one of his first
               acts on entering Rome<ref target="#CH1-n52">
                  <hi rend="sup">52</hi>
               </ref>âand that the power of coinage now depended directly from them, rather than from the senate and the magistrates. One indication of such
               authority would have been the production of coin according to the portrait die; as long as Antony's image was to be seen, any moneyer could have
               signed his name on the reverse. A group of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> gold would be struck with whatever reverse
               dies, in any order or at random, followed by an issue of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> coins or <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> pieces.</p>
            <p>But the evidence of the cornucopia dies is that the case was just the opposite. A chronological arrangement of the coins struck from dies M.Ac,
               M.Bc, and M.Cc has been erected. But the corresponding obverse dies seem almost to have <pb n="24"/> been used at random. Why would a worker
               strike with O.I, for example, put it aside in favor of L.V, and then take it up a second time? That such a sequence was followed is the testimony
               of reverse die M.Cc. Perhaps the worker drew an obverse die at random as he began each day's work. Or perhaps there was consciously an attempt to
               balance the number of coins struck with the portrait of each <hi rend="italic">triumvir.</hi> But in any case, the reverse die, the moneyer's
               signature die, was the limiting element, not the portrait. Ultimately monetary control must have ascended to the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi>
               themselves; no order of coinage would change that. But in the mint itself, in the process of striking, the moneyer must still have filled a
               position of some responsibility, for the coins of each are struck first to his signature. That the position of the moneyer did not change under
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n53">
                  <hi rend="sup">53</hi>
               </ref> or under the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi> ought to be sufficient to show that the responsibilities of the office were not
               initiative.</p>
            <p>The reverse dies of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> vary in type with the <hi rend="italic">triumvir,</hi> so that a stemma ought to be established for each. But only one reverse is known to have been struck to the portrait of
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName>, while the two dies cut for <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> cannot be ordered chronologically by the damage done to obverse O.I. In the case of the dies cut for <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> the results are clearer. The breaks in A.I show that C.Aa was earlier than C.Ba; had either
               been paired with any other obverse the evidence might have been more profitable.</p>
            <p>The reverse dies of Regulus, as those of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, were designed for the
               individual <hi rend="italic">triumvir,</hi> so that again their significance is limited. Only one reverse is known for the <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> gold, which itself knows but one portrait, save for the curious bronze, no. 47 <hi rend="italic">bis.</hi> The reverse of that piece is in no con- <pb n="25"/> dition to allow a comparison with the reverses of the gold coins.
               Two reverse dies occur for the <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> coinage; again, each is struck with its own obverse
               which is not found elsewhere. The <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> coinage offers more variety. Portrait die A.IV
               indicates that three of the four reverses fall into the stemma: 1. R.Aa; 2. R.Ba; 3. R.Ca. The fourth reverse die, R.Da, occurs only once, on no.
               48.10, with an obverse impression which is itself unique.</p>
            <p>Finally, the reverse dies of Mussidius with Mars as type fall into a clear pattern. Obverse L.III establishes the order M.Am, M.Cm, M.Bm. The
               precedence of M.Am over M.Bm is confirmed by both portrait dies A.I and O.II. But in the former case the position of M.Cm is not secondary but
               tertiary. From the evidence of the obverse breaks it appears that the stemma must have been: 1. M.Am; 2. M.Bm; 3. M.Cm; 4. M.Bm <hi rend="italic">bis.</hi>

            <p>When the reverse dies have been ordered, to the extent that is possible, the sequence of the portrait dies becomes considerably clearer. Since
               Mussidius' cornucopia dies M.Ac and M.Bc are the earliest of that series, it must follow that <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> portrait O.II, paired with each of the two reverses, preceded in useâagain, in this seriesâobverse O.I, which occurs only
               with M.Cc. Similarly, portrait L.IV, struck only with M.Bc, was utilized before die L.V, which was paired with reverses M.Cc and M.Ec. Finally,
               since M.Ac preceded M.Dc and M.Ec, the portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> to which they were struck must
               share that order: A.II is earlier than A.III.</p>
            <p>The two coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> bear two differing portrait dies. The damage done to the reverse die,
               C.Al, establishes that obverse L.I preceded L.II. The coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>
               produced for <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> are all struck to the same obverse die, as are those of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian.</persName>
            </p>
            <pb n="26"/>
            <p>The only group of Regulus' coinage which permits examination are the pieces struck for <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony.</persName> Both reverses R.Aa and R.Ba are paired with obverse die A.IV, so that it preceded the other two found with R.Ca, dies A.V
               and A.VI. Although all three comprise the earlier group of gold under R.Ca, the later coins were struck from A.VI. Now one would expect that a
               portrait die would not recur. That die was in higher relief than the reverse, the more difficult to cut, and probably the lower and better
               protected of the two dies when in striking position âthere are more of the reverse dies, for one thing. Each obverse surely was used until
               nothing more could be done with it: the niggardlyness of the moneyer or the indolence of the engraver is illustrated by the repair of obverse
               A.I, as well as the lamentable state of the dies on the latest examples struck from L.V and, again, A.I. If these considerations be correct, the
               first group of coins listed under R.Ca should be broken up so that A.IV precedes, A.VI follows, and the stemma is: 1. A.IV; 2. A.V; 3. A.VI.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Mars series of Mussidius establishes that Antony's portrait die A.I preceded A.II. To be sure, M.Bm occurs twice in the stemma, but
               its own breaks indicate that A.II was the later die in use.</p>
            <p>It has been shown that when each moneyer produced his gold, no effort was made to strike to the portraits in any order. Thus, reverse die M.Bc
               was paired with obverse A.III, then with O.II, and finally with L.IV and A.III again. The only limitation seems to have been that the same three
               portrait dies were employed as long as each was usable. It should, then, be possible to trace the order of each moneyer's production in the
               college or colleges by the obverse dies, whether their dies were thrown together in a jumble, or whether each official had completed his coinage
               before the next began. Again the evidence is not always complete, for not every coin could be classified individually, but it is never
               contradictory.</p>
            <pb n="27"/>
            <p>The chronology of obverse dies determined above by reverse breaks is exactly confirmed as one traces the dies passing among the moneyers. All
               three portraits used by Varusâlet us begin with Bahrfeldt's orderâwere used by Mussidius, two of them in both of his series. Bahrfeldt himself
               noted the one break which proved no. 38.1 to have been struck before nos. 41.1â.2, .7, break no. 3 under <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> portrait L.IV below.<ref target="#CH1-n54">
                  <hi rend="sup">54</hi>
               </ref> Thus some, at any rate, of the cornucopia series struck for <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> were proved
               later than the <hi rend="italic">unicum</hi> of Varus. The other examples of no. 41 were struck from obverse L.V. But it has been shown above
               that the stemma of Mussidius' cornucopia dies proves L.IV to have been used before L.V. Therefore all the Mussidius cornucopia coins struck for
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> are later than the Varus piece.</p>
            <p>Even this step does not prove the independence of Mussidius' coinage; one must consider the coinage by Varus and Mussidius for <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian.</persName> In fact, obverse A.II tells
               exactly the same tale: all three examples produced by Varus are earlier than the pieces from the same die in the cornucopia series of Mussidius.
               Again, the other coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> in this series were struck with portrait die A.III, which by
               virtue of the stemma of cornucopia dies established above must have been in use after A.II. Portrait O.II cannot help us. Most of the coins
               struck from this obverse cannot be distinguished <hi rend="italic">inter se;</hi> those of Varus are at any rate not shown to be later than the
               Mussidius pieces of cornucopia reverse.</p>
            <p>Two of Varus' obverse dies, A.II and O.II, are also to be found in the Mussidius series with Mars' reverse. Portrait O.II is here a bit more
               helpful, for in spite of the difficulty in <pb n="28"/> distributing the coins it is clear that these Mussidius pieces were produced earlier than
               the Varus coins from the same die. The portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName>, A.II, makes the same point as
               definitively.</p>
            <p>Thus the results of the treatment of portraits LIV, A.II, and O.II are rather unexpected. Mussidius' cornucopia series as a whole followed the
               coins struck by Varus, as Bahrfeldt noted for one case. But Bahrfeldt implies, by the manner in which his material is arranged, that the Mars
               series of Mussidius was later still. The contrary is true: not only do the latter pieces precede the cornucopia series, they precede as well the
               coinage of Varus.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> struck with four obverse portraits. Two of them are shared, A.I
               with Mussidius in the Mars series, O.I with the same moneyer in the cornucopia series. In either case the <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> pieces are found to be the earlier. But since the Mars series is the
               earliest of the three discussed above, the <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> coinage must precede
               them all. Portrait die O.I is noted to be the only obverse die which reappears after its substitution by another, for between its two appearances
               occurs obverse O.II under Varus and in both series of Mussidius.</p>
            <p>The stemma of obverse dies as employed by these three moneyers is then established, and the order in which the four series were produced is
               absolutely certain:</p>

            <p>Having arrived at this point, one may be concerned to note that Regulus is omitted from the stemma. A chronology of obverse dies ought to be
               constructed for his coins even as for those of the other three moneyers. The two <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName>
               portraits cannot be separated in time, for that which appears only on the bronze is paired to a reverse impression too badly preserved for study.
               Of the four <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> portraits, three were ordered above in the consideration of reverse R.Ca.
               The fourth, A.VII, is known in but one example, paired with a reverse itself unique, so that it must fall outside the scheme. Finally, each of
               the two portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> is struck to a single reverse, which permits no argument of
               priority. The stemma of the obverse dies used by Regulus is, then:</p>

            <p>The curious fact is that Regulus shares no portrait die with any of the other three moneyers. Apparently Bahrfeldt missed the point, for he
               implies that the interchange of dies was general.<ref target="#CH1-n55">
                  <hi rend="sup">55</hi>
               </ref> Actually there is not a single case of die correspondence. One may argue that the material is weakâas assuredly it isâor that the
               dichotomy is merely coincidental. But the gap is even wider: save only for one case even Regulus' die engravers differ.</p>
            <p>The first two of the three portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, Mussidius, and Varus are both clearly the work of one hand and indeed
               are almost identical. The third die chronologically, A.III, bears rather a better portrait. The relief is higher, the eye is more nearly in
               profile than before, the forward edge of the nose is cut rather than simply <pb n="30"/> traced. The portrait of A.III seems to be by the same
               hand as those of A.I and A.II, but the concept is more plastic, the hand more confident. The portrait of A.III should then be compared with that
               of O.II: both heads are spherical, while the treatment of hair, eye, and ear indicate the same engraver.</p>
            <p>The five <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> dies in the stemma can be broken down by style into three groups. Those
               used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, L.I and L.II, were cut by one hand. The head is rather
               long for its height, the treatment of the hair at the back of the head is linear, the neck and chin are separated by a deep cut. Dies L.III and
               L.IV are the work of a second artist. The head is rather square, the treatment of the hair is plastic, the chin and neck are molded together. Die
               L.III is the more successful in the profile view of the eye. Finally, the portrait of obverse die L.V is small, in high relief, representing a
               round head with a deep Scopaic wrinkle in the forehead. The three hands can equally be distinguished by the cut of the lower edge of the bust:
               the first engraver cuts two small indentations upward but overall the line is almost straight; the second engraver emphasizes the second
               indentation so that the lower right point of the bust curves downward; the third abandons the indentations for a single dramatic swoop
               upward.</p>
            <p>None of the above diesâthat is, all of the stemma save O.I âwas cut by any engraver who cut a portrait for Regulus. Three artists worked under
               Regulus in this series. The first cut the two <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName>, the two <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>, and the best of the four <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName>
               portraits, A.IV. The sensitive portraits are by far the finest of all the obverse dies. One may object that the head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> is much too young for a man approaching his fiftieth year. But the heads are cut with
               delicacy and feeling, the hair is handled with care to preserve its plasticity, the eye is always correctly cut for the profile. All are in
               comparatively high relief. No better portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName>
               <pb n="31"/> exists; that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> was surpassed only after Actium when the concept of his
               portrait had changed entirely;<ref target="#CH1-n56">
                  <hi rend="sup">56</hi>
               </ref> that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> is challenged only by the head of the unique aureus of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> and Octavia in the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> collection.<ref target="#CH1-n57">
                  <hi rend="sup">57</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Two other hands are seen in the portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> produced for Regulus. Die A.VI is rather
               well cut technically, but the quality of the portrait is less than that of A.IV. The back of the head is somewhat misshapen, and the bust below
               is out of balance; for the right point is so lightly cut as to fade away, while the left is distinctly presented. Still, the lower part of the
               bust is reminiscent in style of the fine portraits mentioned above: perhaps we have here a product of the same engraver on an off-day. The third
               (or second?) hand cut two monstrous portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName>, dies A.V and A.VII. The head is
               small and round, the eye too large and incorrectly cut for the profile view, the nose large and awkward. The relief of the whole is low.</p>
            <p>A complete dichotomy between Regulus' dies and those of the other three moneyers is averted at just one point. For although Regulus never strikes
               with a die used by any of the other moneyers, the artist who created his fine portraits also cut obverse die O.I. The latter is more finely cut
               and more realistic in effect than its companion die, O.II; indeed the portraits of O.I and O.IV are almost identical. Thus, although the stemma
               of obverse dies excludes the coins of Regulus, the identification of a common engraver, as well as the historical considerations presented below,
               permit us to continue to inquire whether Regulus might not have been the colleague of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, Mussidius, and Varus.</p>

            <p>It has been indicated above that the fact that a die link exists between two moneyers does not limit them to the same college.<ref target="#CH1-n58">
                  <hi rend="sup">58</hi>
               </ref> Even when the investigation of the die faults is successful, only a relative chronology is the result. To prove that moneyer A used die X
               before moneyer B still does not date the two men to the same year. A may have struck a day or a decade before B. Ultimately, the only way to
               prove the point is somehow to show that A struck both before and after B. They must have coined in some manner so as to overlap. Only then are
               they assuredly and beyond any question colleagues.</p>
            <p>The evidence now is clear that each of the series of gold under discussion is self-contained, each was struck individually. But fortunately for
               us, Mussidius rested from his labors and permitted Varus to coin in the interval between the two series with Mars and with the cornucopia as
               reverse types. Varus and Mussidius, then, are proved to have been colleagues. Neither Grueber nor Sydenham can be followed in this question any
               longer. The coins themselves have solved the problem once for all.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> is not yet assuredly a colleague of the other two. His series of
               gold preceded theirs; that is proved. Theoretically, however, he might have coined a year or two earlier. The answer to this cavil is the
               consideration of the date of the college to which Varus and Mussidius pertained.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> for the production of the gold under discussion is obviously the date of the Lex Titia, <pb n="33"/> November 27, 43 B.C. Before that date the Triumvirate had no legal existence, so that the obverse legend would be impossible. The <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi> is the battle of Naulochus and the defeat of Sextus <persName corresp="#nomisma_pompey">Pompey</persName> in September, 36. For after the victory <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> committed himself to
               the delusion that his second-rate status as primate of Africa, fobbed off on him after Philippi and at Brundisium in 40, could be ameliorated
               only by open defiance of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian.</persName> But Caesar's heir invoked once again the dramatic flair which
               recalled his father, <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> cowered and begged forgiveness, and the Triumvirate became for
               all practical purposes a Duumvirate.</p>
            <p>But the latest date for our gold can be set back still further. The Triumvirate had lasted, legally, for five years, 42 through 38 B.C. When the
               term of office had expired no one dared challenge in law the position which the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi> had taken by force. But
               legalistics prevailed, and all unnecessarily the Triumvirate was renewed, at Tarentum in 37 B.C., as of the first of January of that year.<ref target="#CH1-n59">
                  <hi rend="sup">59</hi>
               </ref> After this date each <hi rend="italic">triumvir</hi> was theoretically <hi rend="italic">triumvir iter r.p.c.,</hi> a nicety observed by
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> in his titulary on the coins.<ref target="#CH1-n60">
                  <hi rend="sup">60</hi>
               </ref> The omission of the iteration dates the moneyers' gold back to 38 B.C. at the latest, the date forwarded by Grueber as the year of office
               of Varus and <persName>Clodius.</persName>
            </p>
            <p>The gold of our four moneyers was struck somewhere between 43 and 38 B.C., inclusive; reason induces us to inquire why the gold was struck at
               all. Each of the moneyers struck gold with a type or types of his own choosing. The Varus aureus with head of Apollo<ref target="#CH1-n61">
                  <hi rend="sup">61</hi>
               </ref> on the obverse and standing <pb n="34"/> Venus on the reverse is the commonest of all Republican gold, save only that struck for <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> by Hirtius. This duality, the private types and the portrait coinage of the <hi rend="italic">triumviri,</hi> makes clear that it was not incumbent on the officials simply to laud their city's leaders. Even when the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi> were to be honored the moneyers' enthusiasm was not boundless.</p>
            <p>The fact that these gold series are unique in conception, the fact that <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> never again
               appears on a coin struck at Rome,<ref target="#CH1-n62">
                  <hi rend="sup">62</hi>
               </ref> the fact that <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>
               never again appear at Rome on the same coin or joined in series,<ref target="#CH1-n63">
                  <hi rend="sup">63</hi>
               </ref> the fact that the moneyers manage to produce gold of types having no direct reference to the <hi rend="italic">triumviri â</hi>all lead
               one to conclude that some special impetus must have motivated the production of these rich and varied aurei. That impetus is most obviously, of
               course, the very inauguration of the Triumvirate. The newest office of the state, nearest to king, is celebrated by the king's own metalâthe
               types are not <pb n="35"/> found in silver. The triumviral portrait gold of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, Mussidius, Varus, and Regulus is to be understood as commemorative of a new beginning for Rome.</p>
            <p>Bahrfeldt had assumed as much, although the manner in which he dated the pieces cannot be accepted. "Die MÃ¼nzen â¦ scheiden sich ohne weiteres in
               zwei durch ihr GeprÃ¤ge wesentlich von einander abweichenden Gruppen. Die GeprÃ¤ge der ersten folgen in ihrer Verschiedenartigkeit ganz dem
               hergebrachten republikanischen Brauche, wÃ¤hrend auf denen der zweiten Gruppe die PortrÃ¤ts und Namen der drei Machthaber <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">M. Lepidus</persName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">M. Antonius</persName> und <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">C. Caesar</persName> mit ihrem Titel III.VIR.R.P.C erscheinen. Daraus folgt unzweifelhaft, daÃ der AbschluÃ
               der Triumvirats in die AmtstÃ¤tigkeit des Kollegiums fiel und daÃ die MÃ¼nzen der ersten Gruppe vor dem 27/11 711/43 geprÃ¤gt worden sind, die der
               zweiten aber danach. â¦ Die GeprÃ¤ge der zweiten Gruppe sind sehr zahlreich. â¦ Ich glaube daher annehmen zu kÃ¶nnen, daB alle diese MÃ¼nzen sich
               nicht auf den kurzen Zeitraum vom 27/11 711/43 bis zum Ende des Jahres zu- sammendrÃ¤ngen lassen, sondern daÃ ihre PrÃ¤gung auch noch in das Jahr
               712/42 hinÃ¼bergreift, die AmtstÃ¤tigkeit dieses Kollegiums also von mehr als einjÃ¤hriger Dauer gewesen sein wirdâ¦"<ref target="#CH1-n64">
                  <hi rend="sup">64</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Bahrfeldt assumes a difficulty where none exists. For he believes that the private types must have been struck before the triumviral portraits.
               The assumption implies that had the Triumvirate been created on the first of January, instead of the twenty-seventh of November of 43, that the
               moneyers of that year would have expended all their energy in producing public types while abjuring the private. But the suggestion is
               gratuitous; P. Accoleius, <persName corresp="#nomisma_petillivs_capitolinvs_rrc">Petillius</persName> Capitolinus, and Marcellinus<ref target="#CH1-n65">
                  <hi rend="sup">65</hi>
               </ref> all struck after the formation of the <pb n="36"/> Triumvirate with no public types at all.<ref target="#CH1-n66">
                  <hi rend="sup">66</hi>
               </ref> Bahrfeldt would also have to explain why, if the moneyers were so zealous in portraying the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi> on their
               gold, they were so haphazard in their silver.<ref target="#CH1-n67">
                  <hi rend="sup">67</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Second, Bahrfeldt skirts danger by suggesting hopefully that the college of 43 might have continued in office in 42.<ref target="#CH1-n68">
                  <hi rend="sup">68</hi>
               </ref> For less than thirty-five days remained in the year after the promulgation of the Lex Titia. A great series of dies had to be cutâwe know
               eighteen obverse and twenty-two reverse to have been usedâand presumably golden flans had to be manufactured. Yet again the difficulty is removed
               by denying it. We know of no reason why the office might have been prorogued, and if Varus and Mussidius struck only in 42 <pb n="37"/> they
               would have had a full year for the production of all the coins which they wished to strike.<ref target="#CH1-n69">
                  <hi rend="sup">69</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it then difficult to fill the college of 43. The key is the discovery that the denarius of L. Servius Rufus bears not the portrait of the
               tribune, Servius Sulpicius Rufus,<ref target="#CH1-n70">
                  <hi rend="sup">70</hi>
               </ref> but that of Marcus Junius Brutus the tyrranicide.<ref target="#CH1-n71">
                  <hi rend="sup">71</hi>
               </ref> Obviously political support of this nature would have been meaningful in the course of only two years, 44 and 43 B.C. The college of 44
               has already been established: M. Mettius, L. Aemilius Buca, P. Sepullius Macer, and C. Cossutius Maridianus.<ref target="#CH1-n72">
                  <hi rend="sup">72</hi>
               </ref> The portrait of Brutus and the coinage of Servius Rufus in general, therefore, can be dated only to 43. His colleagues are assigned on the
               basis of style. Sydenham dated M. Arrius Secondus and C. Numonius Vaala to that year,<ref target="#CH1-n73">
                  <hi rend="sup">73</hi>
               </ref> and undoubtedly C. <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> is to be included as the fourth
                  moneyer.<ref target="#CH1-n74">
                  <hi rend="sup">74</hi>
               </ref> The coins celebrating the formation of the second Triumvirate were struck after the beginning of the following year, when there was
               sufficient time for the preparation of dies and flans. There is then no point to, and indeed no possibility of, predating <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> to Varus and Mussidius, <pb n="38"/> and the three can be taken as
               members of one and the same college, striking in 42 B.C.<ref target="#CH1-n75">
                  <hi rend="sup">75</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Regulus, finally, can be dated no earlier than 42, while there is every reason, as stated above, not to separate him from the other three to be
               assigned to a later year. The problem rather is, when in 42 did he strike with relation to his colleagues. The lack of any die connection with
               the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, Mussidius, and Varus would indicate that those
               three all struck before or after Regulus. His best dies, as we have seen, were cut by the engraver who produced die O.I, the earliest portrait of
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> of the stemma above. But there are indications that the same engraver cut additional
               dies for the moneyers. The portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_mark_antony">Antony</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> on the denarii of Varus are very close to those under discussion.<ref target="#CH1-n76">
                  <hi rend="sup">76</hi>
               </ref> The head is larger, although the relief is no larger, nor is the detail as fine; but the dies were being cut for a series of silver, not
               for commemorative gold, and presumably a number were produced more quickly. The entire concept of the portraits is the same, the hair of the
               heads of <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>
               <pb n="39"/> at any rate is cut always in the same manner on both gold and silver, Antony's wrinkled brow and the eyes and ears of both are
               identical.</p>
            <p>Thus, that the engraver of Regulus' fine dies cut obverse O.I as well cannot date the issue of Regulus' gold. There is, however, a second
               indication of the possibility that Regulus' coins were the earliest of these series. It has been suggested that the moneyers of any given college
               were not equal in rank, but that one held the primacy.<ref target="#CH1-n77">

                  <persName>Plancus</persName>, seems to have remained in the city for the course of the year 42 B.C.<ref target="#CH1-n89">
                  <hi rend="sup">89</hi>
               </ref> Until such an occasion arose, Regulus had another matter to attend: he became one of the moneyers.</p>
            <p>The legend PRAEF.VR occurs on only one part of Regulus' silver coinage. This, however, does not contradict the <pb n="42"/> argument, but rather
               strengthens it: as far as the striking of coin was concerned, Regulus was a moneyer. Even on the PRAEF.VR silver we do not meet, as we might have
               expected, an indication of a special issue.<ref target="#CH1-n90">
                  <hi rend="sup">90</hi>
               </ref> He probably issued first the PRAEF.VR denarii, signifying his position, and then the gold and silver which appear to be the output of an
               ordinary moneyer. It has been commonly assumed that the PRAEF.VR silver must be later than the rest, on the grounds that once the title had been
               assumed it would never have been put by.<ref target="#CH1-n91">
                  <hi rend="sup">91</hi>
               </ref> Thus arose Grueber's interpretation of the title as a temporary honor which supervened in the course of the year. Yet the PRAEF.VR coin
               is, aside from the legend, an ordinary issue, celebrating nothing save the fact that Regulus was PRAEF.VR. But if we conceive that Regulus was
               not a moneyer who happened to become praefect, but the reverseâa praefect assigned to the mintâ the problem is settled at once. The PRAEF.VR
               denarii were in a sense commemorative, an announcement of the position held by Regulus. Once the point was made he continued to strike simply as
               one of four moneyers. Compare the case of Flaminius Chilo who proclaimed that he <hi rend="italic">primus flavit.</hi> Yet only one of his two
               series bears that inscription; had we only his portrait coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> we would never have
               known of the distinction.</p>
            <p>The relative position of Regulus and Mussidius has already been considered by AlfÃ¶ldi in an examination of the style of the portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar.</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n92">
                  <hi rend="sup">92</hi>
               </ref> Here too Mussidius is seen <pb n="43"/> to be the later, for the portrait is both smaller and cruder than that of the coins of Regulus.
               But the <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> portrait of Regulus is in turn smaller than that of Flaminius Chilo, who
               struck during the last half of 43 B.C. Thus Regulus serves as a link between the college of 43 B.C. and his colleagues of 42.</p>
            <p>Accepting Regulus as the fourth moneyer, one returns to Pink to consider why he divides the coinage of 42 B.C. into "regular" and "special"
                  issues.<ref target="#CH1-n93">
                  <hi rend="sup">93</hi>
               </ref> The denarius of Regulus with PRAEF.VR suffers the fate of being classified "special," without any reason having been admitted to justify
               the distinction. But more disturbing, three of our five series of gold are also "special": those of Regulus and <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, and the one Mussidius series with Mars reverse. Now the speciality of
               these issues is supposed to consist in the origin of the metal. The bullion was normally <hi rend="italic">aurum privatum,</hi> purchased on the
               open market. <hi rend="italic">Aurum publicum</hi> (i.e., from the <hi rend="italic">aerarium Saturni)</hi> was to be struck only in an
               emergency, when the metal was not otherwise available.<ref target="#CH1-n94">
                  <hi rend="sup">94</hi>
               </ref> But the suggestion that the moneyer himself supplied the metal used in the mint (<hi rend="italic">aurum privatum)</hi> is backed by no
               evidence, although it has been asserted before Pink.<ref target="#CH1-n95">
                  <hi rend="sup">95</hi>
               </ref> Similarly, the contrast between "public" and "private" bullion is not supported by any Roman source. Actually the only basis for the
               division between these five gold series is the title in the reverse legend, IIII.VIR.A.P.F. And the title remains just a title: these men are <hi rend="italic">quattuorviri</hi> (what else could they be as moneyers?) who strike public gold (what other gold could they strike?).<ref target="#CH1-n96">
                  <hi rend="sup">96</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="44"/>
            <p>Alfoldi is undoubtedly correct in rejecting the whole concept.<ref target="#CH1-n97">
                  <hi rend="sup">97</hi>
               </ref> Every issue was special, insofar as it depended from a <hi rend="italic">senatus consultum</hi> or a vote of the people. All the moneyers
               bore the title whether or not they engraved it on their coins. It was, after all, just that much more to be cut on die after die. If Mussidius
               can honor the <hi rend="italic">triumviri</hi> with a complete series which bears the title, and contrive to produce a second series which always
               omits it; if Varus can refuse to use it while <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName> and Regulus
               include it; and if the series bearing the title <hi rend="italic">precede</hi> those omitting it: then we must reexamine the criteria for the
               division between "special" and "ordinary" issues.</p>
            <p>To conclude, the college of 42 B.C. can now be more clearly conceived. <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, Varus, and Mussidius are proved to have been colleagues. Regulus was undoubtedly the fourth, as one would conclude from
               the type of the gold, the style of the portrait engraving, and the brief historical considerations above presented. The order of the production
               of the gold series is again clear in the case of the three moneyers, while the investigation of Regulus' status in the college makes it probable
               that he was <hi rend="italic">primus.</hi> We cannot construct the order of production of all the series of gold and silver of 42 B.C.; that will
               never be possible. But the gold struck in honor of the second Triumvirate is now arranged: Regulus, <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, Mussidius/Mars, Varus, Mussidius/cornucopia.</p>

               <p>Only two other series are known which bear his portrait: the presumably Gallic gold (see above p. 12); and an issue of gold and silver

                  coins is uncertain but they must be provincial. (One might add the bronze coin of Ephesus, bearing on the obverse the portraits of all three

               <p>Again, the Gallic gold discussed above bears their portraits. Otherwise the two appear together, after the formation of the Triumvirate, on:
                  1. aurei struck in Gaul (Grueber, II, no. 59); 2. aurei and denarii struck in the East by Barbatius, Nerva, and Gellius (II, nos. 98â110); 3.
                  aurei and denarii similar to the last but signed by no official (II, nos. 120â7); the tressis in the bronze coinage called of "the fleet
                  praefects," Bibulus, Atratinus, and Capito, struck in Greece or the East (II, pp. 511 and 515, and no. 154) (<hi rend="italic">pace</hi>
                  Grant, <hi rend="italic">From Imperium to Auctoritas,</hi> Cambridge, 1946, pp. 43ff., who would attribute them to Tarentum). One might
                  include 5. aurei with obverse legend ANTONIVS.IMP, reverse legend CAESAR.IMP, dated to 39 by Grueber (II, no. 90) and Sydenham (no. 1327). The
                  legend opposes so late a date, and Bahrfeldt (p. 47) argues cogently for 43 on the basis of the composition of the <ref target="http://numismatics.org/chrr/id/BOR">Borzano hoard</ref>.</p>

                  is forced to date the office of Mussidius, <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_clodivs_m_f_iiii_vir_a_p_f_rrc">Clodius</persName>, and Regulus
                  originally in 44, continuing through 43, and protruding into 42 B.C. The fourth moneyer is at first Sepullius Macer, his place being filled in
                  about February of 43 by Varus. Only thus can he justify the striking of denarii picturing <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName>, gold and silver of Republican types, silver without the portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName>, and finally the gold under discussion here. The dangers involved in accepting this scheme are enormous; it suffices to
                  remark that the coins of eight moneyers now attributed to 43 B.C. by AlfÃ¶ldi (v. n. 74 <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>) will be dated later (they
                  cannot be dated earlier) only with great difficulty.

Both Bahrfeldt and Gabrici are confuted by
                  the obvious solution: that each moneyer struck the types which pleased him and which made the proper concessions to political reality.</p>

               <p>PRI.FL, then, is only a different way of expressing what III.VIR had meant on the coins earlier. All the moneyers were <hi rend="italic">triumviri,</hi> or later <hi rend="italic">quattuorviri,</hi> but only the head of the college had used the title on his coins. (Cf.
                  AlfÃ¶ldi, "Studien zur Zeitfolge der MÃ¼nzprÃ¤gung der rÃ¶mischen Republik," in <hi rend="italic">Schweizerische Numismatische Rundschau</hi>
                  XXXVI [1954] 28â30, and <hi rend="italic">Studien,</hi> p. 5 n. 1.) Similarly, L. Aemilius Buca is the one moneyer of 44 B.C. to entitle
                  himself IIII.VIR (Grueber, I, no. 4162); both the style and type (the dream of Sulla) of his earliest denarii prove them to have been the
                  earliest of the year. When the portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName> was taken up, a reorganization of the
                  mint apparently took place, for in these series Mettius struck first and alone. (Cf. AlfÃ¶ldi, <hi rend="italic">Studien,</hi> pp. 5â6,

                  Varus strike gold with the inscription IIII.VIR.A.P.F, so that Regulus' priority would have to be indicated otherwise. The link between the
                  old and the new forms of identifying the <hi rend="italic">primus</hi> of the mint will be found in the second college of 43 B.C. Chilo's
                  IIII.VIR.PRI.FL is balanced by Ti. Sempronius Gracchus' IIII.VIR on his aurei and denarii (Grueber, I, nos. 4313â5; Bahrfeldt no. 102).</p>

               <p>A considerable number of aurei are known which were struck by L.PLANC.PR (or PRAEF).VRB during the third dictatorship of <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Caesar</persName>, 46â45 B.C. (Bahrfeldt nos. 20â2). Whether or not the coins were produced at the mint of
                  Rome, or at some provisional establishment, the elected moneyers had nothing to do with overseeing them. Apparently the <hi rend="italic">praefectus urbi</hi> who coined served as the precedent for the creating of the office of <hi rend="italic">praefectus aerarii
                     Saturni</hi> by <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> in 28 as a substitute for the quaestors who had filled that post

                  never bears the legend which would indicate that Regulus was <hi rend="italic">praefectus urbi</hi> in charge of the festivities. The coin
                  reads simply, L.REGVLVS. AlfÃ¶ldi is surely right in regarding Regulus as praefect for the grain supply ("Studien," pp. 23â4); cf. the denarius
                  with modius and ears of grain as reverse type (Grueber, I, nos. 4269â70). Here too the legend is simply L.LIVINEIVS / REGVLVS, so that the
                  denarius with curule chair and two fasces, and the legend REGVLVS.F / PRAEF.VR, must have been meant to be commemorative.</p>

               <p>CIL X 6087 states that <persName>Plancus</persName> was involved in a distribution of land around Beneventum. Broughton assumed the deed to
                  date to 42: "[Plancus] began to distribute land to soldiers at Beneventum [in 42 B.C.]" (p. 357). But the inscription is Augustan and the
                  distribution is not dated; it could as well have been 41. Pink suggests (pp. 40-1) that <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName> was appointed <hi rend="italic">praefectus urbi</hi> not as secondary to <persName>Plancus</persName> or <persName corresp="#nomisma_m_lepidvs_rrc">Lepidus</persName>, but against <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName>'s departure from

            <p>2. Bahrfeldt knew only the Cajazzo specimen, long thought to be unique. This second copy, struck from a different pairing of dies, has now come
               to light. A cast of it, bearing no mark of identification, is to be seen in the British Museum; in <placeName>Berlin</placeName> the collection
               of the Staatliche Museum possesses a wax impression of the coin with a note reading (apparently) "Nervegna", as <persName>Dr. Erxleben</persName>
               writes me, although the coin did not appear in the Martinetti-Nervegna sale (Sambon-Canessa), <placeName>Rome-Paris</placeName>, Nov. 18, 1907.I
               have been able to discover neither its origin nor its present location.</p>

               no. 1581. 5. Ex Prowe coll. 8. The dies are inferred from Bahrfeldt's note, p. 59: "SÃ¤mtliche StÃ¼cke sind stempelgleich." 11. This piece is known
               to me only as an anonymous sulphur cast in the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum. It may represent the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> example.
               12. The cast of the plates has been taken from an electrotype in the <placeName>British</placeName> Museum, again of unknown provenience.</p>

            <p>This strange bronze, now in the Nicholson Museum in <placeName>Sydney</placeName>, was included in the Glendining sale (Henry Platt Hall coll.),
                  <placeName>London</placeName>, July 19, 1950, no.663, and is said to have been earlier in the Museo Kircheriano in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome.</placeName> The coin is altogether unique; it may represent a trial strike of the gold dies. The piece is rather
               worn, and the illustration of the sales catalogue unsatisfactory; I have been unable to obtain a cast of it. But not only is the coin difficult
               to examine through its reproduction, it gives every indication of having been retooled. Thus, on the obverse, the hair of the portrait is too
               deeply cut in back. The reverse die appears to be R.Al: the position of the figure and the legend is the same. But the letters L.RE are not cut
               in the same manner as on the other examples from that die: note especially the wide loop of the R on the bronze, and the dependence of the right
               leg from the loop, not from the vertical of the letter. Similarly, the dots of the border are too widely spaced, as indeed they are too neat and
               clear for a coin wasted by wear and, apparently, corrosion. I am not alto- <pb n="67"/> gether convinced that the piece is a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> product of the mint, or that, if <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, its present appearance represents the piece as it was
               issued. In any case the illustration available to me is inadequate, and its consideration has been almost entirely avoided in this monograph.</p>

            <p>2. Attributed by Bahrfeldt to <placeName>Vienna.</placeName> I am informed by <persName>Dr. Guido</persName> Bruck that the piece is not and has
               not been in the <placeName>Vienna</placeName> collection. I take the reference to be a dittography of no. 51.5 or 51.7. 8. Similarly, Bahrfeldt
               erred in reporting a second example of this type in the <placeName>Gnecchi</placeName> collection, now in the Museo nazionale in Rome. I presume
               the reference to stem from a misreading of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</persName> piece of the same reverse type, no.

               <p>As mentioned above, the catalogue numbers are those assigned by Bahrfeldt; the numbers in brackets are additions to his listings. Bahrfeldt
                  appended to each type the history of each example of that type: place of discovery (when known), previous owners, auction sales in which the
                  coin appeared, as well as any physical peculiarities of the piece. Following his example, I have included all additional information available
                  to me, without repeating that already found in Bahrfeldt.</p>

               <p>I have not attempted to trace the recent history of each of the coins on the market; since almost all are illustrated somewhere the results
                  would not be commensurate with the labor involved, and one sale of Roman gold could undo them all. When the present owner is not known to me,
                  a reference to a previous collection is given.</p>

               <p>Bahrfeldt did not include this piece in his listing although he knew of it. But he relegated it to "Abbildungen," presumably because he lacked
                  the weight of the coin. Since weight is not considered in this monograph, I have included in the Catalogue all the examples known to me,
                  whether in the original or through casts or photographs.</p>

               <p>The three coins attributed to <placeName>New York</placeName>, nos. 41.7, 42.11, and 52.11, pertain to the Durkee collection in the
                  Metropolitan Museum of Art, but are to be found on deposit in the American Numismatic Society.</p>
