            </head>
            <p>The publication of <persName>Howland Wood’s</persName> "Commemorative Coinage of the <placeName>United States</placeName>" by the American Numismatic Society in 1922, was the point of departure for this monograph.</p>
            <p>Since that time, the series has been considerably augmented by the release of ninety additional specimens, of thirty-eight different types.</p>
            <p>It was originally intended some years ago merely to provide a companion volume to that already published, and thereby make available facts and figures pertaining to the subsequently issued pieces.</p>
            <p>In view of the fact that the issue of Mr. <persName>Wood’s</persName> monograph became exhausted, it was deemed advisable to prepare a single volume covering the entire series, thereby bringing to the previous publication additional material which had become available since 1922, as well as a careful emendation of the text.</p>
            <p>From the Columbian issue of 1892 to the Grant coinages of 1922, the present text is still substantially as it originally appeared under the name of <persName>Howland Wood</persName>.</p>
            <p>Every endeavour has been made to make this volume useful as a reference book both to collectors and numismatists; and it is hoped that the supplementary material will prove helpful. Corrections and additional facts will be warmly welcomed by the author.</p>
            <pb n="ii"/>
            <p>So many persons have contributed to the preparation of this work, that it would be difficult to name them all. I wish to express my indebtedness, however, to Miss <persName>M. M. O’Reilly</persName>, of the Treasury Department, to Mr. <persName>John R. Sinnock</persName>, of the Bureau of the Mint, as well as to Messrs. <persName>C. F. Dunn</persName> of <placeName>Lexington</placeName>, <placeName>Ky</placeName>., <persName>L. W. Hoffecker</persName> of <placeName>El Paso</placeName>, <placeName>Texas</placeName>, <persName>Thomas O. Mabbott</persName> of <placeName>New York</placeName> City, <persName>Henry Weil</persName> of the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName> City, and to <persName>Farran Zerbe</persName> of <placeName>New York</placeName> City.</p>
            <p>I wish also to express my appreciation to the staff of the American Numismatic Society, in particular to Mr. <persName>Sydney P. Noe</persName>, Curator and Secretary, and to Mr. <persName>Sawyer McA</persName>. <persName>Mosser</persName>, Librarian, who have placed every facility at my disposal and have been most generous of their time and assistance.</p>
            <p>I am under especially great obligation to the late <persName>Howland Wood</persName>, Curator of the American Numismatic Society, at whose suggestion the preparation for publication of the commemorative issues since the year 1922 was begun, and whose assistance and wide practical numismatic experience made this work immeasurably better throughout. Without his guidance and cooperation, its value would have been considerably less.</p>

            <p>The Commemorative coinage of the <placeName>United States</placeName> during the past few years has taken first place in the attention of many coin collectors in <placeName>America</placeName>. The primary reason for this was the acceleration in the number of issues authorized by Congress, and a corresponding decrease in the number of coins struck per issue at each mint. This resulted in reducing the supply which heretofore had been overabundant. As the number of commemorative issues has increased through the years, the number of persons interested in them has likewise increased, and each new issue has brought forth a new group of collectors.</p>
            <p>The first commemorative coin of the <placeName>United States</placeName> was struck in 1892. It is to be observed that in the period of over one hundred years of <placeName>United States</placeName> coinage preceding no commemorative issues were contemplated.</p>
            <p>The practice of issuing commemorative coins has punctuated the continental European coinages since the fifteenth century, centering particularly in <placeName>Germany</placeName>. Special issues then coined mark events of major magnitude even today, as well as personal anniversaries which chiefly have significance for the respective nation. The European commemorative coinage which developed after the discovery of
<pb n="2"/>
               <placeName>America</placeName>, was expressed largely in silver issues. The quantities of silver from the New World mines depressed the price of silver in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, enabling European nations to advance to larger size pieces, thus inaugurating the ‘dollar-size’ coin.</p>
            <p>The use of coinage as a commemorative vehicle is almost as old as coinage itself, as ancient Greek coins marked treaties, military victories and alliances. The Roman coinage, particularly during the Empire, was replete with commemorative issues, marking many anniversaries, both public and private, naval triumphs, conquests by force of arms, public works, and also the activities of the Emperor.</p>
            <p>The Columbian issue of 1892 was the first American commemorative coin. It might be noted parenthetically, that although the <placeName>United States</placeName> issued a souvenir coin for this celebration, <placeName>Spain</placeName> released only a medal. The legal tender qualities of the Columbian issue were debated at length. The argument was advanced that if legal tender, the coins should be included in the proof-sets of that year. The Columbian issue was not included in the proofsets because of the question of price to the public. The usual procedure was to sell proof coins at a slight advance over their face value—the Columbian Exposition Commission was asking one dollar for these coins. If the Government had included these in the proof-sets of the year, the Commission price could not have been maintained.</p>
            <p>Commemorative coins differ from the regular issues of the year because by authorization of Con-
<pb n="3"/>
gress they are permitted to bear a special design and are not distributed by government agencies. These designs are appropriate for the occasion to be celebrated. In the authorizing Act, Congress usually specifies the number of coins which may be struck, whereas in the regular issues the number of coins struck varies according to the needs of the country.</p>
            <p>In the distribution and circulation of the commemorative issues, there is found a wide divergence when compared with the regular coinage. The regular coinage is delivered either to banks on demand, to the Treasury, or to Federal Reserve Banks, and is released by any of these agencies at par value. Commemorative coins are received by the commission named in the authorizing Act; and these commissions distribute the coins at whatever price they believe they can maintain. The actual monetary usage of commemorative coins, with the exception of some few issues, such as the Columbian, the Pilgrim, the Monroe Doctrine and the Stone Mountain, is practically negligible. The route of the commemorative coin is from the Mint to the Commission, and thence into the hands of the dealer or collector. It is almost certain that the general public is unfamiliar with more than a few of the hundred-odd commemorative issues which have been released to date.</p>
            <p>Every <placeName>United States</placeName> coin is legal tender, and the majority of Acts specify that the coins authorized are ‘legal tender in any payment to the amount of their face value.’ This phrase first appears in the
<pb n="4"/>
               <placeName>Illinois</placeName> Act of 1918. The previous silver coinages, the Columbian half- and quarter-dollar and the Panama-Pacific half-dollar, were therefore legal tender in amounts not exceeding ten dollars. The Lafayette dollar is legal tender to any amount. All gold coins, whether commemorative or standard issues, are unlimited legal tender. There are ten issues of half-dollars, authorized between 1934 and 1936 for which no special legal tender provision was incorporated in the Act; and these issues are legal tender in amounts not exceeding ten dollars. They are the <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName>Boone</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, <placeName>Providence</placeName>, <placeName>San Diego</placeName>, <placeName>Spanish Trail</placeName> and <placeName>Columbia</placeName>, S. C. half dollars.</p>
            <p>The earliest issues which appeared did not bear the mottoes LIBERTY, E PLURIBUS UNUM and IN GOD WE trust. The first two of these mottoes have been used since 1794 and 1795, respectively. "In God We Trust" was first used in 1864. Although all <placeName>United States</placeName> coins have not borne these mottoes, it may be observed that the regular issue of half-and quarter-dollars of 1892 carried them, but they were omitted from the Columbian series. In fact, until 1915 none of the mottoes appeared on commemorative coins. Thereafter, there seems to have been no system about their usage, except that "In God We Trust" was selected most often when a single motto was employed. Since 1935, all commemorative issues except the San Diego and Oakland Bay Bridge issues have borne the three mottoes.</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>The right to sell souvenir coins of the Government at a profit was questioned when the first issue appeared. Since then, when the issue was released at ‘double-face’ value, the general trend seems to be one of increasing premiums.</p>
            <p>Whether any agency, even though authorized by Congress, should profit by selling money at a considerable premium, is debatable. A great many administrations have favoured commemorative coins as an easy method for financing some undertaking in which the Government wished to participate. Other administrations, such as that of Hoover, felt that the currency should not be hired out by Congressional authorizations, and that medals would serve the purpose as well.</p>
            <p>In the course of the past forty-five years, over fifty different commemorative types have been struck at the several mints of United States. In the matter of coinage of a single issue at the several mints, Congress now seems to have adopted the ‘single-mint’ idea—permanently, it is to be hoped. Very small coinage authorizations appear unlikely in the future—for the majority of issues authorized in 1936, the minimum was 25,000 coins.</p>
            <p>As mentioned in the text, there are Commissions which may continue their special series of re-issues for the next hundred years unless retroactive legislation is passed curtailing this feature. A bill was before the 75th Congress which would have accomplished this purpose, but it was side-tracked in the rush of more important national affairs.</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>In the description of the coins, there has been no little difficulty in distinguishing between the obverse and the reverse. The obverse has been chosen as bearing the more important type; and it has been thought not feasible here to follow the official dictum concerning the obverse, namely, "that on all <placeName>United States</placeName> coins issued since 1870, the date side is the obverse." The reason for this Treasury Department ruling is that the obverse die must be destroyed at the end of the year, therefore the obverse is determined by the side which bears the date. For practical reasons this ruling would not prove valuable in a discussion of the commemorative issues, although it serves the Treasury Department’s purposes, even if it is not always adhered to in their publications.</p>
            <p>The actual significance of the date in the more recent issues is very questionable, since many of the issues have been authorized in one year, with an Act requiring a specified date to appear upon the coin. Such coins have often been struck in the subsequent years with little to distinguish them. To make the confusion greater, in a number of instances, anniversary dates have been anticipated so that the coinage date is two years earlier than the anniversary date, and there is no date on the coin giving the year in which it was struck.</p>
            <p>This confusion in dates has made it very difficult to determine the proper sequence of the issues. If one were to rely solely on the authorization dates, there would be complications, as these sometimes
<pb n="7"/>
overlap. Likewise, if one were to rely upon the actual year in which the piece was minted, there would be difficulty in recent years because the piece might be ante- or post-dated. Similarly, one cannot depend on the date appearing on the coin, as this does not always imply the year in which it was struck (as formerly was more often the rule than not).</p>
            <p>In an effort to find a solution, the following plan has been applied. Each issue of commemorative coins has been considered as having three dates: that of authorization, coinage year, and the year appearing upon the coin. These three elements have been combined; and the coin has been placed under the predominant year. For example, the Connecticut half-dollar, authorized in 1934 but coined in 1935, and dated 1935, is classed as 1935. The Gettysburg issue, on the other hand, was authorized in 1936, coined in 1937, but was dated 1936. This issue is therefore closer to 1936 than 1937, notwithstanding the fact that it commemorated an event occurring in 1938. In every instance where a series of the same design but of different years and mint-marks has appeared, it has been considered as a whole, under the date of the first issue of the type.</p>
            <p>A number of writers on commemorative coins have either cited typical coinage Acts or disregarded them entirely. It is believed that the inclusion of each Act here will prove worthwhile, as it is by the Acts themselves that a clear view of the commemorative coinage series is gained. There are
<pb n="8"/>
many instances where the wording of a section is the same as that of a corresponding section in an earlier Act. For economy of space, the complete text of such a section has been given only for the first Act in which it appears. In all subsequent cases, to avoid repetition, reference has been made, within parentheses, to the page of this monograph where the full wording of the section is shown.</p>
            <p>A word here will not be out of place regarding the coinage figures which have been given. Every figure has been verified from direct sources, or from Government reports wherever possible. Those furnished are for the total coinage as reported, including the additional assay pieces. Some writers on commemorative coins have seen fit to disregard these assay pieces, as they have no connection with the issue which has been released, and are struck, so to speak, on the Mint’s own account without authority in the coinage Act. These assay pieces have, however, been included here, with the belief that verification of original records which often show this additional coinage will be simplified. Since these coins were actually struck, they should be included. Where discrepancies appear between the coinage figures shown here and other accounts, in many instances this assay coinage figure will make up the difference.</p>
            <p>A number of issues have been melted in part with no record having been kept of the varieties. In such cases, the net coinage figures for individual issues are merely approximations; and the only
<pb n="9"/>
guide that is reliable is the combined total for the two varieties of the issue.</p>
            <p>The Norse-American medals of 1925 have been purposely omitted from this series as they are not commemorative coins but octagonal medals issued by authority of Congress; they are often popularly but erroneously included as half-dollars. Commemorative coins are a part of the nation’s monetary system, but medals are not.</p>
            <p>Commemorative coins, taken as a group, form an interesting and instructive modern series. The wealth of history, the progress and advance of peoples from the Old World to the New, and a host of other worth while facts provide a valuable record. Finally, we may note that the chronological arrangement is far from being the only one to which this series lends itself. Each collector may form his own criterion for the inter-relation of the Commemoratives. One man will group the pieces relating to discovery, another may keep the State Centennials together, while a third will prefer to have the Exposition issues by themselves. Perhaps this freedom in expressing individual taste accounts for some of the popularity of commemorative coins.

               <p>The suggestion for the first commemorative coin came from the managers of the World’s Fair with a proposal to the Government that a special issue amounting to $20,000,000 in fifty-cent pieces be coined for use at the Exposition. This proposition met with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Mint. Apparently, the original intention was that they be used primarily for admission, and also as souvenirs of the Fair. The idea of selling them at twice their face-value was an additional consideration in view of the financial need of the vast undertaking.</p>
               <p>Two denominations were coined; half-dollars in 1892 and 1893, and a quarter-dollar in 1893. The plan for the coinage of the half-dollars was placed before Congress and the following Act was approved:

                  <q>Approved, August 5, 1892.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Many trial designs were made for the half-dollar because there was doubt as to which portrait of
<pb n="12"/>
                  <persName>Columbus</persName> would be accepted. The reverse also was the subject of discussion, as it was announced to the press that the Administration Building at the Fair would be used; other accounts stated that the reverse would depict the three vessels of <persName>Columbus</persName>. The accepted designs were prepared by the engravers at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>. <persName>C. E. Barber</persName> and <persName>G. T. Morgan</persName> designed the obverse and reverse of the coin, respectively. The portrait of Columbus was taken from the medal struck at Madrid in 1892 to mark the 400th anniversary of <persName>Columbus’</persName> discovery.</p>
               <p>On November 19, 1892, the first piece was struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>, a memorable date in the history of the <placeName>United States</placeName> commemorative coinage.</p>
               <p>It is interesting to note that the two acts authorizing the Columbian Exposition coinages provided that "uncurrent subsidiary silver" be the source of the silver used in these souvenir issues. From this provision, one may be reasonably sure that the majority of the Columbian Exposition coins contain the metal used in the "seated-liberty" series which had been coined during the previous half-century.</p>
               <p>In January, 1893, Mrs. <persName>Potter Palmer</persName> suggested to the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives that $10,000 of the appropriation for the Board of Lady Managers of the World’s Columbian Exposition be given in the form of souvenir quarter-dollars. The authority for this coinage follows:
<q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sundry Civil Appropriation Law</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>World’s Columbian Commission; . . . and ten thousand dollars of the appropriation for the Board of Lady
<pb n="13"/>
Managers shall be paid in souvenir coins of the denomination of twenty-five cents, and for that purpose there shall be coined at the Mints of the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver quarter-dollars of the legal weight and fineness, not to exceed forty thousand pieces, the devices and designs upon which shall be prescribed by the Director of the Mint, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and said silver coins shall be manufactured from uncurrent subsidiary silver coins now in the Treasury; and all provisions of law relative to the coinage, legaltender quality, and redemption of the present subsidiary silver coins shall be applicable to the coins herein authorized to be issued.</q>
                  <q>March 3, 1893.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This coin is the work of <persName>C. E. Barber</persName>, and is the only coin of the <placeName>United States</placeName> bearing the head of a sovereign. It was also the first <placeName>United States</placeName> commemorative coin released with a royal crown on it.</p>
               <p>The coinage of the quarter-dollars began on June 13, 1893. The first, 400th, 1492nd and 1892nd impressions were selected, and certificates stating the facts were forwarded to <placeName>Chicago</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The first Columbian Exposition half-dollar struck, previously mentioned, was sold at a substantial premium. The Remington Company purchased it for $10,000 and it was presented to the new Columbian Museum (now the Field Museum of Natural History) in <placeName>Chicago</placeName>. The 400th, 1492nd, and 1892nd pieces were reserved and were sold at high prices. The rest were offered to the public at one dollar each. The quarter-dollars were sold through the Board of Lady Managers at one dollar each.</p>
               <p>There were coined 950,000 of the half-dollars in 1892 and 4,052,105 dated 1893, a total of 5,002,105 pieces, or $2,501,052.50 in value. A total of 40,023
<pb n="14"/>
quarter-dollars were coined in 1893. Although there appears to be no record of coinage of proofs, all three issues appear from time to time in brilliant proof condition.</p>
               <p>Entirely too many coins of this first souvenir issue were struck, and at the close of the Exposition nearly 3,000,000 half-dollars remained unsold— about 1,400,000 being held in the Treasury at <placeName>Washington</placeName>, 960,000 in <placeName>Chicago</placeName> and 141,700 in the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>. This large remainder became the subject of discussion between the Exposition managers and Secretary of the Treasury Carlisle. The Fair managers did not favor having these pieces put into circulation as this would be manifestly unfair to those who had purchased them at one dollar each. Nevertheless, many were subsequently thrown into circulation at face value. Today the half-dollars are among the few souvenir coins that are in any way familiar to the average person. The quarter-dollars were not nearly so well known as the half-dollars, and at the end of the Exposition 15,809 unsold pieces were returned to the Mint and melted.</p>
               <p>When the half-dollars appeared, their reception by the public—as is invariably the case with a new coin design—was unfavorable. The flatness of the head was much criticized. The "<placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> Ledger" was undecided as to whether the portrait was intended for <persName>Daniel Webster</persName> or <persName>Henry Ward Beecher</persName>. Another paper was certain that it must be a portrait of Sitting Bull. The reverse, too, caused much criticism which was meant to be humorous—especially
<pb n="15"/>
that concerning the "ship on wheels." The portrait of Columbus is truly a nineteenth century interpretation rather than a factual representation of a coarse, fearless European sailor of the fifteenth century.</p>

               <p>In April, designs for the quarter-dollar were submitted by the Treasury Department to the Board of Lady Managers. Two models of the obverse were sent, one with the profile of <persName>Isabella</persName> as a young queen (which was the one selected) and the other with the facing head of the mature queen. The reverse shows the kneeling figure of a woman holding a distaff, emblematic of woman’s industry. The design first considered was the Women’s Building at the Fair.</p>
               <pb n="16"/>
               <p>The quarter-dollar was about as much heralded in the press as the half-dollar, and on the whole the idea received favorable comment. The pieces were greeted with much criticism when issued, and compared unfavorably with the work in design and sculpture at the Exposition itself.</p>

               <p>A series of special postage stamps was also issued in connection with the Columbian Exposition, and of this series the three cent and five dollar denominations are of particular interest, in that the flagship of Columbus pictured on the reverse of the half-dollar is shown on the three cent stamp. The portrait of Columbus on the five dollar stamp is taken from the model of the obverse of the half-dollar, but it faces in the opposite direction.</p>
               <p>A number of leather and plush pocket cases made for the half-dollars were sold at the Exposition.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In 1900, there was erected during the period of the Exposition in Paris, a monument to General Lafayette—the gift of the American people. About $50,000 of the funds required were contributed by the pennies of the school children of <placeName>America</placeName>. The planning, financing and erecting of this statue was undertaken by the Lafayette Memorial Commission. The statue itself was the work of <persName>Paul Bartlett</persName>.</p>
               <p>In the early part of 1899, the Commission asked Congress to make its Monument appropriation in the form of 100,000 souvenir half-dollars. This idea was soon changed to a silver dollar for a souvenir, and the Lafayette Souvenir Dollar came into being by the Act of Congress.

                  <q>Approved, March 3, 1899.</q>
               </p>
               <p>According to the Report of the Director of the Mint for 1900, the silver for this issue, consisting of 38,675.875 ounces of fine silver, was purchased in the open market for $23,032.80. This provided for the striking of 50,000 of these coins at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>. In all, 50,026 pieces were struck.</p>
               <p>The fact that this Act specified that the silver was to be purchased in the market is worthy of note because of the special arrangements in the Columbian issues which provided for the coinage from uncurrent subsidiary silver.</p>
               <p>The coins were to be sold for two dollars each; and again there were comments in the newspapers questioning the ulterior motives of Congress in making the people pay.</p>
               <p>While the designs were in progress, some difficulty arose over the date. The Commissioners desired the delivery of these pieces as early as possible in the year 1899, although the coins were to bear the date 1900. It was contrary to the practice of the Mint to anticipate the dating of a coin. The difficulty was happily avoided by wording the inscription
<pb n="19"/>
"Erected by the youth of the <placeName>United States</placeName> . . . 1900." This date, therefore, was independent of the year in which the coin was struck. The coinage took place on December 14th, 1899, the one-hundredth anniversary of the death of <placeName>Washington</placeName>. The entire issue was struck in one day on an old coining-press which made eighty coins per minute. The first coin struck was forwarded to President <persName>McKinley</persName> who sent it to the President of the French Republic.</p>
               <p>The dies were cut by <persName>C. E. Barber</persName>, of the Mint; the head of <placeName>Washington</placeName> was from the <placeName>Houdon bust</placeName>, and the head of <persName>Lafayette</persName> was from the "Defender of American and French Liberty" medal made by the French artist <persName>Caunois</persName>, in 1824. The statue on the reverse was taken from <persName>Bartlett’s</persName> before a number of final changes were made and differs in many respects from the statue as it now stands in <placeName>Paris</placeName>.</p>

               <p>These pieces, the first of our souvenir coins to be struck in gold, were of the value of one dollar and were sold for three dollars each. They were especially adapted for mementoes, since regular gold dollars had not been struck since 1889 and for many years had been treated more as keepsakes and souvenirs than coins. There are two varieties—one, with the head of <persName>Thomas Jefferson</persName>, who, while President, made the <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase from <placeName>France</placeName> for $15,000,000; the other, with the head of the martyred President <persName>McKinley</persName>, who signed the bill giving the sanction of the Government to the <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase Exposition.</p>
               <p>Of each variety, 125,000 were struck and deposited in the Sub-Treasury at St. Louis. The dies were engraved by <persName>C. E. Barber</persName> and are excellent examples of die-cutting. The <persName>Jefferson</persName> portrait was taken from an old mint-medal engraved by <persName>John Reich</persName>, who during <persName>Jefferson’s</persName> term of office was employed at the Mint. The <persName>McKinley</persName> portrait
<pb n="23"/>
was taken from a medal for which the President gave special sittings.</p>
               <p>According to Mint records, exactly 250,258 pieces were struck at the Philadelphia Mint and 250 of the 258-piece excess were later melted down. As on the Lafayette dollar, the date was partly an anticipated one as 75,080 pieces were struck in December 1902, and the remaining 175,178 were struck in the following month. All, however, bear the date 1903.</p>
               <p>This issue did not attract public attention as did previous commemorative issues, and until recently they were unknown to most people. Only about 35,000 out of the 250,000 coins were sold, and the remainder were destroyed about 1914—an undeserved fate considering the general excellence of the pieces.</p>

on the two- and five-cent denominations, respectively.</p>
               <p>The <persName>Jefferson</persName> and the <persName>McKinley</persName> gold dollars at times appear to have been struck in brilliant proof condition. The first hundred pieces were placed in official frames, and duly signed and sealed by Mint officials.</p>
               <p>During the period of the Exposition, in order to facilitate the sale of these pieces, quantities of them were mounted for jewelry purposes. Small cardboard boxes were made especially and appropriately printed for these coins.</p>
               <p>No record beyond the total number of the pieces which were melted was kept by the Treasury Department. Consequently, as an equal number of each type was coined, probably the same number of each type was melted, It has been estimated, however, that about ten per cent more of the <persName>McKinley</persName> portrait gold dollars were sold.</p>

                  <q>Approved, April 13, 1904.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Although the Mint records state that 60,069 pieces were struck, 25,028 dated 1904 and 35,041 dated 1905, these figures do not tell the true story. Of the 25,028 struck in September 1904 at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>, 10,025 were sold and 15,003 were melted down at the <placeName>San Francisco Mint</placeName>. The Fair Management ordered from the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> 10,000 pieces dated 1905. This mint, prior to its summer closing, struck an additional 25,000 during March and June, to meet possible orders; and as none of these were needed subsequently, the entire 25,000
<pb n="26"/>
were melted. In other words, about 10,000 of each date were distributed, and 40,000 of the 60,000 pieces struck were returned to the melting pot.</p>
               <p>The coins are unattractive and commonplace, bearing a portrait on each side. Because of the small size of the coin, the portraits are insignificant.</p>
               <p>Almost no notice of these pieces appeared in the press at the time and only one short account of them was reported in the numismatic journals, so that they are not widely known. The portraits were designed by <persName>C. E. Barber</persName> of the Mint.</p>

               <p>The Panama-Pacific International Exposition, held in <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> in 1915, was the occasion for
<pb n="27"/>
a commemorative issue materially different from its predecessors. For this event, fifty-dollar gold coins were for the first time authorized and coined by the <placeName>United States</placeName>. The previous fifty-dollar gold pieces, more familiarly known as "slugs," struck in the "fifties" in the gold mining days, were issued in <placeName>California</placeName> privately or by the Government assayers. It was therefore natural that the Exposition authorities, if they were going to issue any souvenir coins at all, should choose a form long associated with <placeName>California</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The issue included more denominations than had been made heretofore in connection with an exposition, so that this set of coins is notable among our commemorative pieces.</p>
               <p>The Act of Congress creating this special issue, reads:

                  <q>Approved, January 16, 1915.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The fifty-dollar gold piece or five eagles was designed by <persName>Robert Aitken</persName> of <placeName>New York</placeName>. It was issued in round and in octagonal form. Of the former shape 1510 and of the latter 1509 were struck during the months of June, July and August. A special hydraulic press used for striking medals at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>, was sent to <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> for the purpose. The first coining took place before a number of notable guests on June 15, 1915, the octagonal variety only being coined. The first 29 "slugs" were struck by officials and guests, and the remainder of the first 100 pieces by the various employees of the Mint. A very complete account of the ceremony is in the "Numismatist" for August, 1915. The description of the pieces is as follows:</p>
               <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Obv.</hi> Minerva, goddess of wisdom, skill, contemplation, spinning, weaving, agriculture and horticulture (the official description), facing left and wearing crested helmet; around edge of shield between two lines, date in Roman numerals: • M • C • M • X • V • ; above, in field, motto in smaller letters: • <hi rend="smallcaps">in god we / trust</hi> • , all within double-dot and dash border.

               <p>10. The obverse and reverse of the octagonal issue is similar to the round type described above, except that the designs of both obverse and reverse have been reduced. The complete design of the round issue has been reduced from 44 mm. to 36½ mm. on the octagonal issue. The octagonal issue has eight dolphins in the angles of both obverse and reverse between the circular inscription and the milling. The dolphins were placed there, surrounding the central field, to convey the idea of the uninterrupted water route made possible by the Panama Canal. Diameter 44 mm.</p>
               <p>It might be noted that the Panama-Pacific issue is the only <placeName>United States</placeName> commemorative coin
<pb n="31"/>
bearing the same design in two diameters. Much disappointment was felt by the critics and Exposition authorities that the two differing planchets of the quintuple eagle bore the same design. Disappointment was also expressed that the design did not "rise to the occasion," especially with two such promising subjects as the old gold-mining days and the completion of the Panama Canal. The general criticism was that the artist, in working out a purely American theme, had borrowed from classical symbolism, and that the only thing American about the coin was the inscription.</p>
               <p>The quarter-eagle or two-and-a-half dollar gold piece was the work of Chas. <persName>E. Barber</persName> and <persName>George T. Morgan</persName> of the Mint. Miss Evelyn Beatrice Longman, of <placeName>New York</placeName>, had prepared a design for this piece but was unable to complete her model on account of illness. This was the first commemorative coin in this denomination. Pieces to the number of 10,017 were struck in the month of June, 1915.</p>

               <p>During the month of June, 1915, there were struck at the <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> Mint 60,030 of the half-dollars. The report of the Exposition management states that 483 of the round fifty-dollar pieces were distributed and 1,017 melted, making no account of the 10 additional assay pieces which were struck. Of the octagonal pieces, 646 were sold and 854 melted down, likewise not accounting for the 9 assay pieces.</p>
               <p>The Commission sold 6,750 quarter-eagles and 3,250 were returned to the Mint. The entire issue of 25,000 gold dollars was dispersed; and of the fifty-cent pieces, 27,000 were sold and 32,866 were returned to the Mint for melting. The coins were sold at the Exposition in especially prepared cases. The complete set of five pieces sold for two hundred dollars, and the set of four pieces (optional as to choice of the octagonal or round fifty-dollar coin),
<pb n="34"/>
for one hundred dollars. The smaller sets of three coins went for seven dollars. These pieces were also sold individually at four dollars for the quarter-eagle, two dollars for the gold dollar and one dollar for the silver half-dollar.</p>
               <p>Prior to the transfer of the half-dollar dies to <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> from Philadelphia, several gold essays were struck from the dies; these have no mint-mark. This commemorative series was the first one to be struck at a branch mint, setting the precedent for many subsequent issues.</p>
               <p>A series of commemorative postage stamps was also issued in connection with the Panama-Pacific celebration.</p>
               <p>The Panama-Pacific Act has the distinction of authorizing the smallest issue of commemorative coins, a fact which is usually overlooked, and considered to be a new evil. This was the first Act to specify the place of coinage, a practice which continued in the following Act but which appears in no other issue, to date.</p>
               <p>The Panama-Pacific coins were the first commemorative pieces to carry the mottoes. Each denomination except the gold dollar has either "E Pluribus Unum" or "In God We Trust." "E Pluribus Unum," the phrase appearing on so many of the standard and commemorative issues, refers to the thirteen original colonies. Translated, it means: "One out of many."</p>

The Association paid for both the dies and the coins.</p>
               <p>At first, a silver dollar was projected, but this was later changed to a gold dollar. The Act of Congress creating this coinage reads as follows:

During August and October, 20,026 were struck dated 1916, and 10,014 dated 1917 were struck in February. The obverse was made by <persName>C. E. Barber</persName>, and the reverse by <persName>G. T.

                  <persName>McKinley</persName> was the first person to have his portrait appear on two separate issues of the <placeName>United States</placeName> commemorative coinage; he was portrayed both on this issue and that for the <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase Exposition.</p>

               <p>Due to the large coinage of these half-dollars, the entire issue was not sold. Of the 1920 issue, 48,000 pieces were returned to the Mint; and of the 1921 variety, 80,000 pieces were returned for melting.</p>

               </p>

               <p>Congress authorized the <placeName>Alabama</placeName> and the <placeName>Maine</placeName> Centennial issues on the same date. These two Acts, in addition to the <placeName>Illinois</placeName> Act of 1918, carry the phrase that the coins may be struck by the Mint "as soon as practicable." The <placeName>Maine</placeName> and the <placeName>Illinois</placeName> issues were struck the year they were authorized, but in the <placeName>Alabama</placeName> issue, due to delay, an awkward date confusion arose. The coins were authorized in 1920 to commemorate a centennial in 1919, but the coins were not struck until 1921, so that in addition to the anniversary dates on the reverse, they carry the later coinage date on the obverse. The <placeName>Alabama</placeName> issue’s double-dating plan set a precedent for later issues. The coin was designed by Laura Gardin Fraser, of <placeName>New York</placeName>, incorporating suggestions made by the <placeName>Alabama</placeName> Commission.</p>
               <p>The pieces were first put on sale at <placeName>Birmingham</placeName>, <placeName>Alabama</placeName>, on the morning of October 26, 1921, during the visit of President <persName>Harding</persName> to that city. They were later distributed by the various banks in the State for one dollar each. The profit from the sale was used for commemorative purposes. Although the Act called for 100,000 pieces, only 70,000 were struck.</p>
               <p>The <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> struck 6,006 pieces in October 1921, with the <persName>St. Andrew’s</persName> Cross dividing the figure 22 at the back of the head of Governor <persName>Kilby</persName>. The <persName>St. Andrew’s</persName> Cross is the emblem on the <placeName>Alabama</placeName> State flag, which, in turn, was taken from the Confederate battle flag. The "22" indicates that <placeName>Alabama</placeName> was the twenty-second State to enter the Union.</p>
               <pb n="46"/>
               <p>In December, 1921, an additional 10,008 of these pieces were struck, as well as 54,030 of the plain variety after the 2X2 had been removed from the hub. Thus there were struck 16,014 with the 2X2 and 54,030 of the plain variety. Of this issue, 5,000 pieces, presumably of the plain variety, were returned to the Mint.</p>

caused much comment. It was the first instance of the portrayal of a living person on a coin of our country, and has served as a precedent for several later issues. It seems indeed strange that this signal honor was not first accorded to a President or some other personage of greater significance in American history than a state Governor.</p>
               <p>Since the time of <placeName>Washington</placeName>, the portrayal of living persons upon coinage of the <placeName>United States</placeName> had been avoided. During the 1860’s and 70’s, the portraits of living Government officials did appear upon the <placeName>United States</placeName> notes and fractional currency, but owing to unsympathetic public reaction, it was considered advisable to abandon the practice. Coolidge, Glass and Robinson, respectively, later were accorded the honor of having their own portraits upon the <placeName>United States</placeName> coinage. Although there have been four exceptions to this unwritten law, there is general opposition to the procedure.</p>

               <p>Although 250,000 pieces were authorized, only 50,028 half-dollars were struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> in July, 1921. Of this number, the first 10,000 pieces coined bore upon the obverse 2☆4, and the balance of 40,028 were of the issue without star. Although the half-dollars with the additional 2☆4 were coined first, these pieces were not offered for sale until several months after a quantity of the plain variety had been sold. The starred variety was struck first, as the star was on the original hub, and later was polished off to permit striking of the plain type without having to prepare new hubs. Later 29,600 half-dollars, presumably of the plain type, were returned to the Mint to be melted.</p>
               <p>The design of the coins is the work of <persName>Robert Aitken</persName>, who designed the Panama-Pacific Exposition fifty-dollar gold pieces. The hubs for the dies were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>

the reverse design was changed to the frontiersman and Indian—a decided improvement. In the meantime, the advertisements and first illustrations of the model showed the piece with the Arms of <placeName>Missouri</placeName>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The centenary of the birth of <persName>Ulysses S. Grant</persName> (April 2, 1822) brought forth another souvenir coinage.</p>
               <p>The chief celebrations were held in <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, the State in which General Grant was born. In 1921, an organization was incorporated in that State under the name of "The <persName>Ulysses S. Grant</persName> Centenary Memorial Association," to conduct appropriate celebrations in Clermont County, <placeName>Ohio</placeName>. It was also determined to erect memorial buildings in <placeName>Georgetown</placeName>, Brown County, <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, where Grant lived as a boy and from which place he was named as a West Point cadet; and at Bethel, Clermont County, where he resided for a short while after his graduation. To help defray the costs of these various under-

takings, including the construction of a highway, as noted in the Act, a bill was introduced in Congress directing the Government to mint gold dollars to be sold at a premium by the Committee. After a number of vicissitudes and amendments, the bill passed Congress, reading as follows:

                     <hi rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the <placeName>United States</placeName> of America in Congress assembled</hi>, That for the purpose of aiding in defraying the cost of erecting a community building in the village of <placeName>Georgetown</placeName>, Brown County, <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, and a like building in the village of Bethel, Clermont County, <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, as a memorial to <persName>Ulysses S.

                  <q>Approved, February 2, 1922.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The original bill called for 200,000 gold dollars, but it met with decided objections on the ground that too much gold would be drawn away from more useful purposes. Therefore 10,000 gold dollars were authorized, and 250,000 silver half-dollars were added. Also the word "memorial" was substituted in the bill for "souvenir," in describing the coins.</p>
               <p>The design, which is the same for both the gold dollar and the silver half-dollar, was the work of <persName>GardinLaura Gardin Fraser</persName>, who had previously designed the <placeName>Alabama</placeName> issue. The initial for her maiden name, <persName>Gardin</persName>, appears on the Grant issue. The models for the half-dollar were prepared prior to those for the gold dollar.</p>
               <p>During March, 1922, the Mint at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> struck 10,016 gold dollars, the first 5,000 of which bore in the obverse right field a small incused star which was subsequently removed for the second half of the coinage. Later, there were also struck 100,055 of the silver half-dollars. The first 5,006 of this coinage also had the incused star. The coins were put on sale during the month of April, two months after the bill’s passage. The half-dollars were sold at one dollar each, and the gold dollars at three dollars each for the plain issue, and at
<pb n="53"/>
three and one-half dollars for the variety with the star.</p>
               <p>The entire issue of the gold coins was sold by the Commission; but of the silver half-dollars, 750 of the type with the star and 27,650 of the plain variety were returned to the Mint.</p>
               <p>In the case of the <placeName>Alabama</placeName> and <placeName>Missouri</placeName> coins, there was some meaning to the added symbols, but in this case there was apparently no significance. Had four stars been placed on the coin, they would at least have shown the rank of Grant as General. The placing of the star upon the half-dollar was not originally contemplated. It was brought about by a request for two varieties of the half-dollar when the gold dollars were ordered. This commemorative gold dollar was the only issue to carry any of the mottoes.</p>

The artist’s monogram or initials are usually in relief when placed there by the artist. The Mint, on the other hand, usually inserts an incused single letter to designate the artist.</p>
               <p>The inscriptions on the Grant series make no direct reference to the purpose for which the coins were struck.</p>
               <p>The practice of artificially creating a variety of a commemorative coin by addition of a device, or change in date or mint-mark, is open to criticism. Notwithstanding that numismatists have considered the varieties superfluous, the fact that they are limited issues makes them readily marketable. Of recent years, because of the limited number struck and a consequent advance in price of the Grant half-dollar with the star, there have been offered for sale numerous half-dollars of the plain variety with the star fraudulently punched in.</p>
               <p>In connection with the spuriously added star of the Grant issue, it might be well to mention here that in 1935 many of the rarer issues were counterfeited. Fortunately, the pieces were recognized
<pb n="55"/>
before the market was flooded, and the counterfeiter was apprehended.</p>
               <p>At one time it was believed that the genuine Grant pieces with star could be recognized by certain flaws in the obverse field which were rectified when the star was removed from the original hub, preparatory to the coinage of the plain issue. A special study of these pieces by the late <persName>Howland Wood</persName>, revealed the fact that a number of diecombinations had been used in striking the Grant issue, but no record was kept as to which dies struck the star variety. Minute examination of the coins reveals a number of characteristics by which the dies may be noted, such as the outlined initial <hi rend="smallcaps">"G"</hi> in <hi rend="smallcaps">grant,</hi> and the period on the reverse following the <hi rend="smallcaps">"I"</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps">pluribus.</hi> From this study it was found that the genuine star in the Grant half-dollar must be recognized on its own merits rather than by the accompanying characteristics on the other parts of the coin. Genuine half-dollars have been noted with and without these characteristics, although the majority of coins with the star appear to have been struck from the dies having the flaws.</p>
               <p>The records show that eight obverse and six reverse dies were used in the total coinage of the half-dollars. The strikings per die, however, show that more coins were struck than are actually accounted for in the Mint Reports, since the combined total for the obverse and reverse dies was 117,685 pieces. The Mint Report gives 100,061 as the total coinage, leaving a wastage of over 17,000 pieces.</p>

               <p>The centennial of the enunciation of the Monroe Doctrine was celebrated in June, 1923, at <placeName>Los Angeles</placeName>, <placeName>California</placeName>, and was the occasion for an issue of commemorative half-dollars. The motion picture industry was the force behind the issue, as an historical revue and motion-picture exposition commemorating events in our national history were shown, and the proceeds from the sale of these half-dollars contributed toward financing this project.</p>
               <p>The Act of Congress authorizing this issue, reads as follows:

               <p>The models for this coin were prepared by <persName>Chester Beach</persName>, who used for the reverse of this piece, the symbolic figures representative of the Americas. This motif had been less successfully employed on the badge of the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo in 1901. The reduction work was done by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The obverse shows the heads of Presidents <persName>James Monroe</persName> and <persName>John Quincy Adams</persName>, respectively, who were instrumental in the formulation of the Doctrine, thenceforth the cornerstone of American foreign policy. The relationship between this issue and the Panama-Pacific issue of 1915 is interesting.</p>
               <p>During May and June, 1923, the <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> Mint struck 274,077 of these half-dollars, representing nearly the entire authorization. The coins were released to the public at one dollar each. According to the records of the Mint, none of these coins were returned for melting; however, the majority of the pieces were not sold to the public but subsequently were placed in circulation at face value. This fact has made it increasingly difficult to secure specimens in perfect condition.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Upon the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of <placeName>New Netherland</placeName>, a souvenir half-dollar was authorized. In 1626, the Dutch West India Company sent <persName>Peter Minuit</persName> as Director-General to the new settlement. A group of permanent colonists had arrived in <placeName>New York</placeName> harbour in the vessel "Nieu Nederland" in 1624 under Cornelius Mey, the first governor. Soon after his arrival in the New World, Minuit became friendly with the local Indians and purchased Manhattan Island for a nominal sum (reputedly twenty-four dollars) in the name of his Company.</p>
               <p>There were other Huguenot-Walloon colonies in
<pb n="59"/>
                  <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> and in <placeName>Florida</placeName>; however, the term "Middle States" in the Act refers only to <placeName>New York</placeName>, <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>, <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> and Delaware settlements. The settlement which centered about Manhattan Island was the most prosperous in later years. The colony was called <placeName>New Netherland</placeName> from the time of its settlement until 1664. In that year, after the territory had been torn from the possession of the Dutch, the name was changed, by the English, to <placeName>New York</placeName>, in honor of the Duke of <placeName>York</placeName>, who later ruled as <persName>James II</persName>.</p>
               <p>It is notable that the Act authorizes a coinage to commemorate an event, whereas the coin portrays persons only indirectly associated with the occasion.</p>
               <p>The persons whose portraits are shown upon this issue are worthy of a brief historical note. Both Admiral <persName>Gaspard Coligny</persName> and <persName>William</persName> the Silent were Protestant leaders of the Reformation, during the latter part of the 16th Century. Coligny was killed in 1572, and Prince William was assassinated in 1584. Their relationship to the founding of <placeName>New Netherland</placeName> in 1624, nearly half a century later, is a spiritual rather than a factual one.</p>

               <p>This issue of souvenir half-dollars was struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> during February and April, 1924, from models prepared by <persName>G. T. Morgan</persName> of the Mint. A total of 142,080 pieces was struck—approximately half the 300,000 coin authorization; these were distributed by the bank authorized in the Act, at one dollar each. All but 55,000 of these coins were sold to the public at a premium. The remaining coins were placed in circulation at face value in order to avoid their return to the Mint and the subsequent recoining expenses. Stamps were also released for the occasion, the one-cent variety showing the ship, "Nieu Nederland," depicted on the half-dollar reverse.</p>

               <p>There was considerable agitation concerning this issue. Some desired its suppression feeling that it was solely a vehicle for religious propaganda and, as such, un-American and unsuitable for the national coinage. The bill for this issue of souvenir coins, included, as sponsors, several religious leaders—the first instance in which religious groups had actively participated in an issue of coins.</p>
               <p>Since the occasion for the coinage was the settling of the Huguenots and <persName>Walloons</persName> in the New World, it was contended that American events associated with the settling could have supplied the types for the coinage.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">THE STONE MOUNTAIN HALF-DOLLAR</hi>
               </head>
               <p>For many years a permanent memorial to the military leaders of the Confederacy has been
<pb n="62"/>
planned. It was proposed that Stone Mountain, <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, comprising one of the largest known masses of workable granite, be suitably carved with portraitures of these leaders in heroic size. Arrangements were finally completed and in June, 1923, the work began.</p>
               <p>In order to secure additional funds to finance this memorial, Congress authorized an issue of souvenir half-dollars, not only as a memorial to the Confederate leaders but also as a memorial to <persName>Warren G. Harding</persName> who was President of the <placeName>United States</placeName> when the work of carving Stone Mountain began.</p>
               <p>The act authorizing the coinage, signed by President Coolidge, follows:

               </p>
               <p>The models for this half-dollar coinage were prepared by <persName>Gutzon Borglum</persName>, a noted American sculptor, who also held the commission for the actual carving of Stone Mountain. The dies were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>. Mr. <persName>Borglum</persName> and other officials of the Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association, were present when the first pieces were struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> on January 21, 1925, the 101st birthday of General Thomas "Stonewall" <persName>Jackson</persName>. The first coin struck was subsequently mounted on a plate of <placeName>Georgia</placeName> gold and presented to President Coolidge. During the remainder of that month and through March, a total of 2,314,709 pieces was coined, which was less than half of the authorized issue. It was proposed by the Association to release these
<pb n="64"/>
coins simultaneously throughout the nation on July 3, 1925, in order to avoid speculation. The first million were sold at one dollar each, with the Association reserving the right to sell the remainder at a higher price. They made their first appearance in May.</p>
               <p>Due to the tremendous number of coins which the Association had to market, it was necessary to devise methods for sales promotion. Several large institutions, as their contribution to the Memorial, were prevailed upon to purchase the coins at the premium and then distribute them at face value, Throughout the South they were distributed on a quota basis, each town subscribing for a fixed number. In each town, also, there was one special coin which was auctioned off to the highest bidder, with the proceeds, which often amounted to several hundred dollars, returnable to the Association.</p>
               <p>During the work of cutting the memorial, a misunderstanding between Mr. <persName>Borglum</persName> and the Association officials resulted in the resignation of Mr. <persName>Borglum</persName>, not without considerable publicity. The Association was not only short of funds at this time but also lacked a sculptor. A sculptor was secured (<persName>Augustus Lukeman</persName>) and money was raised by marking some of the Stone Mountain coins with numbers and also with letters designating the state (e. g., Tenn = Tennessee) and these were sent to communities throughout the South, and auctioned.</p>
               <p>Mention of the Stone Mountain half-dollar is incomplete without stating that there was consid-
<pb n="65"/>
erable opposition to this issue. The issue was severely criticized, particularly by Northerners, because it was not considered fitting that the coinage of the <placeName>United States</placeName> be used to commemorate and perpetuate the memory of erstwhile leaders of the Southern states. Opposition gained sufficient strength at the time, as previously noted, to demand that the entire issue be suppressed. In order to modify the specific clauses in the enacting bill pertaining to the Confederate Army, the phrase making this issue a memorial to President Harding was added. When the coins were released, however, it was obvious that no reference to President Harding had been made. At one time his portrait had been considered as the main obverse device.</p>
               <p>In addition there were protests against the design adopted, as well as general resentment regarding the nature of the Memorial itself which was being done with the funds received from the sale of the coins. Much unfavorable publicity resulted from the disagreements between Mr. <persName>Borglum</persName> and the Association, and the sale of the coins became increasingly difficult.</p>
               <p>The widest divergence of opinion was with regard to the design. Some people felt that the diework and lettering were not sufficiently clear. This was due to the fact that this coin has no level field. Instead, the entire surface is treated as if it were rough-hewn stone against which stars are seen. In previous commemorative coinages, the surfaces of the coins had been comparatively smooth and they might
<pb n="66"/>
have been struck as proofs, but with this issue there was not the possibility of a brilliant proof, thereby producing for numismatists an altogether new effect, and one which, at first, was thought not wholly pleasing. The question appears to be whether the result produced is not more proper for medallic work.</p>
               <p>The authorization called for 5,000,000 half-dollars, the largest issue since that of the <placeName>Columbia</placeName>n, which, too, had had five million, but of which only about two and a half-million had been sold. In fact, the authorization for this issue was over twice the aggregate authorizations for all thirteen intervening issues including all denominations. Fortunately, the Mint authorities realized the absorption point of the country for these souvenir issues and in this period between 1893 and 1924, only about two-thirds of the number of coins authorized were struck. In this same period, about one-third of the number struck'were returned to the Mint and subsequently melted. The Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association returned 1,000,000 to the Mint, of which 500,000 were melted at once. The remaining half-million pieces also were melted recently.</p>
               <p>The obverse of this coin shows General <persName>Robert E. Lee</persName> and General <persName>Thomas J</persName>. ("Stonewall") <persName>Jackson</persName>— both on horseback. The decision to portray these two men upon a <placeName>United States</placeName> coin was not based solely upon their military leadership in the War between the States, but upon their importance as

leaders and as Americans fighting for what they considered to be right and just.</p>

               <p>The Sesquicentennial of the Battle of <placeName>Lexington</placeName> and <placeName>Concord</placeName> (April 19, 1775) was the occasion for an issue of souvenir half-dollars, as well as an issue of special postage stamps.</p>
               <p>At <placeName>Concord</placeName>, the signal was given by the Americans, and the British were attacked from all sides, and forced to retreat to Charleston, near <placeName>Boston</placeName>.</p>
               <pb n="68"/>
               <p>Following this battle, the Colonies were sufficiently aroused to send Minute-men to <placeName>Boston</placeName>, where the British army was besieged by the patriotic colonists. The British showed their mettle, but not without great losses at the Battle of <placeName>Bunker Hill</placeName> in June, 1775; and shortly after this engagement, George <placeName>Washington</placeName> took command of the newly formed army.</p>
               <p>Congress was prompted to authorize a commission which would assist in a celebration of these events, pertaining to the earliest phases of American Independence, and this commission had charge of the distribution of the souvenir half-dollars. Profits realized from the sale of these pieces defrayed the costs of the celebration.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In 1925, President Coolidge signed a bill authorizing the coinage of half-dollars for three celebrations. This was the first time that an authorizing Act of Congress covered more than one issue.</p>
               <p>This Act called for half-dollars to commemorate:</p>
               <p>1. The one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Bennington, and the independence of Vermont.</p>
               <p>2. The seventy-fifth anniversary of the admission of the State of <placeName>California</placeName> into the Union.</p>
               <p>3. The one hundredth anniversary of the founding of Fort Vancouver, in the State of <placeName>Washington</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The anniversary of the Battle of Bennington fell in 1927, and the coin, in chronological sequence, is Number 47.</p>
               <p>The Act authorizing these issues is, as follows:

               </p>
               <p>The designer of the <placeName>California</placeName> half-dollar was <persName>Jo Mora</persName>, of <placeName>Carmel</placeName>, a noted sculptor of <placeName>California</placeName>, whose distinctive designs on the obverse show a miner panning for gold—a scene symbolizing <placeName>California</placeName>’s phenomenal growth in the middle of the nineteenth century, following the discovery of gold; and on the reverse, the bear, the state emblem. Although 300,000 coins were authorized, only 150,200 were struck—in August, 1925, at the <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> mint. These half-dollars were sold at one dollar each by the two clearing-house organizations named in the bill. There re<placeName>Maine</placeName>d unsold at the end of the celebration 63,606 coins which were returned to the Mint by the sponsors. </p>
               <p>This issue commemorated a span of seventy-five years only, the shortest period commemorated on our coins up to that time, with the exception of the memorial and exposition issues.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The occasion for this souvenir half-dollar was the centennial of the founding of Fort <placeName>Vancouver</placeName>, <placeName>Washington</placeName>, in 1825 by Dr. <persName>John McLoughlin</persName>, an employee of the Hudson Bay Company. A pageant was staged for this celebration, and in order to secure funds to assist in the financing, an issue was authorized by Congress in 1925. The authority for this coinage was one section of the act which also
<pb n="74"/>
authorized the <placeName>California</placeName> Diamond-Jubilee and Battle of Bennington half-dollar issues, approved February 24, 1925.</p>
               <p>The Fort <placeName>Vancouver</placeName> half-dollar models were prepared by <persName>Laura Gardin Fraser</persName>, who had designed several of the previous issues. The design is in well executed relief, and the coin is pleasing.</p>
               <p>In August 1925, the <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> Mint struck 50,028 pieces. They were distributed throughout <placeName>Washington</placeName> by the Fort <placeName>Vancouver</placeName> Centennial Corporation at one dollar each. The Act called for the minting of 300,000 coins, but the Mint struck only a fraction of this number, as had been its recent practice. Of those coined, 35,034 were returned unsold.</p>
               <p>The fact that the entire issue was transported by plane from the <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> Mint to Fort <placeName>Vancouver</placeName> is an interesting side light.</p>
               <p>Dr. <persName>John McLoughlin</persName>, whose memory is perpetuated by this issue, was born in Canada in 1784 of Scotch-Irish parents. As an employee of the Hudson Bay Company, he built Fort <placeName>Vancouver</placeName>, on the <placeName>Columbia</placeName> River, in 1825. From 1824 to 1846, he conducted the affairs of the company from this Fort, and became known throughout the territory to Indians as well as to settlers, as a man of great integrity and honesty, and also as a humanitarian. He was able to convince the Indians of his good intentions, at a time prior to the extension of true British or American influence in this region.</p>
               <p>In 1846, Dr. <persName>McLoughlin</persName> removed to <placeName>Oregon City</placeName>, <placeName>Oregon</placeName>, where he became a naturalized American
<pb n="75"/>
citizen. The conspicuous part which Dr. <persName>McLoughlin</persName> played in the development of the West made it fitting that honor be paid to his memory. His early selection of a site on the banks of the <placeName>Columbia</placeName> River for a settlement proved well-chosen as it is not distant from the present city of <placeName>Portland</placeName>, <placeName>Oregon</placeName>.</p>

               <p>The commemoration of the founding of Fort <placeName>Vancouver</placeName>, by the Hudson Bay Company was an event more worthy of a medal than a commemorative half-dollar, insofar as the national significance

of the occasion is concerned. The celebration appears to have been purely local.</p>

               <p>In order to celebrate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on a scale commensurate with the significance of the event for the American people, it was determined to hold an International Fair. <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> was chosen as the Fair site because of its intimate connection with these events and because the Declaration was adopted by the Congress in session in that city.</p>
               <p>In order to raise funds for the financing of the Fair, Congress appropriated funds, and also authorized the issue of silver 50-cent pieces and gold quarter-eagles. The original bill for these coins had requested the minting of gold two-and-one-half-dollar coins, gold dollar-and-a-half coins, and the silver fifty-cent pieces. There was a provision for a special commemorative dollar bill, as well as for postage stamps. The two-cent postage stamp shows the bell depicted on the half-dollar reverse. Secretary of the Treasury Mellon, who opposed in principle the majority of these souvenir issues, would not approve the new gold denomination of one dollar-and and-a-half, or the special dollar bill, therefore the bill was amended and passed with but two types of souvenir coins.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Both the half-dollar and the quarter-eagle were
<pb n="78"/>
designed by <persName>John R. Sinnock</persName>, chief engraver of the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint. This appears to have been the last issue of commemorative coins designed by the Mint employees.</p>
               <p>On May 19, Mayor <persName>Kendrick</persName> of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> participated in the ceremonies attending the coinage of the first Sesquicentennial pieces. The first coin struck was presented by the Mayor to President Coolidge when he visited the Exposition.</p>
               <p>During the remainder of May and June, 1926, 1,000,528 half-dollars and 200,226 quarter-eagles were struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>. This was the first time in many years that the full number of pieces authorized was coined, but this exception no doubt was due to the fact that the Exposition was considered national in scope and interest.</p>
               <p>The Fair was unsuccessful from a financial standpoint, and the National Sesquicentennial Exhibition Commission was unable to distribute the complete allotment of coins. The half-dollars were sold at one dollar each, and the quarter-eagles at four dollars each.</p>
               <p>The Commission failed to sell to the public 154,207 quarter-eagles and 859,408 half-dollars, which were subsequently destroyed.</p>
               <p>To the present time, this quarter-eagle is the last souvenir gold coin authorized by Congress. According to present indications, the increasing price of gold in addition to the increasing restrictions that governments place upon gold coinage, will result in the gradual abandonment of such coinage.</p>

               <p>The half-dollar caused comment, because the obverse bore the portraits of Presidents Coolidge and <placeName>Washington</placeName>. Although the precedent for placing the likeness of a living person upon the coinage had been established, it had not been extended to living Presidents. Thus, the Sesquicentennial half-dollar shattered a record of one hundred and fifty years during which the head of the government had never appeared on the coinage during his lifetime.</p>
               <p>It was also thought that a more fitting tribute was due to the writers of the Declaration of Independence, and that in place of Coolidge’s portrait, those
<pb n="80"/>
of <persName>Benjamin Franklin</persName>, <persName>Alexander Hamilton</persName> or <persName>Thomas Jefferson</persName>, the real "framer" of the document, should have been chosen.</p>
               <p>The design of the coin is very artistic, the obverse showing the portraits of <placeName>Washington</placeName>, the first President, and Coolidge, the President at the time of the celebration (1926). The reverse shows the original Liberty Bell, now hanging in Independence Hall in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName>Penna</placeName>. The reverse was modelled directly from the Bell, and is correct in every detail, even to the chipping along the edge of the rim.</p>
               <p>A description of the half-dollar follows:</p>
               <p>35. <hi rend="italic">Obv.</hi> Accolated busts to right of Presidents <placeName>Washington</placeName> and Coolidge. Around the top border: <hi rend="smallcaps">liberty</hi> between two rosettes. At bottom border: <persName>

               <p>The dies were cut in remarkably low relief, and as a result the coin is seldom struck up in every detail. Had a bolder relief been employed, as was the intention of the designer, a more practical coin would have resulted in which every detail would have been apparent.

               </head>
               <p>The westward movement of the American people in the first half of the past century was of sufficient significance to merit an issue of souvenir half-dollars. These commemorated the blazing of the
<pb n="82"/>
                  <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail and the memory of countless pioneer settlers who subsequently followed that Trail.</p>
               <p>In order to raise funds to finance the marking of the Trail (as noted in the Act of Congress below), an issue of souvenir half-dollars was authorized by Congress, and approved by President Coolidge.</p>
               <p>This issue is notable in that it commemorates a period of time and a movement of people, rather than a specific occasion.</p>
               <p>The Act follows:

                  <q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">An Act To</hi> authorize the coinage of 50-cent pieces in commemoration of the heroism of the fathers and mothers who traversed the <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail to the Far West with great hardship, daring, and loss of life, which not only resulted in adding new States to the Union but earned a well-deserved and imperishable fame for the pioneers; to honor the twenty thousand dead that lie buried in unknown graves along two thousand miles of that great highway of history; to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion; and to commemorate by suitable monuments, memorial or otherwise, the tragic events associated with that emigration—erecting them either along the trail itself or elsewhere, in localities appropriate for the purpose, including the city of <placeName>Washington</placeName>.</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the <placeName>United States</placeName> of America in Congress assembled, </hi>That in commemoration of the <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail and in memory of the pioneers of the far West there shall be coined at the mints of the <placeName>United States</placeName> silver 50-cent pieces to the number of not more than six million; such 50-cent pieces to be of the standard Troy weight, composition, diameter, device, and design as shall be fixed by the Director of the Mint, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, which said 50-cent pieces shall be legal tender in any payment to the amount of their face value.</q>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sec. 2.</hi>(Similar to Stone Mountain issue, Section 2, but authorizing executive committee of the <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail Memorial Association, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of <placeName>New York</placeName>, page 63.)</q>

               </p>
               <p>The designs were prepared by <persName>James Earle Fraser</persName> and his wife <persName>Laura Gardin Fraser</persName>, and are considered among the finest in the entire commemorative series. The hubs for the dies were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>In the fall of 1926, an issue of these coins was struck in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> as well as in <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>. Although there were precedents in the commemorative series for date varieties, or varieties due to the addition of a star or a cross, this was the first instance of a mint-mark as the variety.</p>
               <p>The coins were distributed by the <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail Pioneer Memorial Association which withdrew only a small portion of their 6,000,000 piece authorization. The sale of these pieces was not very successful, as all the difficulties which previous commissions had encountered were present in the distribution of these coins.</p>
               <p>The <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail half-dollars were again coined in 1928, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937 and 1938. The month of coinage, the issue price, the number of specimens coined at the various mints and the number of specimens melted, are tabulated below.</p>
               <p>The 1928 issue is worthy of more than casual notice as this was the first time in the history of the <placeName>United States</placeName> commemorative coinage that a third
<pb n="84"/>
variety of the original type had been struck. When these coins were prepared, the Treasury Department still had available a supply of the 1926 issue, and it was reluctant to release the newly minted coins until the older issue had been redeemed. The matter was not settled until 1933 when arrangements were made to release the 1928 issue, which collectors had enviously eyed in the coinage reports but which had not been released.</p>
               <p>The sale of the 1928 and 1933 issues took place in the same year, and it was therefore deemed advisable to melt a portion of the old issue. The issue of 1933 marks the first commemorative coinage at the Denver Mint.</p>
               <p>A comparatively small coinage was prepared in 1933 which was released by a numismatic firm. The issues of the subsequent years were marketed in the same manner until 1938 when the Commission again distributed its own coins. Many of these were given historically interesting names in order to popularize the coin and promote its sale. These names were later officially discontinued because the coins remained unchanged, except for date or mint-mark. The change of names for the same issue was considered improper without change of authority for coinage. These "sales" names, wholly unofficial, are therefore omitted.</p>
               <p>The coinage of these pieces has been as follows:</p>

               <p>The <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail issue was the first to take advantage of the phrasing of the Act regarding the coinage "at the mints," when issues were struck in 1926 at two mints.

Almost five and three-quarter millions of half-dollars authorized for the <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail Memorial are still unstruck.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The occasion for this souvenir issue in 1927, was the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of <placeName>Bennington</placeName> and the independence of <placeName>Vermont</placeName>.</p>
               <pb n="87"/>
               <p>The Battle of <placeName>Bennington</placeName> was a turning point for the Americans when the fate of the new nation was still in the balance. It contributed to the surrender of the British General <persName>Burgoyne</persName> shortly afterwards, as his encounter with the <placeName>Vermont</placeName> "Green Mountain’’ boys, under Ira Allen, had proven disastrous. Further than this, the Battle of <placeName>Bennington</placeName> showed <placeName>France</placeName> the strength of the new nation, and the alliance which was contracted soon after that victory was one upon which Americans leaned heavily.</p>
               <p>The authorization for this coin was approved by President Coolidge in 1925, in the triple authorization Act including the Fort <placeName>Vancouver</placeName> and the <placeName>California</placeName> Diamond-Jubilee issues. The authorizing Act is on page 70 under Coin 32.</p>
               <p>Since that time, no Act has covered as many issues, although there are instances in which two issues have been combined.</p>
               <p>The circumstances surrounding the authorization of this issue were not unlike those of the <placeName>Alabama</placeName> issue of 1920. In the case of both, the coins were struck considerably after the authorization, and dated accordingly.</p>
               <p>The models for this issue were prepared by <persName>Charles Keck</persName>, who had previously designed the Panama-Pacific gold dollar. The original models for the reverse on this issue, showed a battle-monument instead of the catamount, which was the finally accepted design. The reduction of the models was done by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>A relatively small issue was authorized, and the full coinage allowed was struck. In January and
<pb n="88"/>
February, 1927, there were 40,034 pieces coined at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>. They were sold at one dollar each by the <placeName>Bennington</placeName> Battle Monument and Historical Association of <placeName>Bennington</placeName>, <placeName>Vermont</placeName>. Of the total coinage struck, all the pieces were purchased except 11,892 which were subsequently returned to the Mint for melting. The proceeds from the sale were used to create a permanent fund for the support of historical research and for fostering interest in the history of <placeName>Vermont</placeName>. The coins were sold directly to the public, without commission to brokers.</p>
               <p>A special issue of postage stamps was also released for this celebration.</p>

               <p>This issue was struck to commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands by Captain <persName>James Cook</persName> in 1778. The year 1928 marked the two-hundredth anniversary of the explorer's birth, and the thirtieth anniversary of the annexation of the Islands to the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The design for the model is based upon a sketch prepared by Miss <persName>Juliette May Fraser</persName>, an artist of <placeName>Honolulu</placeName>, <placeName>Hawaii</placeName>, and was executed by Chester Beach, who prepared designs for a number of other issues. The preparation of the dies and the reduction work was carried out by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The authorization for a silver coinage of 10,000 half-dollars was the smallest up to that time. It set a precedent for a "limited coinage" which subsequently was overcome with great difficulty, after numerous commissions had profitably exploited this possibility.</p>
               <p>During June, 1928, the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> coined 10,008 of these half-dollars.</p>
               <p>The Captain Cook Sesquicentennial Commission of <placeName>Honolulu</placeName> released the pieces at two dollars each, the highest initial sales price for a half-dollar up to that time; and the entire issue was exhausted within a comparatively short period. This was followed by a rise in price. Fifty coins of this issue in the form of sandblast proofs were presented by the Commission to various Museums and officials throughout the country. A special surcharge of the regular two cent stamp was released for this celebration.</p>

                  <p>Following the coinage of the <placeName>Hawaii</placeName>an half-dollars of 1928, no Acts approving new issues were signed until the Texas authorization of 1933, under which Texas Centennial half-dollars were coined in 1934. The first new type to appear after the <placeName>Hawaii</placeName>an issue, was the coin authorized to commemorate the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> Tercentenary in 1934. The coins under the latter Act were struck prior to the Texas issue of 1934, approved in 1933.</p>
                  <pb n="92"/>
                  <p>The period without coinage authorizations coincides with the Hoover administration, which was unsympathetic toward souvenir issues. With the vetoing of the Gadsden Purchase half-dollar proposal in 1929, a statement was issued that commemorative coins were superfluous and that their purpose might be as well accomplished with officially authorized medals. These pieces, if struck, would adequately serve collectors, it was thought; and such pieces would not tend to "confuse the coinage."</p>
                  <p>With the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> issue, a new theory in commemorative half-dollar coinage legislation was expressed, which served as the keynote for a number of the later issues, although there are several exceptions which recalled the old forms, and permitted the previous abuses.</p>
                  <p>With the <persName>Roosevelt</persName> administration, a series of new types and reissues of old types was released. Some of the new authorizing Acts contained features worthy of more than passing comment. Generally speaking, the Acts had heretofore contained a statement that the coins were to be struck "at the Mints," and also stated the total number of pieces which might be coined under the Act. The new Acts tended to give a limited coinage which was to be " coined by the Director of the Mint." A number of Acts state specifically that the coins might be sold at a premium, a viewpoint which the Government had previously regarded as outside its province.</p>
                  <p>In 1936, several clauses were added to the Acts of Congress for subsequent issues. The first was, that the coins were to be struck "at a mint," thus
<pb n="93"/>
eliminating the mint varieties of similar pieces which had been struck during the previous years.</p>
                  <p>A fixed date for the coinage, "irrespective of the year in which they are minted or issued" was also inserted, thus making date-varieties of a large coinage impossible, since all pieces were to bear the date stated in the Act.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the points enumerated above, a minimum limit was placed on the number of pieces which were to be coined at one time. Thus it was impossible to coin an unreasonably small issue. In some instances, this withdrawal figure was made the same as the coinage permitted in the Act, thus making but a single coinage possible.</p>
                  <p>The final point written into the new Acts was the expiration clause, which made it impossible for commissions to continue to secure their allotment, if any remained, after a certain fixed date.</p>
                  <p>With all these provisions, it was impossible to secure after 1936, legislation permitting varying dates and mint-marks for an issue, or to order a very small coinage from the mints.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Following the four-year period in which no new issues were authorized, the <placeName>Texas</placeName> Centennial coinage Act was the first of twenty-eight such Acts approved to date by President <persName>Franklin D. Roosevelt</persName>. The text of the Act follows closely that of previous Acts; and not until the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> authorization of 1934, does the new coinage text appear. Although
<pb n="94"/>
the <placeName>Texas</placeName> Act was approved a year before the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> Act, the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> coins were released prior to those of <placeName>Texas</placeName>. The occasion of this souvenir issue was the centennial of the independence of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>
               <p>In 1835, <placeName>Texas</placeName> revolted against <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, and during the revolution the garrison at the Alamo was besieged, finally taken, and the defenders, including <persName>David Crockett</persName> and <persName>Colonel Bowie</persName>, massacred. The Mexicans under General <placeName>Santa Anna</placeName>, were defeated at the battle of <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> on April 21, 1836, by the Texans under the leadership of General <persName>Sam Houston</persName> who, with a much smaller force, succeeded in capturing <placeName>Santa Anna</placeName>. <persName>Houston</persName> became the first president of the independent Texan Republic. In 1845, <placeName>Texas</placeName> was annexed to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, but in 1861 seceded to join the Confederacy. In 1870, <placeName>Texas</placeName> was readmitted to the Union.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Austin</persName>, whose portrait appears on the half-dollar along with <persName>Houston’s</persName>, was one of the founders of the State of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, having been active in attempting to secure for <placeName>Texas</placeName> admission into the Mexican Union in the early 1830’s. In 1835, he was appointed a commissioner to the <placeName>United States</placeName> to secure the recognition of the Texan Republic.</p>
               <p>Realizing the tremendous expenditures involved in a celebration of this nature and hoping to secure advance funds the <placeName>Texas</placeName> Commission requested an authorization for coins in 1933, so that some of the pieces might be sold prior to the opening of the Exposition in 1934. This procedure has since proven itself to be very popular, although the
<pb n="95"/>
practice itself is questionable. Funds secured were also to be used in connection with the <placeName>Texas</placeName> Memorial Museum.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">THE <placeName>Maryland</placeName> TERCENTENARY HALF-DOLLAR</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The occasion for this souvenir issue, the first type released since the Hawaiian issue of 1928, was the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> Colony in 1634 by the followers of Cecil Calvert, better known as <persName>Lord Baltimore</persName>. He founded the new colony to establish an asylum for those persecuted for their religious convictions. The majority of the colonists were Catholics who had been driven from <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The new site was called <persName>St. Mary's</persName>, and appropriate celebrations were held in that city and in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> in 1934. In order to assist in financing these celebrations, Congress authorized an issue of souve-
<pb n="99"/>
nir half-dollars which could be sold at a profit—this profit to accrue to the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> Tercentenary Commission which sponsored the issue and financed the celebrations. A special postage stamp issued for the occasion showed the ships in which the colonists arrived, "The Ark" and "The Dove."</p>
               <p>An issue of 25,000 pieces was authorized by Congress, and the authorization Act is worthy of more than passing notice, due to the many new features which were embodied in it. The Act follows herewith: •
<q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">[Public—No. 215—73d Congress]</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">An Act To</hi> authorize the coinage of 50-cent pieces in commemoration of the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Province of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>.</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the <placeName>United States of America</placeName> in Congress assembled, </hi>That, in commemoration of the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Province of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, there shall be coined by the Director of the Mint twenty-five thousand silver 50-cent pieces of standard size, weight, and fineness and of a special appropriate design to be fixed by the Director of the Mint, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, but the <placeName>United States</placeName> shall not be subject to the expense of making the models for master dies or other preparations for this coinage.</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sec. 2.</hi>That the coins herein authorized shall be issued at par and only upon the request of the chairman or secretary of the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> Tercentenary Commission.</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sec. 3.</hi>Such coins may be disposed of at par or at a premium by said Commission and all proceeds shall be used in furtherance of the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> Tercentenary Commission projects.</q>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sec.</hi> 4. That all laws now in force relating to the subsidiary silver coins of the <placeName>United States</placeName> and the coining or striking of the same; regulating and guarding the process of coinage; providing for the purchase of

material, and for the transportation, distribution, and redemption of the coins; for the prevention of debasement or counterfeiting; for security of the coin; or for any other purposes, whether said laws are penal or otherwise, shall, so far as applicable, apply to the coinage herein directed.</q>
                  <q>Approved, May 9, 1934.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is obvious that the responsibility for the coinage now rests with the Director of the Mint. He is named specifically, whereas previous Acts had, with few exceptions, merely stated that "there shall be coined"; moreover, in the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> issue no mention is made of the Mint. Most of the previous coinage enactments had expressed only the total number of pieces which could be struck under that Act, but in the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> issue there is a fixed coinage figure given, for the production of which the Director of the Mint was made responsible. This was the first Act to contain any reference to the sale of the pieces at a premium.</p>
               <p>The coins were designed by Hans Schuler, the Director of the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> Institute, whose monogram appears upon the reverse. The preparation of the dies as well as the reduction work was done by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>. During July, 1934, the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> struck 25,015 pieces. The entire issue was distributed by the Commission through <placeName>Maryland</placeName> banks, at one dollar each.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In connection with the two-hundredth anniversary of the birth of that famous frontiersman, <persName>Daniel Boone</persName>, half-dollars were struck in 1934. Varieties were struck in 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938.</p>
               <p>The Act of Congress authorized an issue of 600,000 half-dollars. Since orders from the Commission to the mint were for small quantities of the coins and in addition were divided at times among the three mints, an exceptional amount of publicity has been given to this issue.</p>
               <pb n="102"/>
               <p>The text of the Act is as follows:

               <p>The models for the coins were prepared by <persName>Augustus Lukeman</persName>, of <placeName>New York</placeName>, who had assisted in the memorial at Stone Mountain, <placeName>Georgia</placeName>. The reduction work was done by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>. The obverse depicts Boone as he appeared at the height of his career, as a pioneer in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>. Since there are no portraits of Boone from this period, the design was created from contemporary descriptions. The reverse shows Boone negotiating a treaty with Chief Black Fish of the Shawnee Indians, after the siege of Fort Boones borough, in 1778.</p>
               <pb n="103"/>
               <p>The first issue of these coins, 10,007 pieces, was struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> in October, 1934. That only 10,000 pieces should have been coined in the first mintage is unusual, since the Act authorized the Director of the Mint to issue a fixed number of pieces—600,000.</p>
               <p>Since 1925, the practice in this regard had been to coin the number of pieces fixed in the Act. The Arkansas authorization, is also a fixed coinage, but states merely that "there shall be coined," whereas the Boone authorization charges the Director of the Mint with a definite coinage. It would have been in order for the Director of the Mint to have had the entire quantity coined at the first striking. In fact, the precedent for this incomplete coinage in 1934 would have gone back to the <placeName>Lexington</placeName>-<placeName>Concord</placeName> issue; and one can only guess what course commemorative coins in the <placeName>United States</placeName> might have followed, if the <persName>Daniel Boone</persName> Bicentennial Commission had been unable to secure fifteen additional coinages from this authorization. Had the terms of the Act been fully understood by the authorities in the light of past practice under similar circumstances, there would have been but a single issue of the <persName>Daniel Boone</persName> half-dollar. However, it was otherwise. The first issue of 1934 was marketed at one dollar and sixty cents each, by the <persName>Daniel Boone</persName> Bicentennial Commission, of <placeName>Lexington</placeName>, <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>. In the following years, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, further issues were struck.</p>
               <p>The designs for the coins placed the year of coinage upon the reverse. When the 1935 issue was
<pb n="104"/>
struck, the Commission found that the commemorative date of 1934 had been removed from the design. Therefore, they obtained from Congress a special authorization to place this date again on the coinage, in small numerals. The Act was approved in the late summer of 1935; and in the late winter of that year, limited coinages of the double-date variety were struck at the branch mints by order of the Commission. The special Act follows:
<q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">[Public—No. 342—74th Congress]</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">An Act To</hi> authorize the Director of the Mint to supplement the approved design of the 50-cent piece commemorating the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of <persName>Daniel Boone</persName>, the coinage of which was authorized by Act of the Seventy-third Congress (Public, Numbered 258, S. 3355).</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="italic">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the <placeName>United States of America</placeName> in Congress assembled</hi>, That, inasmuch as the annual change in coinage date required by law has caused the removal of the commemorative date of 1934 from the design originally approved and in use for the coinage of the 50-cent pieces commemorating the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of <persName>Daniel Boone</persName>, authorized by the Seventy-third Congress in Public Act Numbered 258 (S. 3355), the Director of the Mint, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, be, and is hereby, authorized to supplement the said design so that the reverse of said 50-cent piece will show the figures "1934" immediately above the words "pioneer year."</q>
                  <q>Approved, August 26, 1935.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The furore which resulted from the coinage of these pieces, which every commemorative coin collector and speculator in America was endeavouring to secure, resulted in a vicious attack upon the Commission by those who had not received the coins,
<pb n="105"/>
and an equally staunch defense by those who had them. Full details regarding the controversy may be read in the "Numismatist;" compare the issues of January to July 1936.</p>
               <p>The result of the agitation was that Congressional hearings were held, and the abuses of the commemorative coin authorizations were exposed. Following the hearing, larger issues were authorized; the number of pieces which could be secured from the Mint at one time was fixed, and the coinage at more than one Mint was stopped, insofar as any new authorizations were concerned. The coinage at several mints has not ceased, however, for the issues which were authorized some years ago, and these may possibly continue to strike coins for years. Those authorizations bear the words "at the mints."</p>
               <p>The table below shows the original price asked by the Commission, the number of pieces coined, the month of coinage, and the number melted, of each issue.</p>
               <p>The 1937 issue has an interesting feature, in that the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> coins were first offered at one dollar and sixty cents each. Some months later, an offering of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> and Denver coins was made at seven dollars and a quarter per pair, and the Denver issue could not be purchased separately.</p>
               <p>Still later in 1937, an offering of the <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> Mint coin was made at five dollars and fifteen cents. Orders were taken for this issue alone, although the last offering by the Commission was for complete sets only, at twelve dollars and forty cents—the
<pb n="106"/>
highest original price which any Commission ever asked for coins which it secured from the Mint at a cost of fifty cents each, plus expenses of the coinage preparation of the dies, and the Commission’s expenses.</p>
               <p>The trend of premiums for commemorative coins has been steadily increasing. The <placeName>Columbia</placeName>n issue of 1892 was released at a premium of 100 per cent (then considered an absurd profit for the Commission to realize). The 1937 s Boone issue was released at a premium of 930 per cent!</p>
               <p>The proceeds from the sale of these pieces was used to purchase sites significant in the career of <persName>Daniel Boone</persName>, which in turn could be presented to the Government as parks, and be perpetuated as national shrines.</p>
               <p>To date, the coinage of the Boone half-dollars has been approximately one-sixth of the total authorization. The Commission had released a statement advising that no future issues of the Boone coins would be ordered from the Mints, but late in the fall of 1938 announced another issue of 5,000 coins from each Mint at six dollars and a half per set.</p>
               <p>The issues to date have been as follows:</p>

                  <q>Approved, May 14, 1934.</q>

               <p>The coins were designed by <persName>Edward Everett Burr</persName> of <placeName>Chicago</placeName>. The models were prepared by Miss <persName>Emily Bates</persName> of <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>. The dies were finished by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Although the anniversary of the Centennial did not occur until 1936, pieces from the three mints were coined in 1935.</p>
               <pb n="110"/>
               <p>The 1935 <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> pieces were sold by the Commission directly, but the bulk of the branch mint issues was handled by a dealer. The <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> Centennial Commission of Little Rock, <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, did not care to handle the retail sale of these coins after 1936, and as a result, as early as 1935, the Commission was traveling about the country, prepared to sell its rights to the highest bidder. Because of this unsettled situation, the <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> series have been nicknamed the <hi rend="italic">"</hi> orphan issue," as they were available anywhere except <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>.</p>
               <p>During 1936, an endeavor was made to secure three additional reverses for the <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> issue. Although this plan did not materialize, one reverse was authorized by Congress in 1936 as follows:

                  <q>Approved, June 26, 1936.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This supplementary Act, it is interesting to note, specified the minimum and maximum coinages which might be struck and also had the coinage date clause. In this instance, because of a specific dating clause in the Act, the coins, for the first time, were struck in a year other than the date shown upon the issue. Although a maximum of 50,000 pieces had been authorized, available to the Commission (or its agents) in two allotments of 25,000 each, only 25,265 pieces of the new reverse were coined in January, 1937, at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The late Senator <persName>Joseph T. Robinson</persName> consented to have his portrait placed upon the reverse of this State issue. <persName>Henry Kreiss</persName>, the designer of the Connecticut and Bridgeport issues, prepared the model for the reverse, the earlier obverse having been retained. The models were reduced by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The <persName>Robinson</persName> reverse issue was released by a coin dealer. A number of these pieces were struck in " proof condition," but are not easily distinguishable as they lack proof brilliance.</p>
               <pb n="112"/>
               <p>The 1937 issue was distributed in special presentation cases, which were supplied by the distributors. A quantity of the 1937 issue were also struck in "proof condition," but again the proofs are not distinctive.</p>
               <p>An issue of special postage stamps was also released for the <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> Centennial in 1936.</p>
               <p>To date, including the additional reverse coinage, only one-fifth of the <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> half-dollars authorized have been minted. The coinages that have appeared are as follows:</p>

               <p>The three stars in the device above have a double significance. They serve to represent the three flags which have flown over <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, and also to signify that <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> was the third State created from the territory acquired by the <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase. The single star represents the participation of <placeName>Arkansas</placeName> in the Confederacy.</p>

               <p>88. A description of the <persName>Robinson</persName> reverse follows, the obverse being from the same dies as 79.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. Bust of Senator <persName>Joseph T. Robinson</persName>, facing right. Around upper circumference: <hi rend="smallcaps">

               </p>
               <p>With the exception of <persName>Robinson’s</persName> name, this type carries the same inscription and legends borne by the original issue.</p>
               <p>The question of the obverse and the reverse of this issue is of particular interest, as it is usually understood in numismatics that a portrait becomes the obverse. In this instance, the portrait of <persName>Robinson</persName> is officially the reverse. The reason for this is the unusual interpretation of the coinage-date side as the obverse. Here, it is the date specified in the supplementary Act (1936), rather than the coinage year which was 1937.</p>

               <p>The earliest Connecticut colonists came from <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> which they left because the government there was too autocratic. Under the leadership of <persName>Thomas Hooker</persName>, they formed a colony in which the Bible was the supreme guide.</p>
               <p>In 1638, New Haven was founded; subsequently it combined with a number of the nearby groups. In 1662, Connecticut received a royal charter, which Sir Edmund Andros attempted to revoke in 1687 under orders from the Stuart King, <persName>James II</persName> of <placeName>England</placeName>. The Charter was carefully guarded, and according to tradition was secreted in an oak tree, subsequently known as the <hi rend="italic">"</hi> Charter Oak." After <persName>James II</persName> was overthrown in 1688, the Charter was produced and the Colony continued under it.</p>
               <p>The "Charter Oak" is the main device on the obverse of the half-dollar, as well as on the three cent postage stamps issued for the celebration.</p>
               <p>The Act of Congress authorizing this issue follows:

               <p>The coin was designed by <persName>Henry Kreiss</persName>, an artist working under the direction of Paul Manship. It is interesting that although the Act specifically states that the Government shall not pay for the expenses of the designing of the models, it did finance this as a Public Works Administration project. The dies were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>During the months of April and May, 1936, the entire authorized coinage of 25,018 pieces was struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>. The Connecticut Tercentenary Commission released these, in small boxes, through the banks of Connecticut, at one dollar each. The proceeds from the sale of the coins were used to defray the expenses of the Celebration.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The occasion for a souvenir half-dollar was the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the city of Hudson, <placeName>New York</placeName>, in 1785. This town of 14,000 inhabitants was one of importance in the late eighteenth century at the time it received its charter. The city was named after Hendrik Hudson, who sailed up the Hudson River in 1609 as an employee of the Dutch East India Company in search of a northwest passage to the Orient.</p>

                  <q>Approved, May 2, 1935.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The above Act is one of the few instances in the
<pb n="119"/>
commemorative coinage wherein two or more issues have been authorized in the same Act. The Hudson issue was released in 1935; that of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> was not struck until 1936, and is described in its sequence.</p>
               <p>The pleasing design of this issue is by Chester Beach, the designer of a number of previous commemorative issues.</p>
               <p>The <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> struck 10,,008 coins, which represented the entire authorized coinage, in June, 1935, and these were originally distributed at one dollar each. Considerable criticism was evoked by this issue, as few collectors had time to place their orders with the Commission prior to its entire disposal which had taken place within an unbelievably short time. This promptness on the part of the Commission combined with wholesale selling resulted in a rapid rise of the retail price.</p>

               <p>The Old Spanish Trail half-dollar was authorized by Congress to commemorate the four hundredth anniversary of the first overland trek on territory now a part of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.

               <p>In 1935, during the month of September, 10,008 of these commemorative coins were struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>, representing the entire authorized coinage. The coins were distributed by the El Paso Museum Committee at two dollars each, and the proceeds were used in furthering the work of the El Paso Museum. The distribution of these pieces was very wide, and none were returned to the Mint.</p>
               <p>No portrait of this sixteenth century explorer is known. His name, Cabeza de Vaca literally translated means "the head of a cow," and a cow’s head was chosen as the obverse, another example of the use of a canting type.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The coin was designed by <persName>Robert Aitken</persName>, who had previously designed the Panama-Pacific quintuple-eagles and the <placeName>Missouri</placeName> half-dollars. During the month of August, 1935, there were struck at the <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> Mint, 250,132 half-dollars. These pieces were released by the <placeName>California</placeName>-Pacific International Exposition Commission at one dollar each,
<pb n="124"/>
and a very extensive campaign was waged to market the coins.</p>
               <p>Although the Exposition was a notable success to the extent that it was held over from the 1935 season, the half-dollar was not very popular with collectors, because of the large coinage.</p>
               <p>At about this time, commemorative coin collectors throughout the nation became coinage-figure conscious. Coinage figures for a while determined retail values. Large authorizations meant a tremendous floating supply of coins, which would have little value to the commemorative coin collector or to his new companion, the commemorative coin speculator.</p>
               <p>To combat this situation, the <placeName>California</placeName>-Pacific International Exposition’s Coin Commission succeeded in having a bill passed by Congress which was designed to permit the recoinage of 1935 half-dollars into 1936 half-dollars at the Denver Mint, thus providing for collectors the stimulus of an added date and an additional mint-mark. Thus, the San Diego set has now the distinction of being the only series on which two different mint-marks appear, and which had no coinage at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.

               </p>
               <p>The additional recoinage of the <placeName>San Diego</placeName> half-dollars is worthy of more than passing note, since many interesting factors are involved. The original Act authorized the coinage of not more than a quarter-million of this issue. The recoinage permitted the reissuing of one hundred and eighty thousand pieces, but added the many features which had become a part of the commemorative coinage legislation. Thus we read that all the recoined pieces shall bear the date 1936, irrespective of the coinage year, and that they shall be struck
<pb n="126"/>
at one Mint, and that the Act shall be ineffective after a year. Since these clauses had been introduced into commemorative coinage legislation to prevent additional varieties, it is singular to find them in a "recoinage" Act which authorized a second variety. The purpose of their inclusion here, of course, was to prevent a variety beyond the second. The original authorization permitted the coinage of 250,000 half-dollars. The recoinage permitted 180,000 pieces of the original coinage to bear a different date and mint-mark. The Mints, therefore, under the two authorizations at different times had to prepare a total of 430,000 half-dollars, although a total coinage of 250,000 pieces was the original limitation placed upon this issue, beyond which further pieces could not be coined. At no time were more than 250,000 pieces outstanding.</p>
               <p>These were released by the Commission at one dollar and fifty cents each. Of this recoinage issue, 150,000 were returned to the Mint and melted. A special issue of postage stamps was also released.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city of Providence, the first settlement in <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, by the great leader <persName>Roger Williams</persName>, was commemorated by a half-dollar of special design authorized by Congress in 1935.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Roger Williams</persName> was a Puritan, who was forced to leave Salem, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, because of his political and religious views. He went to <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> arriving at Slate Rock, and founded Providence in 1636, where he preached tolerance, religious liberty and freedom of conscience.</p>
               <p>Providence, R. I., flourished during the Colonial period and became one of the most important towns in <placeName>New England</placeName>. In 1832, Providence secured a charter as a City, and during the nineteenth century developed as a manufacturing center.</p>
               <p>Appropriate celebrations were held throughout <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> during the Tercentenary year, and a special postage stamp was released.</p>
               <p>The Act of Congress authorizing this issue was combined with the Act authorizing the <persName>Hudson</persName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, Sesquicentennial coinage, which is given on page 117.</p>
               <p>The designs for this coin were prepared jointly by <persName>John Howard Benson</persName> and <persName>Arthur Graham Carey</persName>, both of Newport, R. I. The reduction of the models was made by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The authorization of 50,000 coins was distributed between the three mints as follows:</p>

               <p>The <placeName>Columbia</placeName>, <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, souvenir half-dollars were authorized early in 1936 to mark the sesquicentennial of the founding of that city as the capital in 1786.

               <p>Extensive celebrations were held in the State during 1936, and, as an aid in financing these undertakings, a special half-dollar was authorized by Congress.</p>

               <p>This Act was the first concerning commemorative coinage to be passed in 1936, and it was also the first Act which provided a fixed total for the issue. The Director of the Mint was charged with its production, as was the case with a number of the previous coinage Acts. The Act merely specified a coinage and it was the interpretation of the phraseology which made possible a coinage in small quantities divided among the three mints.</p>
               <p>This issue was designed by <persName>A. Wolfe Davidson</persName>, an art student at Clemson College, <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>.</p>
               <pb n="132"/>
               <p>The models were reduced by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Striking of the coins was divided among the three mints, as follows: <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> 9,007; <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> 8,007; Denver 8,009.</p>
               <p>The majority of these pieces were coined during September 1936; in fact, they were among the last commemorative pieces of that year, notwithstanding the fact that this coinage was the first approved in 1936. Many issues authorized after that for <placeName>Columbia</placeName>, S. C., were released prior to this issue.</p>
               <p>The coins were released by the commission appointed by the Mayor of <placeName>Columbia</placeName>, <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, in complete sets of three pieces at six dollars and forty-five cents per set. The distribution was made by the commission on a very fair basis, and few persons were able to secure these coins in quantity. It made every endeavor to treat the collector fairly and to prevent the speculator from manipulating the prices of the sets in the open market, as had been done with many previous commemorative issues.</p>

               <p>The obverse shows the portrait of Stephen Foster, the popular composer and song writer of the nineteenth century. In 1926, a commemorative issue for Stephen Foster had been suggested by <persName>Pittsburgh</persName>, <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, to commemorate the centennial of his birth in 1826 in that city. He was the composer of "Old Folks at Home," "Oh Susannah," "Old <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> Home," " Nelly was a Lady," etc.</p>
               <p>The coins were designed by Constance Ortmayer of <placeName>Washington</placeName>, D. C. During July, 1936, the entire authorized issue of 15,000 Cincinnati, <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, Musical Center half-dollars was coined at the three mints as follows: <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> 5,005; <placeName>San Francisco</placeName> 5,006; Denver 5,005.</p>
               <p>Due to the very limited coinage authorized and the fact that the commemorative half-dollar wave
<pb n="135"/>
was at its peak, the entire issue was over-subscribed prior to the release of the first set. These pieces were sold in sets only, in printed cards. The price per set was established at seven dollars and seventy-five cents—a new high level for the initial cost of a new type. A number of sets were released with special numbers signifying the order in which they were coined.</p>

               <p>It is interesting to observe that despite the very limited authorization of only 15,000 half-dollars, the phrase "at the Mints" was inserted. At this period, the authorizing Acts read: "to be coined by the Director of the Mint"—the Cincinnati issue was the very last Act authorizing a coinage of souvenir half-dollars with the specific provision that the pieces shall be coined "at the mints."</p>

               <p>In August, 1936, the authorized issue of 100,053 pieces was coined at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>. These pieces were distributed by the banks throughout Long Island at one dollar each; and in view of the large authorizations as well as the speculative demand for commemorative half-dollars of small issues only, the Long Island Tercentenary Commission was notably successful in disposing of nearly the entire coinage. Late in 1936, there were 18,227 pieces returned to the mint to be melted—a comparatively small quantity.</p>

               <p>This coin has been generally criticized because of its stereotyped design, as so many of the previous half-dollars bear accolated busts on the obverse, and ships on the reverse.</p>
               <p>This Act was the first to contain the provision that "the coins shall bear the date 1936, irrespective of the year in which they are minted or issued," a most extraordinary regulation, but one which has been quite widely used in commemorative coinage bills of recent date. This policy of fixing the date which is to appear on the issue, has resulted in much confusion in instances where coins were struck prior to or after the date they bore.</p>
               <p>The Act states the minimum number of coins
<pb n="139"/>
which the commission may order at one time, thus preventing a recurrence of the small coinage rarities. It also limits the length of time to one year, during which a commission may function in withdrawing its entire authorization from the Mint. Thus, a commission may not continuously re-issue the same coin year after year.</p>
               <p>This Act was also the first to specify that the coins should be struck "at a mint," making impossible the production of three varieties of a single type by the introduction of mint-marks.</p>
               <p>Collectors attribute this change in the text of the commemorative coinage Acts, to a hearing on Commemorative Coinage held before the Committee on Banking and Currency during March, 1936. In this "Hearing," the abuses to which the commemorative coinages had been subjected were thoroughly aired, from an official standpoint, and the result was apparent in the subsequent Acts. Within a month after the hearing, many of the evils disappeared.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In order to commemorate fittingly the Centennial of the establishing of Territorial Government in Wisconsin, a souvenir half-dollar was authorized by Act of Congress in 1936.</p>
               <p>The Wisconsin Territory included parts of the present Dakotas, Minnesota and <placeName>Illinois</placeName>. The first Territorial Governor, <persName>Henry Dodge</persName>, an appointee of President <persName>Jackson</persName>, took office on Independence Day, 1836, as noted on the coin.</p>
               <p>It is worthy of special note that this issue does not commemorate the centennial of admission into the Union, which was an occasion for many State commemorative issues. The Wisconsin half-dollar anticipates by twelve years the State centennial of admission into the Union.</p>
               <p>The Act of Congress authorizing this issue reads:
<q>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">[Public—No. 593—74th Congress]</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The original designs for this issue were prepared by <persName>David Parsons</persName>, an art student at the University of Wisconsin. The models which Parsons prepared were then sent to Benjamin Hawkins, a <placeName>New York</placeName> artist, who made a number of changes in the designs and inscriptions, in order to meet the technical requirements of the mint. The reduction of the models was by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>During July, 1936, the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> struck 25,015 pieces, and this coinage represented the minimum permitted under the Act. These pieces were distributed by the Commission at one dollar and fifty cents each.</p>
               <p>The designs selected for this issue were well chosen, as they are significant of the State’s history. The obverse shows the badger, still the emblem of
<pb n="144"/>
the state, and typifying the early fur-trading days when the Northwest Territory was first opened. It might be noted, however, that the Territorial Seal was not copied in every detail. The reverse, displaying the seal of the Territorial Government, depicts the early lead mining by primitive methods in Wisconsin. Both obverse and reverse of this issue emphasize the natural and physical resources of the state of Wisconsin.</p>

               <p>The Wisconsin issue is notable, as it is one of three issues all approved on the same day, in which no limit is placed upon the coinage of half-dollars for the period specified under the terms of the Act. Under these three Acts, an unlimited number of
<pb n="145"/>
coins could have been ordered by each commission in the minimum amounts specified; and for the period of a year Congress relinquished control of the limitation of the coinage of half-dollars to the Wisconsin, Bridgeport and Delaware-Swedish commissions.</p>

               <p>This Act is in the same category as the Wisconsin and Delaware-Swedish issues, as the minimum coinage has been stated. There is one difference between this and the two Acts mentioned above, as those two had expiration dates after which the coins could not be struck. Since this Act has no such date, Bridgeport half-dollars may be struck indefinitely bearing the date 1936, there being no limit as to the number of specimens which may be coined.</p>
               <p>This oversight actually places control of the half-dollar coinage in the hands of the Bridgeport commission rather than in those of the Congressional Committees on Coinage. Can the wide powers given by the above Act to the Bridgeport Centennial, Inc., be abrogated without a special Act of Congress?</p>

               <p>This issue was designed by <persName>Henry Kreiss</persName>, who also prepared the Connecticut Tercentenary issue. The reverses of the two issues bear certain resemblances. The style of the eagle on the Bridgeport issue in particular was criticized as being ultra-modernistic. The dies were prepared by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>, which also did the reduction work.</p>
               <p>During September, 1936, the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> struck 25,015 pieces which was the minimum issue under the Act. These were distributed by the commission, the Bridgeport Centennial, Inc., and the proceeds were used to defray the costs of celebrations held in the city during the year. The coins were issued in small presentation boxes, and were sold at two dollars each. Many of the banks in Bridgeport offered the coins for sale.</p>

It was for the purpose of financing the heroic Memorial that the issue of half-dollars was authorized, as noted in the Act. Trygve Rovelstad also designed the Memorial.</p>
               <p>The obverse shows the head of one of the figures in the Pioneer Memorial group; the reverse depicts the complete Memorial Statue, as was required by the terms of the Act.</p>
               <p>An interesting feature of this Act is that the maximum coinage permitted is equal to the mini-

               <p>During October, 1936, a total of 25,015 pieces was struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> and released to the <placeName>Elgin</placeName> Centennial Monumental Committee, which distributed them at one dollar and fifty cents each through Mr. <persName>L.

               <p>Upon the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of York County, <placeName>Maine</placeName>, a souvenir half-dollar was authorized by Congress. York County, <placeName>Maine</placeName>’s first county, had as its center, on the Saco River, Brown’s Garrison, around which a town dedeveloped in 1636.

               <p>The designs for the half-dollar were prepared by <persName>Walter H. Rich</persName> of <placeName>Portland</placeName>, <placeName>Maine</placeName>. These were then cast in brass by the Pacetti Company in <placeName>Boston</placeName>. The Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName> reduced the designs.</p>
               <p>During August, 1936, the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> struck 25,015 coins of the commission’s authorization of 30,000, and these were in turn released to the Committee for the Commemoration of the Founding of York County for distribution at one dollar and fifty cents each.

               <p>The design for the stockade shown upon the reverse of the coin was taken from an old wood-cut,

and the obverse was an adaptation of the York County seal.</p>

               <p>In some respects, this design bears considerable likeness in treatment to the Fort <placeName>Vancouver</placeName> Centennial issue.

               <pb n="160"/>
               <p>The total coinage permitted was 30,000 pieces and, as the coins might be withdrawn only in amounts of not less than 25,000, this meant that the commission could only secure its full authorization in its first allotment. The basis for an arrangement of this nature in the Act is not entirely clear, but the commission was unable to secure the 5,000 additional coins authorized.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In commemoration of the three-hundredth anniversary of the landing of the Swedes in Delaware, a special issue of souvenir half-dollars was authorized.</p>
               <p>Late in 1637, the first Swedish colonists left Gothenburg, and in March, 1638, arrived in Delaware Bay. They proceeded up the river then called Christina River, named after the reigning Queen of Sweden, and anchored opposite a rocky ledge not far from the present site of the Old Swede’s Church in <placeName>Wilmington</placeName>, Delaware (shown upon the coin). This is oldest Protestant church building in America still used for worship. The ship in which they arrived bore the name "Kalmar Nyckel" or Key of Kalmar. The representation of this ship upon the coin is taken from an authentic model in the Swedish Naval Museum.</p>
               <p>Interestingly enough, this Colony was settled under the leadership of <persName>Peter Minuit</persName>, who had been instrumental in the <placeName>New Netherland</placeName> colonization of 1624 under the Dutch West India Company. In
<pb n="161"/>
1638, Minuit was in the employ of the Swedish West India Company, and upon his arrival in the New World with the Swedish colonists, he purchased land from the Indians (this purchase did not have historical notoriety such as attended the purchase of <placeName>Manhattan Island</placeName>), and erected <placeName>Fort Christina</placeName>.</p>
               <p>In 1655, the Dutch acquired control of Delaware; and in 1664, the English. In 1682, under <persName>William Penn</persName>, Delaware was united with <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>. Until the Revolution, the two states had a common Governor. Delaware was the first State to ratify the Federal Constitution in 1787.</p>

               <pb n="162"/>
               <p>A minimum issue of twenty-five thousand half-dollars was authorized. The three issues approved on the same day (May 15),—the Wisconsin, Bridgeport and Delaware-Swedish issues—all contain the minimum coinage clause which placed no limit on the coinage of the souvenir half-dollars within the period specified. For the period of one year, Congress gave to these commissions the privilege of producing half-dollars in unlimited amounts.</p>
               <p>The designing of this issue was the subject of a competition, the winner to receive $500.00. Numerous designs were submitted, but that of <persName>Carl L. Schmitz</persName> was finally accepted.</p>
               <p>The models were reduced by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>. The Mint at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> coined 25,015 pieces of this issue in March, 1937.</p>
               <p>Insofar as its position in the sequence of half-dollars is concerned, the Delaware-Swedish half-dollar is confusing. It was authorized in 1936, and was required by the Act to carry that date. It was, however, actually coined in 1937, in anticipation of an anniversary to occur in 1938.</p>
               <p>The Equitable Trust Company of <placeName>Wilmington</placeName>, <placeName>Delaware</placeName>, distributed these pieces at one dollar and seventy-five cents each.</p>

               <p>The anniversary of the settlement in 1638 was celebrated in 1938 with appropriate festivals both in this country and in Sweden. A Swedish commemorative two kroner coin has already been released showing upon the obverse the head of the king, and upon the reverse the ship, "Kalmar Nyckel." This is one of the few instances of an American and a foreign coinage having the same type.</p>

               <p>An issue of 50,000 half-dollars was authorized, and, at one time, plans were in effect to have the issue divided among the three Mints. This did not materialize, however, and in June, 1937, the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> struck 50,028 of these half-dollars.</p>
               <p>The models were prepared by <persName>Frank Vittor</persName>, a well-known Pittsburgh sculptor, and when completed were reduced by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The coins were distributed by the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> State Commission of Gettysburg, Penna., at one dollar and sixty-five cents each.

for the Confederate Army, and proved to be the turning point in the War.</p>
               <p>The Gettysburg half-dollar is in the same anticipatory position as the <placeName>Delaware</placeName>-Swedish issue. The Gettysburg issue was authorized in 1936 to commemorate an anniversary falling in 1938. The Act specifies that the coins bear the date 1936 regardless of the year in which coined.

               <p>In September, 1937, the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> struck 25,013 half-dollars. These were released by the <placeName>Norfolk</placeName> Advertising Board at one dollar and fifty cents each. There were 25,000 coins authorized; and not less than 25,000 coins could be withdrawn at one time. In 1938, there were 5,000 <placeName>Norfolk</placeName> half-dollars returned to the Mint, reducing the coinage to 20,000 pieces, the number which the commission had originally requested.</p>
               <p>The obverse shows a ship in the center of a medallion. On the reverse of the coin appears the historic Mace, which was presented by Lieutenant-Governor <persName>Robert Dinwiddie</persName> to the Corporation of <placeName>Norfolk</placeName> in 1753. It was formally accepted by the Common Council in 1754. The Mace has been shown only on rare occasions in <placeName>Norfolk</placeName>, and was used upon the coin because it is one of the treasures of the city which has been carefully guarded for nearly two centuries. The use of the crown, which is a part of the Mace, was criticized somewhat as being contrary to a device representing Liberty. This was the second instance of a royal crown upon the commemorative coinage—the first example having been the <persName>Isabella</persName> quarter-dollar.</p>

               <p>In commemoration of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding and settling of the city of <placeName>New Rochelle</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, a commemorative half-dollar was authorized. The original plans for this issue were formulated by a small group interested in coins; and the first drafts of the Act mentioned a local numismatic club as the distributors.

                  <q>Approved, May 5, 1936.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The designs for the coin were prepared by Gertrude <persName>K. Lathrop</persName>, who had also made those for the <placeName>Albany</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>, half-dollar. The models were reduced by the Medallic Art Company of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>In 1688, the first French Huguenots arrived from <placeName>Rochelle</placeName>, <placeName>France</placeName>, and purchased from <persName>John Pell</persName> a tract of several thousand acres. The settlers were represented in the transaction by Jacob Leisler, who later became Governor of <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>One of the provisions of the transfer of title was that the new owner, or his heirs and assigns (the Huguenot settlers) should give to <persName>John Pell</persName>, or his heirs and assigns, as lords of the Manor of Pelham ". . . one fatt calfe on every fouer and twentyth day of June Yearly and Every Year, forever, (if demanded) ..."</p>
               <p>It is for this reason that the calf is represented upon the obverse of the coin; the <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lis</hi> upon the reverse was placed upon the coin because this device appears on the coat-of-arms of <placeName>Rochelle</placeName>, <placeName>France</placeName>, and it is still a part of the Seal of <placeName>New Rochelle</placeName>, <placeName>New York</placeName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>New Rochelle</placeName>, N. Y., prospered through the years, and in 1857 became a village. In 1899, it was incorporated as a city.</p>
               <p>An issue of 25,000 half-dollars was authorized; the same minimum withdrawal figure ensured a single coinage.</p>
               <pb n="172"/>
               <p>The Act provided that the Mayor of <placeName>New Rochelle, N. Y.</placeName>, appoint a committee for the distribution, and this committee released the coins at two dollars each. There were 25,015 coins struck in April, 1937, at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The Act authorizing this issue specified that the date 1938 should appear upon the coin regardless of the year in which coined. This issue was authorized in 1936, minted in 1937, and carries the date 1938. Fortunately, no other issues are in this chaotic chronological tangle. The difficulty of placing this issue in the sequence of half-dollars is obvious.</p>

               <p>In January, 1937, an issue of 25,015 half-dollars was struck at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName>; and due to the fact that there was no limit on the coinage permitted during the period of the Act’s validity, an additional 25,015 half-dollars were struck in June, 1937. The coinage rights expired on July 1, 1937, the first instance in which a specific date had been mentioned in the Act.

               <p>The coins were released by the Roanoke Colony Memorial Association at one dollar and sixty-five cents each.</p>
               <p>According to the Act which was passed in 1936, all coins were to bear the date 1937, irrespective of the year in which coined. Strangely enough, this is the only issue authorized in 1936 and struck in 1937 which actually carries the minting year. A celebration was held at Old Fort Raleigh, the actual site of the first settlement, during August, 1937.</p>
               <p>A five cent postage stamp was issued in connection with this celebration, for which the design of the reverse of the half-dollar was used as the motif.</p>

               <p>This Act has the distinction of being the only Act approved in 1937 for which there is a coinage dated 1937, and for which the coinage was actually minted in that year.</p>
               <p>The Battle of Antietam was one of the bloodiest single-day battles of the War between the States. Approximately 25,000 soldiers of both sides lost their lives in the conflict.

               <p>An issue of 50,000 coins was authorized, which could be withdrawn in lots of not less than 25,000 half-dollars.</p>

               <p>The fineness of all <placeName>United States</placeName> commemorative issues is uniform. Both gold and silver coins are .900 (thousandths) fine.</p>
               <p>The plates illustrate all issues described in the text. No attempt has been made to illustrate each variety and mint-mark as this would entail needless repetition.</p>
               <p>Where coins of an issue are from both the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> and branch mints, a coin of the latter has been selected in order to show the position of the mint-mark, as the coinages of the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> Mint bear no distinguishing letter.</p>
               <p>The illustrations were made from plaster casts of the coins. Every coin illustrated may be seen in the exhibition rooms of the American Numismatic Society.</p>
