            <p>As long ago as 1934, <persName>Mr. Howland Wood</persName> received, through the kindness of <persName>Mr. Gonzalez</persName>, transcriptions of the documents which follow, and which either are quoted in full or summarized here.</p>
            <p>The importance of this material for anyone interested in the counterstamped pieces of the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> was at once apparent. In August of 1935 we had the pleasure of welcoming <persName>Mr. Gonzalez</persName> at our museum and on his return to <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName> he sent translations of three of the most important of these documents. For some reason, the material was never prepared for publication by <persName>Mr. Wood</persName> and on his death the papers were turned over to the Publication Committee. That Committee decided to reprint these documents, even though we were unable to add to the counterstamped pieces in the Society's cabinet illustrating the practice described. It is felt that what follows sufficiently illustrates the carrying out of these instructions to explain how coins with the fleur-de-lis counterstamp came into existence, how they were withdrawn, and why they are so infrequently met with today, even in <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Since almost all of this information has been supplied by <persName>Mr. Gonzalez</persName> it is fitting that the monograph should appear under his name. Any errors which may have been embodied, however, should not be attributed to him.</p>

            <p>For many years, numismatists have been puzzled by a fleur-de-lis counterstamp which has been found on coins circulating in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, and especially in <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName>. Most of the pieces bearing this counterstamp are of silver and in a great many instances these silver pieces are holed. The counter-stamp does not show marked variation but the pieces to which it is applied cover a fairly considerable period; the pieces known to us bear dates as early as 1800 and as late as 1880. They include issues of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, <placeName>Mexico</placeName> and <placeName>South America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> for 1914, an article on the coinage of the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> was published by the late <persName>Howland Wood</persName>. A brief section thereof was devoted to counterstamps which had been used in Cuba and <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName>. Listed among the undetermined counterstamps is the fleur-de-lis with which we are at present concerned. The illustration used was the piece described below as No. 5. <persName>Mr. Wood</persName>'s description was as follows:
<q>"One of the common stamps on silver coins is what is apparently a double-headed fleur-de-lis (shown in illustration). Some have thought this mark to have reference to some French colony. The shape of the fleur-de-lis would almost preclude this."</q>
               <persName>Mr. Wood</persName>'s conclusions concerning the significance of the counterstamp were based on the knowledge of the few specimens known to him at the time of
<pb n="4"/>
writing. As most of these were on pierced or worn coins of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, he believed that this stamp must have been in use at one of the <placeName>United States</placeName> sub-treasuries to mark as unredeemable coins submitted for redemption. He states, however, that inquiries at official sources brought no confirmation of this suggestion.</p>
            <p>Under date of December 16, 1933, I wrote to <persName>Mr. Wood</persName>, informing him of the decree of the Governor General dated November 27, 1884, which established regulations for the applying of this countermark, and as a result of the correspondence which followed, I later sent him copies of this and succeeding decrees, together with a translation of the more important of them.</p>
            <p>Before proceeding to a description of the coins involved, and a discussion of the decrees, it is fitting that we remind ourselves of the status of <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName>: In 1870 the island had been made a province of Spain and given a representation through elective deputies in the Spanish Cortes. This, however, lasted for four years only, and the island then returned to its former status. In 1877 the representation by deputies was re-established. It was not until 1897 that <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName> was given an autonomous government, and this grant did not become operative before the occupation of the island by the <placeName>United States</placeName> Army in 1898.</p>
            <p>We know that over a long period of years a shortage of small change was characteristic of currency in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> and especially for those islands under a colonial status. The best evidence
<pb n="5"/>
that this condition existed in <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName> is to be found in the decrees with which we are concerned herein, and the coins counterstamped with the fleur-de-lis. A brief description of the specimens available is in consequence next in order:</p>
            <list type="numbered">
               <item n="1.">
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> Dollar of 1800, with a hole obliterating the <hi rend="smallcaps">e</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps">liberty</hi>. Counterstamp eliminates profile.</item>
               <item n="2.">
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> Quarter of 1857, holed at top; fleur-de-lis slightly below the center.</item>
               <item n="3.">
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> Quarter of 1809? The design nearly obliterated, a few letters and two or three of the digits of the date being all that is discernible. In addition to the fleur-de-lis, which is slightly off-center, there are a number of gouges of irregular shape and without any design.</item>
               <item n="4.">Two-real piece struck at <placeName>Guatemala</placeName> in 1817, showing the head of <persName>Ferdinand</persName> VII; pierced at top; counter-stamped with fleur-de-lis.</item>
               <item n="5.">Two-real piece of <placeName>Peru</placeName> for 1826, counterstamped on obverse; worn smooth but not pierced.</item>
               <item n="6.">Copper quarter real piece of the <placeName>Dominican Republic</placeName> for 1844.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These coins are all in the cabinet of the American Numismatic Society. They afford representative examples of the use of the fleur-de-lis counterstamp, without being exhaustive. In my own collection, I have a <placeName>United States</placeName> dollar for 1880, a trade dollar of 1876, a half-dollar of 1857, and four <placeName>United States</placeName> quarters of different dates. All of these were collected in <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName>. Another Puerto Rican collection, that of <persName>Mr. Robert L. Junghanns</persName>, of <placeName>Bayamon</placeName>, contains other counterstamped pieces—a few silver and three or four copper ones. I am also informed by <persName>Mr. Robert R. Prann</persName>, of <placeName>San Juan</placeName>, that he has in
<pb n="6"/>
his possession a number of pieces stamped with the fleur-de-lis.<ref target="#CH1-n1">*</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The official documents relating to these pieces are in the form of decrees issued by the Governor

General for the Island, and give instructions to one and (by implication) to all officials in charge of the custom houses. These were seven in number, as follows: <placeName>Fajardo</placeName>, <placeName>Guayama</placeName>, <placeName>Ponce</placeName>, <placeName>Mayaguez</placeName>, <placeName>Arecibo</placeName>, <placeName>Vieques</placeName> and <placeName>San Juan</placeName>. The first of these decrees, bearing the date November 27, 1884, is also first in importance.</p>

                  <item>5.—Once the General Government has been notified by the authorities that the stamping of said coins has been accomplished, it shall proceed to appoint six persons as representatives of the public Treasury and Commerce Department, to witness the destruction of the dies employed in the performance of said operation.</item>

have been accomplished is not specified, but the second article must have had the intention of supporting the first. The provision that the counter-stamping should be done "as soon as possible" leaves an element of uncertainty which is cleared up by a later document showing that the operation was to be completed by March 31, 1885. We have here an indication of the ultimate purpose of the counter-stamping—the withdrawal of the counterstamped coins from circulation; the interim circulation of pieces which had been counterstamped is given consideration. Unstamped pieces, after a time limit (April 1, 1885) had expired, were no longer to be legal tender. The destruction of the dies bearing the counterstamps is the subject of the final article of the decree.</p>

               <p>This department desiring to terminate the restamping of perforated silver coins as provided for by the decree of the Governor General dated November 27th last, and utilizing the authority given in the sixth paragraph of that decree, has resolved:</p>
               <p>1. The exchange and restamping of pesetas, half-pesos and perforated pesos shall continue to be practiced in the General Treasury Department and in all of the local branches, until the thirty-first day of the present month.</p>
               <p>2. In accordance with the provisions contained in the fourth paragraph of the above cited decree of the Governor General—from the first day of the next month of April, all perforated silver coins which have not been restamped shall remain out of circulation.</p>
               <p>3. All Local Administrators shall see that this end is attained and will comply with the orders which have been communicated, facilitating the operation as much as possible.</p>

               <p>As a result of the counterstamping directed in the preceding documents, and recorded as having been carried out, we may conclude that after April 1, 1885, counterstamped pieces of silver, even when holed or worn, were accepted by the authorities and merchants while pieces not counterstamped were not accepted officially and could not be passed as legal tender; in other words, they circulated, if at all, at bullion rather than face value.</p>
               <p>The next step, the redemption of the counter-stamped silver, is indicated in a decree dated March 17, 1894—ten years after the first one:</p>

               <p>"General Government authorized taking in of all perforated and restamped coins—dollars, half-dollars and quarters, no matter how stamped, provided they bear date prior to 1885, perforated coins having been outlawed November 1884. Your Customs Office should exchange for legal tender all coins complying with requirements above mentioned, within the limit of eight days, and furnish this Office with a detailed telegraphic or postal report of such delivery and exchanges. If you should lack funds, you shall request the exact amount needed of the Treasury Department. The coins collected and exchanged shall be remitted to the Treasury as "reversion of funds" as soon as transaction is effected. I advise the greatest care in this enterprise.

If you receive coins while short of funds, accept them in exchange for your receipt until money reaches you. It will be remitted immediately. Acknowledge receipt."</p>

               <p>This explicitly provides for the exchange of perforated and restamped dollars, half-dollars and quarters, <hi rend="italic">no matter how stamped,</hi> provided they bear a date previous to 1885. It will be seen that holed silver pieces not counterstamped, whether struck before or after 1885, were not redeemable. It is also noteworthy that Mexican or South American pesos, as well as Spanish issues, were locally reckoned in terms of the dollar, since we can hardly suppose these instructions to be intended for <placeName>United States</placeName> dollars only. Presumably the Treasury Department's instructions would take precedence over the decree, which seems to have permitted exchange of currency pierced but not counter-stamped—a provision in direct opposition to the intent of the whole procedure.</p>

               <p>The reader will perhaps have noted that the counterstamped coins were redeemed in pesos—that is, Spanish issues, theoretically, but in all probability, and with much greater likelihood, Mexican issues.

The royal decree published December 6 provides for the replacement of the Mexican silver pesos in circulation.

               <p>The Mexican dollars and other foreign coins withdrawn in <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName> amounted to $6,103,922. Under the Royal Decree published on the 6th December, 1895, these coins were to be melted down for recoinage, Mexican dollars being called in at 95 per cent of their nominal value, or 95 cents of the new coinage being given for each Mexican dollar. The new Spanish dollar will correspond exactly to the five-peseta piece. Spanish gold coin, and gold coin circulating in Spanish dominions, are to be legal tender in <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName>, with a premium of 20 per cent over their nominal value.<ref target="#CH1-n2">*</ref>

               <p>I have the honor to inclose herewith an 'extraordinary' copy of the Official Gazette of <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName>, together with a translation of the same, in reference to the long mooted exchange of the Mexican silver money
<pb n="19"/>
now current in this island for a new money. The details of the plan of exchange have been kept secret up to the time of this publication, on the 8th of December.</p>
               <p>The new money is provincial in its character, but it is in all other respects the same as the coin now circulating in <placeName>Spain</placeName>, except that it is coined for <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName> and will not be taken in circulation, at least for the present, in <placeName>Spain</placeName> or her dominions.</p>
               <p>It is only contemplated by this decree at present to refund the whole dollar—Mexican—and not the fractional Mexican money. This latter money, together with whatever foreign fractional money there is in circulation, will probably be supplanted as soon as enough Mexican dollars are withdrawn from circulation to furnish material for the coinage of the new fractional pieces. These pieces are to be of the same fineness and denomination as those now circulating in <placeName>Spain</placeName>, only as above excepted.</p>
               <p>The bulk of the 5 and 10 cent pieces in circulation are <placeName>United States</placeName> coin of these denominations, badly mutilated; therefore, it may be interesting to learn what has become of a certain amount—an amount not easily estimated—of bad <placeName>United States</placeName> coin.</p>
               <p>There is a considerable seigniorage resulting from the recoinage of the Mexican money into the new coin, and it is provided, after paying all the expenses attendant upon the exchange, that the residue of this seigniorage shall be converted into gold coin, and placed in circulation at the stated premium of 20 per cent. That it will remain in circulation is hardly to be considered. In fact, the whole reference to gold in the articles of the decree is rather spectacular, unless a covert meaning is attached, which has been rumored, viz., that a certain proportion of all dues, customs and otherwise, to the Government will have to be paid in gold and taken by the Government at this nominal rate of 20 per cent premium. This, however, is conjecture. But if it is carried out and put into execution it will occasion great hardship, as the gold will demand a much higher premium.</p>
               <p>It is rather early as yet to predict what effects this new money will have upon the country. Intrinsically it is not worth as much as the Mexican money, and it is absolutely unsupported. That in the course of time it
<pb n="20"/>
must find its level goes without saying. At present the new money is received with favor by the people, and exchange is weak. The ruling rate on <placeName>New York</placeName> is now in the neighborhood of 58 per cent....</p>

               <p>It is hardly possible that the Puerto Ricans were unaware of the very heavy seigniorage<ref target="#CH1-n4">†</ref> involved in the acceptance of the new coins, and one wonders whether the populace was over-prompt in turning in Mexican dollars at a discount of five per cent, and with a further loss due to the lower silver content of the new coins.</p>
               <p>Very likely experienced numismatists will have noted the lack of any provision for the counterstamping or redemption of the copper coins such as the one in the American Numismatic Society's collection and others in private collections. It is probable that the counterstamping of copper was due to 'excessive zeal' on the part of one or more of the customs administrators, or to misunderstanding of their instructions. There is on record a decree of the Governor, dated March 14, 1896, providing for the acceptance of pierced bronze coins. This piercing of bronze seems to have been done for the purpose of
<pb n="21"/>
keeping small change from leaving the Island for other points where the stringency was even greater. Specimens of these pierced pieces in the cabinet of the American Numismatic Society are all Spanish issues ranging in date from 1870 to 1879.</p>
