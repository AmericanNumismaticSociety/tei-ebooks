            <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>This study considers only medals that have been awarded in recognition of scientific or academic attainment. Consideration of decorations
               conferred for bravery or distinguished service forms no part of this work. In 1924 the Association of Military Surgeons of the <name type="place"
                  >United States</name> published "The Medical Book of Merit: United States Army and Navy Decorations Awarded Medical Officers for Distinguished
               Service in the World War" (<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, pp. 69) which may be consulted for the histories and
               illustrations of such decorations together with the citations of medical officers of the Army and Navy for World War Service.</p>
            <p>The difficulty experienced by the author in obtaining data about the medals described herewith and the even greater task of securing photographs
               of each medal, convinces him that this is a neglected subject, though surely of considerable numismatic interest. About half of these medals are
               not represented in the numismatic collection of the Army Medical Museum of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>,
               though it is one of the most complete of its kind.</p>

            <head>PART I MEDALS OF THE SCHOOLS OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, U. S. ARMY</head>
            <p>The Medical Department of the United States Army, like all other branches of our military service, maintains certain schools for the training of
               its officers and men. Such schools form a part of the Army's educational program in effect in both peace and war.</p>
            <p>While other branches of the Army have schools long in existence, the Medical Department claims the oldest of those which have continued since
               their institution with unchanged objectives. There were three service schools in the United States Army when the Army Medical School was
               established. The oldest, the <hi rend="italic">Artillery School of Instruction</hi> at Ft. <name type="place">Monroe, Virginia</name>, was
               founded in 1824. It is now continued as the <hi rend="italic">Coast Artillery School</hi>. The second school in age was the <hi rend="italic"
                  >School of Application for Infantry and Cavalry</hi>, founded at Ft. <name type="place">Leavenworth, Kansas</name> in 1881. It continues as
               the <hi rend="italic">Command and General Staff School</hi>. The third school, the <hi rend="italic">School of Instruction for Drill and Practice
                  for Cavalry and Light Artillery</hi>, was founded at Ft. <name type="place">Riley, Kansas</name>, in 1887. It continues as the <hi
                  rend="italic">Cavalry School.</hi> All three schools have changed radically in scope of instruction given.</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>Thus, while the Cavalry School and the Coast Artillery School are the successors of schools that were founded before the Army Medical School,
               they are very different from their forerunners. The Army Medical School during its forty-nine years of existence has served always for the
               preparation of medical officers for the duties that devolve upon them in the military service. Such duties embrace the practice of medicine, not
               very different from civil practice, and in addition the exercise of a definite medical specialty‚Äîmilitary medicine. That is a specialty that
               suffers from a handicap that is not faced by other specialties. In the past, particularly before the Army Medical School was founded, the lessons
               learned by military surgeons in the fierce light of war itself were forgotten before the outbreak of the next war. Thereafter they had to be
               learned anew, and again in the hard way. It was to preserve such hard-won learning and to foster research in military medicine that the Army
               Medical School was established.</p>
            <p>The Medical Department of the United States Army is composed of the Surgeon-General, a Major-General; his four Assistants, Brigadier-Generals;
               the Medical Corps; the Dental Corps; the Veterinary Corps; the Medical Administrative Corps and the Nurse Corps. All of these five corps exist in
               the Regular Army and the National Guard. In addition there is in the Reserve a Sanitary Corps, composed of specialists in sanitation. All of the
               above are officers. Enlisted men of the Medical Department <pb n="7"/> were formerly known as the Hospital Corps, a term now out of use in the
               Army, though retained in the Navy. The Enlisted Men, Medical Department, are of the following eleven grades: Master Sergeant, First Sergeant,
               Technical Sergeant, Staff Sergeant, Technician Third Grade, Sergeant, Technician Fourth Grade, Corporal, Technician Fifth Grade, Private First
               Class and Private.</p>
            <p>The Medical Department of the Army maintains certain special service schools, as they are known. Each is designed to give special instruction to
               officers and men of the Department. It will be understood that all schools for officers are "graduate schools" in the sense that only graduates
               of professional schools are admitted. Thus, only Doctors of Medicine, Doctors of Dental Surgery (or Doctors of Dental Medicine) and Doctors of
               Veterinary Medicine are under instruction at the respective Army schools. None of the Army schools gives degrees or in any way compares in scope
               with the professional schools and universities of the country.</p>
            <p>The Schools of the Medical Department are:</p>
            <p>The Army Medical School (established 1893).</p>
            <p>The Army School of Nursing (established 1918).</p>
            <p>The Medical Field Service School (established 1920).</p>
            <p>The Army Dental School (established 1921).</p>
            <p>The Army Veterinary School (established 1922).</p>
            <p>The School of Aviation Medicine (established 1922).</p>
            <p>There have been medals created as awards for <pb n="8"/> academic attainment at all of the above schools, except the School of Aviation
               Medicine.</p>
            <p>These medals have, without exception, been established by private gift, though accepted by the War Department and given official recognition.
               Winners of the medals are listed as "medalists" in the <hi rend="italic">Official Army Register</hi>. The medals, almost without exception, have
               been awarded not oftener than annually, in each case. But in some years the regular courses of instruction have been altered or omitted, so that
               the average has been less than one award per year for each medal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Army Medical School</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army Medical School originated in the mind of Surgeon-General <name type="pname">William Alexander Hammond</name> (1828‚Äì1900), who held
               office at the period of the War Between the States. He had gone so far with the plan as to select the professors, outline the course of
               instruction, and provide lecture rooms and laboratories. However, he failed to obtain the approval of the Secretary of War, Honorable <name
                  type="pname">Edward McMasters Stanton</name>, and the school never materialized in his time. This much regretted delay was due, probably, to
               the personal hostility of Mr. <name type="pname">Stanton</name> to General <name type="pname">Hammond</name>, whom he had tried by court martial
               and dismissed from the service on a technical charge. <name type="pname">Hammond</name> was later exonorated. So this act of Mr. <name
                  type="pname">Stanton's</name> must be charged against his record, along with his disloyalty to President <name type="pname"
               >Lincoln</name>.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <name type="pname">George Miller Sternberg</name> (1838‚Äì1915), <pb n="9"/> took office as Surgeon-General of the Army in 1893, he
               created the Army Medical School, being more fortunate than <name type="pname">Hammond</name>, and having the support of the Secretary of War,
               Honorable <name type="pname">Daniel Scott Lamont</name>.</p>
            <p>Not only is the Army Medical School the oldest of the Army service schools; it also possesses the oldest medal awarded for high academic
               standing, the Hoff Medal. Most of the line special service schools do not have such medals, though there are two exceptions. The Knox Medal is
               awarded at the Field Artillery School, <name type="place">Fort Sill, Oklahoma</name>, to the non-commissioned officer making the best showing at
               the enlisted specialists communications course. A privately endowed Leadership Trophy is presented at the Cavalry School, <name type="place">Fort
                  Riley, Kansas</name>.</p>
            <p>The Army Medical School is in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>. It was at first conducted in the Army Medical
               Library and Museum building at 7th Street and Independence Avenue (formerly B Street), Southwest. Later rented quarters were provided and finally
               in 1922 the large building for the school was completed near the <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> Hospital. These two institutions, and
               other schools of the Medical Department to be mentioned presently, constitute the Army Medical Center.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Army Veterinary School</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prior to the National Defense Act of 1916 there was no Veterinary Corps in the United States Army. Veterinarians, but without military rank, were
               attached <pb n="10"/> theretofore to regiments of Cavalry and Field Artillery, and to the Quartermaster Corps. The National Defense Act created a
               Veterinary Corps as one of the several corps of the Medical Department and transferred to it the veterinarians of Cavalry, Field Artillery and
               Quartermaster Corps.</p>
            <p>A school for veterinary officers, known as The Veterinary School of Meat and Dairy Hygiene, was created in 1920 and announced in War Department
               Circular No. 271, 16 July, 1920. It was located at the General Supply Depot, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name>, and
               formed a part of the scheme of Medical Department training under the Surgeon-General.</p>
            <p>Under authority of Army Regulations 350‚Äì105, the school was removed to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> and made
               a part of the Army Medical Center. Its name was changed to the Army Veterinary School on 11 February, 1922. The removal from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> was authorized by the War
               Department on 7 July, 1923.</p>
            <p>The courses of instruction at the Army Veterinary School are to veterinary officers what those at the Army Medical School are to medical
               officers, and those at the Army Dental School to dental officers. The three schools are in one building and much of the instruction is common to
               all three, thereby effecting a saving of time for all concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Army Dental School</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army Dental School, now one of the units of the group known as the Medical Department Pro- <pb n="11"/> fessional Schools, was created in
               1921, the first class graduating in 1922. The school was first housed in a temporary building at the Army Medical Center, but with the completion
               of the new building of the Army Medical School and other professional schools of the Medical Department, it has been conducted in this modern and
               entirely adequate building.</p>
            <p>The Army Dental School is to the Dental Corps what the Army Medical School is to the Medical Corps. The courses of instruction are similar, with
               certain obvious differences due to the type of duty performed by the officers of the respective corps. The students at the Army Dental School,
               together with those of the Army Veterinary School, receive part of their training in the same classes as the officers of the Army Medical School.
               This is a saving of time for the instructors and also in the use of equipment.</p>
            <p>The Army Dental School offers courses for both officers and enlisted men, the latter being trained as dental technicians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Medical Field Service School</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Medical Field Service School was established by the War Department on 30 June, 1920, upon the recommendation of the Surgeon-General,
               Major-General <name type="pname">Merritte Weber Ireland</name>. It is located at <name type="place">Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania</name>. This
               is one of the oldest posts in the United States Army, having been in continuous military use since its establishment in 1752 by the British Army.
               Several earlier schools <pb n="12"/> have been conducted at this historic post, including the School for Artillerists, established at the time of
               the Revolution, the School for Dragoons, established after the War of 1812, a School for Veterinarians conducted after the Civil War, and the
                  <name type="place">Carlisle</name> Indian Industrial School maintained from 1879 to 1918. One of the buildings was erected in 1777 by Hessian
               prisoners of war captured by General <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> at the battle of <name type="place"
                  >Trenton</name>.</p>
            <p>The post was used during the World War as a General Hospital and has been under control of the Medical Department of the Army ever since. Its
               purpose, as the Medical Field Service School, is to train officers and men of the Medical Department in their duties in the field, in both peace
               and war. Among the subjects taught are tactics, map reading, field sanitation, logistics, military art, training of enlisted personnel, and
               administration. With the graduation of the Officers' Classes and the Officer Candidate Classes by the middle of the year 1942, the total number
               of graduates of the Medical Field Service School, including summer camps, is brought up to over twenty-two thousand. The scope of the Medical
               Field Service School's teaching is summed up in its motto: "To conserve fighting strength."</p>
            <p>There are several courses of instruction. The basic course is for junior officers who have just come into the regular service. It is discontinued
               for the period of the emergency. The advanced course, also temporarily discontinued, is for senior officers soon to come up for promotion
               examinations. The <pb n="13"/> non-commissioned officers' course is still given. As emergency courses there are a series of short officers'
               courses, as they are now called, in which officers receive general instruction for about two months. There is now also a course for selected
               non-commissioned officers, and a few privates, of the Medical Department to qualify them for commissions in the Medical Administrative Corps.
               Besides these courses there are summer camps in normal times for students of the Reserve Officers Training Corps, and Reserve and National Guard
               officers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The School of Aviation Medicine</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The School of Aviation Medicine, established 8 November, 1922, is the successor of the Medical Research Laboratory, created during the World War
               for the study of problems relating to the medical side of aviation. The school trains flight surgeons. It is now located at <name type="place"
                  >Randolph Field, Texas</name>. It is not considered here in detail as it awards no medals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">The Army School of Nursing</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On 25 May, 1918 the Secretary of War, Hon. <name type="pname">Newton Diehl Baker</name>, approved the recommendation of the Surgeon-General of
               the Army, Major-General <name type="pname">William Crawford Gorgas</name>, that there be established the Army School of Nursing, in connection
               with the <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> General Hospital, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, "as a method
               of providing for the rapid expansion of skilled nursing service that the continuation of the war will inevitably demand." Thus the school was <pb
                  n="14"/> an emergency institution growing out of the World War.</p>
            <p>The Army Nurse Corps is one of the several corps of the Medical Department of the Army, its status being similar to that of the Medical Corps,
               the Dental Corps, the Veterinary Corps, the Sanitary Corps and the Medical Administrative Corps. Plans for the Army School of Nursing were made
               by a board consisting of Colonels <name type="pname">William H. Moncrief, Percy M. Ashburn, Warfield T. Longcope, Charles H. Mayo, Winford H.
                  Smith</name> and <name type="pname">Robert E. Noble</name>. These were approved by General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> and the school
               began its work amid the rush and needs of a great war. Besides the senior medical officers just named, several leaders of the nursing profession
               of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> assisted, including <name type="pname">Jane Delano</name>, Chairman of the
               American Red Cross Nursing Service; <name type="pname">Dora Thompson</name>, Superintendent of the Army Nurse Corps; <name type="pname">S.
                  Lillian Clayton</name>, President of the National League of Nursing Education; and <name type="pname">Elizabeth C. Burgess</name> and <name
                  type="pname">Annie W. Goodrich</name>, Inspecting Nurses.</p>
            <p>The school was organized in three bureaus: (1) General Information, (2) Credentials and (3) Inspection. There were nine members of the
               professional staff and a clerical staff of thirty. An advisory council of distinguished medical and nursing personnel was appointed by General
                  <name type="pname">Gorgas</name>. The faculty comprised the nurse directors and instructors, the medical lecturers and such other assistants
               as were required in the development of the school. The active support of the American Red <pb n="15"/> Cross was given from the start.
               Arrangements were made for certain phases of the training to be given at hospitals other than the <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name>, where
               such other institutions had greater facilities for teaching. Thus, in obstetrics, gynÔøΩcology, and pÔøΩdiatrics, particularly, the instruction was
               given in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> General Hospital, the <name type="pname">Johns
                  Hopkins</name> Hospital, and others.</p>
            <p>The work of the Army School of Nursing was of the highest quality and its graduates have stood well in their profession both in and out of the
               military service. The school was discontinued in 1933 by order of Surgeon-General <name type="pname">Robert U. Patterson</name>, because there
               was no need for the Army to train nurses when more than the number needed could be obtained from civil training schools. The school was not
               abolished, merely closed for the time being. It may be opened again should a need arise, which may well be the case during the present war.</p>

               <head>THE HOFF MEDAL</head>
               <p>(Army Medical School)</p>
               <p>The oldest of the medals, presented as awards for academic attainment to graduates of the several schools of the Medical Department of the
                  Army, is the Hoff Medal. It is still awarded, though during the present war such prizes are in abeyance as the regular classes are not being
                  graduated at the Army Medical School. The Hoff Medal is only five years younger than the Army Medical School itself and it is by far the
                  senior medal of the Medical Department.</p>
               <pb n="16"/>
               <p>The Hoff Medal was established by Major, later Colonel, <name type="pname">John Van Rensselaer Hoff</name>, Medical Corps, U. S. Army, in
                  memory of his late father, Surgeon and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel <name type="pname">Alexander Henry Hoff</name>, U. S. Army.</p>
               <p>On 28 October, 1897 Major <name type="pname">Hoff</name>, by letter to the Surgeon-General, Brigadier-General <name type="pname">George Miller
                     Sternberg</name>, offered to establish a gold medal, in honor of his father, to be awarded annually to the graduate of the Army Medical
                  School standing highest in his class.</p>
               <p>To endow the prize he offered to deposit in the Treasury of the <name type="place">United States</name>, if authorized by Congress, the sum of
                  one thousand dollars, to be known as the Hoff Memorial Fund, the interest on which would be applied to the cost of the Hoff Medal. In the
                  absence of such Congressional authority, which the law requires before the Government may accept private gifts, Major Hoff offered to supply
                  the medal for the coming session of the Army Medical School.</p>
               <p>On 5 November, 1897, the President of the Army Medical School, Colonel <name type="pname">Charles Henry Alden</name>, replied on behalf of the
                  Surgeon-General, and accepted Major <name type="pname">Hoff's</name> gift of the medal for the next session of the Army Medical School. He
                  stated that amid the press of government business it would be all but impossible to obtain an Act of Congress authorizing the acceptance of
                  the <name type="pname">Hoff</name> Memorial Fund, but suggested, as an alternative, that a trust fund be established with a trust company, to
                  provide for the <pb n="17"/> annual cost of the Hoff Medal. The Secretary of the Treasury approved of this arrangement, and authorized the
                  preparation of the dies at the <name type="place">United States Mint</name> at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania"
                     >Philadelphia</name>. The Surgeon-General offered the Director of the Mint suggestions for the design of the medal.</p>
               <p>The first award of the Hoff Medal was made to the class of 1898 at the Army Medical School. Between that time and 1900 attempts were made to
                  obtain Congressional authority for the acceptance of the Hoff Memorial Fund. Though the plan had the support of the Surgeon-General,
                  Congressional authority was not forthcoming.</p>
               <p>Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name> continued to donate the cost of the medal, approximately forty dollars, annually. On 24 May, 1905, he
                  announced that he had made provision in his will for a perpetual trust to provide for a Hoff Medal annually. He died in 1920 and in that year
                  Mrs. <name type="pname">Hoff</name> provided the medal.</p>
               <p>Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff's</name> will, dated 24 December, 1911, named as his executors the Metropolitan Trust Company of <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and <name type="pname">Russell M. Johnstone</name> of <name type="place"
                     >Albany</name>. It established the trust for the annual striking of the Hoff Medal in the following terms: <q>"Second. I give and bequeath
                     to the Metropolitan Trust Company of the City of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> the sum of
                     fifteen hundred dollars in trust nevertheless, to hold and to invest and from time to time to reinvest, to collect the income to be derived
                     from said fifteen hundred dollars and, after deducting the legal expenses of executing said trust, to pay the net income therefrom on the
                     31st day of December in each and every year to the Surgeon-General of the United States Army, for the purchase of a gold medal by him, of
                     that value, to be known as the <name type="pname">Alexander H. Hoff</name> Memorial Medal, in memory of my <pb n="18"/> father the late
                     Brevet Colonel <name type="pname">Alexander H. Hoff</name>, Medical Department, United States Army, which medal is to be awarded annually
                     to the student standing highest in the graduation class of the Army Medical School. Should the present Army Medical School be merged into a
                     public service medical school, said medal shall follow; but should said medal not be awarded for ten consecutive years, then and in that
                     case said trust is to cease and determine and I direct my said Trustee to pay over the principal constituting said trust fund, with all
                     income in its hands, to the Trustee of the Fund for Widows and Orphans of deceased clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the
                        <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States of America</name>. In the event of my establishing in my life-time a trust
                     fund for the purpose specified in this paragraph of my last will and testament, then this paragraph is to be void and said sum of fifteen
                     hundred (1500) dollars shall sink into and form a part of my residuary estate."</q>

                  the brevet of Lieutenant-Colonel, 13 March, <pb n="19"/> 1865 for "Faithful and meritorious service during the war." He was honorably mustered
                  out of the service on 1 March, 1866. His taste for military life had been established, so that on 14 May of the same year he was commissioned,
                  after examination, Assistant Surgeon, in the Regular Army, with the rank of Captain. He accompanied the first troops to <name type="place"

               <p>Colonel <name type="pname">John Van Rensselaer Hoff</name> was born in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</name> State, 7 April, 1848. He graduated in medicine at <name type="place">Albany</name> Medical College in 1871 and at <name
                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</name> in 1874. In the same year he was appointed Acting Assistant Surgeon and served at
                     <name type="place">Omaha Barracks, Nebraska</name>, until November the twelfth, when he accepted an appointment as an Assistant Surgeon in
                  the Medical Department of the Army. During the years from 1874‚Äì79, his service was on the Western Frontier and he served during this period at
                     <name type="place">Fort Sanders</name>, Wyoming Territory; Fort McPherson, <name type="place">Nebraska</name>; Fort Fetterman, Wyoming
                  Territory.</p>
               <p>In 1879 he was ordered to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> City, whence, after promotion to the grade
                  of Captain, he served at <name type="place">Fort Monroe, Virginia</name>. In 1882 he was ordered to the Department of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</name> and assigned as Post <pb n="20"/> Surgeon on <name type="place">Alcatraz Island</name>, then
                  an army post and now well known as the prison for desperate criminals. He served at <name type="place">Alcatraz</name> until 1884; then
                  relieving Surgeon <name type="pname">George Miller Sternberg</name> (later Surgeon-General) at <name type="place">Fort Mason</name> in the
                  same state. In 1886 he was on duty at <name type="place">Fort Leavenworth, Kansas</name>; and in 1887 was given leave to travel abroad, on his
                  return being assigned to <name type="place">Fort Reno</name>, Indian territory. After this he took station as Post Surgeon at <name
                     type="place">Fort Riley, Kansas</name>; during which period he spent considerable time with troops in campaign. In the autumn of 1890 he
                  took the field with the Seventh Cavalry and First Artillery at the Pine Ridge Agency, <name type="place">South Dakota</name>, and was on duty
                  with them from that time to and through the fight with the Big Foot Band at Wounded Knee Creek on December twenty-ninth and thirtieth and at
                  White Clay Creek on December thirtieth of the same year. During the Indian outbreak he conducted himself with marked gallantry in the
                  performance of his duties as Surgeon and was commended in official orders at the time. After the World War, when the Distinguished Service
                  Cross had been created, he was awarded one of these coveted decorations as a recognition of his bravery in the presence of the hostile
                  Indians. The citation states that "when the Indians made a sudden treacherous attack upon the troop, Captain <name type="pname">Hoff</name>,
                  with utter disregard for his personal safety, attended to the dressing of the wounds of fallen soldiers."</p>
               <p>He was promoted to the grade of Major in 1890 <pb n="21"/> and in 1892 while on duty at <name type="place">Fort Riley</name>, was, at the
                  special request of Governor <name type="pname">R. E. Pattison</name>, of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, detailed to accompany him on
                  a tour of inspection of the camp of the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> National Guard. In the same year he was relieved from duty at
                     <name type="place">Fort Riley</name> and ordered to report at <name type="place">Fort Columbus, New York</name>. While on duty in <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Harbor in 1893, he was appointed a representative of the Medical

                  and other places. In 1896 he was appointed a member of the Board of Officers to meet at <name type="place">Davis Island, New York</name>, for
                  the purpose of revising drill regulations for the Hospital Corps of the army. This was a task greatly to his liking. Thereafter, he once more
                  served in the West at <name type="place">Vancouver Barracks, Washington</name>.</p>
               <p>In 1898 Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name> left <name type="place">Vancouver Barracks</name> in compliance with the orders of the

                  Chickamauga Park.</p>
               <p>In 1900 he was relieved of duty as Chief Surgeon of the Department of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</name> and
                  ordered to report in person to the Surgeon-General of the Army who sent him to Peking, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_1814991"
                     >China</name>, where he was attached to the United States forces. In 1902 he was promoted to the grade of Lieutenant-Colonel and made a
                  member of the Board of Officers to consider the subject of modification of uniform equipment of officers and enlisted men of our Army. In <pb
                     n="22"/> November 1902, he was ordered to <name type="place">Fort Leavenworth, Kansas</name>. There he continued on duty until the

                  War. He served at <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> and in the field with the Russians, and in recognition of his assistance, was
                  awarded the Order of Saint Anne by the Tsar of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2017370">Russia</name>.</p>
               <p>In 1906, he was sent to Manila as Chief Surgeon of the Department of <name type="place">Luzon</name> and continued in the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_1694011">Philippine Islands</name> until the end of 1908. In 1909, he reported as Chief Surgeon of the Department of the

                  1912.</p>
               <p>He gave his best to the service of his choice and it was due to his able mind that many changes, and always changes for the better, were made
                  in respect to the organization of the Medical Corps, which he saw grow up and develop from its more simple predecessor, the Medical
                  Department. Colonel Hoff was for a time editor of <hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon</hi>, the monthly journal of The Association of
                  Military Surgeons of the <name type="place">United States</name>.</p>
               <p>Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name> has been honored since his decease by the service that he knew and loved. One of the new large general
                  hospitals which the army has established and which is now in operation at <name type="place">Santa Barbara, California</name>, is known as the
                     <name type="pname">Hoff</name> General Hospital. At the <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> Hospital in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, a large memorial fountain, partly the gift of Mrs. <name type="pname">Hoff</name>, has been
                  erected in his honor. At <pb n="23"/>
                  <name type="place">Carlisle Barracks</name> the academic building of the Medical Field Service School, perhaps the most important single
                  structure that the Medical Department uses in its training program, is named for him. Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name> is the sort of
                  officer that the Medical Department likes to hold up before its young men as an ideal towards which they must strive. He was ever faithful to
                  the trust placed in him and he never failed to uphold the honor of his corps and give concrete evidence of the true meaning of the expression
                  "an officer and a gentleman."</p>
               <p>On 22 June, 1875, Assistant Surgeon <name type="pname">Hoff</name> married <name type="pname">Lavinia Day</name>, daughter of
                  Brigadier-General <name type="pname">Hannibal Day</name>, U. S. Army. She survived Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name> for several

               </p>
               <p>The Hoff Medal is of gold measuring forty-three millimetres in diameter. The obverse bears the effigy of Surgeon and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel

               <p>The dies for the Hoff Medal are in the <name type="place">United States Mint, Philadelphia</name>, where the medals are struck annually as

                  <hi rend="italic">Eligibility for the Hoff Medal</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The terms of Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff's</name> gift were such that the Hoff Medal is "awarded annually to the student standing highest
                  in the graduating class of the Army Medical School." In some years no medal has been awarded, either because the faculty did not feel that any
                  student had merited it, or when there was no class graduating at the School. All this was as contemplated by Colonel <name type="pname"
                     >Hoff</name> when he endowed the medal.</p>
               <p>There was no change in the procedure until the World War. The class of 1917 entered the Army Medical School in the regular way. After that
                  class had been under instruction for some weeks, it was decided by the War Department that it would be necessary to put more than one class
                  per year through the school in order to supply the need for new medical officers. The National Defense Act had come into force and the Medical
                  Corps of the Army, instead of being increased in five increments as originally intended, was enlarged suddenly to its <pb n="25"/> full new
                  strength. President <name type="pname">Wilson</name> had exercised the powers given him by Congress and had ordered the expansion to take
                  effect immediately.</p>
               <p>Therefore the class then at the Army Medical School was continued under a greatly concentrated schedule of work. The hours of instruction were
                  increased and the time otherwise free reduced. The class managed to complete the full quota of hours of instruction and was graduated at the
                  end of February, 1917, instead of the end of May as had been usual. Immediately a second class of 1917 was entered at the Army Medical School
                  under an even more reduced schedule.</p>
               <p>When the first class of 1917 graduated the faculty of the Army Medical School realized that the available funds would not permit of the award
                  of two Hoff Medals in one year. Accordingly the medal was not awarded to the student standing highest in the first class of 1917, but was held
                  pending later events. As it worked out there were actually three classes graduated in 1917.</p>
               <p>Shortly before the graduation of the third of the classes of 1917, the Commandant of the Army Medical School, Brigadier-General <name
                     type="pname">William Hempel Arthur</name>, announced that the three classes of 1917 would be considered as "sections" of one class and the
                  Hoff Medal awarded accordingly. The same arrangement was made with respect to the Sternberg Medal, as we shall see. General <name type="pname"
                     >Arthur</name> stated that this unsatisfactory arrangement was unavoidable and was made solely because of there being insufficient funds to
                     <pb n="26"/> present a Hoff Medal to each class. In the years since this time there have frequently been more than one class graduated at
                  one of the schools of the Medical Department and there has never been any idea of considering them "sections" of one hypothetical class. The
                  three classes of 1917 had nothing in common except that they received their diplomas in the same calendar year. Each of these 1917 classes was
                  several times as large as the average class that had attended the Army Medical School in previous years, so that the competition for the
                  medals was the more severe. More than one class had been graduated at the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U. S.</name> Military
                  Academy in one year, but there was never any thought of considering them "sections" of the same class. It so happened that one of the
                  graduates of the first class of 1917 at the Army Medical School was a member of a board of officers to examine candidates for commission in
                  the Medical Corps. One of the physicians examined was sent to the Army Medical School in time to graduate in one of the later classes of 1917.
                  Two such officers could by no stretch of imagination have been considered classmates.</p>
               <p>However, there seemed no other solution at the time and but one Hoff Medal was awarded for the three classes of 1917 and but one for the two
                  classes of 1918. A few years later the widow of Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name>, who had personally defrayed the cost of the Hoff Medal
                  in the year of Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff's</name> death, offered to present a Hoff Medal to the officer who had stood first in the first
                  class of 1917, being the <pb n="27"/> last class that had received the full period of instruction comparable to the previous classes. The
                  first class of 1917, she said in her offer to General <name type="pname">Arthur</name>, the then Commandant, was the largest class that has
                  ever attended the Army Medical School. Therefore, with the approval of Surgeon-General <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597"
                     >Ireland</name>, the Hoff Medal for the first 1917 class was awarded by General <name type="pname">Arthur</name> at a ceremony at which
                  Mrs. <name type="pname">Hoff</name> was present. Thus the table below shows awards of the Hoff Medal for two classes of 1917. A similar
                  arrangement was made for the Sternberg Medals for 1917.</p>
               <p>The first recipient of the Hoff Medal was First Lieutenant <name type="pname">Brainard Spencer Higley</name>, Jr., Assistant Surgeon U. S.
                  Army. He died in 1900, before the second Hoff Medal was awarded. Indeed the second Hoff Medal was not awarded until the class graduating in
                  1902. Years afterwards the Army Medical Museum sought in vain to locate the Hoff Medal that had been awarded Lieutenant <name type="pname"
                     >Higley</name>. Finally in 1941 the winner of the second Hoff Medal, Colonel <name type="pname">James Matthew Phalen</name>, U. S. Army,
                  retired, now Editor of The Military Surgeon, presented his medal to the Army Medical School for its extensive collection of medals of medical
                  interest.</p>
               <p>The terms of Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff's</name> will, above quoted, provide for the continuance of the Hoff Medal as an award for
                  academic excellence at a public service medical school should one ever be created and replace the Army Medical Museum. Such a school was ever
                  advocated by Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name>, who envisaged a sort of <pb n="28"/> medical West Point which could prepare medical
                  officers not only for the Army, but for the Navy and Public Health Service as well. A medical academy of somewhat this scope exists in <name

               </p>
               <p>A second Hoff Medal was offered by the widow of Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name> in 1929, to be awarded in his honor at the Medical
                  Field Service School. The offer was declined as the result of the following recommendation of Colonel <name type="pname">Charles Ransom
                     Reynolds</name>, the <pb n="30"/> Commandant, on 22 June, 1929, to the Surgeon-General:</p>
               <q>"It is not believed that another medal should be accepted as an award to a member of the Basic Class in view of the fact that two awards are
                  now being given‚Äîone, the Skinner Medal to the member of the class who receives the highest general standing, and the First Division Prize to
                  the student considered best qualified for duty with the medical regiment. These awards cover practically the entire field of instruction given
                  to the Basic Class of the Medical Field Service School. It would therefore be difficult to determine the basis of awarding another medal. If
                  some minor subject were determined upon as the basis of award, it would not be in keeping with the spirit and purpose evidenced by Mrs. <name
                     type="pname">Hoff</name> and the chances are that the student qualifying for one prize would likely qualify for all of them.</q>
               <q>"Mrs. <name type="pname">Hoff's</name> desire to establish this award is greatly appreciated. Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff's</name> service
                  in the Medical Corps of the Army and his great interest in field service are a continuing inspiration to everyone at the Medical Field Service
                  School. We all wish that a Hoff Medal could be accepted as desired by Mrs. <name type="pname">Hoff</name>, but we believe that the naming of
                  the main academic building at the Medical Field Service School for Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name> is a very appropriate recognition of
                  the splendid services of Colonel <name type="pname">Hoff</name> in the line of work in which the Medical Field Service School is engaged.</q>

               <p>(Army Medical School)</p>
               <p>We have seen that the founder of the Army Medical School was Surgeon-General <name type="pname">George Miller Sternberg</name>. Nothing could
                  be more fitting than that a medal in his honor be awarded at that institution for excellence in bacteriology and related sciences. General
                     <name type="pname">Sternberg</name>, though no longer in office, was living at the time that the Sternberg Medal was <pb n="31"/> created.
                  It was the gift of a loyal friend of the Army Medical School, First Lieutenant <name type="pname">Richard Slee</name>, of the Medical Reserve
                  Corps, U. S. Army, who later attained the grade of Colonel, Officers Reserve Corps. At that time there was no other reserve in the Army and
                  all its officers were of the grade of First Lieutenant. General <name type="pname">Sternberg</name> attended the graduation exercises at the
                  Army Medical School and, at Dr. <name type="pname">Slee's</name> request, made the presentation of the first Sternberg Medal. (For Dr. <name

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">George Miller Sternberg</name> was born in <name type="place">Otsego</name> County, <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, 8 June, 1838. He received his medical education at the College of Physicians and
                  Surgeons, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> (now Columbia University), where he graduated in 1860. He
                  practiced medicine for a year at <name type="pname">Elizabeth, New Jersey</name>, and at the outbreak of the War Between the States was
                  commissioned Assistant Surgeon in the Regular Army. He was present at the battle of Bull Run where, refusing to leave the wounded, he was
                  captured. Declining to give his parole he promptly escaped. Throughout the remainder of the war his work was outstanding and he received
                  brevets of Captain and Major for "faithful and meritorious services."</p>
               <p>Thenceforth he served for many years in the West, often against hostile Indians. Before he was forty he received the brevet of
                  Lieutenant-Colonel for gallantry in the campaign against the Nez PercÔøΩs. <pb n="32"/> He also fought a still more deadly foe for, as Dr. <name
                     type="pname">George M. Kober</name> once said: "I do not know of a single medical officer who faced cholera and yellow fever epidemics as
                  often and courageously as he."</p>
               <p>His studies of disinfectants began while he was serving in the West, and resulted in his being awarded the Lomb Prize in 1885, being the
                  chairman of the American Public Health Association's committee on this subject. He was a pioneer in bacteriological work in America. In 1881
                  he discovered the pneumococcus, the microorganism that causes pneumonia. Some of his photomicrographs, made in 1881, are still unsurpassed,
                  despite more modern apparatus.</p>
               <p>His scientific studies of yellow fever proved that the existing theories as to its cause were erroneous, so that thus he laid the way for the
                  later work of <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name>. His books on bacteriology played an important part in the development of that science in
                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. He published in 1892 the first American textbook on the subject.</p>
               <p>He advanced through the grades and was made Surgeon-General of the Army in 1893 with the rank of Brigadier-General. He established the Army
                  Medical School within a few months of his appointment, showing that he had already made plans for that institution. He recognized young <name
                     type="pname">Walter Reed's</name> ability and sent him to <name type="pname">Johns Hopkins</name> for graduate work under Professor <name
                     type="pname">William Henry Welch</name>. When the famous Yellow Fever Commission was appointed in 1900, General <name type="pname"
                     >Sternberg</name> chose <pb n="33"/>
                  <name type="pname">Reed</name> as its head. The work of that commission is too well known to require description.</p>

                     >Washington</name> on 3 November, 1915 and was buried with military honors in the National Cemetery. One cannot better sum up his career

                  <hi rend="italic">General <name type="pname">Sternberg's</name> Remarks in Presenting the First Sternberg Medal</hi>
               </p>
               <q>"Lieutenant <name type="pname">George R. Callender</name>: It gives me great pleasure to present you the first Sternberg Medal, which is
                  awarded to you by the faculty of the Army Medical School for your proficiency in <pb n="34"/> bacteriology and serumtherapy. I highly
                  appreciate the privilege of presenting this medal, which has been provided and named by Dr. <name type="pname">Richard Slee</name>, who
                  studied bacteriology under my direction in the Hoagland Laboratory, <name type="place">Brooklyn, N. Y.</name> more than twenty-five years
                  ago.</q>
               <q>"My own bacteriological studies commenced at a time when, so far as I know, no one in this country had made any serious researches in this
                  field of investigation, and the majority of the profession regarded this class of microÔøΩrganisms as of no importance from a pathological point
                  of view. It is unnecessary to point out to you the successive steps in the development of our knowledge since that time, and the great value,
                  especially to preventive medicine, of the facts which have been brought to light by a host of earnest students in the bacteriological
                  laboratories in all parts of the civilized world.</q>
               <q>"It is a matter of gratification to me to know that here, in the Army Medical School, this branch of medical science is given special
                  attention, and that in future those who come here to prepare themselves for the varied and responsible duties of medical officers of the army
                  will have a special incentive to excel in bacteriology.</q>
               <q>"At the same time, I desire to impress upon you the fact that no expert knowledge in any one branch of medical science will justify a neglect
                  of that practical knowledge of medicine and surgery, and that preparation for active field-service which it is essential that every medical
                  officer should possess.</q>
               <q>"You cannot give too much attention to questions relating to the prevention of disease among those whose sanitary interests are committed to
                  your care. But, while the studies you have pursued at the Army Medical School are designed especially to prepare you for those responsible
                  duties, you must not forget that the interests of the sick and the wounded of our army are in your hands, and that these interests and your
                  reputations will depend upon your professional knowledge and skill.</q>
               <q>"It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that the Army Medical School, which I established twenty years ago, has served so useful a purpose
                  and is at present in such a satisfactory condition. Several of its earlier graduates now belong to the faculty of the school.</q>
               <q>"We can point with pride to the achievements of many of those who have received its diplomas, and we confidently anticipate that you, Dr.
                     <name type="pname">Callender</name>, and other members of your class will do some notable things in the interest of scientific medicine,
                  and for the reputation of the Medical Corps of the army.</q>
               <q>"I desire to express to Dr. <name type="pname">Richard Slee</name> my high appreciation of <pb n="35"/> the honor he has done me by giving
                  this medal in my name. It is now fifty-two years since I received my commission as a medical officer of the army, and when I consider the
                  great progress which has been made in medical science and in the facilities for acquiring a sound medical education since that date, I feel
                  that you are entering upon your career of active service with greatly superior advantages, and that we may justly look to you for superior
                  achievements. I congratulate you upon being the first graduate of the Army Medical School to receive the Sternberg Medal, which I now present
                  to you." (<hi rend="italic">American Journal of Clinical Medicine</hi>, August 1913).</q>
               <p>Dr. <name type="pname">Richard Slee</name> defrayed the cost of the Sternberg Medal annually from the date of its institution, 1913, until
                  1920, five years after General <name type="pname">Sternberg's</name> death. In that year, Dr. <name type="pname">Slee</name> relinquished the
                  right to present the Sternberg Medal to General <name type="pname">Sternberg's</name> widow, at her request, and created the Slee Medal, to be
                  described presently (see page 48).</p>

               <p>Mrs. <name type="pname">Sternberg</name> offered to endow the Sternberg Medal in perpetuity, in memory of her great husband. The

                  Dr. <name type="pname">Slee's</name> creation of the Slee Medal. Mrs. <name type="pname">Sternberg</name> accordingly deposited with the

                  Company, guaranteed dividend of 5 per cent annually, and yielding approximately eighty dollars per year. The Stock Certificate, bearing the
                  number 1561, is deposited with the Commandant of the Army Medical School, being in the name of the Surgeon-General. By 24 May, 1935 the

               <p>Mrs. <name type="pname">Sternberg</name> had new dies prepared at the <name type="place">United States Mint, Philadelphia</name>, where the

               <p>The Sternberg Medal is awarded to the student at the Army Medical School attaining the highest standing in preventive medicine. The winner is
                  selected by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Director of the Department of Preventive Medicine.</p>
               <p>The first Sternberg Medal was awarded First Lieutenant <name type="pname">George Russell Callender</name>, now Colonel and Director of the

                  Lieutenant <name type="pname">Virgil Heath Cornell</name>, now Lieutenant-Colonel, and sometime Curator of the Army Medical Museum. Both

                  loan in the collection of the Army Medical Museum. Thus that institution has the first copies of each type. The same arrangements, as above
                  described for the Hoff Medal, were made for the award of the Sternberg Medal in 1917 and 1918.</p>

               <p>The first type of Sternberg Medal is of gold, measuring forty millimetres in diameter. The obverse bears, within a plain linear circle, the
                  caduceus, badge of the Medical Corps of the United States <pb n="37"/> Army, upon a wreath of laurel leaves. The lower part of the wreath is

               </p>
               <p>The second type of Sternberg Medal is of gold suspended from a watered silk ribbon of three equal stripes, red-white-blue. The obverse bears
                  the profile of General <name type="pname">Sternberg</name>, facing left, with the words <hi rend="smallcaps">obsta principiis</hi> above and
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">

               </p>
               <p>The name of the recipient and the date of his class are engraved thereon. The suspension of the new Sternberg Medal from a ribbon is, perhaps,
                  unfortunate, for Army Regulations do not permit of its being worn on the uniform. The ribbon hangs from a concealed pin. The diameter of the
                  medal is thirty-nine millimetres.</p>

               <p>(Army Medical School and Medical Field Service School)</p>
               <p>The Skinner Medal was created by one of the fine old field soldiers of the Medical Department, a man who, said Surgeon-General <name
                     type="pname">Reynolds</name>, "appreciated the importance to young medical officers of training in medical field service at the beginning
                  of their careers." This officer was Major <name type="pname">John Oscar Skinner</name>.</p>
               <p>His offer was accepted by Surgeon-General <name type="pname">William Crawford Gorgas</name> on 29 March, 1917. This was after the graduation
                  of the first class of 1917 but in time for the later classes of that year. The same decision as to the award, based on the two later classes
                  of 1917 being "sections" of the same class, was made by the faculty of the Army Medical School (see above, p. 25).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Major Skinner, Founder of the Medal</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">John Oscar Skinner</name> was born in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</name>, 4 May, 1845. He
                  entered the military service as an Acting Assistant Surgeon (Contract Surgeon) in 1871, and served in that capacity until there was a vacancy
                  in the commissioned ranks of the Medical Department. He was commissioned Assistant Surgeon with the <pb n="41"/> rank of First Lieutenant, 10
                  March, 1874, and was promoted Major Surgeon, 9 March, 1892. On 20 October, 1893, the year of the opening of the Army Medical School, he was
                  retired for disability incident to the service.</p>
               <p>"He was," wrote his old friend, General <name type="pname">Jefferson Randolph Kean</name>, in an obituary, "a notable figure in the Old Army
                  of frontier days. He received a medical education of unusual completeness for that day, having graduated in medicine at the Universities of
                     <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</name>, and taken special courses at the

                  at the <name type="place">Sorbonne</name>. He retired for disability in 1893, but did not, as is too often the case with retired officers,
                  give up his interest in and his affiliations with his profession, his Corps, and the Association of Military Surgeons. For many years he was
                  Superintendent of the Columbia Hospital in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, until compelled by increasing
                  deafness to give up administrative work."</p>
               <p>He won his country's highest award for bravery before the enemy. This was in the Modoc War, a tragic episode now forgotten by many. His
                  citation for the Congressional Medal of Honor is: "At Lava Beds, Oregon, 17 January, 1873, he rescued a wounded soldier who lay under a close
                  and heavy fire during the assault on the Modoc stronghold after two soldiers had unsuccessfully attempted to make the rescue and both had been
                  wounded in so doing."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Eligibility for the Skinner Medal</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Skinner Medal has had more variations in form and in the requirements for eligibility than any other medal in our series. The original
                  offer specified that it should be awarded to the student standing highest in military hospital efficiency and administration. These words
                  occur on the obverse of the medal. The first Skinner Medals were of bronze and struck on Major Skinner's order by the <name type="pname"
                     >Bailey</name>, Banks and Biddle Company of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>.</p>
               <p>Major <name type="pname">Skinner</name> turned over to the Commandant of the Army Medical School the sum of $1,100 in First Liberty Loan
                  Converted 4 1/4 per cent Bonds, registered in the name of the Surgeon-General of the Army.</p>
               <p>Under these provisions the Skinner Medal was awarded from 1917 to 1920, inclusive, at the Army Medical School. In 1920 the War Department
                  created the Medical Field Service School at <name type="place">Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania</name>, as we have seen. The Surgeon-General,
                  Major-General <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, felt that the award of the Skinner Medal might now more
                  appropriately be made at the new school.</p>
               <p>On 6 November, 1920, Major <name type="pname">Skinner</name> not only agreed to the change, but authorized the Surgeon-General to "exercise
                  discretion in any manner relative to the award of the medal." The bonds endowing the Skinner Medal were therefore transferred to the
                  Commandant of the Medical Field Service School, 1 March, 1921. A new design was <pb n="43"/> prepared and the medal cast by the <name
                     type="pname">Bailey</name>, Banks, and Biddle Company, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania"
                  >Philadelphia</name>.</p>
               <p>The Skinner Medal at the Medical Field Service School has always been awarded to the student standing highest in the Basic Class, that is, the
                  class of young medical officers who acquire their training in field duties at the Medical Field Service School. Thus we see that the
                  significance of the Skinner Medal at the Army Medical School and its award at the Medical Field Service School are quite different.</p>
               <p>The Liberty Bonds endowing the Skinner Medal having been called for payment by the Treasury, the Surgeon-General on 20 June, 1935, directed
                  the reinvestment of the principal in <name type="place">United States</name> Treasury Bonds, 1955‚Äì1960, bearing 2 7/8 per cent. The new bonds
                  are deposited in the safety box of the Central Hospital Fund of the Army in the American Security and Trust Company, <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>.</p>
               <p>In 1932, the year of his death, Major <name type="pname">Skinner</name> had dies prepared for a new design of the Skinner Medal. They were
                  made at the <name type="place">United States Mint</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania"
                     >Philadelphia</name>. The medal was then struck in gold.</p>
               <p>In 1935, at the time of the unavoidable reinvestment of the endowment fund at a lower rate of interest, the cost of the Skinner Medal in gold
                  had risen to $61.50 each. The annual income was insufficient to permit the medal thenceforth to be struck in gold, so that a bronze medal,
                  struck from the same dies, was substituted.</p>
               <p>Thus the Skinner Medal has been awarded at two schools, the Army Medical School and the Medical <pb n="44"/> Field Service School. It has been
                  of three designs. The first was used at the Army Medical School 1917‚Äì1920, inclusive; the second at the Medical Field Service School; the
                  third at the Medical Field Service School since, and including, 1933. The Skinner Medal was of bronze from 1917 to 1932, inclusive; in gold
                  1933 to 1936, inclusive; and in bronze since, and including, 1937.</p>

               <head>THE SLEE MEDAL</head>
               <p>(Army Medical School)</p>
               <p>The Slee Medal is really a continuation of the Sternberg Medal (see pages 30‚Äì40). When, in 1920, the widow of General <name type="pname"
                     >Sternberg</name> expressed the desire of endowing a medal in honor of her great husband, Colonel <name type="pname">Slee</name> generously
                  offered to have the Sternberg Medal that he presented known thenceforth as the Slee Medal. The Slee Medal, therefore, is from the very same
                  dies as the first type of Sternberg Medal.</p>
               <p>The existence of two types of Sternberg Medals and likewise a medal bearing the name <name type="pname">Sternberg</name> but known as the Slee
                  Medal had been confusing to those interested in numismatics. The Slee Medal was awarded only three times, but, in effect, these three copies
                  should be added to the seven awards of the Sternberg Medal, First Type, since there have been ten awards of the strikes from the original
                  Sternberg Medal dies.</p>
               <p>Thus in the years 1921, 1922, and 1923, two medals inscribed "Sternberg Medal" were awarded at the Army Medical School, one being the Slee
                  Medal, from the old Sternberg Medal dies and the other from the new Sternberg Medal dies. After 1923 the annual award of the Slee Medal by
                  Colonel <name type="pname">Slee</name> was withdrawn. The dies therefor are still in his possession.</p>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Richard Slee</name> was born in <name type="place">Brooklyn</name> on 15 September, 1867 and received his medical education
                  at the Long <name type="place">Island</name> College Hospital, where he graduated in 1891. His scholarship won him the <name type="place"
                     >Dudley</name> Gold Medal and the <name type="place">Lewis</name> Anatomical Prize. He early came under the influence of the great
                  bacteriologist, General <name type="pname">Sternberg</name>, and from him learned much of what was still a new science. Later he became <name
                     type="pname">Sternberg's</name> assistant. It was as a result of General <name type="pname">Sternberg's</name> opinion regarding the method
                  of distributing smallpox vaccine dried on ivory points, the method employed at that time, that Dr. <name type="pname">Slee</name> established
                  a biological laboratory at <name type="place">Swiftwater, Pennsylvania</name>, to produce glycerinized vaccine. The United States Army was his
                  first customer. This virus was used during the <name type="place">Spanish-American</name> War and later for the prevention of smallpox in
                     <name type="place">Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii</name> and the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_1694008">Philippines</name>. These
                  laboratories have since been consolidated with the National Drug Company and are under the direction of Dr. <name type="pname">Slee's</name>
                  son, Captain <name type="pname">Arthur M. Slee</name>.</p>
               <p>In 1908 the United States Army created its first Reserve, the Medical Reserve Corps. Dr. <name type="pname">Slee</name> was among the first to
                  be commissioned in this new group. From this time forth he took a very active interest in military affairs. Dr. <name type="pname">Slee</name>
                  was always an active officer of the Medical Reserve Corps, which prior to the enactment of the National Defense Act, had but one grade, that
                  of First Lieutenant.</p>
               <pb n="50"/>
               <p>In 1913 he was Sanitary Officer, Third Division, at the <name type="place">Gettysburg Reunion</name>. In 1914‚Äì1915, he was on active duty at
                  the Medical Officers Training Camp at <name type="place">Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania</name>. In 1916 he was Sanitary Officer at this camp. He
                  completed the correspondence courses for regular medical officers, <name type="place">Fort Leavenworth, Kansas</name>, 1915‚Äì1916. He devised
                  the <name type="pname">Slee</name> venereal prophylactic packet that was widely used during the punitive expedition under General Pershing
                  into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>.</p>
               <p>In June, 1917, less than two months after the <name type="place">United States</name> entered the World War, Dr. <name type="pname"
                     >Slee</name> was ordered to active duty at <name type="place">Camp Crane, Allentown, Pennsylvania</name>, where the United States Army
                  Ambulance Service was under training. He remained at this post throughout the period of the war. He was promoted Major at the time he reported
                  for duty; Lieutenant-Colonel, 15 June, 1918; and Colonel, 12 April, 1919. When the first commanding officer of Camp Crane, Colonel <name

                  Service with the Royal Italian Army, Colonel Slee succeeded him in command of Camp Crane, 17 May, 1918. He continued on duty to the end of the
                  work of the camp and on 12 April, 1919, closed the camp. His son, Captain <name type="pname">Arthur M. Slee</name>, went to <name type="place"

               <head>THE DENTAL CORPS MEDAL</head>
               <p>(Army Dental School)</p>
               <p>In 1924 officers of the Dental Corps, U. S. Army, were invited to contribute to a fund to establish a medal for academic excellence at the
                  Army Dental School. Thus was created the Dental Corps Medal. The conditions of the award were laid down by the faculty of the Army Dental
                  School, with the approval of the Surgeon-General. It was decided that the medal would be awarded annually to the officer attaining the highest
                  general average at the Army Dental School. The fund was collected by the Director of the Army Dental School as custodian.</p>
               <p>It was announced that the award should be retroactive and thus include the graduates standing highest in the classes of 1922 and 1923. The
                  Army Dental School had been created in 1922 as one of the <pb n="52"/> Medical Department Professional Schools, at first in connection with
                  the Army Medical School and now at the Army Medical Center, <name type="place">Washington, D. C.</name>
               </p>
               <p>The dies for the medal were made by the <name type="pname">Bailey</name>, Banks and Biddle Company of <name type="place"

                  the Dental Corps Medal was ever established.</p>
               <p>In 1934 the award of the medal was discontinued and as its further presentation was not contemplated, the dies were deposited for safe-keeping
                  in the office of the Surgeon-General of the Army. A balance of about one hundred dollars remaining in the fund was used in part to defray the
                  cost of a portrait of the late Colonel <name type="pname">Robert Todd Oliver</name>, chief of the Dental Corps, which may be seen in the Army

               <p>(Medical Field Service School)</p>
               <p>The DeVries Medal was the gift of the late Colonel <name type="pname">Joseph Carlisle DeVries</name> (1874‚Äì1941), Medical Reserve, United
                  States Army, a graduate of the Medical Field Service School and an officer deeply interested in its welfare. The offer of the medal was made
                  by Colonel <name type="pname">DeVries</name> in a letter to the Commandant of the School, Colonel <name type="pname">Percy Moreau
                     Ashburn</name>, dated 14 November, 1922. Colonel <name type="pname">DeVries</name> said, in part:</p>
               <p>"To show my appreciation for what I obtained in way of military knowledge at the school, may I offer a medal to be awarded to the officer
                  attaining the highest mark in drill in the Department of Enlisted Training‚Äîthis man to be selected by Major <name type="pname">Bastion</name>
                  from each Basic Course for Reserve Officers?"</p>
               <p>Major <name type="pname">Bastion</name>, above mentioned, is <name type="pname">Joseph Edward Bastion</name>, now Colonel, Medical Corps, then
                  in charge of the Department of Training at the Medical Field Service School. Colonel <name type="pname">DeVries</name> a month later wrote
                  again to the Commandant giving his wishes concerning the medal:</p>
               <p>"Regarding my medal, it is to be limited to Reserve Officers, provided there are ten or more. Otherwise it is to include National Guard
                  officers. The latter would carry it off each time on account of the fact that they are in constant touch with things military at the armories,
                  while the Reserve officer is very apt to be and remain 'rusty,' unless he be given the advantage of training at our school and is willing <pb
                     n="55"/> to make the most of his opportunities and profit thereby ... " (Letter of 18 December, 1922).</p>
               <p>Carrying out the responsibility placed upon him by the donor, Major <name type="pname">Bastion</name> prepared the following rules respecting

               <p>Under these rules the DeVries Medal was awarded in the years 1923 and 1924. Before the time for the award of the 1925 medal, the then
                  commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel <name type="pname">Charles Ransom Reynolds</name>, (later Major-General and Surgeon-General of the Army), wrote
                  to Colonel <name type="pname">DeVries</name>, 23 September, 1925:</p>
               <p>"What would you think of changing the terms under which the DeVries Medal is to be awarded to <pb n="56"/> the present and future classes, so
                  that it would go to the officer who gets the highest general standing in the class? At the present time it is given to the officer who does
                  best in drill and command, therefore it goes to the one who is really the best drilled officer and who can drill troops best. The course for
                  National Guard and Reserve Officers has been changed. It is no longer a basic course, but is a field officers course in which the subjects of
                  drill and command are given for the sole purpose of demonstrating and illustrating the methods of training. There are other far broader
                  subjects falling under the Department of Training, such as mobilization and the preparation of mobilization plans, training problems, orders
                  and schedules. In other words, the subjects for which your medal was to be awarded have been minimized and now constitute only a small part of
                  the course. Colonel <name type="pname">McCamant</name> gives a medal to the officer who does best in Military Hygiene and Sanitation ...</p>
               <p>"I would suggest, therefore, that you consider a change in the terms under which your medal is to be awarded and to give it to the officer who
                  receives the highest general standing in the Field Officers Class."</p>
               <p>Colonel <name type="pname">DeVries</name> acquiesced in this and thereafter the DeVries Medal was awarded to the officer standing highest in
                  the class composed of field officers of the Reserve and National Guard.</p>

               <p>As a specialist in tuberculosis he had long service with the Veterans' Administration, retiring in April 1941. His interest in the Medical

               </p>
               <p>The DeVries Medal, manufactured by the firm of Dieges and Clust of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>,
                  measures 42 millimetres in its longest and 31 millimetres in its shortest dimensions. The medal is enamelled in colors and is, in effect, an
                  enlargement of the metal badge, representing the arms of the Medical Field Service School, worn as a part of the uniform of the personnel of
                  the school. The only difference is that the DeVries Medal bears the words <hi rend="smallcaps">De Vries Medal</hi> horizontally across the
                  middle of the medal. The arms of the Medical Field Service School, as depicted <pb n="59"/> on the DeVries Medal are: Sanguine, in chief: an
                  open book, a tent and a wheel; argent, in base the staff of ÔøΩsculapius and a naked sword point down, in saltire. Though the heraldry may not
                  be entirely above criticism, the shield represents the book of knowledge, the tent typifies field service and the wheel refers to
                  transportation. The staff of ÔøΩsculapius, the rod with a single serpent entwined, is the ancient badge of the medical art, while the sword
                  pertains to the military service. The reverse of the DeVries Medal is of plain gold. The first copy issued was engraved: <q>LEADERSHIP AND
                     PROFICIENCY IN DRILL DURING SHORT BASIC COURSE FOR RESERVE OFFICERS AT THE MEDICAL FIELD SERVICE SCHOOL</q>

               </p>
               <p>There is no place for the name of the recipient, the only space being that for the date. The medal is suspended from a ribbon of deep red,
                  almost maroon. It is possible that the engraving on the reverse of the medal, being done by hand in each case, may have varied somewhat in the
                  eight examples struck. The <pb n="60"/> later awards were for highest standing in the National Guard and Reserve Officers Course. The first
                  copy was not enameled.</p>

               <p>The Hoskins Medal was created in honor of Doctor <name type="pname">William Horace Hoskins</name>, a prominent veterinarian, who had greatly

                  Association and was approved verbally by the Surgeon-General of the Army in 1924.</p>
               <p>The cost of the Hoskins Medal was borne, 1924‚Äì1925, by voluntary contributions of veterinary officers of the Regular Army. At the annual meet-

                  the Army Veterinary School for award to each class of graduates.</p>
               <p>The medal was cast in gold by the <name type="pname">Bailey</name>, Banks and Biddle Company of <name type="place"

                  long as they were authorized. The medal was discontinued with the award for 1924. The molds have been deposited for safekeeping in the office
                  of the Surgeon-General, U. S. Army.</p>

                  The work of this committee had much to do with the creation of the Veterinary Corps of the Army. It was in recognition of this long service to
                  his profession and the Veterinary Corps that the Hoskins Medal was named in his honor.</p>

                  His obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association</hi>, September, 1921, contains the following
                  paragraph:</p>
               <p>"The latter years of Dr. <name type="pname">Hoskins's</name> life were spent principally as an educator, and he proved successful in this,
                  particularly in securing substantial endowments for his work. His kind sympathetic nature led him to note the sufferings among the poor of the
                  great metropolis where he resided and be became identified with community welfare in the poor sec- <pb n="63"/> tions of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</name>. Through the death of Dr. <name type="pname">Hoskins</name> the profession
                  suffers the loss of an outstanding practitioner, higher veterinary education an ardent advocate, the veterinary college an eminent instructor,
                  veterinary literature a valuable contributor, the Bureau of Animal Industry and the Army veterinary service a staunch supporter, the A. V. M.
                  A. a faithful energetic worker, the country a loyal patriotic citizen, and most of us in the profession have lost a dear unselfish personal
                  friend."</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Hoskins Medal is of gold, measuring 63 millimetres in diameter. The medal bears, on the obverse, the figure of the wise centaur, Cheiron,
                  known in Greek mythology as the teacher of warriors. The right hand holds a bandage and the left the cup of knowledge. Around the border are
                  the words: <hi rend="smallcaps">united . states . army . veterinary . school</hi>, and to the left the date, 1924. Upon the pedestal upon
                  which Cheiron stands are the initials of the artist, J.R.S. [<name type="pname">John R. Sinnock</name>]. The reverse bears a shield with these
                  words: <q>HOSKINS MEMORIAL MEDAL AWARDED TO</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="64"/>
               <p>Space for two lines is provided for engraving the name of the winner and the date, in full, not merely the year. In a wide border about the
                  shield there is an endless branch of laurel leaves.</p>
               <p>Major <name type="pname">Davis</name> of the Army Medical Museum has recently inspected the plaster matrix from which the Hoskins Medal has
                  been cast. He considers it in such poor condition that it is doubtful whether it can again serve its purpose.</p>

               <head>THE McCAMANT MEDAL</head>
               <p>(Medical Field Service School)</p>
               <p>The McCamant Medal, awarded at the Medical Field Service School, was the gift of Colonel <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson McCamant</name>
                  of <name type="place">El Paso, Texas</name>. The origin and purpose of the medal are best set forth in the letter from the Commandant of the
                  School to the Surgeon-General, asking authorization for the acceptance of the McCamant Medal, at first designed to be a watch fob or
                  charm.</p>
               <p>Under date of 22 September 1924, Lieutenant-Colonel <name type="pname">Charles Ransom Reynolds</name> wrote to the Surgeon-General as
                  follows:</p>
               <p>"Colonel <name type="pname">Thomas J. McCamant</name>, Med.-O.R.C., of <name type="place">El Paso, Texas</name>, now a student at the Medical
                  Field Service School desires to present a medal to be awarded this year and hereafter to the member of the six weeks' course who attains the
                  highest mark in Military Hygiene and Sanitation, competition to be opened to regular, national guard and reserve officers of every
                  section.</p>
               <p>"The medal is to be in the nature of a watch fob, suitably engraved.</p>
               <p>"Authority is requested to authorize Colonel <name type="pname">McCamant</name> to make this award."</p>
               <p>This request was approved by Major-General <name type="pname">Meritte Weber Ireland</name>, Surgeon-General of the Army, as indicated by the
                  following indorsement by his Executive Officer, Lieutenant-Colonel <name type="pname">Robert Urie Patterson</name>, 25 September, 1924. By a
                  coin- <pb n="66"/> cidence, both Colonel <name type="pname">Patterson</name> and Colonel <name type="pname">Reynolds</name> became
                  Major-Generals and Surgeon-Generals of the Army in turn.</p>
               <p>"1. Granting authority to accept the award of a medal in the nature of a watch fob, to be presented annually by Colonel <name type="pname"
                     >Thomas J. McCamant</name>, Med-O.R.C., of <name type="place">El Paso, Texas</name>, to the student attaining the highest mark in Military
                  Hygiene and Sanitation at the basic six weeks' course, <name type="place">Carlisle Barracks, Pa.</name>"</p>
               <p>The first McCamant Medal was from a stock design and was merely a watch fob, but thereafter, a special design having been completed, the medal
                  is comparable to the others of our series.</p>
               <p>The following letter of 12 October, 1926, from Dr. <name type="pname">McCamant</name> to the Commandant of the Medical Field Service School,
                  gives further information about the terms of the award of the McCamant Medal: <q>"My dear Colonel <name type="pname">Reynolds</name>:</q>
                  <q>"Your letter of the 6th was received, and I immediately wired you regarding the medal for best grade in military hygiene.</q>
                  <q>"Last year I had a thorough understanding with Major <name type="pname">Stayer</name> regarding this medal and it was definitely understood
                     that the medal was to be presented each year until I had notified the School that I desire to have it stopped.</q>
                  <q>"I also had a special die made for this medal by the <name type="pname">Conlyn Jewelry Store</name> and Mr. <name type="pname">C. B.
                        Gray</name> of said store understood that this medal was to be cast each year from this die. After the die had been made and paid for
                     the expense for the medal was very little and consisted of paying for the cast as well as the lettering required thereon.</q>
                  <q>"I trust that I made my telegram sufficiently plain and that you presented the certificate for the best grade in military hygiene and had
                     Mr. <name type="pname">Gray</name> to cast the medal and letter same.</q>
                  <q>"I wish you would see that this is attended to and that Mr. <name type="pname">Gray</name> mails the medal, after completing the same, to
                     the one authorized <pb n="67"/> to receive it, and henceforth if you will notify the Director of the Department of Military Hygiene
                     regarding this medal it can be made and lettered and delivered at the graduating exercises. ...</q>

               <p>The McCamant Medal continued to be given as the award for highest class standing in the Department of Military Sanitation, until 1930, when it

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson McCamant</name> was born at <name type="place">Glen Rose, Texas</name>, 27 November, 1874. He received the

                     >cum laude</hi>, 1902. He became chief of the staff of the City-County Health Hospital of <name type="place">El Paso</name>, 1929, and of
                  the Masonic Hospital, also of <name type="place">El Paso</name>, 1931. From 1916 to 1933 he was Health Officer of <name type="place">El Paso
                     County, Texas</name>, and under his direction the <name type="place">El Paso</name> City-County Health Unit won first place in the Rural
                  Health Conservation Contest, 1934, 1935, and 1936.</p>
               <p>He served as a private in the Hospital Corps, U. S. Army, during the Spanish-American War, being <pb n="68"/> assigned to the Second Division
                  Hospital, Seventh Army Corps, <name type="place">Jacksonville, Florida</name>, and <name type="place">Atlanta, Georgia</name>. At the outset
                  of the World War he organized the 111th Sanitary Train, Thirty-Sixth Division, at <name type="place">El Paso, Texas</name>, and was inducted
                  into the Army in July 1917. Thereafter he was commanding officer, 141st Field Hospital, in training at <name type="place">Camp Bowie,
                     Texas</name>, and overseas for nearly a year. During this period he was in action at the relief of Rheims, 6th to 28th October, 1918.</p>
               <p>He was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel, 1919, and returning to the <name type="place">United States</name> in that year, was discharged from the
                  military service at <name type="place">Camp Dix, New Jersey</name>. He continued active interest in the military service and was promoted
                  Colonel, Medical Reserve, August, 1924. He completed the course for National Guard and Reserve Officers at the Medical Field Service School,
                     <name type="place">Carlisle Barracks</name>, 1924, and having attained the highest general average, was awarded the DeVries Medal. (See
                  page 60.)</p>
               <p>It was during this course at the Medical Field Service School that he established the McCamant Medal for award to the officer standing highest
                  in Military Sanitation. Colonel <name type="pname">McCamant</name> states that he established the medal, "appreciating the efforts of Major

                  <hi rend="italic">Design of the McCamant Medal, First Type</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The McCamant Medal awarded in 1924 to Major <name type="pname">Richard Emmons Elvins</name> is of gold, and seemingly from a stock pattern
                  manufactured for general use. The design has no particular reference to military hygiene, the subject in which the medal was awarded, and the
                  words, "Military Hygiene" form no part of the design, but are engraved in a blank scroll at the bottom of the medal. The reverse of the medal
                  is plain and bears the inscription in engraved letters, somewhat crudely executed. The medal as first awarded was designed to be worn in
                  civilian clothing as a watch fob or charm.</p>
               <p>The medal is circular with wavy edges, and measures 30 millimetres in diameter, from the most distant points of the wavy margin. The design is
                  a burning torch of knowledge in front of an open book, while eight other books, closed, form the background, above which and below the top of
                  the torch are rays extending downward from the flame. Below this design, in an arc which occupies about three-fourths of the circumference of
                  the medal, is an elaborate scroll upon which are engraved the words, <hi rend="smallcaps">military hygiene</hi>.</p>
               <p>The reverse is plain, bearing only, in small letters, <hi rend="smallcaps">iok gold</hi>. The following words are engraved upon the first
                  McCamant Medal, the lines being not horizontal but inclined somewhat to the left: <pb n="70"/>
                  <q>MCCAMANT PRIZE EFFICIENCY IN MILITARY HYGIENE WON BY <name type="pname">R. E. ELVINS</name> MEDICAL FIELD SERVICE SCHOOL</q>

               </p>
               <p>The medal is suspended from a gold ring from which it can be hung from a watch chain or similar fastening. It is of bright finish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Design of the McCamant Medal, Second Type</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second type of McCamant Medal, or possibly one should say the only one for which there was an individual design, was manufactured by
                  Dieges and Clust of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> to the order of the Conlyn Jewelry Shop of <name
                     type="place">Carlisle, Pennsylvania</name>. This shop has changed hands and no record can be found of the dies.</p>
               <p>The medal is circular in shape, suspended from an unwatered blue ribbon. The obverse bears the caduceus, the emblem of the United States Army
                  Medical Department, from the lower part of which branches of oak leaves extend upward in the form of a wreath. To the left of the caduceus is
                  the word <hi rend="smallcaps">mccamant</hi> and to the right the word <hi rend="smallcaps">prize</hi>. Below, in an arc, are the words <hi
                     rend="smallcaps">for military hygiene</hi>. The whole is enclosed in a Greek key border.</p>
               <p>The reverse of the McCamant medal is plain, appropriately engraved by hand. While it is not <pb n="71"/> unlikely that the wording varied in
                  the several copies, the following is probably more or less typical: In an arc at the top, the name of the recipient, with the military rank in
                  a straight line below. In the lower half of the reverse these words: <q>HIGHEST STANDING IN MILITARY HYGIENE</q>
               </p>
               <p>To the right and left of these words there are scrolls.</p>
               <p>The second type of McCamant Medal was clearly a medal comparable to the others awarded at the Medical Department's schools, and not intended
                  for wear as a fob or watch charm.</p>
               <p>The McCamant Medal measures 32 millimetres in diameter.</p>

               <p>The Rea Medal was founded in 1925 by Mrs. <name type="pname">Henry Robinson Rea</name> (<name type="pname">Edith Oliver Rea</name>) of <name
                     type="place">Pittsburgh</name> for award at the Army School of Nursing, <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> Hospital, <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>. Its creation was one of the many acts of beneficence on the part of Mrs. <name type="pname"
                     >Rea</name> in connection with the training of nurses for the United States Army.</p>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Edith Oliver</name>, born in <name type="place">Pittsburgh</name>, 17 November, 1865, is the widow of <name type="pname"
                     >Henry Robinson Rea</name> (1863‚Äì1919), director of many important <name type="place">Pittsburgh</name> corporations and a dollar-a-year
                  man during the World War.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <name type="pname">Rea</name>, on account of poor health, did not take an active part in war work until after the <name type="place"
                     >United States</name> entered the World War. Since that time her activities on behalf of service men and women have been of enormous extent
                  and variety. She was a member of the Board of Incorporators of the American Red Cross, and served for twenty years as a very active member of
                  the Central Committee. She did active work in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> during the war as chairman of
                  the Comfort Section of the District of Columbia Chapter. Mrs. <name type="pname">Rea</name> and her mother defrayed the greater part of its
                  incidental expenses. In 1918 the American Red Cross built a convalescent house at the <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> General Hospital,
                  in which Mrs. <name type="pname">Rea</name>, who had been made Field Director, <pb n="73"/> furnished the ground floor as a gift to the
                  service men. Mrs. <name type="pname">Rea</name> was the first woman Field Director of the American Red Cross and the only one during the World
                  War.</p>
               <p>Some of the works and gifts of Mrs. <name type="pname">Rea</name> are these: The Memorial Chapel at <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name>
                  Hospital, in honor of all service men and women. She under-wrote the entire cost ($32,000) for the American Red Cross and in person turned
                  over the first spadeful of earth for the building, 1929. In 1919 she gave the hospital its large swimming pool. In the same year she gave
                  greenhouses to the hospital. She was largely instrumental in obtaining the gift by the American Red Cross of the fine recreation building at
                  the Army Medical Center, 1927. She gave sound equipment for the hospital's motion picture theatre, and greatly assisted in the provision of
                  athletic equipment for the men.</p>
               <p>Particularly interested in the work of U. S. Army nurses, she worked untiringly for the passage of the bill to give them military rank, which
                  they now enjoy. She offered a scholarship of $1500 to a graduate of the Army School of Nursing, for the advanced instruction of a graduate
                  selected for her education, training and personality. This scholarship was awarded, 1924, to Miss <name type="pname">Barbara M. Price</name>
                  of <name type="place">Rochester, New York</name>, who received a year's training in the Department of Nursing and Health, Teachers College,
                  Columbia University.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <name type="pname">Rea</name> lives at <name type="place">Sewickley, Pennsylvania</name>, where she has had her country home for many
                  years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Eligibility for the Rea Medal</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <name type="pname">Rea</name> established the medal which bears her name in 1925. It is accompanied by an honorarium of five hundred
                  dollars, being the only medal awarded at any school of the Army Medical Department which has this additional prize. The Rea Medal was
                  established to honor "that member of the graduating class of the Army School of Nursing whom the faculty consider has shown the greatest
                  aptitude for her work, not only for the lessons learned from books, but also for human understanding, unfailing cheerfulness, and optimism
                  found everywhere during time of stress, but which are much rarer now without the exaltation and excitement of war."</p>
               <p>The medal was struck by Tiffany and Company, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, from dies of their
                  manufacture. Possibly sketches by Miss <name type="pname">Elizabeth Will</name>, an Occupational Therapy Aide at the <name type="pname">Walter
                     Reed</name> Hospital, may have been used in part in the preparation of the design by Tiffany and Company.</p>
               <p>The Rea Medal is, of course, not at present awarded, since the Army School of Nursing is not now functioning. But neither the School nor the
                  Rea Medal is abolished. Should the exigencies of the military service make necessary the reopening of the Army School of Nursing, the Rea
                  Medal will again be awarded to the honor student in each class.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Rea Medal is of gold, measuring 38 millimetres in diameter, suspended from a deep red ribbon of <pb n="75"/> unwatered silk. The obverse
                  of the medal bears the kneeling figure of Hygeia, facing right, and holding in her hands the cup of knowledge. In an arc above are the words:
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">army . school . of . nursing .</hi> Below, on a tablet, two straight lines with the words: <q>

                  charged with a lamp, in allusion to the lamp of <name type="pname">Florence Nightingale</name>, which caused her to be called "The Lady of the
                  Lamp" by the British soldiers, at the time of her nightly visits to the beds of the wounded and sick in the Crimean War. The whole of the
                  reverse is surrounded by an endless branch of ivy. The ribbon of the medal is suspended from a gold bar bearing a branch of ivy in the center
                  of which is a small circle charged with the letter <hi rend="italic">R.</hi>

               <p>(Medical Field Service School)</p>
               <p>The McKinney medal was established by the gift of Colonel, then Major, <name type="pname">Garfield Lesley McKinney</name>, Medical Corps, U.
                  S. Army. His connection with the Medical Field Service School has been intimate. He has been the commander of the First Medical Regiment there
                  stationed and has directed the Medical Equipment Laboratory, wherein are developed apparatus and appliances for use by the Medical Department
                  in the field.</p>
               <p>Colonel <name type="pname">McKinney</name>, long interested in the training of the enlisted men of the Medical Department, offered to
                  establish a medal to be awarded annually to the non-commissioned officer standing first in the Non-Commissioned Officers' Course at the
                  Medical Field Service School.</p>
               <p>Colonel <name type="pname">McKinney's</name> letter to the Surgeon-General, forwarded with the approval of the Commandant of the Medical Field
                  Service School, made the offer on 8 October, 1926. Here is the letter in full:</p>

                  <p>"1. As the Non-Commissioned Officers' School appears now to have become one of the established annual courses given at the Medical Field
                     Service School, and having personally had the opportunity of closely observing 3 classes of non-commissioned officers go through this
                     school, it is my opinion that it will be appropriate and advisable to award, upon graduation, a suitable medal to that student who in
                     certain respects stands first in his class. Medals are now awarded in some of the other courses given at this school, and I believe that a
                     medal for the Non-commissioned Officers' School will act as an incentive to increased efforts to many in each class, as well as tending to
                     increase the dignity of the course and elevate its standards.</p>
                  <p>"2. If it meets with approval, I would like to institute a gold medal to be awarded to one student in each Non-commissioned Officers' Class
                     of the Medical Field Service School, beginning with the class now pursuing this course of instruction, I to bear all expenses incident to
                     the designing and casting of the first medal and thereafter the cost of the medal awarded in each subsequent annual class. The medal to be
                     of gold, as artistic and attractive in design and inscription as any now awarded to other classes at this school.</p>

                     >America's</name> participation in the Great War, Major <name type="pname">McKinney</name> had three important assignments: Sanitary
                  Inspector, <name type="place">Camp Grant, Illinois</name>; Surgeon of the Port of Embarkation at <name type="place">Charleston, South
                     Carolina</name>; and Surgeon of the large Cantonment Camp, Camp Pike, <name type="place">Arkansas</name>. In September 1919 he was sent
                  overseas for duty with the American Forces in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</name>. On the Rhine he was stationed at
                     <name type="place">Andernach, Mayen, Neuwied</name>, and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3358131">Coblenz</name>. He spent much of
                  his spare time during this period in <pb n="81"/> the study of <name type="place">German</name>, becoming fluent in his reading and speaking
                  knowledge of the language.</p>
               <p>Back in the <name type="place">United States</name> in 1922, Lieutenant-Colonel <name type="pname">McKinney</name> (he had been given that
                  temporary rank in 1918) was assigned as a student at the Command and General Staff School, <name type="place">Fort Leavenworth, Kansas</name>,
                  being one of the first medical officers to receive this special training. He was, after graduation, assigned as Director of the Department of
                  Training, Medical Field Service School, <name type="place">Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania</name>, at the same time being commanding officer
                  of the First Medical Regiment.</p>
               <p>At the time of its organization in 1925, he was given the added duties of Director of the <name type="place">Carlisle Barracks</name>
                  Non-Commissioned Officers' School. He continued on this work until 1928, in which year he attained the permanent grade of Lieutenant-Colonel.
                  His interest in the field training of the medical soldier resulted in his establishment of the McKinney Medal at this time.</p>
               <p>From July 1928 to July 1929 he was a member of the War Department General Staff, relinquishing this assignment to become the head of the
                  Planning and Training Division, Office of the Surgeon-General, War Department. He remained on this duty until the autumn of 1931 when he
                  entered the Army War College as a student, graduating in the following year and likewise completing the Field Officers' Course at the Chemical
                  Warfare School in the same year.</p>
               <p>From September 1932 to January 1933 he was Commandant of the Medical Field Service School. <pb n="82"/> He continued on duty at <name
                     type="place">Carlisle Barracks</name> until 1939 as Director, Medical Department Equipment Laboratory. From that year until 1940 he was
                  once more in the Surgeon-General's Office as Chief of the Planning and Organization Section, Planning and Training Division. On 5 February,
                  1940 he became Surgeon of Camp <name type="pname">Joseph T. Robinson</name>, <name type="place">Arkansas</name> (known as Camp Pike during the
                  World War), and is at present on this duty. He became a Colonel on 13 June, 1934.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The McKinney Medal was designed in accordance with the description submitted by Colonel <name type="pname">McKinney</name> at the time he
                  established the medal. It is of gold, 37 millimetres in diameter, suspended from a ribbon of watered silk of three equal stripes,
                  red-white-blue. The ribbon hangs from a concealed pin. The obverse bears in a circle a medical soldier bending over and ministering to a
                  wounded infantryman half reclining on the ground. The infantryman's rifle lies nearby. In an arc above are the words: <hi rend="smallcaps"
                     >medical . field . service . school .</hi>; and below: <hi rend="smallcaps">
                     <name type="place">u. s. a.</name>
                  </hi> On a rectangular tablet at bottom of circle the words: <hi rend="smallcaps">mckinney medal</hi>. The reverse bears a wreath of laurel
                  leaves upon which are four tablets. To the left the two tablets bear, respectively, the words: <hi rend="smallcaps">scholarship</hi> and <hi
                     rend="smallcaps">military bearing</hi>, while the two tablets at the right are, respectively, charged with the words: <hi rend="smallcaps"
                     >conduct</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">leadership</hi>, these being the four bases for the award of the medal. <pb n="83"/> Above in two
                  arcs are the words: <hi rend="smallcaps">non-commissioned officers' course</hi>. The space in the middle of the reverse is for the name and
                  rank of the winner of the medal. Like the other medals awarded at the schools of the Medical Department of the Army, this one may not be worn
                  on the uniform.</p>

            <p>The Association of Military Surgeons is the oldest of the several associations maintained by the various branches of the <name type="place"
                  >United States</name> Army, such as the Field Artillery Association, the Society of American Military Engineers, the Cavalry Association, the
               Infantry Association, the Quartermaster Association, etc. It was founded in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name> on 17
               September, 1891. It celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1941 (for its history, see <hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon</hi>, September, 1941,
               lxxxix, 242‚Äì594).</p>
            <p>By means of its annual meetings and its journal devoted to military medicine it has been able to render the <name type="place">United
                  States</name> a great and lasting service. Its membership is drawn from the Medical Department of the <name type="place">United States</name>
               Army, that of the <name type="place">United States</name> Navy, the National Guard, the Organized Reserves, the <name type="place">United
                  States</name> Public Health Service, the Veterans' Administration and the Indian Medical Service (Department of the Interior).</p>
            <p>The Association's periodical has been known, in turn as the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Association of Military Surgeons of the
                  National Guard, The Proceedings of the <pb n="88"/> Annual Meetings of the Association of Military Surgeons of the <name type="place">United

               serially from the first in 1891. The journal has been a monthly since 1907.</p>
            <p>The Association has offered four valuable medals, two accompanied by an honorarium. The <name type="pname">Enno Sander</name> Medal was awarded
               1900‚Äì1908, inclusive, and the Wellcome Medal since 1916, including that year. Another medal, the <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> Medal, though
               announced as a prize and the die made, was never awarded. The Founder's Medal, created in 1941, is awarded from time to time. These medals will

               <p>The Association gratefully accepted Major <name type="pname">Sander's</name> gift and decided that there be constituted a Standing Committee
                  on the <name type="pname">Enno Sander</name> Prize, charged with the duty of selecting a subject for the contest each year. There was also
                  created a Board of Award to judge the essays and determine the winner. The essays were required to be submitted under a nom de plume and the
                  envelope marked with such nom de plume and containing the name of the author, to be opened at the annual meeting and the winner announced by
                  the President of the Association.</p>
               <p>Major <name type="pname">Sander</name> further asked that the medal be withheld if, in the opinion of the judges, no essay were of sufficient
                  merit to warrant the prize. The essay adjudged second best was to be given Honorable Mention and the author made a life member in the
                  Association. Both the winning essay and that given Honorable Mention were published in <hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon</hi>, the
                  monthly journal of the Association.</p>
               <p>The first <name type="pname">Enno Sander</name> medal was awarded in 1900 and the essay published in the following year. Between that year and
                  1908 the medal was awarded seven times. In 1909 Major <name type="pname">Sander</name> withdrew his offer of the medal.</p>

                  During 1871‚Äì1874 he was professor of materia medica and botany, having reorganized the school after it had been closed for two years. In 1902
                  it conferred upon him the title of Professor Emeritus of Materia Medica and Botany, in recognition of his services to the study of pharmacy

               <p>The records of the Association of Military Surgeons are incomplete, due to the moves of its offices in the past. The only written information
                  available as to the <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> Medal is in the Minutes (manuscript) of the Executive Council of the Association. Under
                  date of 29 March, 1916, we read:</p>
               <p>"The Medical Reserve Corps of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> has established a prize known as the

                  of the plan to create the <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> Medal. After the dies had been made there was a delay, for some reason, in making
                  the first awards. It was planned to present the medal as a prize for the best essay on an approved topic, thus being similar to the earlier
                     <name type="pname">Enno Sander</name> Medal and the later Wellcome Medal. However, though at least one essay was submitted in 1916 or 1917,
                  the medal was never awarded.</p>

               <p>In <hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon</hi> for November 1916 (xxxix, no. 5, 491) there is a photograph of the <name type="pname"
                     >Gorgas</name> Medal. It exists in but one copy, as far as is known. This is the one presented to General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name>
                  himself. It is in the <name type="place">United States</name> National Museum in the collection of <name type="pname">Gorgasiana</name>
                  deposited there by the General's family. It is of eighteen karat gold, one and five-eighths inches in diameter. The obverse bears the effigy
                  of General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> facing to the left. In the margin are the words ASSOCIATION OF MEDICAL RESERVE CORPS, <name

               <p>The space at the end of the inscription is obviously for the date.</p>
               <p>There is a possibility of the revival of the <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> Medal, which, though an appropriate award, had such an
                  unfortunate beginning. It is understood that a group of interested persons may offer to endow the medal and to have it awarded by the

               <head>THE WELLCOME MEDAL</head>
               <p>The Wellcome Medal was established by the late Sir <name type="pname">Henry Wellcome</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london"
                     >London</name>, an American by birth, a distinguished pharmacist and manufacturer of pharmaceutical products. The medal was established
                  before Sir <name type="pname">Henry</name> received his knighthood and therefore bears the legend THE <name type="pname">HENRY S.
                     WELLCOME</name> MEDAL.</p>
               <p>Sir <name type="pname">Henry</name> thus wrote to the President of the Association of Military Surgeons of the <name type="place">United
                     States</name> in 1916:</p>
               <p>"Desiring, as I do, to further medico-military research, I hope I may in some way aid your Association in the development of the proposed
                  military and naval sanitary measures which are necessary to meet the needs of the new American Army and Navy. I venture to submit to the
                  Association of Military Surgeons of the <name type="place">United States</name> the following offer:</p>
               <p>"Personally I shall be very pleased to contribute each year a gold medal and $300 as first prize, and a <pb n="96"/> silver medal and $200 as
                  a second prize, to be awarded annually by the Association for the best and second best researches, discoveries, inventions, designs,
                  improvements, essays or any other acts or deeds which the Executive Council of the Association may consider desirable and helpful to the
                  objects of the Association and relating to any phase of medico-military affairs and disease control associated with the Army, Navy, Militia
                  and Public Health and Marine Hospital Service in times of peace and war, at home and abroad. These two awards to be made according to merit,
                  and the competition to be open to any member of, or person eligible for membership in, the Association of Military Surgeons of the <name
                     type="place">United States</name>."</p>
               <p>The Association thankfully accepted Mr. <name type="pname">Wellcome's</name> offer and the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Prize and Medal
                  were duly established. It will be observed that the terms of the prize contest are similar to those above described for the <name type="pname"
                     >Enno Sander</name> Prize and Medal, except that the honorarium is considerably larger for the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name>
                  Prize.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Silver Medal and accompanying Prize were not for the second best essays in the contest for which the
                     <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Gold Medal and Prize were offered. In only one year has the same subject been announced for the two
                  contests. The second best essay in each contest won the author Honorable Mention and a life membership in the Association. Thus the two <name
                     type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medals must be considered as distinct prizes.</p>
               <pb n="97"/>
               <p>For the years 1916 to 1926 inclusive both the Gold <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal and the Silver <name type="pname">Wellcome</name>
                  Medal were awarded under the above provisions. In 1927, with the approval of Sir <name type="pname">Henry</name>, the Association announced
                  the abolition of the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Silver Medal. Thenceforth the Gold medal only was awarded and the honorarium of $200
                  formerly accompanying the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Silver Medal was added to that attached to the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name>
                  Gold Medal, making the combined honorarium $500.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Silver Medal was awarded but six times. In five of the years between 1916 and 1926, when the <name
                     type="pname">Wellcome</name> Silver Medal was in existence, no award was made. The Association found that contestants had to devote as much
                  time and effort to the essays for the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Silver Medal as for the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Gold
                  Medal, so that in some years all essays were entered for the higher award. From a numismatic standpoint it is not impossible that the silver
                  medal may become of greater value than the gold, because the gold medal, having already been awarded twenty-four times (including 1941),
                  continues to be presented annually, while the silver medal is already obsolete.</p>
               <p>It should be mentioned that the endowment of the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal and Prize was but one of Sir <name type="pname"
                     >Henry's</name> generous gifts to military medicine. Shortly before he established this medal he offered a prize of ten thousand dollars
                  for the best design for a military ambulance.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Prize contest is conducted under <pb n="98"/> the same regulations as those for the <name type="pname"
                     >Enno Sander</name> Medal, which went out of existence seven years befor the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal was created. The
                  essays are submitted under a <hi rend="italic">nom de plume</hi> and the winner is not known until the envelope marked with such <hi
                     rend="italic">nom de plume</hi> is opened and the name found within. At first, five judges were appointed by the Executive Council to pass
                  on the essays submitted. Later it was arranged that the judges should be the five vicepresidents of the Association. The essays must,
                  therefore, be submitted in quintuplicate. All essays submitted become the property of the Association and the winning essay and the second
                  best (honorable mention) are published in <hi rend="italic">The Military Surgeon</hi>.</p>
               <p>In December 1941 the American representative of the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Foundation, which since Sir <name type="pname">Henry
                     Wellcome</name>'s death has carried out his wishes concerning the presentation of the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal, notified
                  the Association of the destruction of the dies for the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal. This unfortunate loss occurred during one of
                  the German air attacks on <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>. The Foundation therefore announced that no more <name
                     type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medals could be presented during the present war. They added, however, that as soon as peace is restored, new
                  dies will be prepared and medals presented not only to all future winners, but likewise to those, beginning with Lieutenant-Commander Behnke
                  in 1941, who have already won but not received the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal. The only remaining copy of the medal from the
                  original dies <pb n="99"/> is being kept as a model. When the new dies are made the matter of a possible alteration of the design may come up.
                  The original die bore the legend "The Henry S. <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal." Possibly a new one will bear the words "The Sir
                     <name type="pname">Henry Wellcome</name> Medal." The decision must wait.</p>
               <p>A certificate attesting the award of the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal is now being prepared by Sir <name type="pname"
                     >Henry's</name> representative in the <name type="place">United States</name>. It will be presented to all past and future winners of this

                     >Philadelphia</name> College of Pharmacy was <hi rend="italic">Suppositories</hi>, in which he announced a new and improved shape. The new
                  design received recognition in various textbooks of pharmacy. Since the shape of suppositories had come down through the centuries without
                  change, the designing of a new and improved shape was an early indication of his creative instinct.</p>
               <p>It may be said that his bent of mind towards originality played a very important part during later years in the development of his career.</p>
               <p>Following his graduation from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name> College of Pharmacy, Sir
                     <name type="pname">Henry</name> spent a few years in the retail drug business in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                     York City</name>. Later he took a position in the firm of <name type="pname">McKesson</name> and <name type="pname">Robbins</name>.</p>
               <p>He left <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> for <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london"
                     >London</name>, and in 1880 with the late <name type="pname">Silas M. Burroughs</name>, established the firm of <name type="pname"
                     >Burroughs</name>, Wellcome &amp; Co., manufacturers of fine chemicals and galenicals. In addition to the <name type="place"

               <p>Sir <name type="pname">Henry's</name> American interests were wide and varied. A life member of the American Pharmaceutical Association since
                  1875, he took an active interest in its scientific work. In 1934, when the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>
                  headquarters building was dedicated as the American Institute of Pharmacy, he was the Honorary President of the American Pharmaceutical
                  Association and was awarded the Remington Honor Medal for his scientific and other valuable contribu- <pb n="101"/> tions to pharmacy. He was
                  an Honorary Member of the Association of Military Surgeons of the <name type="place">United States</name> and was also a member of the
                  Archaeological Society of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> and the American Society of Tropical Medicine.</p>
               <p>As a result of the Sir <name type="pname">Henry's</name> experience and interest in tropical research, the Secretary of War, Hon. <name
                     type="pname">J. M. Dickinson</name>, appointed him to visit Panama and make a survey of sanitary conditions and methods. His unbiased
                  report of this survey helped to secure a free hand for General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> in continuing his monumental sanitary work in
                  the <name type="place">Isthmus</name>. Many years later Sir <name type="pname">Henry</name> became a director of the <name type="pname"
                     >Gorgas</name> Memorial Institute of Tropical and Preventive Medicine.</p>
               <p>On one of his expeditions to the <name type="place">Sudan</name>, Sir <name type="pname">Henry</name> discovered several prehistoric Ethiopian
                  Archaeological sites in the Upper Nile region. Excavation was conducted under his personal supervision, with a technical and administrative
                  staff of twenty-five Europeans and three thousand native workmen.</p>
               <p>Sir <name type="pname">Henry Wellcome</name>'s scientific achievements ranged from pioneering in the use of aerial photography in
                  archaeological surveys to the establishing of a number of research institutions. He received wide recognition for his work.</p>
               <p>During the first World War, Sir <name type="pname">Henry</name> placed his scientific institutions at the service of the British Government.
                  He instituted a commission to improve design and construction of army ambulances. For use in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt"
                     >Egypt</name> and Palestine during the war, he <pb n="102"/> constructed, equipped and supplied a chemical and bacteriological motor field
                  laboratory for the British Army Medical Service. It was at this period that he became a British subject by naturalization.</p>
               <p>In recognition of his Life's work and generous support of medical research he was knighted by <name type="pname">King George V</name> in 1932.
                  He received the LL.D. of the University of <name type="place">Edinburgh</name>, 1928; Sc.D. of Marquette University, 1936; the cross of <hi

                  have to their credit an immense number of important original researches, Sir <name type="pname">Henry</name> established the following

               <p>The <name type="pname">Wellcome</name> Medal measures forty-six millimetres in diameter. The obverse bears the profiles of <name type="pname"
                     >Machaon</name> and <name type="pname">Podaleirios</name>, the Greek military surgeons, whose achievements in the Trojan War are described

                  so that they in their turn became "divine professors of the healing art." <name type="pname">Homer</name> and the cyclic poets recounted how
                     <name type="pname">Machaon</name> and <name type="pname">Podaleirios</name> healed the wounded Greek heroes, and their striking description
                  inspired artists of the classical period to engrave the scenes upon gems, or carve them on <pb n="104"/> stone. <name type="pname"
                     >Machaon</name> was more strictly a surgeon and wears a helmet with long appendages, as depicted on the <name type="pname">Wellcome</name>

                     >Machaon</name>, the elder brother, is assigned chief place on the medal. Both, however, were true military medical officers, being

                  appropriate figures could adorn a medal given for contribution to military medicine. The name of each, in Greek, MAXAŒ©N and Œ†ŒîAŒõAEIPIOŒ£, is

               <p>The institution of the Founder's Medal of the Association of Military Surgeons of the <name type="place">United States</name> is thus
                  described by the Association's Secretary, Colonel <name type="pname">James Matthew Phalen</name>, in an editorial in <hi rend="italic">The
                     Military Surgeon</hi> for September, 1941, the Fiftieth Anniversary Number, lxxxix, 596:</p>
               <p>"The advent of the fiftieth year of the life of the society caused our President, Colonel <name type="pname">Harold Dunbar Corbusier</name>,
                  to favor the creation of a medal for award by the Association for conspicuous work in the field of Military Medicine. After much consideration
                  the Executive Council voted its approval <pb n="109"/> of a Founder's Medal which should memoralize General Senn, and which should be awarded
                  by vote of the Council to any member, past or present, who has rendered conspicuous service to the cause of Military Medicine. A design was
                  worked up in the office of the Secretary, and the execution of the medal entrusted to Bailey, Banks and Biddle of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>. Briefly, the medal, to be cast in bronze, will present the profile of
                  General Senn on one side and the seal of the Association on the other. The Medal will be completed and available for award at the <name
                     type="place">Louisville</name> meeting in October [1941]. An engrossed scroll will be awarded with the medal."</p>
               <p>There are two slight mistakes in this statement. The medal is struck and not cast. The design on the reverse is not the seal of the
                  Association but its coat of arms. The legend on the obverse is: THE FOUNDER'S MEDAL,while in the exergue there is a space for the name of the
                  recipient. The inscription on the reverse, in a circle about the arms, is: ASSOCIATION OF MILITARY SURGEONS OF <name type="place">United
                     States</name>.The arms depicted on the reverse are those adopted by the Association in 1909. In the four quarters there are the caduceus,
                  badge of the Medical Corps of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U. S.</name> Army; the oak leaf with acorn superimposed,

                  of the <name type="place">United States</name> flag; in the center of the shield, superimposed, is the badge of the Association. For a crest
                  there <pb n="110"/> is an eagle displayed, the cross of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2660646">Geneva</name> superimposed on its

               <p>The President of the American Medical Association, Dr. <name type="pname">John A. Witherspoon</name> (1864‚Äì1929) reported at the annual
                  meeting of 1913 that he had appointed a committee to consider the award of a special gold medal on behalf of the Association to Surgeon
                  General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name>. At the annual meeting of 1914 Dr. <name type="pname">Witherspoon</name> asked the chairman of this
                  committee for his report.</p>
               <p>The Chairman, Dr. <name type="pname">Charles Alfred Lee Reed</name> (1856‚Äì1928) of <name type="place">Cincinnati</name>, made the following
                  report:</p>
               <p>"Mr. President: It is my privilege and happiness to present to you an illustrious member of the medical profession to be the recipient of a
                  gold medal of appreciation now to be conferred by the American Medical Association. Citizen of the republic, graduate in arts and medicine,

                  whose genius made possible the construction of the Isthmian Canal."</p>
               <p>President <name type="pname">Witherspoon</name> thereupon addressed General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> in these words:</p>
               <p>"General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name>: One of the acts of my administration of which I am very proud, was the appointment of this special
                  committee for the purpose of showing to the world our appreciation of ability, our appreciation of greatness, our appreciation of that
                  wonderful genius which has made it possible, sir, for you not only to demonstrate to the world that it was possible to build the <name
                     type="place">Panama Canal</name>, but also to go further and show, as you have done, that 500,000 lives which have been lost in our country
                  by preventable diseases [which] can be and will be prevented finally with you at the head of the Army of our country. We hope you will always
                  be at the head of the sanitary protection of our people.</p>
               <p>"As retiring president of the American Medical Association, it gives me great pleasure to turn over and to present to you, General <name
                     type="pname">Gorgas</name>, a gold medal in commemoration of your wonderful ability and your wonderful work that has connected nations and
                  has taught the world that the American Medical Association contains a man who dared to do what was right for the salvation of mankind."</p>
               <p>Amid what the minutes record as "loud applause," General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> accepted the medal, saying:</p>
               <pb n="114"/>
               <p>"I thank you, Mr. President, and Fellows of the American Medical Association. I appreciate, of course, the great honor of this occasion, but I
                  would like to have you think that this honor is to be shared by three or four hundred young Americans who have labored in this sanitary work
                  on the Canal Zone, and I receive this medal in part as their chief and as their representative. Again, I thank you." <hi rend="italic"

               <p>It was a happy thought of the American Medical Association to have the presentation made by the distinguished Dr. <name type="pname"

                  obverse bears General <name type="pname">Gorgas</name>'s profile, facing right. He is in civilian dress and without hat. In the four shorter

               <p>The reverse consists of a cross of four equal arms, extending to the margins of the medal. In the angles there are clusters of olive leaves.
                  The cross itself is charged with the cup of knowledge at the top and the serpent staff of ÔøΩsculapius at the bottom, between which is the

                  <name type="pname">William Crawford Gorgas</name> was born at <name type="place">Toulminville, Alabama</name>, on 3 October, 1854. His father,
                     <name type="pname">Josiah Gorgas</name> (1818‚Äì1883), a native of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, was an officer of Ordnance, <name

                  the States and became Chief of Ordnance. Thereafter he became President of the University of the South at Sewanee, Tennessee, where the future
                  Surgeon General spent much of his boyhood. Unable to obtain an appointment to West Point, he decided on entering the military service as a
                  medical officer. He obtained his medical degree at the <name type="place">Bellevue</name> Hospital Medical College, <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, in 1879, and after a year's internship was commissioned Assistant Surgeon, <name
                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U. S.</name> Army, in 1880.</p>
               <p>The usual life of a young Army officer followed. He was stationed on the plains and at posts in <name type="place">Texas, Florida</name>, and
                  elsewhere. Following the occupation of <name type="place">Havana</name> by American troops in 1898 he was placed in charge of a yellow fever
                  camp at Siboney. Later in the same year he was appointed Chief Sanitary Officer of <name type="place">Havana</name>. In <name type="place"
                     >Cuba</name>, <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> and his associates had finally proved the mosquito transmission of yellow fever. <name
                     type="pname">Gorgas</name> put this to practical use, and not only freed <name type="place">Havana</name> of mosquitoes but of yellow fever
                  as well. His success brought him an international reputation.</p>
               <p>In 1900 Major <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> was sent to <name type="place">Panama</name> as a sanitary expert in the planning and
                  construction of the canal. The same French engineers who had <pb n="117"/> built the Suez Canal failed in <name type="place">Panama</name>,
                  not because of any defect in their engineering skill, but because their workmen died like flies from yellow fever and malaria. <name
                     type="pname">Gorgas</name> was there to prevent a recurrence of this. His magnificent success is too well known to require detailed
                  statement. That the canal was finally built was as much due to <name type="pname">Gorgas</name>'s supervision of the sanitation as to the work
                  of the Corps of Engineers, and is so recognized. From 1906 on <name type="pname">Gorgas</name> was, by President <name type="pname">Theodore

               <p>The proof that the mosquito transmits yellow fever is the basis on which one of the most important chapters of tropical sanitation rests.
                  Yellow Fever has been one of the great scourges of the tropics, affecting white races in particular. The French failed in their efforts to
                  construct the <name type="place">Panama Canal</name>, as stated above, and <name type="place">Panama</name> came to be known as "the white
                  man's grave." It was said that for every tie on the <name type="place">Panama</name> Railway a human life had been sacrificed. Chinese coolies
                  too had perished in great numbers in <name type="place">Panama</name>.</p>
               <p>The Scottish-Cuban physician, <name type="pname">Carlos</name> Finlay, had long thought that the disease was transmitted by a mosquito, but
                  had never been able to prove it. <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> and his colleagues did just that, and having done so, the authorities
                  knew how to attack the disease. By destroying the mosquito <hi rend="italic">AÔøΩdessgypti,</hi> then known as <hi rend="italic">Culex
                     fasciata</hi>, the dreaded "yellow jack" was subdued.</p>
               <p>Congress was long in giving official recognition to the men of the <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> Commission, for more than thirty
                  years elapsed before the special medal was authorized and struck. <name type="pname">Walter Reed</name> himself had died long before, but his
                  copy was sent to his widow.</p>

                  Hospital Medical College. He passed the prescribed examination and entered the Medical Department of the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6252001">U. S.</name> Army as an Assistant Surgeon, in June 1875. Thereafter, as with most young medical officers, he
                  spent long service in the West. In 1890, at his request, he was permitted to serve in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4347778"
                     >Baltimore</name> where he devoted all of his spare time to work at the <name type="pname">Johns Hopkins</name> Hospital. There, under
                  Professor <name type="pname">William Henry Welch</name>, he specialized in the new science of bacteriology. In 1893 he was promoted to the
                  grade of Surgeon (Major) and ordered to the newly created Army Medical School as Professor of Bacteriology and Secretary of the Faculty. About
                  the same time, Dr. <name type="pname">James Carroll</name>, then a Hospital Steward (a grade now known as Sergeant, Medical Department), was
                  made his assistant.</p>
               <p>In 1898 <name type="pname">Reed</name> was appointed chairman of a board to determine the cause of the outbreaks of typhoid fever in the camps
                  in the <name type="place">United States</name>. His associates were Dr. <name type="pname">Victor Clarence Vaughan</name> of the University of
                     <name type="place">Michigan</name> and Dr. <name type="pname">Edward Oram Shakespeare</name> of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>. They showed that the <pb n="120"/> disease was spread largely by contact
                  and not by water alone, as had been thought.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Reed's</name> practical interest in yellow fever began in 1897. When the disease appeared in <name type="place"
                     >Havana</name> in 1900, Surgeon-General <name type="pname">Sternberg</name> made him the head of a board of officers to study the cause.
                  The other members were Carroll, above mentioned, <name type="pname">Lazear</name> and <name type="pname">Agramonte</name>. Their carefully
                  planned work resulted in proving that the disease is transmitted by the mosquito, as suggested by Finlay, who however, had never been able to
                  prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Reed</name> returned to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> in 1901 and resumed his work at
                  the Army Medical School. In 1902 he was appointed Librarian of the Army Medical Library, the largest collection of medical books in the world.
                  He said that at last he had been given the duties that he had most desired ever since entering the Army. He was Librarian but one week, for he
                  perished on 22 November, 1902 from appendicitis, operation being too late to save him. Thus, in his fifty-first year, was lost one of <name

                     February 9, 1901. Six days later these <pb n="130"/> same mosquitoes caused the very severe case of Hanberry in which his life for several
                     days hung in the balance. He was discharged July 10, 1902, with character very good."</q>

                  to the President, Reverend <name type="pname">John B. Creeden, S. J.</name>, he said in part:</p>
               <p>"In commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of my graduation in medicine, I have created an endowment fund of sixteen thousand dollars to be
                  held in trust by my Alma Mater, the Georgetown University of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, D. C.</p>

                  medal is to be awarded by the Association of American Physicians upon the recommendation of its Council..."</p>
               <p>The gift also provided for a fund of ten thousand dollars, the income from which would be devoted to awards for lectures delivered at
                  Georgetown University.</p>
               <p>The medal thus established by Dr. <name type="pname">Kober</name> is struck in the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The following sketch was written by Brigadier-General <name type="pname">Jefferson Randolph Kean</name>, Editor of <hi rend="italic">The
                     Military Surgeon.</hi> It appeared in that journal for June 1931:</p>
               <p>"Dr. <name type="pname">Kober</name> was born at <name type="place">Alsfeld</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2921044"
                     >Germany</name>, March 28, 1850. His father, <name type="pname">Johann J. Kober</name>, was interested in the liberal movement of 1848, and
                  would have liked to join the exodus of fine men who came to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> to seek freedom and
                  to escape the harsh measures of repression which followed that abortive effort. <name type="pname">Johann Kober</name> was, however, retained
                  at home by the necessity of caring for his large family, which included ten children. He vowed, however, that none of his sons should serve in
                  the army of any German potentate, and so in due time his third son <name type="pname">George</name>, age 16, renounced his allegiance to the
                  Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt and set out for the American Land of Promise. He entered the Army in 1867 at <name type="place">Carlisle</name>
                  Barracks, became a Hospital <pb n="135"/>
                  <name type="pname">Steward</name> in 1870, and in 1871 was assigned to duty in a clerical position in the Surgeon-General's Office. He at once
                  made use of his opportunities to study medicine, and was given the degree of M.D. by Georgetown Medical College in 1873. In 1874 he was
                  appointed Acting Assistant Surgeon in the Army and sent to the west coast.</p>
               <p>"Dr. <name type="pname">Kober's</name> army service lasted (with one intermission of 13 months) until 1888, during which time he took part in
                  the Nez PercÔøΩs campaign. Establishing himself in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> he soon became connected
                  with Georgetown University Hospital, and has done perhaps more than any other man to build up the Medical School of that University, of which
                  he was for many years the Dean. When Dr. <name type="pname">William H. Welch</name> was, in 1927, awarded the Medal of the <name type="pname"
                     >Kober</name> Foundation for research in scientific medicine, he said in the course of his remarks in accepting it: ÔøΩI wish time and
                  occasion were suitable for me to say something of Dr. <name type="pname">Kober's</name> own important contributions and services to medicine,
                  surgery, hygiene and public health and charities, and indeed I cannot refrain from at least expressing here publicly what others as well as I
                  have urged upon him in private conversation‚Äîthe earnest wish that he should give the profession as well as the public the benefit of an
                  autobiographical narrative of a long and unusually varied, interesting, and useful life.'</p>
               <p>"Into these noble activities of Dr. <name type="pname">Kober's</name> we cannot go even to the extent of their enumeration. Happily, however,
                  he took to heart Dr. <name type="pname">Welch's</name>
                  <pb n="136"/> suggestion and when death overtook him in his eighty-second year he had nearly completed an autobiography of which the first
                  volume appeared last year, and the second will doubtless soon be completed by the <name type="pname">Kober</name> Foundation of Georgetown
                  University, which has been charged with its publication.</p>
               <p>"<name type="pname">Dr. Kober</name> never married, and found his happiness in the study of his profession, and in the practical application
                  in many ways of preventive medicine for the health and happiness of this city. He was one of the oldest members of our Association of Military
                  Surgeons, having been elected a Life Member thirty-four years ago. He died April 24 [1931] at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963"

               <p>The <name type="pname">Bailey K. Ashford</name> Award was established in 1940 by <name type="pname">Eli Lilly</name> and Company,
                  manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, and accepted by the American Society of Tropical Medicine, which was given the right to select the winners.
                  The terms of the offer and the basis for the award were set forth in <hi rend="italic">The American Journal of Tropical Medicine</hi> for May
                  1940, xx, 453‚Äì454.</p>
               <p>The award consists of an honorarium of one thousand dollars. <name type="pname">Eli Lilly</name> and Company has also caused a medal to be
                  struck to accompany this award. The award was approved at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine, 1940. It was
                  provided that the award would be made three times only, given in alternate years, beginning in 1941. An additional sum of $150, or as much
                  thereof as might be necessary, was made available to defray traveling expenses of the recipient of the award, to enable him to attend the
                  annual meeting and receive it in person.</p>

                  <name type="pname">Bailey Kelly Ashford</name>, son of <name type="pname">Dr. Francis Asbury Ashford</name>, a Confederate soldier, was born
                  in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, D. C. on 18 September, 1873. He received his medical education at the
                  Georgetown University, graduating in 1896. After a year's practical experience at the Children's Hospital of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>, he entered the Medical Corps of the Regular Army as a First Lieutenant Assistant Surgeon in
                  1897. He graduated at the Army Medical School in 1898. <pb n="141"/> He had entered the military service just in time to participate in the
                  Spanish-American War, in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</name>, where he was present at the battle of
                  Hormiguerros. It was his first visit to the tropics and his autobiography reflects the delight that he experienced at the country and the
                  opportunity to do research. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</name> was to be his home for the rest of his life,
                  excepting only when exigencies of the service called him elsewhere.</p>
               <p>He was promoted through the grades to the rank of Colonel, 1917, and was sent to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> as
                  Division Surgeon of the First Division. He was present at the Aisne-Marne and Meuse-Argonne Offensives. Later in the war he was put in charge
                  of the training of medical officers in the American Expeditionary Forces, establishing a special school at Langres.</p>
               <p>His fame rests chiefly on his discovery of hookworm disease in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</name> in the days
                  of the Spanish-American War. The Puerto Rican Anemia Commission, created in 1904 by the Government, was a result of his recommendations. His
                  campaign against this fatal malady was the first ever waged in the Western Hemisphere. He treated more than 300,000 patients. His other
                  important contribution to tropical medicine was his work on the cause of sprue, a serious tropical digestive disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Ashford</name> was frequently the representative of his country and of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4566966"
                     >Puerto Rico</name> at international congresses. In 1916 the Rockefeller Foundation sent him to <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</name> to study and treat tropical diseases. He founded the Puerto Rican School of Tropical <pb n="142"

                  University. Thereafter he held the chair of Tropical Medicine at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</name>.</p>

                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</name>, who bore him a son and two daughters. He died in <name type="place">San
                     Juan</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4566966">Puerto Rico</name>, 1 November, 1934. Though he was in poor health, he was able
                  to be present at the unveiling of a bronze bust erected in his honor in his beloved School of Tropical Medicine. In the last year of his life
                  he published the interesting autobiography, <hi rend="italic">A Soldier of Science</hi>, in which he modestly told of his life's work. His
                  brother, Colonel <name type="pname">Mahlon Ashford</name>, was also an officer of the Medical Corps of the Regular Army.</p>
               <p>He received many honors. From the <name type="place">United States</name> the Distinguished Service Medal for his success in training medical
                  officers in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> during the World War. Britain created him a Companion of the Most
                  Distinguished Order of <name type="pname">Saint Michael</name> and <name type="pname">Saint George</name>, while the King of <name

                  a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons and of the American College of Physicians. His scientific publications, chiefly in tropical

               <p>The <name type="pname">Bailey K. Ashford</name> Medal is of bronze measuring 71 millimetres in diameter. The obverse depicts a man clad in a
                  laboratory gown looking into a microscope near which are an assortment of test tubes, beakers, flasks, books and other laboratory accessories.
                  Near the margin are the words: <name type="pname">CHRISTIAN PETERSON</name> COMPANY.</p>
               <p>The reverse bears a seated nude male figure with right hand outstretched. In the margin there is the legend: THE <name type="pname">BAILEY K.

               <p>The <name type="pname">Bailey K. Ashford</name> award, including the medal, has been made only once. It was presented at the annual meeting of

                  It was given "in recognition of his work in the study of races of anopheles mosquitoes in the neotropical region and for his incrimination of
                     <hi rend="italic">Anopheles bellator</hi> as a vector of malaria."</p>
               <p>According to the terms of the gift by <name type="pname">Eli Lilly</name> and Company there are to be but two other awards of this valuable

               <head>OTHER MEDALS OF MEDICAL INTEREST</head>
               <p>It has been found difficult to know where to draw the line as to medals to be included in this monograph. Some of the most important medals
                  offered in this or other countries for medical research and other work have been won from time to time by officers of the <name type="place"
                     >United States</name> Army Medical Corps. For instance, Brigadier-General <name type="pname">Frederick Fuller Russell</name>, the Army
                  medical officer who is responsible for the use of typhoid fever prophylaxis in the army, has been awarded the Sedgwick Medal and the Marcellus
                  Hartley Medal. Surgeon-General <name type="pname">Sternberg</name> won several medals, including one from the American Medical Association.
                  Deputy Surgeon-General <name type="pname">John Shaw</name> Billings, the father of the Army Medical Library, largest collection of medical
                  books in the world, received several such awards. The French Association for the Advancement of Science awarded its medal to a <name
                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">U. S.</name> Army medical officer for direction of the campaign in Serbia against typhus fever.
                  And there have been not a few others. As recently as 21 <pb n="145"/> May, 1942, the <name type="pname">Walter</name> Burns Saunders Memorial
                  Medal was presented to the Army Nurse Corps. This medal, awarded biennially to an American nurse for outstanding attainments, was won in 1932
                  by <name type="pname">Annie Warburton Goodrich</name>, founder of the Army School of Nursing.</p>
               <p>It is a matter of regret that limitations of space do not permit the inclusion of some of these medals, but the author has had to confine
                  himself to medals honoring medical officers, rather than those won by individual medical officers. There is no way of assuring completeness
                  were an attempt made to include this last group.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION</head>
               <p>The award of medals is a time-honored mode of recognizing merit. The series above described gives a fairly comprehensive picture of the
                  medico-military educational system at present in effect in the Medical Department of the <name type="place">United States</name> Army. That
                  these medals are comparatively unknown to collectors is remarkable considering the high value placed on them by the military service.
                  Similarly the medals awarded in honor of Army medical officers are of great importance. In all we have here a series of twenty-four medals,
                  struck in gold, silver and bronze, many being of the highest artistic worth. Perhaps these pages will serve to bring home to collectors the
                  scientific accomplishments of Army medical officers, and to such officers the historical background of the medals already known to them. <pb
                     n="146"/> The writer of these lines, in their preparation, has been struck by how few of the recipients of these medals are familiar with
                  their history or with the lives of the men that they honor.</p>
