            <p>The first colonial mint of the <placeName>United States</placeName> was opened on the fifteenth of July, 1920, at <placeName corresp="#geonames_1701668">Manila</placeName>, thus instituting a new departure in our mint procedure. Some years previously this policy had
                    been adopted by <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, whose colonial mints had been established in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2077456">Australia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and <placeName>Canada</placeName>. Since 1903 the <placeName>United States</placeName> Government had minted the coinage for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1694011">Philippine Islands</placeName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>. Expediency, economy, the possibility
                    of. quicker deliveries, together with the Government's policy of helping the Filipinos to participate in the management of domestic affairs,
                    were the determining features for the establishing of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1701668">Manila</placeName> mint. On <pb n="2"/>
                    February 8, 1918, the <placeName>Philippine</placeName> Legislature passed a bill appropriating 100,000 pesos, half the original
                    appropriation, for the construction of machinery for a new mint. This bill was signed by' Governor <persName>Harrison</persName> eight
                    days later.</p>
            <p>The machinery was designed and built at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> under the
                    supervision of <persName>Clifford Hewitt</persName>, then chief engineer of the <placeName>United States</placeName> mint. In June,
                    1919, it was assembled, tested and found satisfactory; it was then shipped to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1694011">Philippine
                        Islands</placeName> via the Panama Canal, arriving at <placeName corresp="#geonames_1701668">Manila</placeName> in November in perfect
                    condition. <persName>Mr. Hewitt</persName> reached <placeName corresp="#geonames_1701668">Manila</placeName> at the end of the month
                    and undertook the installation of the machinery.</p>
            <p>Although the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1701668">Manila</placeName> mint is probably the smallest in the world, it is one of the finest
                    and most modern. It is located on the lower floor of the old Intendencia Building fronting the Pasig River. This building also contains the
                    offices and the hall of the <placeName>Philippine</placeName> Senate, and the offices of the Treasury of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1694011">Philippine Islands</placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>On October 11th, three months after its inauguration, the mint narrowly .escaped destruction by fire which gutted the two upper floors of the
                    Intendencia Building. The Senate hall, the offices of the Insular Treasurer and other governmental offices were totally destroyed, but the
                    mint on the lower floor was so little damaged that minting was resumed next morning.</p>
            <p>The mint was formally opened on Thursday morning, July 15th. A copper ingot was taken from the furnace, cooled, rolled into a thin strip
                    between the heavy rollers of a machine, shot beneath the smoothly working pistons of another machine whence it emerged in the form of many
                    small discs and then placed, in the stamping, machine — and there came into existence the first piece of money ever coined under the
                    American government in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1694011">Philippine Islands</placeName>. The first one-centavo piece was coined
                    by Governor-General <persName>Harrison</persName> under the direction of <persName>Mr. Hewitt</persName>. Speaker <persName>Osme�a</persName> of the House of Representatives, in a like, manner, struck off the first medal (designed <pb n="4"/> by <persName>Mr. Clifford Hewitt</persName>) which was issued in commemoration of the opening. On the obverse of the medal appears the
                    profile of President <persName>Wilson</persName>; the reverse shows the figure of Liberty protecting and instructing beginners in the
                    art of coining, holding in her right hand a pair of scales to demonstrate the absolute necessity for care and exactness in operation which
                    all mint work demands. On the first day two thousand of these medals were minted.</p>
            <p>The official party at the formal opening included the Governor-General and <persName>Mrs. Harrison</persName>; Speaker <persName>Osme�a</persName>; <persName>Mr. Kwei Chih</persName>, Chinese Consul-General; Hon. <persName>Alberto
                        Barreto</persName>, Secretary of.Finance; <persName>Dr. A. P. Fitzimmons</persName>, Director of the Mint and former Treasurer of the
                        <placeName corresp="#geonames_1694011">Philippine Islands</placeName>, and <persName>Mr. Clifford Hewitt</persName>, the mint's
                    metallurgist.</p>
            <p>The mint is prepared to coin all bronze, nickel and silver money needed for circulation in the <placeName>Islands</placeName>; it has a
                    daily output of 85,000 pieces, and an annual capacity of 25,000,000 coins, made possible by twenty electrically driven machines.</p>

            <p>In order to insure the legal fineness of bullion received as deposits and of ingots for coinage purposes, as well as to make accurate payment
                    to depositors of metal, a well equipped assay department has been instituted. Such an establishment will have a stimulating effect on the
                    mining of gold and silver throughout the <placeName>Islands</placeName>. Gold is mined in considerable quantities in <placeName corresp="#geonames_1728929">Baguio</placeName>, Paracale and <placeName corresp="#geonames_1730144">Aroroy</placeName>, and silver in the
                        <placeName corresp="#geonames_1700903">Island of Marinduque</placeName>. As the gold mined here has heretofore been refined by the
                    cyanide process it was not of very high fineness, but with the improved electrolitic process it is possible to obtain the fineness of 999.9
                    plus.</p>
            <p>With regard to the melting department, the output of each melting furnace, figured on an eight-hour day basis, would be approximately 2000
                    pounds. A specially designed settling chamber has been built which reduces the silver melting losses to a minimum of three-quarters of an
                    ounce on every thousand ounces melted.</p>
            <p>The rolling and cutting department consists of two 50 h. p. electrically driven <pb n="6"/> machines of the most modern type, fitted with
                    hardened steel rolls. They are equipped with a patented adjustment whereby the rolls can be regulated to one ten-thousandth of an inch. By
                    this accurate adjustment there is no difficulty in producing perfectly uniform strips of silver so that when planchets are cut they will be
                    within the legal tolerance of weight.</p>
            <p>An automatic coin reviewing machine has been installed. The coins are dumped into a distributing hopper which drops them on a travelling belt
                    where each coin passes slowly before the reviewer's eye and the condemned pieces picked out. Those which are perfect pass on and fall into a
                    box at the end of the machine. They are counted by means of a coin counting board which holds five hundred pieces. An experienced operator
                    of this board can handle 2000 coins of any denomination per minute. As they are counted they are placed in bags.</p>
            <p>A complete mechanical department has also been installed, with fully equipped machine, blacksmith, electrical, plumbing and carpenter
                    shops.</p>

            <p>This department is very necessary for a successful operation of the mint, as all tools and special medal or coin dies may be made in these
                    shops at a minimum cost.</p>
            <p>The annealing and cleaning department consists of an automatic rotary annealing furnace. All the coin blanks are run through this furnace at
                    a temperature of 1400 degrees Fahrenheit, as continual rolling hardens metal and annealing restores the original softness to the coin blank.
                    In this process the coin blanks become oxidized or tarnished. This oxidization is removed by rumbling and burnishing them in water and
                    compound in a special rotary washing machine. The blanks are then placed in a centrifugal coin dryer which extracts all moisture.</p>
            <p>The weighing system consists of a large six-foot bullion balance with a capacity for weighing 10,000 ounces of coin, clippings or ingots. The
                    coins are weighed individually by an automatic weighing machine to determine which fall within the legal law of tolerance, which is less <pb n="8"/> than I 1/2 grains over or under the legal standard. These automatically controlled scales are enclosed in glass, designed to
                    weigh to 1/16 of a grain and are entirely mechanical in operation. There are 10 weighing beams in each scale, and, each beam will weigh 10
                    coins a minute — 100 coins on the 10 beams— approximating a daily output of .48,000 coins figured on an eight-hour day basis. This machine
                    separates the heavy and light pieces from those that fall within the tolerance allowed. All that is required of the operator is to keep the
                    ten feeding tubes filled with coins, as the machine does the weighing and separating into different boxes.</p>
            <p>The Director of the. Mint, <persName>Dr. A. P. Fitzimmons</persName>, former Insular Treasurer of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1694011">Philippine Islands</placeName>, was greatly instrumental in securing the appropriation for the mint and in
                    organizing it. Practically all of the employees are Filipinos; and having no previous mint experience, the present efficiency is attributed
                    to the painstaking instruction of <persName>Mr. Hewitt</persName> and to the mechanical aptitude of the Filipino people.</p>
