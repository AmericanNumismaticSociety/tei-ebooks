            <p>Just as medals are closely connected to their historical context, this volume and the conference which it records can best be situated in terms of related events and activities. For the American Numismatic Society, this is the fourth of its annual conferences devoted to an exploration of a specific aspect of American numismatics; the literal interpretation of Coinage of the Americas Conference was breached by the 1985 symposium on paper money. From a broader perspective this marks another step in the Society‚Äôs long-term involvement with the medal, an involvement which can be noted in the many references in the papers which follow to the 1910 International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals, the series of medals commissioned by the Society, its prestigious <persName>J. Sanford Saltus Award</persName>, and its unrivaled collection of American medals.</p>
            <p>In a national context, the Conference reflects a growing interest in the American medal by art historians, artists, and numismatists. The culmination of this has been the Twenty-First Congress and Exposition of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de la M√©daille, held in <placeName>Colorado</placeName> Springs, September 11-15, 1987. This is the first time that this international event, comprising lectures, workshops, and an exhibition of contemporary medals, has been held outside of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>. Our conference was timed to offer visiting scholars and artists an historical complement to the mainly contemporary focus of the FIDEM Congress. We are pleased and honored that many of the Congress participants were able to join us on this occasion.</p>
            <p>We are most grateful to <persName corresp="#viaf_64112980">Eric P. Newman</persName> (<persName>St. Louis</persName>), <persName>Lewis I. Sharp</persName> (The Metropolitan Musuem of Art), and <persName>Cory Gillilland</persName> (National Numismatic Collection, SI) for chairing the three sessions of the symposium.</p>
            <p>For the first time, this Coinage of the Americas Conference is accompanied by a documented, scholarly exhibition,"The Beaux-Arts Medal in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>." <persName>Barbara A. Baxter</persName>, a doctoral candidate at <placeName>Harvard University</placeName> and alumna of the ANS Summer Seminar, is guest curator for the exhibition, on display in the Society‚Äôs East Exhibit Hall from September 26, 1987 through April 16, 1988. Her well ‚Äî illustrated interpretive catalogue is a valuable complement to many of the papers published here, as the beautifully mounted exhibition was an inspirational context for the conference itself.</p>

            <p>There are several themes which run through the papers in this volume, the most striking of which is the importance of context to an understanding of the medal. Since its inception in the Renaissance by Pisanello, the medal has always had a rather clearly defined formal definition‚Äîit is a piece of relief sculpture, usually round, of suitable dimensions for holding in the hand. Its two faces are intended to relate to each other artistically and symbolically; the obverse usually presents a visual representation of the subject while the reverse bears a symbolic representation. There have been, of course, medals which have departed from this definition, but surprisingly few. Often such apparent departures have been brought about by curators and scholars who have, for the sake of variety or context, included such objects as plaques and coins in shows and studies of medals. Artists, on the other hand, have usually taken delight in the rigorous formality of the medium.</p>
            <p>Despite its very specific definition, the medal is all but totally defined by its milieu. Perhaps more than any other art form besides architecture, the medal is tightly linked to the social context from which it proceeds. The simple truth is that no one really knows what to do with a medal once it has been made. Indian chiefs may have worn them around their necks, but the rest of us have to decide whether to use them as paperweights, search for a display stand for them, or slide them into a drawer with other significant but nonfunctional mementos. But this seeming lack of function hasn‚Äôt kept institutions from sponsoring the production of medals, artists from designing them, or the public from treasuring them.</p>
            <p>In the papers collected here, we can see a change in who has initiated the production of medals and the reasons for their creation. In the colonial period, the medal was chiefly a vehicle for a European power, be it <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, or <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, to advertize its dominance among its American subjects. The medal figured above

all as a mark of initiation; it was at the time of coronation of a new ruler or the entry into alliance of Indian tribes that medals most frequently were distributed. The portrait of the ruler stood for the power of his armies, an identification that had been promulgated by Louis XIV a century earlier.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Libertas Americana</hi> medal was also consciously designed to mark a new beginning. Benjamin Franklin and his associates were actively searching for symbolism to represent a totally new nation. To avoid contemporary royal imagery, they borrowed symbols and quotations from the Roman Republican tradition as it was understood in their day, not without running into the problems connected with slavery that had plagued so many efforts of the new republic.</p>
            <p>In the nineteenth century, Indian Peace Medals and Presidential Inaugurations served as the impetus for many of the official medals, but increasingly other institutions and even individuals sought the prestige that came from an image propagated in gold, silver or bronze. In this context, the identification that exists between medals and coins is significant. Though the earliest Renaissance medals were created by artists and craftsmen with no connection to coinage, many medals of the early modern period were created by the same artists who designed coins and were even struck at the same mints. Moreover, the format of the medal closely parallels that of the coin, reinforcing the identification of the two media. In a medal, the president of an American corporation or society could receive the numismatic recognition offered to foreign rulers and, after 1909, to the most illustrious of past national presidents.</p>
            <p>The great international expositions of the turn of this century were a vital forum for introducing the public to art in general and especially to recent developments in other countries. The one work of art that the average fair-goer could bring home as a physical souvenir was a medal. No country was more identified with the early universal expositions than <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, and its art came to dominate American fairs as well; the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 is recognized as a critical point in the dissemination of French influence, under the rubric of Beaux-Arts style, into American art of all media. The French schools themselves served as the training ground for the most important of American medalists: the sculptors Saint-Gaudens, French, Flanagan and Brenner stand out in this regard. The name of Saint-Gaudens constantly recurs in discussion of later American Beaux-Arts medalists; through his teachings at the Art Students League and his training of many apprentices and assistants, he transmitted his approach to the medal to a whole

generation of medalists. American artists were quick to put their own mark on the medium, through the use of indigenous subjects, but also through a distinctive vigor and looseness of modeling and the adoption of specifically Renaissance formats.</p>
            <p>Among medalists who became active in the first years of this century, the medal also became a convenient medium for personal enterprise. <persName>Janet Scudder</persName> set up a studio in Paris to make small portrait plaquettes of visiting Americans; framed like paintings, these deluxe souvenirs of the Grand Tour were easily portable and could be distributed in multiple copies. Bela Pratt made extra copies of a commissioned portrait as a speculative venture. Theodore Spicer- Simson produced a whole series of medallions of famous authors as a commercial venture.</p>
            <p>The twentieth century saw the entrance of another party into the process of the creation of medals‚Äîthe collector. Already in the early years of the century, <persName>John Cotton Dana</persName> had sponsored the production of medals for the benefit of a museum and its constitutents. It was with such groups as the Circle of Friends of the Medallion and its successor, the Society of Medalists, that the collectors themselves took the lead in sponsoring medallic creation. But, as with so many aspects of the American medal, such enterprises had their origins in the early days of the medium, when Italian Renaissance princes and Nuremburg burghers sponsored the creation of medals to fill their collections.</p>
            <p>The American medal has moved in its own directions, adopting imagery and styles befitting its role as a colony, then republic, removed geographically from other homes of the medal. But apart from its specific geographical and political context, the medal in America has shared the social, economic, and artistic contexts of medals since the Renaissance and has made its own contributions to this shared tradition.</p>

            <p>American colonial records suggest that until the middle of the eighteenth century, peace treaties and land sale agreements between European colonists and American Indian groups were symbolized by the exchange of traditional Indian beaded belts (wampums), or animal skins.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> The awarding of medals to American Indians was therefore never a standard practice in Britain‚Äôs bid to retain possession of its American colonies or in her colonial rivalry with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. Greatly valued as official symbols of recognition by Indians, however, medals soon became inextricable from English dealings with Indians. Because of their ideological importance, the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> government also early adopted medal distribution as an aspect of its Indian policy. American scholars recognize the value of medals as important documents of U.S. history, yet far more research has been done on the presidential medal series than on its colonial antecedents. The standard treatments by Belden and Prucha systematically exclude these colonial medals.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This essay focuses on the numismatic problems of an early English medal series believed to have been awarded to American Indian Chiefs by <persName>King George I</persName>. The earliest reference to this medal appears in a book by <persName>Charles Miner</persName> titled <hi rend="italic">The History of Wyoming</hi> (a small town in Pennsylvania) in which he states:"Fortune was unexpectedly propitious to our search, for we found a medal bearing on one side the impress of <persName>King George</persName> the First, dated 1714 (the year he commenced his reign) on the other an Indian chief."<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The first in a series of colonial medals, this"peace medal" is not only the earliest of its kind that bears direct iconographic references (on the reverse) to the native American, it is also the most problematic. This series is probably the only bronze medal distributed before the <persName>Admiral Vernon</persName> medals of 1740, and unlike later medals we know nothing about its origins, the authority behind its issue, its authorship, date, and context of its distrbution. My paper uses archaeological, documentary and numismatic evidence to address these issues.</p>
            <p>The corpus of <persName>George I</persName> medals comprises pieces made from bronze or copper with an undetermined alloy. A catalogue of all known examples is appended. Some examples have traces of silvering on them.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> They average about 17 g in weight, 39 mm in diameter, and 1.5 to 2.2 mm in thickness. Some had loop attachments and, where a loop has broken off, a hole was made for a suspension ring. Extremely rare in American and Canadian collections, only 19 pieces were available for analysis during my research at the ANS in summer 1985. Most of these, plus the nine pieces that were in the <persName>Bowers</persName> and <persName>Merena</persName> 26-28 March 1987 sale

appear to have been recovered from burials, as they all show signs of corrosion and pitting on their surfaces.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>My study has identified three obverse and six reverse types. Obverse Type I has a laureate bust of <persName>George I</persName> portrayed in low relief (<ref target="#fig-3">fig. 1</ref>). The legend <persName>GEORGE KING</persName> OF GREAT <placeName>BRITAIN</placeName> is spread out with the G of <persName>GEORGE</persName> starting from beneath the right shoulder. This obverse is combined with two reverses, A and B, and they are exclusive to it. Reverse A shows a figure presumed to be that of an American Indian in frontal view and leaning on a bow in his left hand while holding an arrow with his right. On top of a hill to the far left is a tree and to the right of the tree, a deer. Although similar to A, reverse B depicts the Indian in profile and in motion. This type is the smallest in size of the whole group, measuring about 37 mm in diameter, and no more than 1.3 mm thick.</p>

            <p>Type II medals follow a similar design format as Type I, but they are larger, approximately 39 mm in diameter (<ref target="#fig-4">fig. 2</ref>). The bust of <persName>George I</persName> on the obverse is executed in much higher relief, the transitions in facial features are smoother, and the armor and hair more detailed. The legend is close together with the G of <persName>GEORGE</persName> and N of <placeName>BRITAIN</placeName> starting and ending at the tips of the monarch‚Äôs shoulders. Two reverses, C and D, appear on medals of this group. In both cases the Indian is shown in the act of shooting an arrow at the stag. Reverse C has 5 branches in the tree, and a high slope to the hill, while reverse D has six branches and a low slope.</p>

            <p>Type III closely resembles Type II on the obverse, but the bust is larger, and the relief higher (<ref target="#fig-5">fig. 3</ref>). The shoulders are broader and the floral motif on the chest appears to be the reversal of that which appears on Type II. Two distinct reverses, E and F, are associated with this type. Similar to C and D, E and F can be differentiated by the fact that there are only four branches on the tree, and that the gradient of the slopes is higher. The only apparent difference between E and F is that the second branch at 1 o‚Äôclock appears at the node between the first and third branches in E, and on the first branch in F.</p>
            <p>This analysis has identified two broad style groups. Type I represents a distinct group not only because of its crude obverse bust, but also because of its two reverses, A and B, which are iconographically different from those of Types II and III. A chronological sequence based on style is not possible, but this evidence suggests that the two sets of medals may be the work of two workshops or artists.</p>
            <p>The Type I medals are unsigned, but those of Types II and III are distinguished by the artist‚Äôs initials, T.C., on the truncation of the obverse bust.</p>

            <p>This leads to the question of attribution, which has aroused considerable speculation. None of the well known English medalists or engravers of the early eighteenth century bears the initials T.C., but the initials I.C., by contrast, are well known as those used by <persName>Johann Croker</persName>, whose medals and coins rank among the finest in English history.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> Many American numismatists have attributed the medals to <persName>Johann Croker</persName>, following Betts‚Äôs erroneous identification of the initials as I.C.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> Close examination under magnification, however, proves the initials to be T.C. American numismatists have obviously been frustrated by this apparent contradiction as the entry in the Sotheby (Toronto) 1968 sale catalogue illustrates:"<persName>George I</persName>, copper medal by <persName>John Crocker</persName>, laureate bust to right, in armour, signed TC on truncation, <persName>GEORGE KING</persName> OF <persName>GREAT BRITIAN</persName>"<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Johann Croker</persName> was the Chief Engraver of the English Royal Mint from 1705 to 1741. One of the most prominent medalists of the early eighteenth century, he executed almost all the medals of <persName corresp="#viaf_805714">Queen Anne</persName> and <persName>George I</persName>, and also remained influential in the Royal Mint through much of the reign of <persName>George II</persName>.</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>It would be, then, quite reasonable to speculate that the"official" medal of George I for Indian Chiefs would have been designed by him. And such attribution seems even more convincing considering intriguing stylistic connections that exist between the bronze medals that bear the initials TC and <persName>Croker‚Äôs</persName> bust for the <persName>George I</persName> coronation medal of 1714. Yet, this evidence raises more questions than answers: Are the obverses on the bronze medals copies from an original by <persName>Croker</persName>? If so, is TC a misspelling of <persName>Croker‚Äôs</persName> initials? The busts may have been copied from an original of <persName>Croker</persName>, but the initials TC are definitely not his. Published illustrations of <persName>Croker‚Äôs</persName> medals indicate that he was consistent in placing his IC beneath the bust, rather than on the truncation of the neck.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The authorship of Type I medals is equally speculative. Of the three types, only medals in Type I are distinguished by a six-pointed star or mullet located directly beneath the obverse bust. This seems to confirm the separate status of the Type I medals. A mullet is a common heraldic device and tells us nothing concrete about the medal. It thus poses some questions: Who owns the star, is it an artist‚Äôs personal symbol and if so, who is he? Is it a mint mark or simply a control mark to distinguish this issue from earlier or later issues?</p>
            <p>Two names in English numismatic sources may be our only clue to the identity of the artist; <persName>George Hautsch</persName> and <persName>George Vestner</persName> who both worked at the English Royal Mint in the early eighteenth century as engravers and medalists used the mullet as personal emblems.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref>
               <persName>Hautsch</persName> was the first to use the six-pointed star on his medals from the 1690s until his death in 1712, two years before the accession of <persName>George I</persName>. Attribution of the piece to Vestner is also doubtful on stylistic grounds, since both he and Hautsch are credited with much finer and more professionally executed medals than this mediocre design. And even when both used the star, neither pierced his star at the center as in these examples.</p>
            <p>The search for the origins of the medals seems as problematic as finding their author or authors. Records of English colonies in <placeName>North America‚ÄîNew York</placeName>, <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>‚Äîdo not mention any royal presents of an Indian Peace Medal during the reign of George I.The most comprehensive source on British medals <hi rend="italic">Medallic Illustrations,</hi> describes only a medalet, listed as a"Scottish Archery Ticket" from the same period with similar iconographic features, but that identification seems tentative.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> Neither Betts nor Whiting cite primary sources to support their claims that <persName>George I</persName> issued this medal series for American Indian Chiefs at his accession to the throne.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="7"/>
            <p>The paucity of written data compels us to turn to the numismatic evidence for further clues. The use of an English rather than a Latin legend, for instance, represents a significent departure from the accepted practice of the English <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName>. <persName>Graham Dyer</persName>, Librarian and Curator of Medals at the <persName>Royal Mint</persName>, notes that Croker also favored Latin inscriptions. He thus endorses my speculation that this feature may be"an indication that the medals are probably unofficial issues with no connection to the <persName>Royal Mint</persName>."<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>That these bronze medals were private issues seems convincing on close analysis of the pieces themselves. As the medals average 1. 5 mm in thickness, it would have been difficult to strike up such high relief busts using any simple minting devices available during the early 1720s. Even with the more advanced screw press, multiple blows may have had to be used since most of the medals (particularly Types II and III) reveal signs of modeling, unevenness, and in one case cracking, on their surfaces. It appears that the pieces were struck in a screw presss without benefit of a collar. Some letters of the legend have indentations (fish-tailing) beneath the lower serifs which is the sign of the outward flow of displaced metal as the flan comes under the pressure of the dies.</p>
            <p>Although significant, the fact that a screw press was used for the operation does not locate the manufacturing site of the pieces. Screw presses were widely used in Britain during the early eighteenth century. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, Bristol and Birmingham, they were used for the private manufacture of buttons, toys, and allegedly, for counterfeiting coins.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> By contrast, we have no definite record of a screw press in any of the American Colonies. Massachusetts apparently owned a mechanical device that was used for the minting of its own coins about 1652. However, by 1684 the operation of the Massachusetts mint had been halted by the Crown. A decade later, Massachusetts officials appealed for a lift of the royal ban, an indication that the device was probably still operational.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Comparison of these bronze medals with some contemporary American Colonial coins and medals, including the Pine Tree shilling of Massachusetts (1652-1684), the <placeName>Rosa Americana</placeName> two pence (1723), the <persName>Higley</persName> three pence (1737) and the <persName>Admiral Vernon</persName> medals (1739-41), however, reveals no stylistic connections. Official medals of the <persName>Royal Mint</persName> either before or during <persName>George I‚Äôs</persName> reign also exhibit no affinities. The letter punches used for the legends on these bronze medals are significantly different from the official British and American coins or medals. For example, not only do we find a characteristic E punch on Types II and III, but also the G punches of these types have peculiar humps on their horizontal
<pb n="8"/>
bars. The numismatic evidence thus suggests an origin other than an American colony for these two issues. If they originated in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, they were probably produced in a private mint.</p>
            <p>Private mint records are in general not readily available and the lack of published contemporary sources from Birmingham, for instance, makes a full reconstruction of this medal‚Äôs history difficult. However, a letter from <persName>James Logan</persName>, Secretary of the Province of Pennsylvania, to <persName>John Askew</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, dated 26 June 1726, may hold the key to unravelling the history of these bronze medals,"... I shall observe here that being out of medals it will be necessary to bespeak of Jos. Harmer of Birmingham 4 or 5 gross of the same I had of him at 36 sh. p. Gr. or perhaps <persName>Samuel Wilson</persName> in <persName>Crooked Lane</persName> will supply them at the same price but they must be of the best sort with an impression on both sides...."<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The size of the <persName>George I</persName> medal is almost equivalent to the English crown, a silver coin. Since the crown was worth five shillings, no more than four silver medals could have been obtained for each English pound. If <persName>Logan</persName> paid as little as 36 shillings for each gross (144 pieces), then his medals could only have been made of an inferior metal such as copper, which was far less expensive than silver, but more difficult to work.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> It can also be inferred from <persName>Logan‚Äôs</persName> letter that his medals may have been produced in more than one workshop, located in <placeName>Birmingham and London</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> This point is particularly significant given the marked stylistic differences that exist between medals of Type I and those of Types II and III. However, the consistencies in the iconography of their reverses suggest some historical link between the pieces, possibly the same patron for all the types.</p>
            <p>Questions regarding the authority behind the medals, when and why they were issued, can be answered by examining their specific historical context. Even though we do not have absolute dates for these medals, it is safe to assume that those that bear the effigy of <persName>George I</persName> were issued during his reign. Later issues are designated by the name <persName>George II</persName> in the legend. Thus the issue and distribution of the bronze medals seems to have begun sometime during the reign of George I and continued through much of that of <persName>George II</persName>.</p>
            <p>The archaeological finds have mostly come from western and central <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName>western New York</placeName>. Outside of this nucleus, the distribution of the medals is sporadic.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> This geographical area roughly coincides with the lands occupied by the Iroquois and Tuscarora Indians in the eighteenth century.</p>
            <p>The American historian <persName>Herbert Osgood</persName> observed that"the wars
<pb n="9"/>
of the seventeenth century were sporadic and mainly between European settlers and Indians. The wars of the eighteenth century in contrast were intercolonial, that is, between the British and the <placeName>French</placeName>. The Indians were only drawn into these wars because of alliances they had with the individual colonies."<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> The crucial role played by the Iroquois and Tuscarora Indians in this respect emerges in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> colonial records.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> By the end of the seventeenth century autonomous Iroquois groups‚ÄîSeneca, Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga and Maquase‚Äîhad formed a federation known as the"Five Nations." They were later joined by the Tuscarora bringing their number to six. For many years they were considered the most powerful Indian alliance in the eastern United States, and the"Six Nations" were most valuable military allies to European colonists in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Logan</persName> asserted that military alliances with these Indian nations provided the buffer and their"only security against the French in case of a rupture."<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> Perhaps of equal value was the ability of the Indian communities to mobilize large numbers of warriors on short notice to defend allied colonies. The geographical and political importance of the Six Nations would thus explain why the English colonies made consistent efforts to protect and reaffirm their old treaties with the tribal chiefs.</p>
            <p>From 1693 through 1735, however, the French made significant inroads into these alliances by offering presents to various Indian chiefs from the king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. Fears of <placeName>French</placeName> attempts to lure Indians of the Six Nations were echoed in a letter of 11 June 1715 from Capt. <persName>John Riggs</persName> to Capt. <placeName>Nicholson</placeName> which was later transmitted to Secretary <persName>William Popple</persName>."Last week an express came down from our frontiers, that the Govr. of Canada is very busy, tempting our 5 nations to come over to them, there being great presents sent them from the <placeName>King of France</placeName>..."<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> At least three silver medals dated to 1693, 1706 and 1710 were included in the presents to Indian chiefs.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> Many more were distributed on subsequent occasions.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Comparable presents were not forthcoming from the British despite persistent requests from the colonial authorities to the Home Government. The desperation of the colonists was quite evident in several letters sent from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> to the Lords of Trade in <placeName>Britain</placeName>. These letters repeatedly emphasized the need to counter growing French influence with royal presents to the Indians.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Governor <persName>Hunter</persName> wrote on 29 September 1715,"I must also intreat your lordships to intercede with his majesty that the Ordinary presents to the Indians upon the accession of the
<pb n="10"/>
several Princes to the throne may be speedily transmitted. They are wanted and will be of great service at this time...."<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Although the precise nature of the royal presents was never revealed, it is on record that both <persName>King Charles II</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_805714">Queen Anne</persName> distributed medals to some Indian chiefs at their accession. <persName>George I</persName> did not follow this precedent. Indeed, throughout the reign of <persName>George I</persName> and the greater part of his successor‚Äôs, no official English medals were awarded to Indians.</p>
            <p>At the conference between <placeName>Pensylvania</placeName> officials and representatives of the Six Nations at <placeName>Albany</placeName>, 7 September 1721, Governor <persName>William Keith</persName> offered one gold medal (probably an example of <persName>George I‚Äôs</persName> coronation medal) and other presents to Indian chiefs.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> It seems that between 1714 and 1752, belts and gorgets were used extensively as symbols of alliance with Britain rather than medals.<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> The only official British medal on record that was distributed to Indian chiefs was a silver medal of <persName>George II</persName> which was awarded by Governor <persName>Sir Denvers</persName> Osborne of New York to Iroquois chiefs who attended a conference at <placeName>Albany</placeName> in 1752.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> That the 36 year period between 1714 and 1750 represented a period of great intercolonial conflict would seem to be sufficient justification for a private medal. Thus it is not surprising that in 1757,1764, and 1766, the Quakers of Pennsylvania commissioned a series of private medals for distribution to Indian chiefs.</p>
            <p>The historical significance of the bronze medals under study, however, lies not so much in the interaction between the Iroquois and the European colonies as a whole, but rather in the precise role played by <persName>James Logan</persName>.</p>

               <persName>Mr. Logan</persName> was a well-known scholar and <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> statesman. He had come to the colony in the company of <persName>William Penn</persName> in 1699 at the age of 25. When Penn returned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in 1701, <persName>Logan</persName> became Chief of the Proprietary Representatives of the <placeName>Penns</placeName>. From 1701 on, he was agent for all land sales, a position held until 1732 when <persName>William Penn‚Äôs son Thomas</persName> arrived in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>. Even though <persName>Logan</persName> is said to have relinquished all his public offices, including that of Secretary of the Province, in 1714 at the accession of George I, he remained liason for Indian relations for at least two more decades and also served a term as mayor of Philadelphia in 1723.<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of all these diverse roles, <persName>Logan‚Äôs</persName> involvement in the fur trade of Pennsylvania offers the most insight into the meaning and significance of the medals.<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> After surviving a political filibuster in 1705, <persName>Logan</persName> returned from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>"armed with documents" to transact business for the proprietary on a scale hitherto unheard of.</p>
            <pb n="11"/>
            <p>But in 1708, management of the province of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> passed from <persName>William Penn</persName> to a trusteeship representing <persName>Penn‚Äôs</persName> creditors. <persName>Logan‚Äôs</persName> political influence took a downward turn. He left public office in 1714 for private business, specializing in the fur trade. In partnership with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> merchant <persName>John Askew</persName>, he bought a stock of goods to run a wholesale business suited for the Indian trade.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> By 1720 <persName>Logan</persName> owned one of the largest wholesale establishments on the east coast. He maintained two warehouses in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, on Fishbome‚Äôs Wharf and on Second Street, from which he supplied smaller traders with sundry foreign goods imported through Askew.<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> The most prominent and probably richest of the fur traders, <persName>Logan</persName> extended credit to both Indians and small traders. A description of a consignment of goods taken by one <persName>Henry Smith</persName>, a fur trader, that appeared in his journal, included medals intended for Indians.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref> How many of these medals were already in circulation by 1726, which Indians received them, and on what occasions, may never be known. But <persName>Logan</persName> states quite explicity that"the Indian Goods must goe only to the traders to receive skin"<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> and thus his motives for distributing the medals cannot be misinterperted. Further, since we have no official requests for medals in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> records, or from any of the other English Colonies between 1714 and 1750, it seems almost certain that the medals were acquired for Logan‚Äôs own personal benefit.</p>
            <p>In fact, the two motives were interwined. In addition to their military support role, the Six Nations were respected as important commercial partners. Because of the Indian Wars of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> and the <placeName>Carolinas</placeName>, which began in 1712 and lasted for nearly five years, <placeName>Pennsylvania merchants</placeName>, including <persName>Logan</persName>, made huge trade gains. With the wars over in 1717, competition increased as the fur trade in those southern regions was revived. <persName>Logan</persName> noted in a letter to <persName>Mrs. Hannah Penn</persName>"the tightening competition he was facing from Maryland and especially the price war that was being waged by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> traders, not to mention constant <placeName>French</placeName> obstructions of free trade."<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> In his letters to <persName>Askew, Logan</persName> emphasized that Indian trade goods must be of high quality. As he had stated in an earlier letter, the fur trade was his brainchild and only source of income, thus he would work toward maintaining his edge over other competitors. Economic necessity thus may have influenced the issue and distribution of <persName>Logan‚Äôs</persName> medals more than political expediency and, with more than 700 medals, he undoubtedly bought a lot of loyalty.<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref>

Engravers of the Royal Mint in the eighteenth century were allowed to lend their dies out for private use. Fears that the practice facilitated counterfeiting of currency were expressed by Sir Isaac Newton, Master of the Mint from 1699-1727, in a proposal designed to curb the right of mint engravers to work on private medals: Rupert A. Hall and Laura Tilling, eds., <hi rend="italic">The Correspondence of Isaac Newton</hi>, 2 (Cambridge, 1977), pp. 405, 413,422, 446. The identity of the artist with the initials T.C. is open to speculation. Several candidates may be listed: Thomas Callowhill mentioned in an Askew letter of 1704 in William Trent‚Äôs Correspondence (unpublished MS in Historical Society of Pennsylvania); or Thomas Carter, a notorious counterfeiter who is mentioned in one of Newton‚Äôs letters (Hall and Tilling, p. 405) are just two possibilities.</p>

               <p>Treaties between English colonies and Indian groups published by Benjamin Franklin contain detailed descriptions of presents given to Indians at such meetings. Colonial records indicate that until probably 1750, traditional Indian wampums (beaded belts) constituted the primary symbols that were exchanged at the signing of peace treaties and negotiations for land sales between Indians and English settlers. Animal skins, particularly those of the beaver and deer were also employed, see Frank Speck, <hi rend="italic">The Penn Wampum Belts,</hi> Leaflets of the American Indian Heye Foundation 4 (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, 1925).</p>

                  <persName>Logan</persName> probably benefited from his privileged position as Chief of the proprietary representatives of the <placeName>Penns</placeName> and from his personal relationship with <persName>William Penn</persName>. It is also noteworthy that for some time, part of the profits from the fur trade went to the proprietary representative in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>. A <placeName>Penns</placeName>ylvania statute of 1701 stated that"no persons are permitted to trade with those Indians but by license from <persName>Mr. Penn</persName>." Protests were lodged by various individuals with Colonel Quarey, principal agent for the <placeName>Penns</placeName>ylvania Company against this law, see <persName>Zimmerman</persName> (above, n. 31), pp. 2, 55, 67, 78.</p>

               <p>I am still working on the iconography of these medals. I have therefore decided to omit an in-depth discussion of it. It is, however, significant that the hunting scene is given an emblematic status. The imagery not only reflects <persName>Logan‚Äôs</persName> economic interests as a fur trader, but also may be an attempt to appeal to Indian sensibilities. According to <persName>J. C. H. King</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Tbunderbird and Lightning: Indian Life in Northeastern <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> 1600-1900</hi> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, 1982), pp. Iff., the deer had a central position in the Iroquois economy of the seventeenth and eighteenth century.</p>

            <p>Of the various Indian Peace Medals issued in North <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> under British rule, perhaps the rarest and most intriguing are the Happy While United (HWU) medals, dated 1764, 1766, and 1780, and undated. Without exception they are exceedingly rare. Most are housed in museums and are relatively unknown to today‚Äôs collectors.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Before considering the Happy While United medals, however, some discussion is needed of the Montreal medal, a related undated type issued in 1761, some three years before the earliest dated HWU medal. Like the Happy While United medals, the Montreal medals were commissioned by Sir <persName>William Johnson</persName>, produced by <persName>D.C. Fueter</persName>, and issued to North American Indians with allegiance to the British Crown.</p>

                  <persName>Robert W. McLachlan</persName>, in his article on <placeName>Canadian</placeName> Indians, described the Montreal medal as follows:"Obv. MONTREAL A view of fortified town, showing five church spires, with water in front of which there is an island; to the right on a fort is a flag displaying the cross of <persName>St. George</persName>; <hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> DCF in a small oval.

               </p>
               <p>The identity of DCF was unknown when the hallmark was first mentioned in the literature by Schoolcraft in 1851.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref>
                  <persName>C. Wyllys Bett</persName> in his 1894 work on colonial medals hypothesized that the DCF on the Montreal medal meant <persName>D.C. Fecit</persName> or <persName>D.C.</persName> made it.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
                  <persName>Dr. William Beauchamp</persName> did not say who DCF was in 1903,<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref> nor did <persName>McLachlan unravel</persName> the mystery in 1905.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Although partial attribution of both the Montreal and HWU medals was made by <persName>Frederick W. Hodge</persName> in 1907, DCF remained unidentified.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> However, in 1909, <persName>McLachlan</persName> reported the identity of DCF to be <persName>Daniel</persName> Christian Fueter, crediting <persName>John H. Buck</persName>, then curator of the Department of Metal Work in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> for the identification.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> This identification was followed by <persName>Chapman</persName>,<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref>

                  <persName>Daniel</persName> Christian Fueter was a Swiss silversmith who emigrated to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> by way of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> in 1754 and later settled in Bethlehem, PA, returning to Switzerland in 1769.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> He entered his mark at the guildhall in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> on 8 December 1753. After arriving in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, he ran a classified ad in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Gazette </hi>of 27 May 1754, which read:"<persName>Daniel Fueter</persName>, Gold and Silver-Smith.

               <p>
                  <persName>Fueter</persName> was an accomplished silversmith well known for the beautiful pitchers, vases and decorative items he produced. An exemplary specimen, a splendid silver basket wrought by <persName>Fueter</persName> in 1756, is illustrated in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Bulletin</persName> of the Museum of Fine Arts </hi>(<placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>), October 1954, pp. 87-88.</p>
               <p>While it was <persName>Fueter</persName> who designed and produced the Montreal medals, the man responsible for having them commissioned was <persName>Sir William Johnson</persName>. <persName>Johnson</persName> held a number of offices in the Colonial government which put him in a position of authority with respect to government relations with the Indian nations. In 1744 <persName>Sir William</persName> was appointed commissioner of the Six Nations by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>
                  <persName>Governor DeWitt Clinton</persName> and in 1746 he was made commissioner for Indian affairs. In February 1748 he became commander of all forces in defense of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> State frontiers. In 1755 General Brad- dock made him sole superintendent of the affairs of the Six United Nations, with the rank of Major General. As such, he was the leader of the expedition of the battle of <persName>Lake George</persName>, where he soundly defeated Baron Dieskau‚Äîa major turning point of the <placeName>French</placeName> and Indian War.<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref>
                  <persName>Sir William</persName> also played a major role in the battle of Montreal; where the defeat of the <placeName>French</placeName> was instrumental in bringing an end to the war.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>McLachlan</persName>, in his article on <placeName>Canadian</placeName> Indian medals, was the first to mention <persName>Sir Willian Johnson‚Äôs</persName> involvement with the Montreal medal. In that article, <persName>McLachlan</persName> quotes excerpts from a private diary kept by <persName>Johnson</persName> and correctly concludes that the medal was issued as a reward for those Indians who took part in the Montreal campaign.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> In <persName>Arthur Woodward‚Äôs</persName> 1933 article on the Montreal medal, he quotes liberally from the <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Sir William Johnson</persName> Papers</hi> giving further evidence that the medals were awarded to <placeName>England‚Äôs</placeName> Indian allies at Montreal and providing a wealth of information about how the Montreal medals came into existence.<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref>
               </p>
               <p>According to a letter quoted in <persName>Woodward‚Äôs</persName> article, <persName>Sir William</persName> was ordered by General <persName>Amherst</persName> in 1760 to enlist the cooperation of as many Indians as possible to join the British in defeating the <placeName>French</placeName> at Montreal.<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> As the fight progressed, some of the Indian ranks joined the <placeName>French</placeName> side, but a sufficient number remained loyal
<pb n="22"/>to the British to effect the fall of Montreal in September of 1760. According to <persName>Woodward</persName>,"Apparently the idea of a medal to be issued to the faithful Indian allies of the Montreal expedition, as a token of appreciation of their loyal conduct, was born on the field of battle, probably within the walls of the conquered city and was fathered no doubt by the sagacious <persName>Sir William</persName>, who knew such a gesture would tend to cement tighter the bonds of good will and friendship between the Indians and the British Crown.<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref>
                  <persName>Woodward</persName> concludes that <persName>Sir William</persName> made a list of the Indians who were to be honored with the medals (a list that <persName>Amherst</persName> refers to in a letter to <persName>Johnson</persName>, see below n. 21) and that <persName>Amherst</persName> took the list to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> with the intention of having the medals made immediately.<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In February of the next year, <persName>Amherst</persName> wrote to <persName>Sir William</persName> to report on the progress of the medals. This letter contains the first authentic, contemporary description of the medals. <persName>Amherst</persName> wrote,"As an Encouragement to Such as behaved well during the last Campaign, I have, as I mentioned to You, I would, Ordered a Number of Silver Medals to be struck, representing the City of Montreal with a blank Reverse, On Each of which is to be Engraven the Name of One of those Indians, who, by wearing the same as a badge of Distinction, will, by Virtue thereof have free Egress and Regress to any of <persName>His Majesty‚Äôs Forts</persName>, <persName>Posts</persName> &amp; <persName>Garrisons</persName>, so long as they Continue true to his Interests: they are not quite finished Yet, when they are, I shall send them to you, to make a Distribution of them."<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Fueter</persName> had been commissioned to do the work, which he completed in April 1761. The medals were not struck but were cast in an engraved mold. The cost of the Montreal medals is mentioned in a letter written to <persName>William Pitt</persName> by General <persName>Amherst</persName> on May <hi rend="italic">4, </hi>1761."I have sent one hundred and Eighty two medals to <persName>Sr Wm Johnson</persName>, to be delivered to as many Indians as accompanyed the Army to Montreal, it will please the Indians much, and I trust will have a good Effect, the Expense is not great, the whole amounting to <hi rend="italic">74/6/4</hi> Sterling."<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A total of 182 silver medals were produced and according to <persName>Amherst</persName>, one gold specimen was made especially for Johnson. On 17 April 1761, Amherst wrote to <persName>Johnson</persName>:"I send you by <persName>Capt. Minnett</persName> 182 Silver medals for that Number of Indians who were under your Command On Our Arrival in Montreal. Each medal has a Name inscribed on it, taken Exactly from the List which you gave me in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> according to the Enclosed Copy.‚Äî...I Enclose One of these medals In Gold, which I beg your Acceptance of; and that you will permit me to say, no one has so good a right to it as yourself; for

I am convinced those Indians that did Accompany the Army were Induced to it from the proper Care, and good Conduct you shewed towards them.‚Äî"<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref> This is the only mention in the literature of a gold medal for <persName>Sir William</persName>, and although noted by <persName>Woodward</persName>, it has not been acknowledged in the numismatic literature. Very possibly this unique specimen has been destroyed or is lying in some obscure place awaiting discovery.</p>
               <p>The Montreal medals are generally thought to be cast only in silver, but the engraved <placeName>Canadian</placeName> Archives specimen (<ref target="#fig-6">M1</ref>) is in pewter. Although Woodward was of the opinion that any pewter medal was probably a forgery, he apparently did not examine the actual medal. The present writers are of the opinion that it is genuine.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The Montreal medals and the Happy While United medals are closely related. As with the Montreal medal, it was <persName>Johnson</persName> who commissioned the HWU medals and Fueter who made them, but the two issues served somewhat different purposes. The Montreal medals were issued to those Indian chiefs who fought loyally with the British forces against the <placeName>French</placeName> at the battle of Montreal. The HWU medals, on the other hand, were used to attract as allies those Indians who still remained loyal to the <placeName>French</placeName> after the British had won the war and to reaffirm the loyalty of the Indians who had fought with the British during the war.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Woodward</persName> writes that in the spring of 1764, <persName>Johnson</persName> issued a general treaty invitation to those tribesmen who had been <placeName>French</placeName> allies in an effort to win their allegiance to the British. In July of the next year, a convocation of <placeName>French</placeName> Indians met with Johnson at Fort Niagara.<ref target="#CH2-n35">35</ref>
                  <persName>Johnson</persName> knew that the leaders would be wearing <placeName>French</placeName> medals and wrote to General <persName>Thomas Gage</persName> on June 1 to ask for English medals to have ready to replace the <placeName>French</placeName> ones.<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref> Gage found that there would be insufficient time to have a special medal made since the medals used for such official confirmations were usually ordered from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. As the need for the medals was pressing, Gage proposed to use the dies that had been recently prepared for medals for some unspecified southern tribesmen.<ref target="#CH2-n37">37</ref>
                  <persName>Woodward</persName> quotes a letter Gage wrote to <persName>Johnson</persName> on June 10,"I am afraid the Medals can‚Äôt be got ready by the Time you desire.I have been these two Months getting a Dye made for Medals to send to the Southward. I believe it‚Äôs now finished. The Reverse is not the King‚Äôs Arms but represents an Englishman and an Indian in Friendly Conversation. I suppose these would do for you as well as the old Pattern. I imagine when the Dye is once made that it can‚Äôt take much time to run the Medals. They are larger than yours [presumably the Montreal medal], &amp; I will see what can be done for you immediately."<ref target="#CH2-n38">38</ref> Although there is no evidence that any Happy While United medals were ever issued to southern tribes, this letter from Gage certainly allows that possibility. Furthermore, in 1875 a Happy While United medal was found in a grave in <persName>Tennessee</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-n39">39</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="27"/>
               <p>Of the delivery of the medals, <persName>Woodward writes</persName>, The medals were finished and sent to <persName>Johnson</persName> on the 26th of the month. Gage wrote at that time saying: <persName>‚ÄòMr. Watkins</persName>, a volunteer setting out from hence to join the army under the command of Col. Bradstreet. I profit of that occasion to send you the 60 medals I mentioned in my letter of the 24th Inst, to have had struck off agreeable to your desire. The Mould was made for the Medals for the Indians in Florida [we infer from the use of the word"Mould" that the pieces were cast from the die and not struck] &amp;c. &amp; tho‚Äô not quite as large again as that you sent to me I fancy it will answer well enough. I can not say much for the workmanship of them nevertheless they are finished by the best hand that could be found here‚Äô."<ref target="#CH2-n40">40</ref> In a subsequent letter to <persName>Johnson</persName> on July 15, <persName>Gage wrote</persName>,"<persName>Mr. Watkins an Ensign</persName> of the 30th carried the Medals from hence some Time ago, and should have nearly joined you by this Time."<ref target="#CH2-n41">41</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As best we can determine, the first reference in the literature to the Happy While United medals was by Schoolcraft in his history of Indian tribes in 1851,<ref target="#CH2-n42">42</ref> wherein he described a HWU medal housed at the Biblioth√®que Imp√©riale in Paris. <persName>Alexandre Vattemare</persName> cited the Schoolcraft reference in an 1861 publication<ref target="#CH2-n43">43</ref> which precipitated a note by <persName>William</persName> Sumner Appleton in his review of Vattemare.<ref target="#CH2-n44">44</ref> Betts, in his 1894 history of colonial medals, listed four HWU medals, all dated 1764 (Betts 509, 510, 511 and 513).<ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref>

               </head>
               <p>In general, the obverses of the HWU medals show a bust of the King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> surrounded by the inscription <persName>GEORGIUS III</persName> D.G.M. BRI. FRA. ET. HIB. REX. F.D. The reverses, allowing for individual differences, are as described by <persName>Betts</persName>, "HAPPY WHILE UNITED. In exergue, 1764. In the field N/YORK and DCF counterstamped. Landscape, representing in the foreground an officer and at the right an Indian, seated on a rustic chair on the bank of a river. On the right a house on a rocky point, at the junction of the river with ocean, and three ships, under full sail, at sea. The Indian holds in his left hand a pipe. With his right hand he grasps the hand of the officer who is seated on his left. At his right a tree, at the left a mountain range. Silver. Cast. Size 46, with loop for suspension, formed of a pipe and an eagle‚Äôs wing."<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The known HWU medals bear the dates 1764, 1766, 1780, or no date. The obverse legend is the same on all the medals while the portrait differs slightly from medal to medal. The reverses, believed to depict <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> harbor, exhibit a few slight differences.
<pb n="28"/>
Notably, the rarer large-size medals (72-75 mm) show three ships; the small-size medals show two. All are cast and chased in silver with a loop formed from the likeness of a pipe and eagle‚Äôs wing, except for one small-size specimen which is composed of two shells joined at the rim (<ref target="#fig-17">HWU 12</ref>). The problem of striking a medal, whether 55 or 75 mm, with the pipe and eagle wing suspension undoubtedly accounts for the lack of any fully die-struck medals of this series. Of all the medals we were able to examine photographically, three do not bear the N:/YORK and DCF hallmarks.</p>

John Murray</persName> and <persName>Major A.B. Murray</persName>), 559."2.2 inches" (55.9 mm). Regrettably only the obverse is plated and the cataloger did not indicate that it was undated. He created that impression, however, by reference to the illustration in Tancred which is undated.<ref target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> For clarification, we note that the wrong Betts number is listed. Thus any conclusions of precisely what this medal was, must at this time remain speculative.</p>
                  <p>
                     <persName>Betts</persName> 511 is an undated small-size medal classified as a separate type by <persName>Betts</persName> because of the missing date. His description of this piece is perplexing for two reasons. First he notes that there are no ships on the reverse, but this is undoubtedly an error since the ANS specimen considered to be the Betts 511 type (<ref target="#fig-9">HWU1</ref>) has two ships. Secondly, Betts dates 511 as 1764 but notes that the exergue is plain and refers to the description in Tancred, p. 49, of a similar undated medal. The line drawing in Tancred shows a series of lines across the exergue indicating perhaps that the date might have been removed either from the piece itself or from the die. Probably these"no date" pieces were produced for presentation in a different year.</p>

                  <p>We believe that <persName>Betts</persName> 509 and 510 (cast, chased in silver, 75 mm in diameter) are two examples of the same type rather than two different types.

However Betts, citing Parkman‚Äôs"History of the Conspiracy of Pontiac," chap. 31, notes that Pontiac made peace with the English in the summer of 1765 and was given numerous gifts by Sir William Johnson at Oswego, NY, on 23 July 1766.<ref target="#CH2-n50">50</ref> Although Betts felt that the gifts included the so-called Lion and Wolf medal (Betts 535), we are of the opinion that the 1766 HWU medals may also have been issued at this time.</p>

                  <p>The latest of the HWU medal types is that known as the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> medal, dated 1780 (Betts 570). The obverse of this medal depicts the Great Seal of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> (first designed in the late 1770s) and the reverse a reproduction of the reverse of the Happy While United medals of 1764-66, with a date of 1780. The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> medals measure 75 mm in diameter and have a pipe and eagle‚Äôs wing suspension loop. The four known specimens of this medal are all in more-or- less Mint State condition and it seems unlikely that they were ever awarded officially or even worn.</p>

                  <p>Betts cited the specimen of his Betts 570, then in the Appleton collection, as made of copper as did Appleton on two published occasions.<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> It seems more likely, however, that it is brass. Appleton later willed the medal to the Massachusetts Historical Society. The present whereabouts of the medal are unknown; it has not been found at the MHS and was not listed in the catalogue of the MHS sale scheduled to be held by Stack‚Äôs in 1973.<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> The ANS has a plaster cast of an unidentified <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> medal which may well be the MHS specimen.</p>
                  <p>Clearly Wayte Raymond was impressed by <ref target="#fig-19">HWU 14</ref>, as it occupied one of only two plates in the catalogue. The whereabouts of this piece are unknown. <ref target="#fig-21">HWU 16</ref> was only recently discovered in Ohio and has been examined by the authors.</p>
                  <p>It seems unlikely that these <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> pieces were issued officially. From a technical standpoint, none of the HWU medals could have been fully die struck with the eagle and pipe suspension edge with the technology available to <persName>Fueter</persName> in 1760 or even 1780. Thus, although the 1780 pewter medal in the BM is extremely sharp and detailed, it could not have been struck. The brass (or copper) cast pieces (Appleton‚Äôs misplaced piece, the Senter piece and the Ohio one), are relatively crude castings. There is little doubt that these medals were not made in or around 1780. Since the Appleton piece was known from about 1850, this may well have been when they were made. Until further data on these <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> medals are available, they must be relegated to an apochryphal position in the Indian Peace Medal series.</p>
                  <p>Certainly the views expressed herewith on this fascinating series are not the last word, but we hope that the information available here will prompt more research by contemporary scholars.</p>

            <p>To understand the current thinking on what we call the"<placeName>Spanish</placeName> medal in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>," that is, the medals produced in territories under <placeName>Spanish</placeName> rule, we have to consider some fundamental studies from the turn of the century. We can then examine the policies behind the introduction of the earliest medal in <placeName>Spanish</placeName>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, whose influence extended to the medals of later periods. A consideration of the circumstances of the introduction and spread of the medal, which we intend to follow here in its general outlines, will shed light on the colonial policy as a whole.</p>
            <p>Regarding published sources, the works of Medina on <placeName>Spanish</placeName> colonial medals, published between 1900 and 1919, remain fundamental;<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> supplemented by <persName>Herrera‚Äôs</persName> 1882 work on <placeName>Spanish</placeName> proclamation medals<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> and Vives‚Äôs 1916 book on medals of the House of Bourbon.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> These works all exhibit a similar point of view; they differ in that Medina focused on the American case individually, while <persName>Herrera</persName> and Vives considered it in the context of <placeName>Spanish</placeName> history as a whole. In more recent years, while several works have treated the development of the Academies, especially that of Mexico,<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> from a variety of viewpoints, the medals themselves have only been treated in isolated works which are basically catalogues for collectors.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> In a recent study, I examined the medallic activity of the Academy of <persName>San Carlos</persName>, and placed it in the context of <placeName>Spanish</placeName> and American medallic activity.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The first question to deal with must be the validity of the term <placeName>Spanish</placeName> in this medallic production, the extent to which it is a manifestation of <placeName>Spanish</placeName> intention and the role played by interests, producers, manufacturers, and recipients. To this end, we shall examine three points of reference whose influences complemented each other: the proclamation medal; the work of the mints; and the work of the academies.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Medal of Proclamation and Oath: the Artisanal Factor in the Origins of the American Medal</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The first documented medal in the new world, of which no extant specimens are known, is that of the proclamation and oath of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii_spain">Philip II</persName> in Lima in 1555. Medina has critically analyzed the documentation published by <persName>Herrera</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> To its difficulties of interpretation is added the uniqueness of the case, not only since, as Medina has explained, this was a medal for Lima alone, but also in that there were no analogous medals, either extant or known from documents for the next century and a half. In any event, the mention of a royal proclamation ceremony of the sort typical of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>,
<pb n="47"/>
including the distribution of medals with the king‚Äôs image, remains significant. The use of coins in this context on the American continent is attested indirectly for this period and explicitly for later times. We cannot therefore eliminate the possibility, if we accept the explanation of the development of American proclamations proposed by Medina, that the lack of a mint in Lima in 1555 led to the creation there of a medal to fill a role served by coins elsewhere and in Lima itself at a later date.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> In any event, we have here the earliest evidence for connecting the origin of the <placeName>Spanish</placeName>-American medal with the ceremonies attendant on a royal proclamation.</p>
               <p>Apparently, the singular form in which the Renaissance medal was adopted in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> did not lend itself to export to the new world because of the different social and political relationships.<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref> The notice published by Medina of a medal of <persName>Gonzalo Pizzaro</persName> stands out as an exception.<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref> Only the proclamations of kings, documented from the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii_spain">Philip II</persName> (that is, the official government activities), would serve as the occasion for the creation of coins or medals to disseminate the image of a new king.<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> The single case documented for the <persName>Hapsburg Dynasty</persName> does not allow us to do more than speculate about this activity on the basis of what happened in the eighteenth century. This is confirmed by the fact that from the appearance of the earliest extant specimens of 1701, the proclamation medal remained for many years in <placeName>Spanish</placeName>-<placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, and, even after the introduction of other genres, continued to be the dominant form.</p>
               <p>The geographical distribution of the cities in which medals were minted for the six proclamations up to 1808 can serve as an index of the spread of the <placeName>Spanish</placeName> medal on the American continent. From the data assembled by <persName>Herrera</persName>, <placeName>Medina</placeName> and <persName>Grove</persName>, we can discern a progressive extension and intensification of the production of the medals. Mexico served as an initial focal point and remained the area of greatest production. From there, production extended in two directions‚Äîto the Caribbean Islands and to the south‚Äîa distribution still apparent in 1808. Though the regional configuration of proclamation medals is related to the location of mints, it corresponds more closely to clearly-defined economic regions; for example, the region of el Plata, which had no mint in this period.</p>
               <p>However, some exceptions are apparent, with some places and issuers fluctuating radically in output, not only on a local scale as was frequent in New <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, but occasionally as an entire region. Cuba, for example, had been previously normal in its production, but produced no medals for the proclamation of Ferdinand VII in 1808. The outpouring of medals on the island in 1834 can be seen

                  </figure>
as a reaction to the independence of the continental viceroyalties. Nevertheless, the distribution is generally representative of the lines of development in <placeName>Spanish</placeName>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> during the eighteenth century.</p>
               <p>The earliest known examples are for the proclamation of <persName corresp="#viaf_87644221">Philip V</persName> in 1701 (<ref target="#fig-22">fig. 1</ref>), which were limited to the two cities of New <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, Mexico City and Veracruz, issued no doubt by municipal authorities.<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> Both are of cast silver and correspond, as Medina pointed out,<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> to the prototype of the medal for the proclamation of <persName corresp="#viaf_87644221">Philip V</persName> in Cadiz (<ref target="#fig-23">fig. 2</ref>), dated 1700.<ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> The 1701 issues have the same obverse (except for the date) and retain the titulature of the Cadiz piece with no mention of the New World; the Mexico City piece has on the reverse the inscription IMPERATOR INDIARVM together with the arms of the city. These characteristics, together with the mediocre quality of these pieces, leads to the inference that they were the product of silversmiths‚Äô workshops. This conclusion is supported by the documented production of proclamation medals in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> by silversmiths trained as artisans rather than in the fine arts.<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref> In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, on the other hand, such documentation is common as in the case of <persName>Gonzalo Pizzaro</persName> mentioned above.<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref> From such examples, it can be affirmed that even if in its concept the medal was introduced as a royal proclamation, in practice its development was bound up with and influenced by the artisanal world, specifically silversmiths.</p>

               <pb n="49"/>
               <p>This can be seen, above all, in the clear connection between peninsular and American workshops, in spite of the existence of American mints and the documented use of coinage in connection with proclamation ceremonies.</p>
               <p>The first models came from <persName>Cadiz</persName>. Later, for the proclamations of <persName>Louis</persName> I in 1724 and <persName>Ferdinand</persName> VI in 1747, examples can be found based more or less on pieces made in <persName>Cadiz</persName> for the proclamation of <persName corresp="#viaf_87644221">Philip V</persName>, but other prototypes can be noted, generally from Andalusian cities, which were in closest contact with <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref>
                  <persName>Mexican</persName> proclamation medals of <persName corresp="#viaf_262764224">Louis I</persName>, for example,<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref> appear to correspond to models from Granada,<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref> though the direction of influence is not certain; they themselves served as models for medals of <persName corresp="#viaf_49346331">Ferdinand VI</persName> in San Miguel el Grande.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref> In the case of <persName corresp="#viaf_100902917">Charles III</persName>, the medal of <persName>Puebla de los Angeles</persName>

The most notorious example of this last group is in the medals of <persName corresp="#viaf_262764224">Louis I</persName> from the <persName>Yucatan</persName>. Changes in the nature of the proclamation medal in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> itself, however, would soon make themselves felt in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> as well.<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref>

               <p>The proclamation medal in eighteenth-century <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> can be placed in the context of the well-known struggle between the artisanal world of the Baroque and the academic style of classical art. The side taken by the Bourbons in this struggle is clear; placing a great deal of importance on the quality of coin and medal production, they encouraged the development of a national medallic program tied to the Academies, designed to replace the artisanal production then dominant.<ref target="#CH3-n24">24</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The transfer of this tendency to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> led to a series of alterations imposed on the American medal, culminating in the creation of the Mexican Academy in 1785. But this event was in itself the consequence of an evolution whose first decisive step was the reorganization of the mints, the"<persName>Casas de Moneda</persName>." Although this is generally considered the work of <persName corresp="#viaf_100902917">Charles III</persName>, it can be seen clearly throughout <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> as the result of an earlier, gradual development.</p>

               <p>The American mints, from the creation of the first two in Mexico and Santo Domingo in 1536, underwent a transformation that is beyond the scope of this paper.<ref target="#CH3-n25">25</ref> The introduction of the medal, whether in 1555 or 1701 was, as we have seen, independent of the mints. But, by the middle of the eighteenth century a movement parallel to the evolution in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> brought about the appearance in 1760 of medals signed by mint engravers for the proclamation of <persName corresp="#viaf_100902917">Charles III</persName>; groundwork for this must have been laid in the reign of <persName corresp="#viaf_49346331">Ferdinand VI</persName>.

               </p>
               <p>Given the current state of our knowledge, it is not possible to follow the general training of engravers in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> before the reign of <persName corresp="#viaf_100902917">Charles III</persName>, except in specific cases such as <persName>P√°rraga or Hern√°ndez Escudero</persName>. These examples of American conditions in 1760 evidence the beginning of a transformation which was not yet institutionalized and a tendency to regulate the training and career of engravers, which would become systematized and well documented in a later period.<ref target="#CH3-n35">35</ref> From about 1760 on it is possible to discern a medallic activity in the American mints, with engravers coming either directly from <placeName corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</placeName>‚Äîas would become the regular path in later years‚Äîor from the mint of Mexico, which had come to assume a position of primacy among the mints of <placeName>Spanish</placeName>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. The steps in the creation of the mint of Guatemala in 1733, or the relationship maintained with those of Lima and Potosi throughout the century are significant in this regard.<ref target="#CH3-n36">36</ref>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Introduction of the Academies</hi>
               </head>
               <p>It was during the reign of <persName corresp="#viaf_100902917">Charles III</persName> (1759-88) that the bases which had developed received their first formal recognition and that medallic activity in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> as in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> underwent an explosive growth. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</placeName> the institutional ties between the mint and the academy reached their height in the person of Prieto and in the creation of the School of Engravers within the Mint, which would become the exclusive training ground of the profession. In 1772 monetary types were unified following patterns designed by Prieto and distributed to the mints. In this process, the American mints
<pb n="52"/>
began to obtain their engravers from the same source as those in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Within this context there developed the third of the major determinant elements of the <placeName>Spanish</placeName> American medal with the foundation in 1785 of the Academy of San Carlos of New <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, whose characteristics have been the object of repeated studies.<ref target="#CH3-n37">37</ref> In the area under discussion here, it is possible to discern a revision of the schema set up by Prieto even before the apparent development of American needs. It must be recalled that one of the principal activities of the Academies of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, as later in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, was engraving in all media, including medals.<ref target="#CH3-n38">38</ref> The transfer to Mexico of Jer√≥nimo Antonio Gil to replace Casanova in 1778 was accompanied by the specific charge to establish a School for Engravers within the mint, a school which was to serve as the nucleus for the future academy.<ref target="#CH3-n39">39</ref> The ties between activities and institutions as well as a clear preoccupation with production of official art are readily apparent, and it is significant that the Academy was housed in the same building as the mint until 1789, when they were separated upon the arrival of Tols√°, Ximeno and Gonz√°lez Velazques.<ref target="#CH3-n40">40</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The foundation of the Mexican Academy led to the fulfillment of the needs of the American mints for the training of medalists and engravers along the model of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</placeName>, which Gil had known well.<ref target="#CH3-n41">41</ref> But this did not exclude the possibility of the continued flow of engravers from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. Thus we see <placeName>Spanish</placeName> engravers such as Gordillo<ref target="#CH3-n42">42</ref> appear at the Potos√≠ and Lima mints at the same time as a sizable group of Mexicans, presumably trained at the local Academy.<ref target="#CH3-n43">43</ref> However, though the Academy appears to have been able to meet the needs for which it was established, in 1804 the training of engravers was conferred on the department of engraving of the mint in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n44">44</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The results of the introduction of the Academy are well known and had a great impact on the Mexican medal. Along with the production of medals of high quality, we can note the assimilation of the proclamation medal within a varied production, the introduction of neo-classical style alongside certain realistic tendencies which appear to derive from the school of Prieto, and the creation of a corpus of medals other than for proclamations.</p>
               <p>If Gil is known above all for his series of proclamation medals for <persName corresp="#nomisma_charles_iv_spain">Charles IV</persName>, his greatest contribution is the creation of a medallic tradition outside of the proclamation pieces. The content of this new production was oriented to the academic institutions of Enlightenment <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and the society introduced in the Bourbon era into New <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n45">45</ref> The themes of royal events,<ref target="#CH3-n46">46</ref> of learned societies

VII bear the sponsorship of clearly-defined institutions: certain clerical establishments<ref target="#CH3-n50">50</ref> and entities involved with mining<ref target="#CH3-n51">51</ref> joined the learned and academic bodies in sponsoring such medals (<ref target="#fig-27">fig. 6</ref>). The production of artisanal proclamation medals would ultimately die out in areas with no mints or other contact with such activity; the case of Cuba at the proclamation of <persName corresp="#nomisma_charles_iv_spain">Charles IV</persName> serves as a good example.</p>
               <p>With the rise of the academic medal, Mexico appears to have moved away from the medals of the southern regions, where the scheme of medallic production based on the mints was maintained, though even there some signs of influence by the new tendencies were apparent.

               <p>What we have considered as the <placeName>Spanish</placeName> medal in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> is then the result of three main factors‚Äîroyal proclamations, the mints, and the academies‚Äîwhich were coordinated with the governmental structures and interacted upon each other. The height of this development came in 1808 with the proclamation of <persName corresp="#viaf_286447916">Ferdinand VII</persName>, but the wars which followed brusquely interrupted this activity, which was strongly identified with pro-<placeName>Spanish</placeName> sentiment. It remains for us to describe the influence of this medallic tradition on later production, which was to become increasingly localized and to respond to external influences, with various results, throughout the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>Three fundamental directions can be noted. First, a certain retention of basics can be seen in the case of Mexico. From about 1820 on, a restoration of the Academy, although along different lines, brought with it the reappearance of medalists such as Trasgallo and Medina (apparently Mexicans) who followed tradition with their medals commemorating the"proclamation" of <persName>Augustin I</persName> in 1822.<ref target="#CH3-n54">54</ref> Later, the"<placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>anizing" reorganization of the Academy in 1843 led to the arrival of Bagally as director of medallic production; his students <persName>Ocampo</persName>, <persName>Naval√≥n</persName>, and Spiritu stood out in the period of Maximilian.<ref target="#CH3-n55">55</ref>
               </p>
               <p>To the south, medallic production became increasingly sporadic and linked to the activity of the mints. A certain rise in medallic activity at the time of independence gave way to a steady decline in production. The medal for the dedication of the railroad in <placeName>Potos√≠</placeName> in 1912 constitutes a curious example of late <placeName>Spanish</placeName> involvement. However, <persName>Argentina</persName> was an exceptional case. Though without a mint in the colonial period, it had shown enthusiasm for the proclamation medal‚Äîespecially for <persName corresp="#nomisma_charles_iv_spain">Charles IV</persName> (<ref target="#fig-30">fig. 9</ref>) and <persName corresp="#viaf_286447916">Ferdinand VII</persName>‚Äî minted locally as well as in <persName>Santiago de Chile</persName> and in <placeName>Potos√≠</placeName>. It was probably this activity in the absence of a mint that led to the nineteenth-century production, which originally followed common trends but led in the middle of the century to medals of high quality, produced by artists of basically Italian origin. The pieces of Cataldi, Orzali, Podest√°, Zuccotti, Bellagamba and Cottuzzo are indicative of this well-established tradition which owed little to <placeName>Spanish</placeName> influences.<ref target="#CH3-n56">56</ref>

               <p>Finally, in Cuba and the Philippines (<placeName>Spanish</placeName> colonies until 1898), the proclamation of <persName corresp="#viaf_87748802">Isabella II</persName> in 1834 was marked by medals in which the Department of Engraving of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</placeName> added a uniform element to local tradition.<ref target="#CH3-n57">57</ref> Similarly, certain pieces such as the anonymous medal for the Havana aqueduct of 1858 follow the tradition of the nineteenth-century <placeName>Spanish</placeName> medal exhibiting unmistakably high quality (<ref target="#fig-31">fig. 10</ref>).

            <p>How to interpret the new American liberty in visual terms? That was the task that <persName corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</persName> set for the <placeName>French</placeName> artist <persName>Augustin Dupr√©</persName>, in 1782, on the eve of American victory in the Revolution. As always, <persName>Franklin</persName> had suggestions of his own. The solution, in the head of Liberty on the obverse of <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs medal</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Libertas Americana,</hi> is one of the most effective and moving works of art of the Revolutionary era; the reverse also conveys topical and significant ideas with iconographic subtlety (<ref target="#fig-32">fig. 1</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>On the reverse an armed Minerva, her shield blazoned with the fleur de lys of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, combats the English lion, as the infant Hercules strangles the two snakes sent by the <persName>jealous Juno</persName>. The legend, NON SINE DIIS ANIMOSUS INFANS, a quotation from Horace (Book 3, Ode 4, 20), expresses the idea that although Hercules is powerful and courageous, qualities Dupr√© conveys in his rendering, nonetheless the newly-born child requires divine protection.</p>
            <p>The sentiment and heavily literary, allegorical approach in the reverse of the medal is similar to the tenor of the proposals made for the seal of the <placeName>United States</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> by the first committee to work on the project. The Continental Congress established the committee on 4 July 1776, before the close of business on the day on which they adopted the Declaration of Independence, and appointed <persName corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</persName> to the committee along with <persName corresp="#viaf_95296943">John Adams</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref>
               <persName>Franklin</persName> proposed as a subject for the seal Moses liberating the Israelites from the <persName>Egyptians</persName>, and <persName>Adams</persName> suggested a classical theme, the choice of <persName>Hercules</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of the two sources for allegory represented in these initial ideas for the <placeName>United States</placeName> seal, the biblical and the classical, the latter was more at home in the burgeoning neoclassical artistic environment of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> in 1782 when <persName>Franklin</persName>, anticipating the successful conclusion of the War of Independence, proposed to Dupr√© the striking of a commemorative medal of American Liberty.</p>
            <p>The potential of Hercules to represent <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> had been recognized, in <persName>Adams‚Äôs</persName> seal proposal, for example, where the mythic choice of Hercules symbolized the climate of crisis and decision for revolutionary action in 1776. By 1782, the choices had been made, and with victory at hand, Hercules, newly born, was the pertinent conception to symbolize the new nation: courageous, strong, and warding off danger.</p>
            <p>Further specific connection between the mythic image and history can be identified. The two snakes of the Hercules myth, that he is shown strangling on the reverse of the medal, refer to the two major battles of the Revolutionary War that have their dates of victory cited in the exergue: the surrender of General Burgoyne at Saratoga

(17 October 1777) and that of General Cornwallis at Yorktown (19 October 1781). The artist‚Äôs signature, <persName>Dupr√© F.[ecit]</persName>, is in the lower right.</p>
            <p>In ancient art, <persName>Hercules</persName> is sometimes shown seated while strangling the serpents,<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref> and he is sometimes represented struggling in a half-standing position, similar to that on <persName>Dupre‚Äôs</persName> medal, as in a wall painting from Pompeii (<ref target="#fig-33">fig. 2</ref>). <persName>Dupr√©</persName> based his Hercules in part on models such as these, but he does not copy them: the ways in which his <persName>Hercules</persName> differs from the types from which it is derived are instructive. <persName>Dupr√©</persName> has taken care to show that while <persName>Hercules‚Äôs</persName> arms are occupied with the snakes, he is still partly enmeshed in swaddling cloth‚Äîindeed he is in the process of disentangling his right foot. This motif conveys the idea of change of status and of growth. Thus, through it, the artist suggests symbolically the revolutionary process as well as the revolutionary accomplishment.</p>

a different theme, the sculpture of Laocoon in the Vatican in Rome, which depicts the hubristic priest and his two sons attacked by two monsters of snake-like form (<ref target="#fig-34">fig. 3</ref>).

between the two works of art is not that between <persName>Hercules</persName> and Laocoon. The posture of <persName>Hercules</persName> is nearly identical (although reversed) to that of the older of Laocoon‚Äôs two sons, seen on the right of the sculpture. While the father and the other boy are about to die, this son is shown making his escape, liberating himself from the coils of the snake by pushing them down from his legs and freeing his feet.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref>
               <persName>Dupr√©</persName>, by depicting in connection with Hercules a similar action of disentangling the feet, dramatizes through visual means the struggle between bondage and freedom. Thus he suggests symbolically, with a subtlety that does not disturb the fundamentally triumphant mode of the image, the historical context of struggle against constraint that lies behind the achievement of American independence. Although <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Laocoon</persName>
               </hi> is one of the best known works of classical sculpture, to my knowledge Dupr√© is the only artist to have recognized in the figure of the son freeing himself from the snakes the potential for the expression of heroism, as well as of political liberty.</p>
            <p>A dimension of the mythic meaning of <persName>Hercules</persName> that has particular pertinence to the revolutionary context is that he represents an image of vindicated illegitimacy. <persName>Hercules</persName> was born out of wedlock, the son of <persName>Jupiter</persName> and the mortal woman <persName>Alcmena</persName>. The reason for <persName>Juno‚Äôs</persName> hostility, that motivated her to send the snakes to kill the child, was her jealousy about her husband‚Äôs philandering directed toward this illegitimate birth. Nevertheless, Hercules grew to become a hero and savior, and eventually became divine. The violence and illegitimacy of his birth were vindicated through his life. Thus he may stand as a prototype of the violent and, as even many of those who were in sympathy with the revolution thought, the illegitimate origins of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, vindicated by history. This interpretation is parallel to one made, in connection with the <placeName>French</placeName> Revolution, by <persName>Jerrine Mitchell</persName> of <persName>Jacques Louis David‚Äôs painting</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Intervention of the <persName>Sabine Women</persName>
               </hi> (1799). In this work, the women of the Sabine tribe, who had been violently abducted by the Romans, seek to bring peace during a battle between the Romans, who are now their husbands, and the Sabines, who are their brothers. In <persName>Mitchell‚Äôs view</persName>, <persName>David expresses</persName>, through the abduction of the women and their subsequent acceptance of their fate, the post-Revolutionary need to reconcile the perception of the violent and illegitimate origins of the <placeName>French</placeName> Revolution with its ultimate legitimate status.<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> Thus it appears that each artist found classical narrative ways to express the legitimization of revolution in the eighteenth century, <persName>Dupr√©</persName> the American Revolution and David the <placeName>French</placeName> Revolution.</p>
            <pb n="67"/>
            <p>If the reverse of the <hi rend="italic">Libertas Americana</hi> medal is saturated with complex literary allegory of the kind that characterized the attempts to arrive at a design for the <placeName>United States</placeName> seal, the obverse is a penetrating artistic invention, as free in its representation of liberty as the goddess it represents.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dupre</persName> depicts <hi rend="italic">Libertas Americana</hi> as the bust of a female facing left, with her abundant loose hair blown behind her. A liberty cap surmounts the staff that crosses diagonally, as if resting on her right shoulder. Above is the legend LIBERTAS AMERICANA, and below in the exergue one reads the reference to our Declaration of Independence, 4 JUIL. 1776. Although he did not spell July in English (one wonders why, when he had <persName>Franklin</persName> right at hand), <persName>Dupre</persName>, with his youthful, far-seeing, and unconventionally flowing-haired goddess, captured the spirit of American Liberty.</p>
            <p>The conception of a Goddess of Liberty with her attribute of the liberty cap on a staff has its roots in antiquity. In ancient Rome, the manumission of a slave was symbolized by the adoption of the pileus cap, the headgear of the working citizen, by the freed slave. The manumission ceremony, in which slaves took on the cap as a symbol of freedom, and were touched by a rod, was called capere pileum, after the cap.<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref> From this ceremonial use,<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref> the cap developed its generalized meaning of liberty. The pileus became an attribute of Libertas, the Goddess of Liberty, who was shown

holding the cap, often on the top of the staff, and Roman emperors used the propaganda power of the circulating coins and medals impressed with the image of Libertas to associate themselves with the goddess, and to advertise thus their claims to being good, or legitimate, emperors (<ref target="#fig-35">fig. 4</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref> During the Saturnalia, a licentious, orgiastic, mardi gras-like festival marked by <persName>sanctioned role</persName>-reversals, masters served their servants‚Äîand everyone wore the pileus.</p>
            <p>The potentially revolutionary character of the symbol of manumission,

that the eighteenth century recognized so clearly, was realized on one notable occasion in Rome, on a coin struck by <persName>Brutus</persName> following the assassination of <persName corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Julius Caesar</persName> in 44 B.C. On the obverse is a portrait of <persName>Brutus</persName>, and on the reverse, the cap of liberty is placed between two daggers, with an abbreviated inscription of the Ides of March. Thus, through the symbol of the cap, <persName>Brutus</persName> proudly identified himself with the restoration of republican liberties.<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This coin type carries the liberty cap through the centuries, for in 1552, <persName corresp="#viaf_289634335">Henry II</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> employed it for a medal after his victory over <persName corresp="#viaf_88598818">Charles V</persName> of Germany, to promote the idea of himself as a liberator, the cap between the daggers transformed into a tall-crowned, narrow-brimmed Renaissance model.<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref> In another allegorical representation, Liberty, unusual in being represented nearly nude, holds the cap, here again the tall-crowned Renaissance model, on a medal commemorating the Treaty of <persName corresp="#geonames_2800867">Brussels</persName> of 1577 between don <persName>Juan of Austria</persName> and the Estates General of the Netherlands (<ref target="#fig-36">fig. 5</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n12">12</ref>

            <p>From the Renaissance, the symbolization of liberty in terms of a cap, and the explanation of the source of the symbol in Roman manumission, is standard in iconographical dictionaries. It is amusing to see that in some editions of <persName>Ripa‚Äôs</persName> famous <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Iconologia</persName>,</hi> for example, antiquity is <hi rend="italic">visually</hi> distant, as in an Italian edition of 1766 where, reflecting yet another fashion, the"ancient" cap appears in a low-crowned, broad-brimmed contemporary mode.<ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref> In an earlier, <placeName>French</placeName> edition of Ripa, the conical form of the cap held by Liberty is more in touch with Roman models.<ref target="#CH4-n14">14</ref>

            <p>The earliest use of the liberty cap that I have found to refer to the eighteenth-century struggles for political liberty is attributable to Hogarth, and is characteristically satirical. In an engraving of 1763, Hogarth placed a cap on the head of the outspoken English libertarian <persName corresp="#viaf_62815192">John Wilkes</persName>; through an ironic reversal, the <persName>rakish Wilkes</persName> is transformed into a Liberty Goddess by the attributes of cap and staff. This image of <persName>Wilkes</persName> was disseminated widely, not only through the engraving, but by being reproduced on a porcelain punch bowl that was a favored item in libertarian circles on both sides of the Atlantic. To summarize, through Hogarth the cap with its symbolic meaning came to the colonies, and largely through its frequent use in several media by the prolific revolutionary artist Paul Revere, as on his masthead for the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>

            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> talent for giving visual expression to contemporary ideas of freedom is nowhere better demonstrated than in the obverse of this medal, above all through the motif of the hair of Liberty freely flowing in the wind. This visual idea, too, can be traced to antiquity; the sources for the unloosed hair are Greek, rather than Roman. However, the motif underwent an imaginative transformation in the hands of Dupr√© far greater and more innovative than in the case of his dutiful and straightforward adoption of the attributes of cap and staff.</p>
            <p>The waving locks of <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> natural seeming goddess, unconstrained by any hat or diadem, need to be seen in the context of the complicated, stilted, and powdered artificiality of contemporary, aristocratic,"real" hair styles in this late eighteenth-century period (<ref target="#fig-37">fig. 6</ref>). As the caricature conveys, these could bring elaboration to the point of incendiary danger! In striking contrast, on the medal, the hair unbound and moving with the wind, is a visual metaphor of liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> invention is based upon the reinterpretation of a motif derived from classical art where unloosed hair was used to express Dionysiac spiritual liberation. This motif can be seen on two ancient coin types from which Dupr√© seems to have derived inspiration. One is a hellenistic tetradrachm of <persName>Mithradates VI of Pontus</persName> (120-63 B.C.), whose surname, Dionysus, inspired the exceptionally- free treatment of his hair (<ref target="#fig-38">fig. 7</ref>). A further reference to the name Dionysus is the ivy wreath of the reverse, a symbol of the god.<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref> A specific detail of the Mithradatic coiffure, the short wayward lock at the top, appears to be incorporated in <hi rend="italic">Libertas Americana. </hi>Another coin with Dionysiac associations is a gold stater of the city of Lampsacus, of the fourth century B.C., with a representation of a flowing-haired maenad, a female follower of Dionysus, wreathed
<pb n="71"/>
with ivy (<ref target="#fig-39">fig. 8</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref> The rich sculptural treatment of the hair recalls that of Libertas, and the feminine gender of the maenad may have helped <persName>Dupr√©</persName> in finding a bridge from the hellenic Dionysiac models to his medal.</p>
            <p>Thus to the artistic question implied in the commission of <hi rend="italic">Libertas Americana</hi>‚Äîhow to interpret the new American liberty in visual terms?‚Äî<persName>Dupr√©</persName> devised an original and effective answer. Drawing upon the hellenic motif of Dionysiac liberation expressed through abundant and unloosed hair, he transformed it to express a new meaning for his own time: eighteenth century political liberation.</p>
            <p>Thus it can be seen that the artist drew upon two strains of liberating iconography from the antique, that of the spiritually liberating god Dionysus, and that of Roman manumission with its cap and staff, in creating the image of <hi rend="italic">Libertas Americana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The idea of the liberty as"blowing in the wind," to borrow a pertinent phrase from songwriter <persName>Bob Dylan</persName>, appears a few years later in the work of <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> friend, the painter <persName>Jacques Louis David</persName>. In his important drawing for a monumental painting (never completed), that commemorates the early revolutionary event, the sworn unity of the three estates in the"Tennis Court Oath," the fresh breezes of liberty enter through the open windows, stirring the curtains like celebratory pennants.<ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref>

having showed it to a guest at Mount Vernon.<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref> The medal was well known at the time, <persName>Franklin</persName> having sprinkled examples of it liberally among Americans in government. It is unmistakable that Dupr√©‚Äôs medal is the source for the cent, but the subtlety of the <placeName>French</placeName> artist‚Äôs rendering has been lost in the translation: the goddess on the coin is coarsely rendered, and unfortunately her hair, rather than seeming to flow freely in the winds of liberty, merely looks unkempt. Something more signifying than the elegance of <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> artistry has been lost: the cap and staff, that had accompanied Liberty since antiquity, are omitted.</p>
            <p>The cap and staff are excluded on other contemporary coins inspired by the <persName>Dupr√©</persName> model, such as the 1792 pattern dime. The reason for the elimination of the motif of cap and staff in these first federal coins is the sensitivity in the period to the major issue threatening union, that of slavery versus emancipation.</p>

            <p>The nation had just emerged from the constitutional battles and compromises of 1787, in which the major threat to union had been the conflict between North and South over the slavery issue. Against that background, it is not surprising that the new federal mint reinterpreted the Dupr√© model along more generalized lines, maintaining‚Äîor trying to maintain‚Äîthe inspirational effectiveness of the flowing hair, but eliminating the cap and staff with their specific and concrete references to the inflammatory issue of freeing <persName>slaves. Earlier</persName>, when the colonies were united in the cause of independence, and the issue of slavery was not a focal point of conflict, the liberty cap took a significant place on currency, on the 26 July 1775 notes issued by the Provincial Convention of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName>
               <pb n="73"/>
(<ref target="#fig-41">fig. 10</ref>). As <persName>Eric Newman</persName> has described, the allegorical personification of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, standing at the head of American troops, holds the liberty cap and staff as she walks over a scroll marked SLAVERY; on the left of the group, flanking the central figure of <persName>Brittania</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_49264990">George III</persName> is shown"trampling the M(agna) CHART A and applying a fire brand to an American city under attack by a British fleet."<ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is clear that in the period of the first issuance of federal coins, such as the cent, the ideational link between the Liberty Goddess, with her Roman symbols that represented the freeing of slaves, and the cause of emancipation of American slaves was well known. In the first abolitionist painting made by an American, <hi rend="italic">The Genius of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> Encouraging the Emancipation of the Blacks</hi> (1790-92), by <persName>Samuel Jennings</persName>, a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> abolitionist, the American Genius is the Liberty Goddess, and her cap and staff are prominently displayed. She leans toward the slaves who pay her homage, resting the weight of her upper body on books, on learning, indeed on the catalogues of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Free Library Company that commissioned the painting.<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref> The library had been founded by the ubiquitous <persName corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</persName> and in this period was largely supported by <persName>Quakers</persName>.</p>
            <p>The visual vocabulary of Roman manumission, with liberty cap and staff, expresses in Jennings‚Äôs painting abolitionist support for the emancipation of American slaves. In the context of the tension in the period between North and South, and the recent and tenuous Constitutional compromises, the generalized and inspirational goddess of the flowing hair‚Äîdeprived on federal coins of the attributes that specifically referred to freeing of slaves‚Äîavoided abolitionist controversy.</p>
            <p>The story of <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> image is quite different in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, a nation which, for all of its revolutionary conflicts, was not divided on an abolitionist issue. Largely although not exclusively through the influence of <persName>Dupr√©</persName>, the liberty cap became a central symbol of the <placeName>French</placeName> Revolution. One of the first uses of the cap to symbolize liberty in the early days of the Revolution in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> is on a medal designed by <persName>Dupr√©</persName> to commemorate the establishment of the Mayoralty of Paris in June of 1789.<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref> Once the <placeName>French</placeName> Revolution was fully underway, the imagery of the cap was seen everywhere, on top of trees of liberty, on the Declaration of the Rights of Man, on commemorative plaques, medals, coins, as well as on decorative works of furniture and porcelain.</p>
            <p>Just as, in 1792, the <placeName>United States</placeName> adapted <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Libertas Americana</hi> for the first federal coins, in the same year the <placeName>French</placeName> utilized <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> design for a revolutionary medal (<ref target="#fig-42">fig. 11</ref>), but with a significant difference.</p>

            <p>While the American coins eliminated the symbols of manumission, in the <placeName>French</placeName> version, the cap as well as the staff are included. Nor did the <placeName>French</placeName> ever abandon the image of the female goddess with her cap; rather, she was transformed in meaning from Liberty into the Republic, and has lasted as the vigorous, familiar symbol of the <placeName>French</placeName> Republic to this day.</p>
            <p>While wariness with regard to abolitionist significance of the liberty cap led to its omission from the earliest federal coins, some subsequent coins reinstated the cap along the lines of <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> medal, the staff topped by the cap slanted behind the shoulder of the flowinghaired goddess, and in the course of the nineteenth century, the image of the liberty goddess with cap remained a common image although there was competition from diademed Liberties and other types. However, the persistence of the cap in the nineteenth century is attributable to the inherent conventionalism of coin images, which owe their acceptability to their traditionalism, particularly in commerce over large geographic areas. In major works of art of large scale, such as <persName>Thomas Crawford‚Äôs</persName> Liberty for the dome of the <placeName>United States</placeName> Capitol, the goddess with the cap was specifically rejected as an image of American Liberty,<ref target="#CH4-n26">26</ref> and gradually awareness of the cap‚Äôs true meaning was lost.</p>
            <p>By 1879, <persName>Robert Morris</persName> writing on"The Liberty Cap on American Coins" felt an explanation was in order:"Yet, in reply to the query what is this ‚Äòstick with a nightcap on it‚Äô which the <placeName>French</placeName> lady holds on our trade dollar...." He went on to cite the Roman sources in answer.<ref target="#CH4-n27">27</ref>

            <p>As <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName> wrote to <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> while they were developing ideas for a new coinage,"If we get down to bedrock facts, would the [Indian] feather head-dress be any more out of keeping with the rest of Liberty than the canonical cap which never is worn and never has been worn by any free people in the world?"<ref target="#CH4-n28">28</ref>

The new full length Liberty designed by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> for the twenty dollar gold piece (<ref target="#fig-43">fig. 12</ref>), seen from the front and pressing forward victoriously, does not even wear the Indian headdress as originally conceived: her hair flows freely in the wind. Since <persName>Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs</persName> image of Liberty is frontal, hair flowing behind would be lost to view; for this reason he has swung the loosed hair around to the side so that the inspirational image cannot be missed. Thus <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> finally arrived at a new transmutation of <persName>Dupr√©‚Äôs</persName> inspired metaphor of liberty.</p>

            <p>The art of the medal in the <placeName>United States</placeName> from ca. 1830 to the First World War begins in the pictorialism of <persName>John Trumbull</persName> and the federalist era, moves past the neo-classicism of <persName>Napoleon‚Äôs</persName> world, has a long involvement in the narrative symbolism of the decades before and after the Civil War, and, after the Centennial, turns to a new idiom. This new vocabulary belongs to the age of <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> and his pupils. Beside it, and influenced by its innovations, stands the work of the engravers at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint, a sculptural school perhaps more conservative than the independents but receptive to many of their ideas. The artists of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint became involved with a Grecian classicism of the fourth and, later, the fifth centuries B.C.<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> They paved the way for the <persName>Greek</persName> and <persName>Etruscan</persName> archaic and transitional style in American medals after World War I, an art identified with such sculptors as Paul Manship.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>If the medallic beginnings are grounded in the heroic narrative art of American painters in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>‚Äî<persName>Benjamin</persName> West and <persName>John Singleton Copley</persName>‚Äîand the later phases depend on <placeName>French</placeName> trends in the 1880s and 1890s or the revival of a high classical and earlier hellenism, the intermediate decades belong to an art that is both expressively Victorian and peculiarly American. The neo-classicism which gave way to sentiment in the Victorian cemetery also gave way to an art of the sentimental heroic in the medals which commemorated the triumphs and disasters of the growing Republic from the Mexican War to the after-glow of the Civil War. The American sculptors in Italy who sent back the great and popular statues and reliefs for the public monuments of the states united, soon to be divided, also trained and inspired several generations of funerary carvers for the mortuary gardens of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> Their iconography and its vocabulary were very much that of their contemporaries among the medalists of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

               <p>The <placeName>French</placeName> medalists, <persName>Duvivier</persName>, <persName>Dupr√©</persName> and <persName>Gatteaux</persName>, who designed the Congressional medals for George <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> and his Revolutionary War generals and colonels, leaned toward the pictorialism of the grand <placeName>French</placeName> painting from the age of <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName>. Thus, the reverse of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> on Dorchester Heights on March 17, 1776, is accurate enough according to the engravings of the time, but the composition could be almost a painting by <persName>Adam Franz van der Meulen</persName> of <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName>, the grand monarch, on a campaign in the Low
<pb n="81"/>
Countries. The obverse of the famous Diplomatic Medal, commissioned by <persName corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</persName> when he was Minister in Paris, is right out of the fantasy engravings of symbolic life in the colonies or New <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> before its capture in the <placeName>French</placeName> and Indian War. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> as an Indian princess in feathered bonnet and feathered skirt or kilt is enthroned amid the produce of the New World, while the Roman god of commerce, Mercury, with all his traditional attributes, runs up to her. With an ample cloak on her left shoulder and over her left leg, a quiver on her back and a strap across her bare upper body, this rustic personification of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> (or later, <placeName corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</placeName>) is a form of native Diana, with the cornucopiae of Fortuna cradled in her left arm. The identical goddess-personification stands amid captured flags and cannon to place a crown on the head of <persName>Daniel Morgans</persName> for his victory over Colonel <persName>Tarleton at Cowpens</persName> in South Carolina in the closing months of the Revolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Augustin Dupr√©</persName> (1748-1833), the creator of these two medals with Indian princesses as personifications, put a complex view of the rout of the British at Cowpens on the reverse of the Congressional medal for General <persName>Daniel Morgan</persName>. There were paintings and engravings of the retreating British, the charging Continentals and their Indian allies.<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> When <persName>Dupr√©</persName> turned to the medal for General Nathaniel Green (or Greene) and the battle of Eutaw Springs, September 8, 1871, the last major engagement between the British and the Americans in South Carolina, a new trend was started. The pictorialism of Dorchester Heights and the uplands around Cowpens was replaced by an image of Victoria with wreath and palm alighting on a shield amid the captured standards one of which was given to the victorious General.</p>
               <p>The Germanic medalists who came to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> to take over the <placeName>United States</placeName> Congressional commemorations from the <placeName>French</placeName> imports continued the tradition of symbolic reverses. Thus, <persName>John Reich</persName> (born 1768) used the clasped hands of an American officer and a loyal Indian chief, peace pipe and hatchet crossed above, as the reverse of a Presidential medal for <persName corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</persName>. Major General <persName corresp="#viaf_100194661">Andrew Jackson</persName> defeated the British at New Orleans on January 8, 1815, the last action of the War of 1812. The reverse of the Congressional medal by <persName>Moritz F√ºrst</persName> (born 1782) also takes refuge in the symbolism of victory rather than in a view of the battlefield. A dramatic, rather rococo figure of Victoria has put down her wreath and palm to inscribe a record of the triumph at the dictation of Pax. The motif of Victoria writing up the successes on the battlefield goes back to the triumphal sculpture and numismatic reverses of imperial Rome.</p>

Six crowns of laurel and oak enframe vistas of six battles and culminate in the central scene of General Scott on horseback observing the capture of Mexico City on September 14, 1847 (<ref target="#fig-44">fig. 1</ref>). The fall of Mexico City had been brought about by the great victory at Chapultepec on September 13. All this is fitted in balanced fashion on the reverse of a medal which, naturally, has a (Roman) bust of the General on the obverse.</p>

               <p>It remained for <persName>Anthony C.

The honorand was <persName>James Ross Snowden</persName>, Director of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint, and the building was the Greek revival, neo-classic building in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, built in 1832 and rendered fireproof in 1856. Director Snowden looks directly out at us, wearing his narrow, counting-house glasses and with the wart on his left cheek rendered prominently. The Mint building is as detailed, from the frames of the windows to the flagpole and the tall chimney, doubtless the focus of the fireproofing. Roman medallions could not show a Hadrian or a Septimius Severus and a temple or a triumphal arch with more depth of detail.</p>

               <p>Graeco-Roman is the operative phrase for the President <persName>Andrew Johnson</persName> medal described earlier, for very shortly the <placeName>United States</placeName> official medals will be influenced by the art of the Attic funerary monument as interpreted in such monumental mystic figures as the <persName>Adams</persName> Memorial by <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> in <persName>Rock Creek Cemetery</persName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>, D.C., or various funerary and commemorative statues by <persName>Daniel Chester</persName>
                  <placeName>French</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref> Then would come the influences of late archaic and transitional Greek sculpture in the medallic art of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. In the midst of all this, as mentioned earlier, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> and certain of his followers, such as <persName>James E. Fraser</persName>, would try an Italian Renaissance revival (the format and lettering of <persName>Antonio Pisano</persName>, called Pisanello) in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> of the decades from 1889 to the First World War. Even the Congressional medal for the British Captain who rescued the survivors of the <hi rend="italic">Titanic</hi> in 1912 would be carried out partly in this Renaissance taste. The realism of relief sculpture and statuary as a result of the Civil War had some echoes in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> medallic art, more in private medals than in anything produced at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint. Such realism reached its apogee in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> in medals leading up to and including World War I. One excellent example is the medal struck for the victorious conclusion of the World War in Belgium. On one side a soldier charging over the trenches with fixed bayonet symbolizes the final offensive in Flanders, September 28 to November 11,1918.</p>
               <p>On the second side, the victorious entry of the King and Queen of the Belgians into <persName corresp="#geonames_2800867">Brussels</persName> on November 22, 1918, is shown in dramatic detail.</p>
               <p>One of the first of the Grecian stele compositions on an official <placeName>United States</placeName> medal is <persName>Charles E.

                  <persName>Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs</persName> dispatch of the Atlantic Squadron of the <placeName>United States</placeName> Navy on a cruise around the world. The obverse with the presidential bust has the epigraphic format of a Renaissance medal, while the reverse combines allegory of the Greek fourth century B.C. or the early hellenistic age with the naturalism of a Roman triumphal relief, or here in terms of iconography, a contemporary photograph.

               <p>The high points of the new medallic art at the end of the Victorian era were embodied in the official medals for the two great fairs held in the <placeName>French</placeName> capital in 1889 and 1900. The first medal was the work of <persName>Jean-Baptiste Daniel Dupuis</persName> (1849-99), and the second was the creation of <persName>Jules-Cl√©ment Chaplain</persName>, his older contemporary (1839-1909) and perhaps the greatest <placeName>French</placeName> medalist of the new, romantic imagery. These and similar <placeName>French</placeName> medals certainly influenced the styles and compositions of the followers of <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, but the <placeName>United States</placeName> government engravers at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint were relatively undisturbed by the Beaux-Arts currents of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>. This may have been the reason for the turmoil in the years from the Columbian Exposition of 1892 and 1893 until Saint-Gaudens, his contemporaries, and his followers redid the coinage from 1907 to 1917. The official engravers seem to have moved from Victorian neo-classicism to a sentimental version of the Attic fifth and fourth century B.C. art practiced by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> in many of his funerary monuments. The <persName>Adams</persName> Memorial noted earlier was his powerful statement of this art.</p>
               <p>The obverses of the two medals present two very similar studies of the spirit of the <placeName>French</placeName> Republic, a lady of classic determination. The first bust is heavier than the second, which emphasizes fussier details of the liberty cap (rather than a coif of hair), wreath, drapery, and the tree behind. J.-C. Chaplain filled out his obverse with vistas of Paris, the palaces used for the fair, behind the bust and the figures
<pb n="92"/>
on the obverse and reverse.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Views of the figures on the reverse seem to confirm that, while <persName>J.-C. Chaplain</persName> was more famous than J.-B. <persName>D. Dupuis</persName>, the medal for the 1889 exposition was a stronger work of art than that which commemorated the fair at the turn of the century.</p>
               <p>The reverse of the 1889 medal presents a splendid composition of the arts or peace protecting a child with a torch and crowning a man whose tools suggest he personifies labor or industry (<ref target="#fig-53">fig. 10</ref>). The Eiffel Tower provides a vertical exclamation point in the right background. Costumes, and the lack of them, suggest a debt to a relaxed, fluid classicism, well overlaid with the faces and poses of the new art which developed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> with popular romanticism after the middle of the nineteenth century. The setting, from the altar, cippus, or bench on which the goddess-personification sits, to the ledge on which labor rests for inspiration, is an accomplished podium for the figures to act out their roles. The front of the ledge or step is tastefully framed to encompass the locale and the date of the Exposition Universelle, so hailed in the strong yet discreet lettering around the medal‚Äôs upper edge.</p>
               <p>The reverse of Chaplain‚Äôs medal of 1900 is a stricter classical quotation, one which does not come off well in the art dominant in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and flourishing in the <placeName>United States</placeName> at the hands of <persName>Daniel</persName>
                  <pb n="93"/>

                  <persName>A winged, wreath bearing"goddess</persName>," the spirit of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> rather than <persName>Nike-Victoria</persName>, flies upward, wreath in hand and a torch-bearing Genius in the old <persName>DeWitt Clinton</persName> pose of thought seated on her backs (<ref target="#fig-54">fig. 11</ref>). The odd composition is based on the motif of apotheosis as seen both on Roman imperial sestertii of Sabina (A.D. 135) or the two Faustinas (A.D. 141 and 175) and on the commemorative reliefs which honored the memories of <persName>Hadrian‚Äôs</persName> wife Sabina and the elder Faustina, wife of Antoninus Pius. Somehow, the design, the composition, does not translate into a medal to be given exhibitors and prize-winning artists at a major international fair in 1900. Finally, a small point to be sure, the lettering on obverse and reverse of the second medal is too weak and too close to the edges of the flan. In the appreciations published after Chaplain‚Äôs death on July 13, 1909, his portraits were cited as the glory of his work. Perhaps the ideal qualities of this medal pointed up the weaknesses in the creativity of a sculptor termed"this severe, exact, and powerful artist."<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref>

Specific, famous masterpieces of Greek sculpture come to mind when looking at these matronly ladies holding their great bundles of lictors‚Äô staves or rods, with the axes of supreme power very evident. The seated figure recalls the goddess (Demeter?) from Tarentum in the Berlin Museum,

and the standing personification has been influenced by the famous <hi rend="italic">Lady in a Peplos,</hi> a garment with an overfold (as here on the medal), for many years in the front hall of the American Academy in Rome and now an ornament of the central court of <persName>Isabella Stewart Gardner‚Äôs Museum</persName> in <placeName>Boston‚Äôs</placeName>
                  <persName>Fenway</persName> area.<ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref> Clearly, Sinnock was turning to the same font of up-to-date, academic classicism, early <persName>Greek</persName> and <persName>Etruscan sculpture</persName>, which was inspiring many American sculptors such as Paul Manship, Carl Jennewein or Walker Hancock, who had worked at the American Academy in Rome or who had visited the museums of Italy and Greece and had looked at histories of Greek sculpture illustrated with good photographs.</p>
               <p>A later Congressional medal with a reverse in this modern form of neo-classicism was created by <persName>Frank Gasparro</persName> and <persName>Gilroy Roberts</persName> in 1958 in honor of Vice Admiral <persName>Hyman George Rickover</persName>. A Greek, late severe style"<persName>Herakles</persName>" (in the manner of the sculptor Paul Manship) kneels to the right, extended hands touching one of three elliptical lines which encircle his body. This is the medallic reduction and transformation of those bronze statues of heroes set up around the piazzas of corporate and some public buildings in the 1930s, notably Paul Manship‚Äôs conception of Prometheus set above the skating rink or sunken piazza at Rockefeller Center in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City.</p>
               <p>The totally abstract and the completely conceptual hit <placeName>United States</placeName> medals as well as larger, three-dimensional sculpture after World War II, but forms of classicism or painterly pictorialism remain the most solid fare of medallic art.

               <p>Just as there are many, varied, private monuments in the older cemeteries of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, so there are many different medals from the era of Revolutionary diplomacy and triumph to the celebration of confidence under <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n16">16</ref> Medals public and private had their artistic roots in the pictorialism of painting and the classicism of sculpture. Just as <placeName>French</placeName> and Italian sculptors monumentalized the founding fathers and their buildings, so <placeName>French</placeName> and German medalists had a hand in creating the commemorative numismatics of the new nation. When medallic art became American after the war of 1812, sculptors in stone were ready to create abroad, in Italy where marble was good and skilled finishers plentiful, and to train or inspire the local carvers in the parks and cemeteries of

the homeland. From this time, coincidental with <persName>Victoria‚Äôs</persName> advent on the throne of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, the arts of the medal, the marble (later bronze) relief or statue, and the grand engravings after great paintings were interwoven.</p>
               <p>The character of classicism became more refined as the pupils of <persName>AugustusSaint-Gaudens</persName> turned to medals from the late 1880s onward. <persName>John Ruskin</persName> and <persName>Charles</persName> Eliot Norton brought the world of the Italian Quattrocento, notably <persName>Pisanello</persName> or <persName>Donatello</persName>, into American art. The peopled architectural drawings of <persName>Henry and Francis H. Bacon</persName> for the Assos excavations of the early 1880s made an influential mark in the architectural settings of <persName>F.H. Bacon‚Äôs cousin Henry Bacon</persName>, in the sculptures of <persName>Daniel Chester</persName>
                  <placeName>French</placeName> and in the allegorical figures on the medals of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By 1900, American sculpture, including the medal, was embarked on a sophisticated path which has extended, with variations, to modern times.<ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref>

            <p>The formation and use of a medals collection for an American public institution during the Beaux-Arts era is exemplified uniquely by the theories and practices of <persName>John Cotton Dana</persName>. Pioneering librarian and innovative museum director, Dana was essentially a great educator. His ideas were perfectly suited to interest the public of a thriving industrial city and the <placeName>Newark Museum</placeName> was his own creation.<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> The theories he introduced at Newark in the early years of the twentieth century influenced the direction of libraries and museums throughout <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Certain aspects of <persName>Dana‚Äôs philosophy</persName> were put into practice in the field of medals. Here he involved the <persName>Newark-born sculptor</persName>, <persName>John Flanagan</persName>, and a local medal manufacturer, <persName>Chester R. Hoag</persName>, of the firm of Whitehead &amp; <persName>Hoag</persName>. <persName>Dana</persName> was a man of many words, very quotable; a colorful public figure about whom much has been written. <persName>Flanagan</persName> was a successful sculptor, active and recognized throughout a long life. The Whitehead &amp; Hoag Company, closely associated with the Museum since its founding, mass-produced medals, badges and novelties on an international scale.</p>
            <p>Exhibitions of 1910 and 1928 illustrate how medals could be used successfully for education and enjoyment in a general museum of"art, science, technology and history." Museum archives contain particular information regarding loans, gifts and purchases. These often-overlooked references reveal many of <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> personal insights as to how he worked to build his ideal museum collection of medals and use it for the common good.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>Newark Museum‚Äôs</placeName> participation in the American Numismatic Society‚Äôs 1987 conference on"The Medal in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>" and its accompanying exhibition brings us full circle. The"International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals," hosted by the Society from March 9 through April 1, 1910, provided <persName>Dana</persName> with an unparalleled survey of the field: its history, techniques of manufacture and its contemporary artists. <persName>Dana</persName> was well aware of the activities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> institutions. The ANS‚Äôs major exhibition and its detailed, illustrated catalogue had both an immediate and long-lasting influence, one which, to his credit, Dana acknowledged.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The exhibition, however, was a summary of Beaux-Arts styles here and abroad without a full introduction to modernism such as the Armory Show would present only three years later. Nonetheless, by the end of 1910, the <placeName>Newark Museum</placeName> had shown medals by at least nine American artists<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref> represented in the Society‚Äôs exhibition and, in January 1911, it had purchased twelve examples for its permanent collection, some perhaps the very works illustrated in the Society‚Äôs catalogue.<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="103"/>
            <p>One of <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> talents was his ability to involve people in certain activities which he administered. <persName>John Flanagan</persName>, one of the finest medalists of the Beaux-Arts period, was closely associated with the NM throughout his life. There are more than 70 of his art works in the collection because <persName>Dana</persName> firmly believed that American artists should be promoted over <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>ans. The long acquaintance of <persName>Dana</persName> and <persName>Flanagan</persName> must have begun in 1902 since <persName>John Cotton</persName> and <persName>Nadine Dana</persName> came to Newark in January of that year and Flanagan returned home from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> some months later.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>There are three medallic portraits of <persName>Dana</persName> by <persName>Flanagan</persName>, based on life sketches and commemorating Dana‚Äôs accomplishments. One, a bronze galvano plaque, is a typical Flanagan profile, certainly part of his series of portraits of friends, fellow artists and distinguished persons (<ref target="#fig-56">fig. 1</ref>). Dated 1933, this is posthumous (<persName>Dana</persName> died in 1929) and made at the request of <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> friend, <persName>Henry Watson Kent</persName> of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<ref target="#CH6-n5">5</ref> In 1942 <persName>Kent</persName> presented a replica to the Century Club where he and <persName>Dana</persName> had been members. Because
<pb n="104"/>
the portrait shows an aged <persName>Dana</persName>, it is difficult to reconcile this portrayal with the sharpness and vigor in the catalogue description of the Century Association‚Äôs collection:
<q>
                  <persName>Dana</persName>, a hell-fire Puritan from Vermont, did more than any other man to attract Americans into museums. He sharpened his language by studying law and then formed his philosophy of public service by working in libraries to"put the right books in the right hands at the right time." As the organizer of The <placeName>Newark Museum</placeName>, he lambasted"that popular ideal, the classical building of a museum of art, filled with rare and costly objects. It adds to its inutility a certain power for harm.... Objects do not make a ‚Äòmuseum,‚Äô they merely form a ‚Äòcollection.‚Äô<ref target="#CH6-n6">6</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Other portraits of <persName>Dana</persName> were produced for the new <placeName>Newark Museum</placeName> building, dedicated in 1925 when, because of the growth of collections and activities, the museum became an entity separate from the library. The new building was only a block away and <persName>Dana</persName> continued as administrator of both institutions. A large bronze plaque to him was installed near the main entrance.</p>
            <p>A companion piece, also by <persName>Flanagan</persName>, shows <persName>Louis Bamberger</persName> who donated the bulding at a cost of an estimated $750,000. (Bamberger‚Äîa"merchant prince" of Newark‚Äîwas one of <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> most ardent supporters from the business world.) The original Flanagan sketches were also used in the creation of small bronze plaquettes of <persName>Dana</persName> and <persName>Bamberger</persName> which served as souvenirs of the dedication of the building. Like the larger plaques, they were struck in 1928 and 1925 respectively. The plaquettes were by the Medallic Art Company which made many of Flanagan‚Äôs works. They were issued approximately in the same number and materials and sold at the same prices: <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> unique gold piece at $230; 12 silver pieces at $12; and 200 bronze at $2.60 each.<ref target="#CH6-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> library career began in <persName>Denver</persName>, <placeName>Colorado</placeName>; there he introduced new concepts, such as open book stacks so that visitors could browse freely. Use of the library rose dramatically and news of <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> innovations received wide notice. Although he had no formal training in the field, he was elected president of the American Library Association in 1895. He soon moved to Springfield, MA, where a large library functioned with museums of science and art. Dissatisfaction developed over the administration of the museums, and <persName>Dana</persName> resigned to accept the position of librarian at the Free Public Library in Newark. He came at age 46, his ideas and philosophy of education fully matured. It is quite possible he arrived with the very idea of establishing a museum.</p>
            <pb n="105"/>
            <p>
               <persName>Newark</persName> at the turn of the century was the major city in <persName>New Jersey</persName>. Its population nearly doubled between 1890 and 1900, with skilled and unskilled workers of diverse nationalities. When two library trustees journeyed to Springfield to offer <persName>Dana</persName> the position of librarian, one warned him that <persName>Newark</persName> was neither a book-reading community nor a library center. <persName>Dana</persName> replied,"Let‚Äôs make it both."<ref target="#CH6-n8">8</ref> When he arrived in Newark"he found a city of 23 square miles, with a population of 300,000 and only one public high school."<ref target="#CH6-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The era of peace and prosperity following the Civil War brought to <persName>Newark</persName>, as to many American cities, a generation of monied families whose businesses and homes were in the city. Many traveled abroad, acquired collections and became patrons of the arts. In spite of close proximity to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, there was a growing desire to have their own public cultural institutions. Pride and some gratitude for their prosperity prompted an interest in donating statues and buildings to beautify the city‚Äôs public parks and avenues. There was a spirit of new beginning and adventure with the arrival of a new century.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dana</persName> assumed his position in a library building completed only in the previous year. He must have approved of its Renaissance style because it was not as forbidding as the classical, which suggested to him an aloof, bank-like stronghold. Also, the library as a public institution was readily accessible, located in a small park; not isolated, but downtown on one of the city‚Äôs main arteries.</p>
            <p>Understandably, <persName>Flanagan</persName> was awarded the commission to create a large sculpture in high relief to be placed over the main door of the library. He was the only <persName>Newark</persName>-born sculptor to supply statuary for the city. <persName>Dana</persName> never failed to point out the international success of this local artist, the"foremost medalist in this country,"<ref target="#CH6-n10">10</ref> and use it as a source of civic pride. <hi rend="italic">Wisdom Instructing the Children of Men,</hi> was installed on the library facade in 1909.</p>
            <p>For his staff, <persName>Dana</persName> intentionally chose persons who had little formal training and thus could easily break with tradition and be receptive to his unusual ideas. His most able assistant was Beatrice Winser, who assumed the routine duties of running both library and museum. (Much of Flanagan‚Äôs correspondence was therefore with Miss Winser.) At <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> death, she became director and carried on his policies. Others on <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> staff were apprentices who learned the profession by working in all departments. <persName>Dorothy Dudley</persName> of the Apprentice Class of 1925/26, became a member of the Exhibits Department and was in charge of the"Medals Made in Newark" exhibition of 1928. With <persName>Dana</persName> as editor and coauthor, she also produced
<pb n="106"/>
an illustrated booklet for the show.<ref target="#CH6-n11">11</ref> From <persName>Newark</persName>, she went on to a distinguished career at the Museum of Modern Art in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> where she served as registrar for 33 years.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> Board of Trustees, made up of interested citizens, generally supported his innovations. With <persName>Dana</persName> as librarian, a wide variety of contacts and activities reached out into all areas of the community. Constantly writing and speaking, <persName>Dana</persName> publicized the institution in awareness of the value of public relations. In general, this was greeted with appreciation and enthusiasm, especially when the success of the"new" library received national recognition. Among his later credits were:"citizen" who"helped to create our greater city" and who"blazed intellectual trails in culture, education and industry."<ref target="#CH6-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>From the beginning, the library had informally exhibited objects in its public rooms. Fortuitously, the top floors of the building (accessible by elevator) were not yet needed for the library‚Äôs literary collections and thus were available for meeting rooms and galleries. Approximately a third of the fourth floor was devoted to science. Three other rooms became art galleries for changing exhibitions. At first, by necessity, these were largely objects on loan from trustees, members and local collectors. Clubs, institutions, businesses and individuals were invited to participate. The exhibitions were well received and the library‚Äôs own collection grew by gift and purchase. With the city‚Äôs blessing, the <placeName>Newark Museum</placeName> Association was formed on April 29, 1909.</p>
            <p>An especially ambitious undertaking was the milestone 1912"Modern German Applied Arts" (Werkbund Exhibit of Industrial and Applied Art), the first museum showing in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> of an industrial art exhibition. <persName>Dana</persName> brought to <persName>Newark</persName> more than 1,300 objects, created by contemporary artists and craftsmen in Germany and Austri, which traveled to museums in five other American cities. <persName>Dana</persName> had long advocated the theory that beauty can be found in everyday objects. He was now established as the major museum proponent of the need for a close relationship between the artist and the manufacturer.<ref target="#CH6-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The average exhibition contained a variety of objects shown tastefully in combination. Installation provided a simple unobtrusive background, the colors pale and the materials plain so that they could be reused without costly, time-consuming changes. Exhibition cases and furniture were sturdy golden oak"library bureau," still in use today. Several of the cases were donated, along with medals, by <persName corresp="#viaf_92873758">Whitehead</persName> &amp; <persName>Hoag</persName>.<ref target="#CH6-n14">14</ref> Objects were always well labeled, and inexpensive booklists, checklists or small, easily-carried
<pb n="107"/>
catalogues usually guided visitors through the exhibition and led on to additional information about the objects. Printed material, considered a vital supplement, was often produced in the library‚Äôs printshop under Dana‚Äôs direction. Especially important were posters displayed throughout the building to advertise current exhibitions.</p>
            <p>A view of an exhibition held in the center court of the museum building shows a variety of objects from different cultures arranged together (<ref target="#fig-57">fig. 2</ref>). Openness and accessibility allowed a visitor to be free to browse at will (as he could in open stacks of the library) and make discoveries on his own.
<q>...The court exhibits change frequently. Tables spread with all manner of museum news and periodical literature invite those who would rest and read. Rugs laid on the marble court add an inviting and home-like air.<ref target="#CH6-n15">15</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The cases in the foreground, grouped where they could receive the most natural light, are filled with medals and coins. These were easily installed, in their storage boxes, already labeled, and were raised on bases to be nearer the glass for closer study. Thus <persName>Dana</persName> attempted to create a pleasant welcoming environment in his new kind of museum. The general public could enjoy discovering and learning about objects, such as medals, too often hidden away in a cabinet by an individual collector.</p>

            <p>Medals were included from the beginning in these changing exhibitions and in the growing collections of objects acquired by gift or purchase. Many came directly from the artist or manufacturer,
<pb n="108"/>
chosen specifically for the museum‚Äôs use. Two examples, or clich√© strikes, were often supplied so that both sides could be seen on exhibition. Small in size, produced in quantity and variety, medals could be easily accommodated in limited gallery, storage and installation facilities. <persName>Dana</persName> often combined them with bronzes, coins and gem stones. He saw them as miniature art works often representing eminent artists when larger, more costly examples were beyond his budget. Certainly, he was most interested in these objects for their craftsmanship, manufacture and for the patterns of words and letters in their designs. He was personally more interested in medals as illustrative of a country‚Äôs culture or history than as fine art per se.<ref target="#CH6-n16">16</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1910 the focus was particularly on medals, with at least two exhibitions including them (this no doubt due to the ANS‚Äôs large exhibition)."A Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Bronzes" was held from February 25 to March 11. <persName>Gutzon Borglum</persName>, <persName>Victor D. Brenner</persName> and <persName>John Flanagan</persName> were represented by medals as well as by other sculpture including casts and marbles. (These artists, with Chester Beach, <persName>Eli Harvey</persName> and Isidore Konti, were also represented in the ANS exhibition.) All of the artists were currently living in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> although some were foreign-born and many foreign-trained. It was stated in the catalogue that the works were lent by the artists themselves and that many were for sale with prices on application. Attendance at the exhibition totaled 4,631.<ref target="#CH6-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A more comprehensive survey of medals was included in the exhibition of December 6, 1910, to January 15,1911. The poster read in part:
<q>AN EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS &amp; OTHER OBJECTS OF ART: 52 American paintings....Samples of the Work of American Potters and of <placeName>French</placeName> &amp; American Medalists; Hand-wrought Jewelry; Lenox China;Oriental Rugs; Portrait Coins; Pottery &amp; Porcelain lent by a Newark Collector....<ref target="#CH6-n18">18</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>More than 325 medals were borrowed from 14 Newark and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> lenders.<ref target="#CH6-n19">19</ref> Supplementing the 16"modern medals struck at the <placeName>French</placeName> Mint" from the library‚Äôs collection<ref target="#CH6-n20">20</ref> were 150 <placeName>French</placeName> medals from the Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration. The loan and a visit from <persName>Dana</persName> are described from Cooper Union‚Äôs point of view in their 1911 <hi rend="italic">Annual Report:</hi>

In this way, by...temporary loans, the Cooper Union Museum should become a center for assisting the formation of similar museums throughout the <placeName>United States</placeName>. The visits of many Curators and Librarians from all parts of the country have made this year interesting. The Librarian of the Newark Free Public Library listed the numbers of casts of bronze locks, knobs, etc., made by the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, for purchasing similar ones for Newark.<ref target="#CH6-n21">21</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Several of the lenders of the American medals were to become closely involved with the museum and many of the loans became purchases or gifts. <persName>Dr. William</persName>
               <persName>S. Disbrow lent</persName> an undetermined number of portrait medals of men of science and medical medals; his large science collection (already on view in the library) and his numismatic collection would come to the museum in 1919 and 1922. The 57 medals struck by the Whitehead &amp; Hoag Company"after designs by <persName>Bela L. Pratt</persName> and others" and five pieces"illustrating the process of making a medal"<ref target="#CH6-n22">22</ref> would be only part of large donations steadily received from this important local industry. <persName>Chester R. Hoag</persName>, an original partner in the company, was one of the first trustees and was president of the Association 1920-25. <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> long and friendly correspondence with <persName>Mr. Hoag</persName> began with the first exhibitions and continued until <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> death in 1929. Some letters reveal <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> personal ideas about the museum‚Äôs activities.<ref target="#CH6-n23">23</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The 10 American medalists lent 61 pieces"nearly all secured through the kind offices of <persName>Mr. John Flanagan</persName>."<ref target="#CH6-n24">24</ref> A letter from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> dated January 13,1911, from <persName>Flanagan</persName> to <persName>Dana</persName>, illustrates that he was already directly involved as a contact with other artists:</p>

            <p>By these means, <persName>Dana</persName> provided practical and active support for living American artists by giving their works exposure in exhibition, making price lists available and by purchasing works for the collection. He preferred to acquire objects directly from the artists whenever possible and was able in some instances to acquire study or experimental pieces which often had more of the artist‚Äôs personal creativity than the final work. An example is Flanagan‚Äôs <hi rend="italic">The Delver </hi>medallion, a sketch for the reverse of the Essex Agricultural Society of Massachusetts medal, 1913 (<ref target="#fig-58">fig. 3</ref>)<ref target="#CH6-n27">27</ref> To support these artists was the responsibility of a public museum and although he said he could not understand modernism, <persName>Dana</persName> felt strongly that the new styles should be shown at Newark:
<q>...in this world of change I am convinced that the institutions in my charge must see and feel and respond to the world‚Äôs changes...there is always hope that the new is good and helpful and let us help it find itself.<ref target="#CH6-n28">28</ref>
               </q>
            </p>

            <p>Also purchased early in 1911 as a result of the 1910 exhibitions were 84 <placeName>French</placeName> medals costing $220. These were almost entirely bronze copies from the Monnaie de Paris acquired through <persName>George</persName>
               <persName>E. Stechert</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>.<ref target="#CH6-n29">29</ref> No doubt these were similar to those
<pb n="111"/>
borrowed from Cooper Union. Certainly, too, the ANS exhibition had shown the great influence of the <placeName>French</placeName> on recent medallic art.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dana</persName> was not ashamed to acquire and use less-costly replicas or restrikes along with the authentic. In 1912 he wrote to his secretary from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> asking her to inform the president of the Museum Association regarding the recent purchases:
<q>I have tried to have in mind what I think to be his ideas...."Applied Art," replicas at moderate prices, many kinds with the hope of interesting many minds. When we are rich we will buy <hi rend="italic">real</hi> things.<ref target="#CH6-n30">30</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He continually sought out, often on his travels overseas, objects which illustrated the common, everyday life and culture of the people. These would be used particularly in the lending collection, developed from the library‚Äôs lending out of books and other printed material. Most of these objects were meant to be handled and examined closely, even by school children, who could thus gain an experience not possible in the usual museum exhibition. Coins and medals were ideal for this purpose. While in Rome in 1912, Dana purchased five replicas of Italian medals in terra cotta and 100 sulphur replicas of coins of the Roman Empire:"Strong, almost unbreakable. Can be freely handled. Color of originals."<ref target="#CH6-n31">31</ref> Replica or authentic, these objects were seen for their great educational value, for the worth of a museum object is in its use and"beauty has no relation to price, rarity or age."<ref target="#CH6-n32">32</ref> With great success, the lending department also circulated"process exhibits" which explained the manufacturing processes used in local industries. The raw materials, parts and finished products were mounted, complete with labels and illustrations, on charts. Process exhibits were also included in the permanent collection and exhibitions. <persName>Dana</persName> believed that these could encourage visitors of all professions, interests and skills to better appreciate the finished object, whether hand or machine made.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Flanagan</persName> assembled such exhibits for the museum from the artist‚Äôs viewpoint, to illustrate how his medals were made through"...a whole series of models from the sketch to the die."<ref target="#CH6-n33">33</ref> In 1913, a series of eight pieces was acquired which showed the steps in creating the gold medal issued by the <placeName>Penns</placeName>ylvania Society. The particular works were originally issued in 1909 and 1910, and the exhibit was a composite of medals for <persName>Horace Howard Furness</persName> and <persName>Andrew Carnegie</persName>. <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> plaster models were, at his request, supplemented by bronze clich√©s and two steel dies from the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Society itself (<ref target="#fig-59">fig. 4</ref>). The artist asked that these bronzeproofs always be exhibited with his other medals and plaquettes and
<pb n="112"/>
not with the dies, perhaps because there was machine tooling not from his hand of which he did not approve.</p>
            <p>A gift from <persName>Flanagan</persName> in 1914 consisted of two wax models of 1910. These were an interim step not included in the series just described: trial strikes made from the reduced plaster models for the purpose of detecting flaws. The designs were for the Massachusetts Horticultural Society‚Äôs <persName>George Robert</persName> White Medal of Honor, awarded to Charles Sprague Sargent in 1909.</p>
            <p>A particularly interesting and sensitive exhibit consisted of three parts for a galvano plaque made in 1908: a wax model, a negative galvano and the finished galvano plaque (<ref target="#fig-60">fig. 5</ref>). When the finished work was shown in the ANS 1910 exhibition it was titled <hi rend="italic">Portrait of a Man.</hi> When the exhibit was donated to the museum in 1927 Flanagan called it <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Prochaska.</hi> He does not appear to have answered Beatrice Winser‚Äôs question in correspondence,"...who is or was Prochaska?"<ref target="#CH6-n54">54</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>During the late 1920s, as a means of creating civic interest and pride, Dana held several exhibitions calling attention to products made by major city industries. Many of his ideas regarding the use
<pb n="113"/>
of medals culminated in"Medals Made in Newark," held throughout 1928, which featured products of Whitehead &amp; Hoag.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>It was <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> policy to exhibit the same objects over and over in different contexts.<ref target="#CH6-n35">35</ref> Thus many of the objects in the 1910 loan exhibition reappeared here, the majority as gifts and purchases received along with many other acquisitions during the ensuing years. Whitehead &amp; Hoag, for example, had donated more than 130 medals, both of eminent artists and of a more commercial kind. Included were process exhibits which illustrated striking methods and machine production.</p>
            <p>Along with several sets of dies, hubs and finished medals, the Company lent to"Medals Made in Newark" (and later donated) a process exhibit"How Medals are Made."<ref target="#CH6-n36">36</ref> In particular the making of the Lincoln Prize Essay Medal, designed by <persName>Charles Hinton</persName> after portraits by <persName>Leonard W. Volk</persName> and his son, <persName>Douglas Volk</persName> as shown (<ref target="#fig-61">fig. 6</ref>). The Company needed to borrow the dies at times to strike new medals which were still used as awards. The process required for mass-producing a medal was illustrated by 19 objects in plasticine, plaster and bronze, with photos of the machinery required.<ref target="#CH6-n37">37</ref> The objects carried through the process from a copy of the artist‚Äôs large model to the finished medals with different patinations. The illustrated booklet for the exhibition has on its title page one of Dana‚Äôs many dicta:"The good workman is an artist; a good artist is first of all a good workman."<ref target="#CH6-n38">38</ref> The medals process was traced, the history of the medal described and a brief description of the company and its products presented. Both authentic pieces and replicas, coins, medals and gem stones were discussed in relation to the medal. The classical tradition was traced even to work being done

currently in the city. (The <placeName>French</placeName> medals acquired in 1910-11 were illustrated and, even in 1928, continued to be termed"modern".)<ref target="#CH6-n39">39</ref> Complete with a book list compiled by the library, the booklet was typical of <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> publications as a supplement to an exhibition.</p>

museum. A letter of October 20, 1927, to <persName>Mr. Hoag states frankly</persName>:
<q>I am sending you herewith my little pamphlet,"The Industrialist is an Artist," to show you that my interest in matters of this sort is very keen, and that I would much prefer to show a Whitehead &amp; <persName>Hoag</persName> Exhibit than I would an oil painting. This, of course, is between ourselves.<ref target="#CH6-n40">40</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion: <persName>Dana‚Äôs</persName> theories regarding the use of medallic art can be illustrated by <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Portrait of Prochaska</hi> (see above, <ref target="#fig-60">fig. 5</ref>). The plaque lent by the artist to the American Numismatic Society‚Äôs 1910 exhibition had developed into a three-part"process exhibit" by 1927 when donated by him to the <placeName>Newark Museum</placeName>. On loan to the Society‚Äôs 1987-88 Beaux-Arts exhibition, these works<ref target="#CH6-n41">41</ref> show Dana‚Äôs influence in an American museum dedicated to public education.</p>

            <p>While instrumental in the formation of the contemporary American medal collection at The <placeName>Newark Museum</placeName> under the direction of <persName>John Cotton Dana</persName>, <persName>John Flanagan</persName> was more esteemed by fellow artists for his own medallic work. <persName>Frederick W. MacMonnies</persName> considered him"the leading medalist of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>," while <persName>Daniel Chester</persName>
               <placeName>French</placeName> thought that"he was one of the few men who knew all about the technique of medal making.<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> Flanagan was, in essence, a medalist‚Äôs medalist. <persName>Lorado Taft</persName> noted that he was among those who realized"that the designing and elaboration of a good medal represents as much study as the making of a statue."<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> Although Flanagan received numerous commissions for public sculpture and portrait busts throughout his productive career, it was ultimately his medals which established his reputation here and abroad as an important American Beaux-Arts sculptor.</p>

               <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> first medals were executed in Paris at the turn of the century. Among his most successful medallic works from this period are his portraits of <persName>Mabel Clarke</persName> (1895-98; <ref target="#fig-62">fig. 1</ref>), and <persName>Hortense Lenore Mitchell</persName> (1896-1900; <ref target="#fig-63">fig. 2</ref>), which reveal the sculptor‚Äôs mastery of bas-relief. From the delicate modeling of the women‚Äôs hair to the naturalistic rendering of their dress, it is evident that
<pb n="121"/>
               <persName>Flanagan</persName> was influenced by the work of his teacher, Augustus Saint-Gaudens.</p>

            <p>Born in Newark, NJ on August 4, 1865, <persName>John George Flanagan</persName> was apprenticed to his father, a marble cutter, before he studied modeling in the evenings from 1880 to 1882 at Cooper Union in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. After working briefly for <persName>Truman H. Bartlett</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, <persName>Flanagan</persName> was employed at the <persName>Perth Amboy Terra Cotta</persName> Works in <persName>New Jersey</persName>. At the age of 20, he became Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs studio assistant, while the sculptor was working on his <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Lincoln</persName>, <persName>Puritan</persName>,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shaw Memorial.</hi> One of <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> principal jobs, besides running errands, was to model an American eagle, wings spread, on the back of <persName>Lincoln‚Äôs chair</persName>. In order to do this, he reportedly borrowed a large bird of prey from the zoo in Central Park. During this time <persName>Flanagan</persName> was also enrolled in life classes under <persName>George</persName> de Forest Brush at the Art Students League. Following Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs advice, the young sculptor went to Paris in the spring of 1890 and continued his studies under <persName>Henri Chapu</persName> at the <persName>Acad√©mie Julian</persName> and <persName>Alexandre Falgui√®re</persName> at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where he became a matriculant in July of 1891. At the Ecole, <persName>Flanagan</persName> was awarded

third prize for his figure drawing after the antique.</p>

            <p>During 1891-92 he assisted MacMonnies, also a pupil of Falgui√©re‚Äôs, with his colossal <hi rend="italic">Barge of State</hi> for the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition in Chicago. After a trip to Italy in 1893, <persName>Flanagan</persName> received a commission for a statue entitled <hi rend="italic">Commerce</hi> and a monumental clock for the Rotunda Reading Room of the Library of Congress in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>, D.C. Returning to Paris after a few months in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, he set up a studio at 16 Impasse du Maine, where he lived and worked until 1902.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1898 The Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> commissioned <persName>Flanagan</persName> to design a commemorative medal in honor of <persName>Dr. Garrison Brinton</persName> (<ref target="#fig-54">fig. 3</ref>). <persName>Brinton</persName>, an anthropologist, physician and surgeon, who was also a professor of ethnology and archaeology

in the Academy of Natural Sciences of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, as well as a professor of American linguistics and archaeology at the University of <placeName>Pennsylvania,</placeName> is characteristically portrayed in full beard and period dress. The seal of the Society is represented on the reverse. The owl, perched on the shield, is in strikingly high relief.</p>
            <p>While <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> portrait medallions and plaquettes varied in style during this early period, many were similar in format to the work of the <placeName>French</placeName> medalist <persName>Jules-Cl√©ment Chaplain</persName>, who played an important role in releasing medallic art from the formulas of routine and returning it to a direct study of nature. In his portrait of <persName>Agnes Lane</persName>, 1899 (MMA collection), in particular, <persName>Flanagan</persName> enlarged the head of the figure, heightening the visual impact of the composition.</p>
            <p>At the Paris Salon of 1899, <persName>Flanagan</persName> exhibited several medallions and plaquettes, including a gilded portrait of a young woman. The following year he won a silver medal for his display of portrait medallions at the Paris Exposition Universelle.</p>
            <p>After 12 years working in Paris, <persName>Flanagan</persName> returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in June of 1902 and eventually established a studio on Broadway.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>At this time he also received a commission for a high relief in bronze symbolizing"Wisdom Instructing The Children of Men" for the Free Public Library in Newark.</p>
            <p>One of <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> first medallions upon his arrival home was a portrait of <persName>Walt Whitman</persName>, 1903 (<ref target="#fig-65">fig. 4</ref>), cast by the <persName>Griffoul Foundry in Newark</persName>. Reminiscent of <persName>Thomas Eakin‚Äôs</persName> sensitive photograph of this eminent American poet,<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref> the sculptor also chose to capture Whitman in a contemplative mood; his profile almost lost beneath his flowing beard. In a later medallion, (plaster model, The <placeName>Newark Museum</placeName>; bronze cast, ANS), Whitman is depicted frontally in a more animated fashion. Even though Saint-Gaudens once remarked"that a full face in a medallion was too much for the gods,"<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref>
               <persName>Flanagan</persName> successfully modeled several portraits from this point of view.</p>
            <p>Like many sculptors of the Beaux-Arts school, <persName>Flanagan</persName> also experimented with the color of his bronzes. In his portrait of Leo Tolstoy, 1907, for example, one medal has been gold-plated (<ref target="#fig-66">fig. 5</ref>, Metropolitan Museum of Art), while another has a brown patina (ANS). The degree of surface play varies considerably in these two pieces. While Tolstoy‚Äôs beard shimmers in light and shade in the
<pb n="125"/>
MMA portrait, this sculptural effect is not apparent in the ANS medal.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>In 1904 <persName>Flanagan</persName> began modeling a relief entitled <hi rend="italic">Aphrodite</hi>, which was later carved in marble and tinted for a dining room in the Knickerbocker Hotel in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. Upon seeing this work in <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> studio, Saint-Gaudens wrote to Stanford White,"<persName>Flanagan</persName> has made a beautiful Venus in bas-relief that I thought you would like to see. I think it is really very fine and I volunteered to write to you to go and see it. You might find a chance to place it in some of your houses. In marble or gilded bronze I think it would be swell."<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref> Several years later <persName>Flanagan</persName> took a plaster cast of the head of the panel and made a reduction of it (<ref target="#fig-67">fig. 6</ref>). Portrayed in a seductive manner with loose flowing hair and lips slightly parted, <hi rend="italic">Aphrodite</hi> is the sculptor‚Äôs most impressionistic work.</p>
            <p>Included among <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> many commissions for commemorative works is his medal for The <placeName>Penns</placeName>ylvania Society‚Äôs <persName>Horace Howard Furness Award</persName> for Distinguished Achievement, 1909 (illustrated above, p. 112, <ref target="#fig-65">fig. 4</ref>). The obverse shows a portrait of <persName>William Penn</persName> with appropriate inscription, while on the reverse three nude men symbolic of Character, Force, and Intelligence, are presented a laurel branch by Fame, a draped female

figure. With the development of the Beaux-Arts medal in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, there was greater acceptance of the nude in medallic art as more academically-trained sculptors were drawn to the field. Seventeen years earlier, Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs design for the reverse of the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition medal had been rejected by a Senatorial committee because of the inclusion of a nude youth. Although he attempted several modifications, Saint-Gaudens found no alternative but to redesign the medal excluding the figure altogether.</p>
            <p>Also in 1909, the newly-established Circle of Friends of The Medallion asked <persName>Flanagan</persName> to design their first medal commemorating the <persName>Hudson-Fulton</persName> Celebration (ANS). The circle, led by the poet and literary figure, <persName>Charles de Kay</persName>, was formed"to encourage in the public a taste for small sculptures and especially bas-reliefs." For the obverse <persName>Flanagan</persName> modeled a double portrait of <persName>Henry Hudson</persName> and <persName>Robert Fulton</persName>. On the reverse a figure of a nymph recumbent on a cloud holds a light bulb aloft, rather than a torch, representing the present age of electricity. She gazes down upon the vessels of the two voyagers, the <hi rend="italic">Half Moon</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Clermont.</hi>"Past and present are knit together; three centuries are suggested in one small bronze."<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>For the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, <persName>Flanagan</persName> designed the <persName>George Robert</persName> White Medal of Honor in 1910 (ANS). The medal demonstrates how well the sculptor could fit any theme within a circular format. On the obverse a young horticulturist kneels to plant a tiny tree on the grounds of a public park or a private estate, where there is an elaborate gazebo or a greenhouse depicted in the background. As Cornelius Vermeule observed so well, writing in 1971,"the sense of mission, of repose, and of manicured nature in this vista is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the medal and the tastes of those who sponsored it."<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> The weight of the inscription, on the reverse, is carefully balanced with an elaborate bouquet of fruits and flowers.</p>
            <p>In 1912 <persName>Flanagan</persName> was voted by the <placeName>United States</placeName> Congress to design a gold medal in honor of the British captain, <persName>Arthur Henry Rostron</persName>, whose crew rescued survivors of the <hi rend="italic">Titanic</hi> in the mid-Atlantic (<ref target="#fig-68">fig. 7</ref>). Rostron‚Äôs portrait, modeled from life, and the explanatory legend fills the obverse, while the reverse symbolically depicts the heroic rescue at sea.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref>
               <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> muscular figures were most likely inspired by Michelangelo‚Äôs powerful forms in the Sistine Chapel, which he saw on his trip to Italy.<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref> A lifeline has been thrown to a man and woman floating in the water as jagged icebergs loom in the background. The date of the rescue is inscribed above.</p>

                  <persName>The Delver</persName>,</hi> (illustrated above, p. 110, <ref target="#fig-54">fig. 3</ref>). In an interview with <persName>DeWitt M. Lockman</persName>, the sculptor stated that he always used models as much as possible for his medals.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> skill in modeling the nude form is also evident on the reverse of the award medal he designed for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> in 1915 (ANS). Seemingly weightless male and female figures are shown facing one another, each extends a hand to the other. In the background the sun is shining and billowy clouds fill the sky. The symbolism of the figures, however, representing the union of the two seas between the Isthmus of Panama, was found questionable at the time.<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Probably the most familiar of <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> medals are his portraits of artist friends, which he began in 1917 with the <persName>sculptor Paul Wayland Bartlett</persName> (<ref target="#fig-69">fig. 8</ref>). Like Saint-Gaudens before him, <persName>Flanagan</persName> looked to his colleagues as subjects for his own work. His portraits, however, are more classically restrained than Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs reliefs, which are more spontaneous in quality. With the"Bartlett," in particular, <persName>Flanagan</persName> has simplified the head in favor of linear clarity.</p>
            <p>His plaquette of the painter <persName>Julian Alden Weir</persName>, 1919 (<ref target="#fig-70">fig. 9</ref>), has been called"the masterpiece of medallic portraiture."<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> Weir‚Äôs mature head is superbly crafted, successfully evoking the character of the sitter. <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> ability to capture a likeness, as well as the personality in clay, is evident in his other portraits, most notably of <persName>Walter Griffin</persName>, <persName>Joseph Pennell</persName>, <persName>Daniel Chester</persName>
               <placeName>French</placeName>, and <persName>Childe Hassam</persName> (all Brooklyn Museum).</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Flanagan</persName> also executed portrait medals of <persName>Frederick W. MacMonnies</persName>, 1929 (ANS) and Augustus Saint-Gaudens, 1934 (ANS); the latter was later reduced by the Medallic Art Co. to commemorate a dinner on April 9, 1937, in honor of the sculptor.</p>
            <p>With his medal for the Garden Club of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, 1920 (ANS), <persName>Flanagan</persName> once again found a coherent solution to a difficult thematic problem. On the obverse a woman is depicted in a natural position tending her flowers. The curve of her back gracefully echoes the contour of the medal. On the reverse a simple but elegant floral motif surrounds a plaque bearing the recipient‚Äôs name.</p>
            <p>The following year <persName>Flanagan</persName> received his most important commission: The Verdun Medal, 1921 (<ref target="#fig-71">fig. 10</ref>). The gold medal was presented to the people of Verdun by the <placeName>United States</placeName> government in recognition of the heroic defense of their city during World War I. A competition was arranged by a congressional committee, which asked sculptors <persName corresp="#viaf_13127761">Paul Manship</persName>, <persName>Chester Beach</persName>, <persName>Sherry Fry</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_96004462">Anthony de Francisci</persName>, <persName>Robert Aitken</persName>, <persName>John Flanagan</persName>, <persName>Henry Hering</persName> and <persName>Anna V. Hyatt</persName>, to submit a plaster model according to a suggested design.</p>

            <pb n="132"/>
            <p>While the design of the obverse of the medal was left to the artist, it had to bear the inscription"From the people of the <placeName>United States</placeName> to the City of Verdun;" the reverse had also to include a representation of the Porte Chaus√©e of Verdun with the inscription"Ils ne passeront pas"‚Äîthe cry of the <placeName>French</placeName> troops under General P√©tain. After carefully inspecting each model without knowing the identity of the artist, the Committee of Fine Arts, which included <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName> and invited guests <persName>Daniel Chester</persName>
               <placeName>French</placeName> and <persName>Herbert Adams</persName>, unanimously selected <persName>Flanagan‚Äôs</persName> work. His design was chosen for its simplicity and innovative use of the motto even though it did not strictly conform to the committee‚Äôs suggestions.<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1922 <persName>Flanagan</persName>s received the prestigious <persName>J. Sanford Saltus Award</persName> from the American Numismatic Society in recognition of his artistic achievement in the field of medals.</p>
            <p>After working on several commissions for public sculpture, <persName>Flanagan</persName> remodeled <hi rend="italic">Aphrodite</hi> for the obverse of a medal issued by the Society of Medalists in November 1932 (<ref target="#fig-72">fig. 11</ref>). The goddess of love now flirtatiously plays with a string of pearls, and her identity is clearly stated. The reverse depicts the Lampadedromy, a race run in ancient Greece to honor such gods as Prometheus, Athena, and Hephaestus. Two athletes are shown passing the torch; one has just collapsed in exhaustion. Movement is cleverly suggested here by the men‚Äôs swirling drapery as well as the steep incline awaiting the next runner. <persName>Flanagan</persName> had previously used this motif on his clock for the Library of Congress.</p>
            <p>Having modeled medals for almost 50 years and having exhibited them in all the major expositions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, Flanagan became internationally known for his work, as his numerous awards and citations proved. After a long illness, he died in a welfare hospital in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> on March 28, 1952.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref> Although his obituary in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Times</hi> credited him first as the designer of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> bicentennial quarter, still minted today, <persName>Flanagan</persName> should be remembered foremost as an important sculptor of medals.</p>

            <q>The beautiful artistic possibilities involved in the designing of medals have been almost completely ignored in this country.... The trouble has been that they have been simply manufactured; the fact that they may be made the vehicle of an expression of artistic skill peculiarly their own has been lost sight of. Their genesis has been little nobler than that of buttons.... What an excellent thing it would be if this beautiful medal should awake a vivid interest among us in the Glyptic Art. Whenever art has flourished, it has been one of the by-paths to

which sculptors turned partly for recreation, partly for the secrets of decorative expression which it revealed.<ref target="#CH8-n1">1</ref>
            </q>
            <p>That Caffin wrote so positively about <placeName>French</placeName> is a tribute as much to his growing national reputation as monument maker as it is to his potential as a numismatist. By this time he had produced just two designs‚Äîthe <persName>Dewey</persName> and a medal for the Architectural League of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-73">fig. 1</ref>).<ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is not documented how <placeName>French</placeName> learned of the D<persName>ewey project</persName> but on June 3, 1898, Public Resolution No. 38 passed Congress, authorizing the Secretary of the Navy:
<q>To cause to be struck bronze medals commemorating the battle of Manila Bay, and to distribute such medals to the officers and men of the ships of the Asiatic Squadron of the <placeName>United States</placeName> under command of Commodore <persName>George Dewey</persName> on May first, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight....<ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps the offered fee of $7,000 provided sufficient incentive. But more likely <placeName>French</placeName> became involved because as president of the National Sculpture Society he was active in efforts, both in and out of government circles, to improve the design of American coinage.<ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref>

            <p>A three-member Board comprising <persName>Charles H. Allen</persName> (president), Senator <persName>Henry C. Lodge</persName> and <placeName>United States</placeName> Naval Academy professor, <persName>Marshall Oliver</persName>, was appointed by the Secretary of the Navy.<ref target="#CH8-n5">5</ref> Almost immediately they must have contacted <placeName>French</placeName>, learned of his terms for undertaking the work and agreed to permit him to make a design. Apparently there was no formal competition but at least 34 proposals were received.<ref target="#CH8-n6">6</ref> That <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> actual numismatic experience was the 1896 President‚Äôs prize medal for the Architectural League did not seem to matter; his credentials as a punctual public monument maker were sufficient.</p>
            <p>By July 18, 1898, he began his first sketch and on August 16, he wrote in his diary that designs were completed.<ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref> By August 27, 1898, the duplicate plasters of the sketches were sent to Oliver and to <persName>Allen</persName> and they were formally approved by October 7.<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> The first design for the obverse has not survived but the first model for the reverse has been located in a private collection (<ref target="#fig-74">fig. 2</ref>). It is a study of a shirtless sailor‚Äî<placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> first executed ideal male figure, albeit at considerably under-lifesize scale.</p>
            <p>As a profile portrait, the likeness of <persName>George Dewey</persName> (<ref target="#fig-75">fig. 3</ref>) is certainly adequate. The head is erect, the contour of the face well modeled. The curve of the shoulder and chest terminus is nicely balanced with the outer edge of the medal, which is marked by a series of decorative beads. The necessary lettering surrounds the head unobtrusively. It was only after he had submitted the "official" design, promised by December 15, 1898, but not delivered until January 2,1899, that a problem was noticed. On January 6 <placeName>French</placeName> wrote to <persName>Allen</persName>:
<q>The mistake concerning the title will be rectified and I will send you another cast with the correction made. I shall also of course change the stars, if you wish it, but may I venture the suggestion that the insignia of the rank which was given Commodore Dewey in honor of his great victory, might very properly appear upon the medal struck to commemorate it?<ref target="#CH8-n9">9</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Although he was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral just three weeks after the battle, the Navy preferred that the medal give Dewey‚Äôs rank as Commodore. <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> idea was quietly ignored.</p>
            <p>The obverse portrait, which critic Caffin praised as "excellent"<ref target="#CH8-n10">10</ref> was probably not changed appreciably between August and January. But the design of the reverse (<ref target="#fig-76">fig. 4</ref>) was modified. <placeName>French</placeName> explained his first model on August 24, 1898:</p>
            <q>The specifications also called for a figure of Victory on the reverse and here I have taken the liberty of substituting for the conventional female figure, the figure of a sailor in fighting costume.</q>

            <q>"The man behind the gun" has occupied so prominent a position in the late war that it seems proper that he should be represented and certainly our sailor is the embodiment of Victory in most peoples‚Äô minds just now.<ref target="#CH8-n11">11</ref>
            </q>
            <p>By October 16, 1898, <placeName>French</placeName> reported to his brother that he still had not finished the design.<ref target="#CH8-n12">12</ref> The reason was the sculptor‚Äôs decision to rework the composition on his own initiative.</p>
            <p>The young sailor and the cannon barrel on which he sits are constant in both concepts. The preliminary design (see above, <ref target="#fig-74">fig. 2</ref>) with its marvelously-foreshortened cannon and the jutting diagonal of the right knee, seems overly large and too active for the circular space. In the final design for the reverse (see above, <ref target="#fig-76">fig. 4</ref>), the figure has been subdued; it is more frontally, and for <placeName>French</placeName>, more consistently posed. The cannon, slightly tilted, is now parallel to the surface plane, the flag more evenly draped across his lap. The flagpole now becomes the unifying compositional element. It divides the lettering around the circumference and isolates the sailor‚Äôs torso and face in uncluttered background of the upper half of the medal.</p>
            <p>In the placement of the feet <placeName>French</placeName> moves easily between the necessary details of story telling and decorative design. The right foot is posed on a floating rope fragment that has no apparent beginning or end. The sailor‚Äôs left foot rests on the plaque which is a functional part of the medal; it is not a detail found on the deck of a naval vessel. This juxtaposition of narrative elements with design requirements is successfully repeated twice more‚Äîsuperimposing the sailor‚Äôs head over the letter T in the word Victory and the continuation of one stem of the letter M in Memory into the flagpole. <placeName>French</placeName> made a final change when he corrected Dewey‚Äôs rank on the obverse; he replaced the sailor‚Äôs cap with a scarf (<ref target="#fig-77">fig. 5</ref>).</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>French</placeName> and the Department of the Navy signed a contract on January 19, 1899, and the medal was struck by the Tiffany Company in July 1899, in two sizes‚Äîthree inch diameter bronzes for the "notables" and one and ll/l6th inch reductions for the 1,634 sailors and Marines who served during the short-lived Battle of Manila Bay on May 1,1898 (<ref target="#fig-78">fig.6</ref>).</p>
            <p>The <persName>Dewey</persName> story has two more tangential chapters. The first involves <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City‚Äôs celebration of <persName>George Dewey‚Äôs</persName> military exploits, September 28-30, 1899. As a member of the National Sculpture Society and its recent past president, <placeName>French</placeName> was invited to make one of the sculptural groups for architect <persName>Charles Lamb‚Äôs Dewey Triumphal Arch</persName> which spanned Fifth Avenue at Broadway

and 23rd Street. <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> subject was <hi rend="italic">Peace</hi> (<ref target="#fig-79">fig. 7</ref>), and was paired with Philip Martiny‚Äôs <hi rend="italic">Call to Arms.</hi>
               <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> group was modeled in the spring of 1899, with the actual enlargement and production in staff (hemp-reenforced plaster) for his and all of the sculptural decorations completed in less than two months. The group of the mother and young child dressed in a sailor‚Äôs suit documents an appropriate reuse of <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> profile portrait of <persName>Admiral Dewey</persName>.</p>

            <p>The second involves <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> manufacture of a commemorative plaque (<ref target="#fig-79">fig. 8</ref>) for <persName>Dewey‚Äôs flagship</persName>, the <hi rend="italic">Olympia,</hi> a project commissioned by the State of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> and citizens of the state capital in 1898 and placed on the ship before it entered <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Harbor in September 1899. The nearly floating allegory, holding Dewey‚Äôs rather prosaic utterance that began the lopsided battle in the Phillipines, "Gridley you may fire when ready," seems more like Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs <hi rend="italic">Amor Caritas</hi> with its billowing gown than <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> normal, more refined drapery treatment in the figure of <hi rend="italic">Wisdom, </hi>one of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Public Library doors.<ref target="#CH8-n13">13</ref>

            <p>
               <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> next foray in the medallic arena came in the summer of 1917, when he was asked to make a medal (<ref target="#fig-80">fig. 9</ref>) to commemorate the visit of the <placeName>French</placeName> and British War Commission to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, May 7-10, 1917. <persName>Mayor John P</persName>. <persName>Mitchell</persName> appointed a citizens‚Äô committee to plan the celebration. That summer, the Committee on Decorations proposed issuing a commemorative medal‚Äîstruck in gold for the two English visitors, two <placeName>French</placeName> delegates and <persName>Mayor Mitchell</persName>, and subsequently in bronze and silver for members of the

            <p>
               <placeName>French</placeName> was only interested in the project if he could seek the assistance of a helper. In this instance, Evelyn Beatrice Longman designed the group on the reverse, portraying the inspiration of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> as symbolized by <persName>Joan of Arc</persName>, the chivalry of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> as a medieval knight and American Liberty.</p>
            <p>The obverse shows <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> portrayal of Victory (<ref target="#fig-82">fig. 10</ref>), wearing a "modified" trench helmet that is covered with a sprig of oak leaves, a lily and a cluster of pine needles. The profile on the obverse is one of <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> most exquisite female portrait heads and its source was the recently-completed head of the Spirit of Life, the principal feature of the <hi rend="italic">Spencer Trask Memorial</hi> located in Saratoga Springs, NY. Obviously <placeName>French</placeName> was pleased with this ideal portrait, a stirring, triumphant image that replaced the reserved allegories such as the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Hunt Memorial</hi> figures. This alert portrayal was first suggested in the head of <hi rend="italic">

            <p>At the same time that he was at work on the War Commission medal, <placeName>French</placeName> was approached by another personal friend, <persName>Robert de Forest</persName>, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art‚Äôs Board of Trustees. De Forest was a member of the Mayor‚Äôs Catskill Aqueduct Celebration Committee and chairman of the Medal sub committee. The medal (<ref target="#fig-83">fig. 11</ref>) was issued to commemorate the 12-year public works project, building of the Catskill Aqueduct, a major water supply for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, and offered by the American Numismatic Society at a subscription price of $25.00 for a silver medal and $7.00 for a bronze.<ref target="#CH8-n16">16</ref>

            <p>
               <placeName>French</placeName> agreed to make the obverse and offered de Forest the same proposal he had offered <persName>Gilbert</persName>:
<q>While I would be responsible for the head on the medal, I should have to get all the help possible in making the models for the medal and I should probably ask Lukeman to aid me. He is here for the summer.<ref target="#CH8-n17">17</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The matter of the fee in this type of project always presented a special problem:
<q>For a medal that we recently made together, he was paid $600.00 for his share of the work and I have no doubt that he would be glad to do this for the same amount. If there are funds enough, you may pay me four hundred dollars. If there are not, I will contribute that amount to the fund and pay myself!<ref target="#CH8-n18">18</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In this project the reverse was designed by both and executed by Augustus Lukeman and credited to him alone. At <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> suggestion he modeled a standing nude male figure, holding a symbolic water vessel in such a way that maintains the overall vertical emphasis, but with a twist of the shoulders that enhances the horizontal as it flattens the figure.</p>

            <p>The lettering and the faintly-outlined Catskill mountain range, one hundred miles north of the city, share the background in a balanced manner.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>French</placeName> created his image for the obverse, aptly described in an American Numismatic Society circular as the symbolic head of the City of Greater <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, as a composite of heads of his groups, <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Brooklyn</persName>
               </hi> and <hi rend="italic">Manhattan</hi>, that flanked the <persName>Brooklyn</persName> entrance to the Thomas Hastings‚Äôs Manhattan Bridge which are now located at the entrance of the Brooklyn Museum. When de Forest presented three medals to the Metropolitan as a gift, Henry Kent, the Museum‚Äôs secretary wrote to the donor:
<q>I have received the copies of the Catskill Aqueduct medal made by <persName>Mr. Daniel Chester</persName>
                  <placeName>French</placeName>, one in silver presented by you in behalf of the <persName>Mayor‚Äôs Catskill</persName> Aqueduct Committee, and two in bronze in different colors presented by yourself. I shall take the necessary steps in the matter. May I say how very fine I think the medals are, more distinguished and finer than any medal I have seen since the work of <persName>David</persName>.<ref target="#CH8-n19">19</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> third medal (<ref target="#fig-84">fig. 12</ref>) of this period was executed at a time when the carving of the Lincoln Memorial statue was well underway in the Piccirilli Brothers‚Äô Bronx studio. It too was ordered by <persName>Robert de Forest</persName> on March 31, 1919, and was awarded to 12 prominent <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> businessmen who generously gave their time and resources for the War Council of the American Red Cross.</p>
            <q>I am involved in another medal but this time a pretty important one. It is a medal to the War Council of the Red Cross intended to be given to each one of them to commemorate their long and effective service. Is this something you would at all care to undertake yourself? If not whom would you recommend? It should be artistic and distinguished.<ref target="#CH8-n20">20</ref>
            </q>
            <p>Although de Forest offered an out by suggesting that <placeName>French</placeName> might name another artist, he agreed to take the commission on April 9, apologizing for taking more than a week to reply. De Forest was pleased:
<q>That is fine, but I do not want you to do it on personal grounds. Feel perfectly free to say no. As to remuneration, it should be fair compensation, whatever that be.I think our Committee can afford to pay that.... I should think that either the program of your Catskill medal should be followed, that is a large medal which could be cast for presentation, with a possible reproduction in
<pb n="148"/>
smaller size, or else the medal should be of the largest size that can be stamped with a die.<ref target="#CH8-n21">21</ref>

            <p>Issued late in the year, both the obverse and reverse have special design histories. Given the "private" nature of the medal, <placeName>French</placeName> eliminated all lettering on the obverse, although an earlier model includes, in the left field, the initials AEF, identifying the American Expeditionary Forces who first entered the fighting in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> in the

spring of 1917. In making the portrait of the young American soldier, <placeName>French</placeName> used his nephew, Prentiss, as his model. While the helmet seems slightly too large for the circular frame, and the strap an unavoidably intrusive detail, the portrait and general feel of the relief recognizes the war as the work of young soldiers. The fact <placeName>French</placeName> strenuously opposed <placeName>America‚Äôs</placeName> entry into the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>an fighting but then encouraged his nephew to serve once war had been declared, is captured in the youthfully naive but alert face.<ref target="#CH8-n22">22</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>In designing the reverse, <placeName>French</placeName> made a sketch which has not survived showing a recumbent wounded soldier with a nurse behind. <persName>Will H. Low</persName>, a fashionable <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> muralist, saw the sketch and told <placeName>French</placeName> that he had once considered designing a poster for the American Red Cross along the same lines. Low suggested that the nurse stand in front of the bed, a change <placeName>French</placeName> readily incorporated and credited the artist as collaborator by including both sets of initials, DCF and WHL, barely visible beneath the nurse‚Äôs feet (<ref target="#fig-85">fig. 13</ref>).<ref target="#CH8-n23">23</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <placeName>French</placeName> was almost successful in his attempt to superimpose the cross on the medal‚Äôs surface. <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> wounded soldier, who appears considerably older and nearer death in the first model (<ref target="#fig-86">fig. 14</ref>) and the uneasily stiff-backed nurse have a basic symmetry that adequately records the nurse‚Äôs vital role in the healing process of war.</p>

            <p>Although it was not issued until 1920, the history of <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> last important medal, the <hi rend="italic">Pulitzer,</hi> begins in 1918, one year after the School of Journalism of <placeName corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</placeName> University, with a bequest from <persName>Joseph Pulitzer</persName>, began its annual prize "for the most disinterested and meritorious public service rendered by any American Newspaper during the year...."<ref target="#CH8-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In May 1918, <placeName corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</placeName> president Nicholas Murray Butler sought <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> advice about the best method for securing a design. <placeName>French</placeName>, always opposed to competitions, tactfully responded:
<q>You ask if it is "desirable to invite two or more medalists to submit suggestions." In general I think it best to decide upon a sculptor and require that he shall submit designs for consideration by the committee in charge. The compliment of being selected to execute a work of art is in itself an incentive and I think that most artists do their best work when a commission is put unreservedly into their hands.<ref target="#CH8-n25">25</ref>

            <p>By mid-June, <persName>Butler</persName> asked <placeName>French</placeName>, long a member of the University‚Äôs art advisory committee, to make the medal.<ref target="#CH8-n26">26</ref> Before responding to <persName>Butler</persName>, <placeName>French</placeName> wrote <persName>Augustus Lukeman</persName>:
<q>What is your price for a medal made all by yourself? Also what is your price for a medal supervised by me,‚Äî if I can‚Äôt get it given to you outright?<ref target="#CH8-n27">27</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day <placeName>French</placeName> replied, declining the project for himself:
<q>Only one who has made a medal appreciates how much work there is in one. A statue hardly is more exacting in time and patience and it is not a thing that can be done successfully as a side issue. I am explaining this in order that you may not think that I am rejecting your flattering proposition lightly.<ref target="#CH8-n28">28</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He then offered to supervise the work suggesting that he and Lukeman could do the work for $1000.00 but concluded:
<q>I make this suggestion because of the wish you have expressed that I should be identified with the medal, but I really should advise that you should put the commission entirely into <persName>Mr. Lukeman‚Äôs</persName> hands. This probably would reduce the expense two or three hundred dollars.<ref target="#CH8-n29">29</ref>

            <p>By September 28, 1918, <placeName>French</placeName> wrote to <persName>Butler</persName>, submitting a photograph (<ref target="#fig-87">fig. 15</ref>) of the rough design for the reverse‚Äîa clay model with the date of 1917 and a fictitious award line to the <hi rend="italic">

            <q>On the reverse we have represented <persName>Franklin‚Äôs</persName> press in operation with the inscription. I think I remember that you suggested that only the inscription should be on the reverse, but it seemed to Lukeman and me that the in-

terest would be increased by introducing an early press with a figure of a printer at work. I hope you may think so.<ref target="#CH8-n30">30</ref>
            </q>
            <p>
               <persName>Butler</persName> responded promptly, commenting favorably on the profile bust by <persName>Houdon of Franklin</persName> on the obverse that was a basic requirement of the medal and adding:
<q>I...am particularly pleased that you thought of putting the printing press on the reverse. That is a little touch which is quite a stroke of genius.<ref target="#CH8-n31">31</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>When the medal (<ref target="#fig-88">fig. 16</ref>) was finally issued in 1920, the dies were changed‚Äî<persName>Franklin‚Äôs</persName> birth and death dates were removed, <placeName>Columbia‚Äôs</placeName> identification was added as was a place for inscribing the recipient‚Äôs name. On the reverse the inscription JOSEPH PULITZER MEDAL was added beneath the printing press.<ref target="#CH8-n32">32</ref>
            </p>
            <p>While the execution of the reverse should be credited to <persName>Lukeman</persName>, its overall design, and control of the project belonged to <placeName>French</placeName>. In making the final model, several modifications were made. The printer acquires shoes, pants and a hat but remains barechested as he strains to tighten the press. A coat, referring to the fact that printers came to work properly attired, is draped over the press frame. The requisite lettering works with only modest success as it is suspended in front of the press almost pushing at the printer‚Äôs back. These details, refinements that enhance without interfering, were unquestionably made at <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> suggestion.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> place in American numismatics has been little known, quite possibly because his medals have not been widely distributed and were personal rather than "public" endeavors. Despite this disclaimer, <placeName>French</placeName> attacked his medal designs with a stylistic consistency that marked his career. He worked in a timely manner; he thoroughly explored all of the design possibilities, giving first concepts and final models the same creative effort, and he generously recognized the contributions of friends and associates.</p>

                  <persName>Marshall Oliver sheds</persName> some light on the early history of the project and the Board‚Äôs interest in securing a qualified design. The letter to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy offers an "after-the-fact" confirmation about <placeName>French‚Äôs</placeName> overall concern but little on his direct involvement. Oliver cites an article in <hi rend="italic">Scribner‚Äôs Magazine</hi> that mentions unnamed sculptors capable of revitalizing American coinage:
<q>I wrote to the editors of "Scribner‚Äôs" requesting them to ask "W.W." who the two or three artists might be that he had in mind. The letter was referred to R. S., <persName>Mr. Russell</persName> Sturgis, the well known architect, from whom I received a note this morning, telling me that <persName>Mr. Walton</persName> (W. W.) was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, but that he (R. S.) knew that the artists intended were <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Mr. Daniel C.</persName>
                        <placeName>French</placeName>
                     </hi>, and <persName>Mr. Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>. I ought to say that this information I regard as being of a quasi-confidential character. <persName>Mr. Sturgis</persName> is good authority, for he is versed in such matters, having been associated with Messrs. <placeName>French</placeName> and Saint-Gaudens as president of the commission appointed to secure, for the U. S. Mint, designs for a new coinage.</q>

            <p>The medals, medallions and coins created by <persName>Bela Lyon Pratt</persName> were sketched and sculpted with both enthusiasm and pleasure by Pratt himself. It is hoped that the following first-hand material will serve to cast light on this less known, currently neglected sculptor.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Bela</persName> (pronounced Beela) Pratt was born in Norwich, CT, in 1867. His father, <persName>George Pratt</persName>, was a respected Norwich lawyer; his mother, Sarah Victoria Whittlesey Pratt, came from a long line of artists and musicians. Her father, Oramel Whittlesey, had in 1835 founded Music Vale Seminary in Salem, CT, which was the first Normal Academy of Music in this country. It was because of her artistic heritage, perhaps, that she had the foresight and conviction to encourage her fourth child and second son, Bela, to pursue his passion for modeling, which had evidenced itself at a very early age.</p>
            <p>Pratt‚Äôs father was a graduate of Yale University and so it was a natural step for <persName>Bela</persName> to be guided toward the Yale School of Fine Arts, which he entered at age 16. After three years of successful study under Professors <persName>Neimeyer</persName> and <persName>Weir</persName>, and after having won the Ethel Child Walker Prize for Sculpture, Pratt moved on to further studies at the Art Students League of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-89">fig. 1</ref>).</p>

            <p>The greatest American sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, was an instructor at the Art Students League of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. It was here that Pratt began a life of intense study, cautious reverence, and painful jealousy of his famous mentor. In 1889 Pratt won the coveted first prize, the "Concours," at the Art Students League. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> directed his protege, whom he later described as "a great student of mine," to travel to Paris for study under Chapu and Falqui√®re at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.</p>
            <p>Pratt flourished in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, winning several medals and prizes at the Ecole and finishing first in his class. Saint-Gaudens called him back to the States in 1892 to undertake a commission for two colossal groups on The Water-Gate Peristyle at the World‚Äôs <placeName>Columbia</placeName>n Exposition in Chicago.</p>

Shattuck with her youngest daughter <persName>Clara</persName>. These low reliefs were completed in 1893, but it was not until 1897, after Pratt had gained some experience in medallic work, that he launched a speculative venture to reduce the marble medallions and cast them in silver (<ref target="#fig-90">fig. 2</ref>).</p>

I‚Äôm going to have them reduced to about four inches and cast in silver. This is speculation on my part. I hope that they will look so well that I can get lots of things of that sort to do when I go back.I believe people would be willing to pay a price for a thing that seemed as precious as a silver medal or relief, that would scare them if asked for plaster or bronze, and I think, myself, that there is more sense in having a thing of that kind around than a large relief, or at least unless one has a truly good light for the latter. If the rich people could see enough of this sort of a thing it would become very popular with them and I do like to work in that way, part of the time anyhow....<ref target="#CH9-n1">1</ref>

            <p>As a result of <persName>Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs</persName> recommendation, <persName>Pratt</persName> was appointed to a professorship at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Museum School of Fine Arts in 1894, a position which he held for the rest of his life. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, surrounded by <persName>Harvard</persName> loyalists, <persName>Pratt‚Äôs</persName> devotion toward Yale, his first love, never wavered. Nevertheless, on the occasion of <persName>Charles William Eliot‚Äôs</persName> twenty-fifth year as President of <persName>Harvard</persName>, Pratt was commissioned to sculpt a commemorative medal. A gold edition of the medal was to be presented to Eliot at the commencement day alumni dinner. According to notes written by <persName>Bela‚Äôs</persName> wife, <persName>Helen Lugarda</persName> Pray (whom he met as a student in his sculpting class at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Museum School and later married in 1896), the gold medal at the time it was made was worth $500. Six bronzes were also cast. The plaster had been reduced in Paris. The following letter from <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to Pratt, dated Jan. 11, 1895, refers to the Eliot medal:</p>

(whether cast or struck) if it is about 50 centimeters in diameter will cost from fifteen to twenty-five Dollars; in other words if you send a model of fifty centimeters to Paris you will have a most faithful reduction to any size you desire for Twenty-five Dollars. This reduction will be furnished you in iron, and in order to have it cast in gold I think you would have to bring that iron model to Tiffany &amp; Co. who I believe do the best work of that kind in this country....</p>

            <p>In 1894 Pratt was awarded three separate commissions for the decoration of the new Library of Congress Building in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> D.C. The most well-known pieces today are the six female spandrel figures, flanking the three arches, and sculpted in high relief granite above the main entrance. They represent <hi rend="italic">Art, Science</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Literature</hi>. His second commission, an eleven foot symbolic figure of <hi rend="italic">Philosophy</hi>, stands high in the central rotunda. The third and final commission was for ornamental bas-relief medallions on "four separate subjects," to be placed in the pavilions. Pratt chose the four seasons as his separate subjects. He considered <hi rend="italic">Spring</hi> to be the "best of the lot." His sensitive treatment of women and children, as depicted in the four medallions, recurred in many sculptural forms throughout his lifetime. It echoed his innate respect and tenderness toward the women in his life‚Äîhis mother, sisters, wife, and models‚Äîas well as toward his own children.</p>
            <p>In view of the fact that Pratt had studied at the Yale School of Fine Arts and had received an <persName>Honorary Bachelor</persName> of Fine Arts degree from Yale University in 1899, it was appropriate that Yale "catch up" to <persName>Harvard</persName> by commissioning Pratt‚Äôs second medal. As with most of his commissions, this one involved a long and trying period before artistic realization. The classic design illustrates Yale‚Äôs motto of LUX ET VERITAS, Apollo‚Äôs chariot being guided by Truth over the clouds (<ref target="#fig-91">fig. 3</ref>).</p>

            <q>I had a letter from Prof. Weir this week and from that I judge that they would like to give me the medal to do, but as they have already asked some N.Y. sculptors to submit designs, they don‚Äôt feel quite free. However, they want me to make a sketch for it and I‚Äôm going to do it.It‚Äôs queer how I always seem to be on the ground a little too late.

Did I tell you that <persName>Adams</persName> design was "rotten" and that (according to Prof. Wier‚Äôs brother, who told Tarbell) I am to have the job.

               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, Dec. 17 ‚Äô99</q>
            <q>I have had another letter from Prof. Weir in which he says that all the other sculptor‚Äôs designs have been rejected and that I am to go right on with mine as they have no thought of giving the medal to anyone but me. They will pay me $ 1000.00 for the work. This ought to leave me about $500 after paying for the die cutting etc. But I am glad to do it at any price...</q>
            <p>Over one year later, Pratt commented on Tiffany &amp; Co.‚Äôs execution of the die:
<q>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, March 3 1901</q>
               <q>They have suggested some more slight changes in the medal but I wrote them that I objected "to tinkering any more with my design as not one of the alterations suggested by the committee had improved it in the least."The design was fully and officially accepted seven months ago but they seem to have gotten hold of some man at the place where the die is being cut who is trying to "queer me" with them. I hope my letter doesn‚Äôt make them mad but I felt mad when I wrote it and it is all for the good of the medal....</q>
            </p>
            <p>Five years elapsed before Pratt was given another chance to display his talents for medal work. In June 1906, Professor <persName>Charles</persName> Eliot Norton of the Longfellow Centenary Committee and under the auspices of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2653941">Cambridge</placeName> Historical Society, asked Pratt if he would be willing to undertake the making of a medal. This bronze medal, which was fashioned to commemorate the birth of Longfellow, was to be about 2 1/2 inches round. It would bear on one side the head of <persName>Henry W. Longfellow</persName>, and on the other a brief inscription. The number of copies to be issued was strictly limited to 200, and individual collectors could purchase one of the medals for $10 (<ref target="#fig-92">fig. 4</ref>).</p>
            <pb n="164"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-92">

               <p>4</p>
            </figure>
            <p>Norton, in a letter to Pratt, noted:
<q>I do not know whether the die can now be made in this country as well as in Paris. You will remember that the attempt to have the die for the Eliot Medal made here- proved unsatisfactory, and that we had finally to have the work done in Paris....</q>
            </p>
            <p>Pratt, writing to his mother in Kansas City, MO, on November 18, 1906, mused:
<q>One thing that is quite interesting is the fact that Pier- pont Morgan has ordered two of the <persName>Longfellow</persName> Medals and wishes to have them struck in gold! They will cost him about $300 each but I suppose he doesn‚Äôt mind a little thing like that. He says he is getting a collection of gold medals and he wants two so he can show a obverse and reverse in the case....</q>
            </p>
            <p>A few of these 200 medals were reserved by the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2653941">Cambridge</placeName> Historical Society, to be awarded one each year as prizes for the pupils in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2653941">Cambridge</placeName> school system for essays on the poet‚Äôs life and works. Pratt, who generally disliked and avoided making public appearances, seemed to enjoy the Centennial Celebration:
<q>Mar. 3d, 1907</q>
               <q>The <persName>Longfellow</persName> celebration was the biggest kind of success. I was very sorry that I did not have the medal realy
<pb n="165"/>
finished when the photograph that was used on the program was taken. It looks twice as well now and I have made some very important changes in the face, especially about the eyes. Anyhow people seemed to admire it.But I shall not have it cast untill I am satisfied with it myself. I wish you might have seen me on the platform with all the great people. Gov. <persName>Guild</persName>, Pres. <persName>Eliot</persName>, <persName>Charles</persName> Eliot Norton and any number of distinguished people.The sad thing is that they did not put my name in the paper with the others, but as they had only about half of the big men mentioned, a little man like me ought not to feel slighted....</q>
            </p>
            <p>One remarkable exception to the standard treatment for medal design was Pratt‚Äôs sunken relief $2.50 and $5 <placeName>Indian</placeName> Head gold coins, also referred to as the quarter and half eagles, commissioned by President Roosevelt in 1908. A passion in Pratt‚Äôs life was American <placeName>Indian</placeName> artifacts, for which he dug and hunted on many occasions. He even surmised that he must have had some <placeName>Indian</placeName> blood in his lineage, so ruddy was his complexion, so dark his hair, and so enamored was he with <placeName>Indian</placeName> lore.</p>
            <p>One day early in 1908, <persName>Dr.William Sturgis Bigelow</persName>, a Trustee at the Museum of Fine Arts, visited <persName>Pratt‚Äôs</persName>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> studio and asked if he knew of anyone who could interpret an idea of his regarding a new coin. In 1908 many artists were talking about the <persName>Saint- Gaudens</persName> coins, including Pratt and his assistant who had just been discussing how they would have done the <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> coins. They envisioned sinking the relief, but abandoned the idea as being too radical a change to be admitted by the mint. When <persName>Dr. Bigelow</persName> became an interested champion, Pratt‚Äôs excitement rose and he wrote:
<q>His idea was even more radical and startling than mine, for while I had thought of a ground sloping more or less gradually to the relief, his idea was to sink the relief at right angles to the coin after the manner of the old Egyptian reliefs. I at once began work on the models, and they looked so well and promised so much that I could hardly keep away from them long enough to make a bluff at doing my regular work....</q>
            </p>
            <p>On February 2, 1908, he had forged ahead:
<q>I‚Äôve got the coin model very well along and it has worked out very nicely. I can‚Äôt believe that those in authority can possibly fail to see that it is just what we have all been
<pb n="166"/>
looking for! It realy looks handsome to me and everybody to whom I have shown it says that it is the best ever. I wish you could see it just to help out in the general excitement and give me the courage to see the thing through. Do you suppose that I will realy take it to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> and show it to Teddy? I don‚Äôt think there any use in just sending it. There are too many ways that it would get sidetracked, which is just what is most likely to happen to it anyhow....</q>
            </p>
            <p>A week later he was still elated:
<q>The coin continues to be the admiration of all to whom I show it, but Dr. Bigelow has been sick abed with the grip and so things are rather at a standstill. I need not tell you that I am feeling very happy and cheerful. I always do when there is plenty of work promised and I am feeling well enough to tackel it. The fact is that I‚Äôm feeling very agressive just now. There seems to be something in the atmosphere of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> not unlike that found in Paris, among the artists, and I am right in the midst of it. I think and believe it is what we have all been looking for for so long, the beginning of a real American School of Art. I wonder if I am right! I certainly believe it. It‚Äôs all very exciting and not at all unlikely. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> is showing a life in Art matters which can‚Äôt be matched in any other city in the country at any period....</q>

               <p>I am sending you the medal in plaster, of the coin on which we have been working for the past fortnight. It seems to me that your idea of having a sunken relief is going to work out perfectly. This arrangement protects the design from wear as well as possessing the advantage of presenting a level surface which will not interfere with the coins being stacked satisfactorily. Owing to the fact that the surface exposed is broad and flat, the wear on the coin will obviously be less than the wear on the irregular surface of the ordinary coins; thus reducing the loss of metal and rendering the coin of considerable economic value.</p>
               <p>Aside from these practical considerations, the sunken relief has a distinct and original decorative quality. The <placeName>Indian</placeName> head seems particularly appropriate for use on a <placeName>United States</placeName> coin, being essentially American in
<pb n="167"/>
character. The <placeName>Indian</placeName> is a decorative type, and the headdress adapts itself admirably to artistic treatment. The backward sloping arrangement of the feathers allows space for a head of generous proportions, while the contour of the profile and the shape of the head-dress are in sympathy with the circular shape of the coin....</p>
               <p>One set of the casts is gilded and the other has a dark finish. The relief of these coins may be strengthened or diminished to any extent necessary in the minting.</p>
               <p>All the artists and others who have seen these designs have been enthusiastic in their admiration of it and I feel sure that if the project could be carried through that it will be found entirely satisfactory.</p>

            <p>Pratt‚Äôs studio was often open to friends, colleagues, and on certain occasions to the public, since transporting monumental pieces of sculpture to small galleries for exhibition was not always feasible. He also felt, and quite rightfully so, that everyone liked to "get a smell of the sculpture." In a letter dated Feb. 23, 1908, he refers to a special visit:
<q>Yesterday <persName>Henry Higgenson</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Higgenson</persName> and their son <persName corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</persName> came in to see the bust [a portrait of <persName>Henry Lee Higgenson</persName> to be placed in <placeName>Boston‚Äôs</placeName> Symphony <persName>Hall</persName>. <persName>Higgenson</persName> was founder of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Symphony Orchestra], and they were all most complimentary. I‚Äôm so pleased to have the family pleased as that is often the most difficult part of a portrait. The committee have been perfectly satisfied. In the afternoon the Higgensons came in again and brought Mrs. Tyson with them. <persName>Mrs. Tyson</persName> is the prime mover in getting the bust made and she said that they all felt they had been most fortunate in getting me to do it instead of <persName>St. Gaudens</persName>! Also, they all thought my coins much superior to St. G‚Äôs. Of course they are quite right in both cases!...</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the next few months, interesting details were revealed concerning the issue of the coins. <persName>Dr. Bigelow</persName>, a personal friend and confidant of President Roosevelt, wrote to Pratt from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Senate Chamber in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> on April 8, 1908:</p>

               <p>The President likes the coin‚Äîboth the idea of a countersunk relief and your <placeName>Indian</placeName> head. 1 saw <persName>Mr. Leech</persName> (Director of the Mint) at the White House yesterday and again at the Freeman this morning. He seems well disposed. The laws limiting the changes in design to once in fifteen or twenty years (I forget exactly) make it doubtful when either process or design can be adopted, but he is going to look it up and see what coins will be available for new designs within a reasonable time.‚ÄîI told him to go ahead with the sunken relief idea on anything, as far as I am concerned but that I could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> give him authority to use <hi rend="italic">your design</hi> without consulting you, and moreover that I thought you would want to retouch it if it were adopted.</p>
               <p>He asked me to write to you about it.‚ÄîOf course, you are insured against loss in any case since it stands as a private commission from me even if the gov‚Äôt does not take it.‚ÄîBut suppose they do.‚Äîshall I refer <persName>Mr. Leech</persName> directly to you for terms, or can I give him any message?</p>
               <p>Of course the suggestion of the gov‚Äôt paying out money will set a different set of wheels turning, and the creaking may wake up some watch-dog of the Treasury from Illinois or <persName>S. Dakota</persName> who is trying to make his constituents think him a financier, and it might be an obstacle to getting this thing judged on its merits, and it is conceivabley possible that the best may be for me to say to Mr. Leech‚Äî "this <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> of a sunken relief I give the gov‚Äôt outright.‚Äî The <hi rend="italic">design</hi> of the <placeName>Indian</placeName> Head has cost me so &amp; so. If there is no appropriation available I will pay the bill &amp; give the Gov‚Äôt the design too for the sake of seeing the experiment tried." That would eliminate the idea of a job, which every department or official shies at like a colt at a pile-driver.</p>

ly question he knows of is what coin it can be got on to, and he is going to Phila. to the mint to see. The President wants the St. Gaudens eagle on the reverse, also in "recessed relief‚Äô, but there is a technical question whether "recessing" it would be"changing the design" within the meaning of the act. There is hope of getting it on a $5.00 piece anyway. Everything is ready for a new issue, but only the specimen pieces have been struck and none have gone out. There is a chance that this whole issue can be stopped and our coin substituted. But keep all this to yourself till further notice.</p>

                  <persName>Mr. Leech</persName> has got back from Phila. and reports everything favorable there. He had started one of the men there on the reverse, but when I told him what you said about doing it, he said he saw no objection to your going ahead, and that he‚Äîor we‚Äîcould see which came out best. Do you want to try on that basis? Why don‚Äôt you? I will stand in the gap as before.‚ÄîThe President wants the <hi rend="italic">standing </hi>St. Gaudens eagle of the $10.00 piece reproduced in "sunken relief‚Äô... <persName>Mr. Leech</persName> said unofficially that he did not think it necessary for you to reproduce "every feather." I got the idea that he would not object if you should improve it in any way. But I would not, if I were you, get <hi rend="italic">too</hi> far from the original, as the President likes it. Perhaps you can make him like it better.‚Äî</p>

               <p>The coin it goes on depends on whether it is possible to get it on the $5. 00. Everything is prepared for a new issue, and the dies are made. But the coins are not yet struck. If they were, nothing more could be done for twenty five years. <persName>Mr. Leech</persName> takes the ground that the law refers to the date of issue of the coins, and not to the date of the cutting of the die‚ÄîThis is the point we are now wrestling with.</p>

            <p>By fall, Pratt wrote to his mother with great excitement:</p>

            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">...Remember the coin is a secret!</hi>
            </q>
            <q>We went to the Symphony concert last night, the first night of the season with the new conductor, Max Fidler. He‚Äôs all right! The program was fine and he kept the orchestra together in a very masterful style; but that is not what I want to write about....</q>
            <q>
               <persName>Well, Helen</persName> [Pratt‚Äôs wife] thought it would be nice to walk in the corridor to see if we could find our friends. We found the Woods, one and all, waiting for us and I had only just shaken hands when <persName>Dr. Sturgis Bigelow</persName> pounced on me and with a most misterious manner, husteled me off under a light away from the crowd and produced the first of the coins from his pocket! He says the President and mint people are most enthusiastic and it is their plan to get the coin all distributed for circulation and in fact into circulation before there is a chance to rase a row. Bigelow says there is sure to be a big fuss. I suppose he will get all the glory if there is any. There is always somebody ready to snatch every bit of credit for things of this kind, but it is a fact that Bigelow has engineered this thing through and it is sure that without him it never would have gotten through. I shall feel badly to have it called the "Bigelow coin" when it is really the "Pratt coin."</q>
            <q>The papers here, except the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi>, gave credit of the design for the Archbishop medal to <persName>LaRose</persName>! However, he came out like a little man and the <hi rend="italic">

            <q>After the first of November you can all you want of my coins at any bank, but that is still a secret. They have "knocked spots" out of my design at the mint. They let their diecutter spoil it, which he did most thoroughly, so try not to be too disappointed when you see the coins.The little <hi rend="italic">$2</hi> 1/2 coins don‚Äôt look so badly but the <hi rend="italic">$5</hi> is a sight! I could not sleep for a night or two after I saw it. The first impression, which <persName>Dr. Bigelow</persName> showed me at the Symphony two weeks ago looked quite well. But they tried to retouch it and gee! they made a mess of it!With a few deft touches the butcher or blacksmith, who is at the head of things there, changed it from a thing that I was proud of to one which I am ashaimed! Still it is the best coin the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> has ever had....</q>
            <q>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, Nov. 8th, 1908</q>
            <q>There have been several newspaper notices of the "New coin designed by <persName>W.S. Bigelow</persName>." They usually mention that <persName>Dr. Bigelow</persName> got me to "make the models." There seems to be no excitement about it at all and I suppose that is because they have not yet appeared. Anyhow, I shall have very little of eather the credit or discredit. I had not thought it possible that they would play such a trick on me and it realy looks much as if Dr. Bigelow was to blame. If a person gave a painter an order for a picture and told him in a general way what sort of a picture he wanted he would never think of claiming that he "designed" the picture and then proceed to take all the credit for it. As near as I can make out that is what <persName>Dr. Bigelow</persName> has done. It‚Äôs just the same thing that La Rose did in regard to the Archbishop medal. Tiffany &amp; Co., who struck the Yale medal and got all the credit for that, played much the same trick. This seems to me the meanest kind of robbery....</q>
            <p>Once the coins were in circulation (<ref target="#fig-93">fig. 5</ref>), Dr. Bigelow wrote Pratt

                  <salute>Dear <persName>Mr. Pratt</persName>
                  </salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I have a quantity of clippings taken from papers all over the country about the new coins. Would you like to see them? There is only one comment that is otherwise than favorable and that is a short paragraph from the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Herald.</hi> There is also one from the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> which said point blank that I designed the coins. If I had seen this when it came out I should have written to correct it.</p>
               <p>I am sorry that they do not put you more in the foreground as a general thing. I have in my hand a copy of a memorandum I sent Mr. Leech who asked if I had anything to say about the designs for publication, as he expected an invasion of inquiring reporters. It ends with these words: "The credit for this particular design is wholly <persName>Mr. Pratt‚Äôs</persName>." In a private letter to him enclosing this memorandum I said: "If we could be sure that the thing was going to be a success I should be inclined to withdraw entirely and have the thing known as the Pratt design. As it may turn out a popular failure, however, I think it may be safer to couple the names and call it either the "Pratt-Bigelow" or the "Bigelow-Pratt" design."</p>
               <p>Of course you and I, who have thought more about it than anybody else, can now see points where the thing could be done better if it were done over. Some of these the Mint is responsible for, others not. But on the whole the thing seems to be a success and I think we may well congratulate ourselves. At any rate nothing but an act of Congress can withdraw these coins from circulation for twenty years, at the end of which time I hope they will come to you for another design. If they do, remember and get the relief completely below the level of the surrounding surface at all points....</p>
               <p>In January 1909, Pratt delivered a talk in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> to the Thursday Evening Club, to which he had recently been elected a member. He offered some amusing reflections about his new coins:</p>
               <q>I am sure that up to the time that <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> made his beautiful coins the <placeName>United States</placeName> had the most inane and ugly coins the world has ever seen. We did have one handsome one once, about 1862-3 they got out a nickel cent with a flying eagle, which was really fine but it only lasted two years, when it was revised in favor of the
<pb n="173"/>
ridiculous one-cent piece of today....</q>
               <q>The Latin, German, <placeName>Indian</placeName>, English and Sanskrit words for coin all mean some kind of cattle. The Bible work "shekel" means a lamb. Out West they have begun to get busy with a name for the new gold coins which have just been minted. In a clipping which some kind friend has sent me from <persName>Denver</persName> is the story of a man who tried to pass some of them on the street cars and elsewhere but they were all refused; those to whom he offered them not being sure whether they were milk checks or a new kind of tobacco tag. No farther West than <persName>Jamaica Plain</persName> [<placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, where <persName>Pratt</persName> and his family lived], I offered for my fare a $5 bill, being short of change. Upon the conductor‚Äôs refusing to change it I told him I had nothing smaller except a $2.50 gold piece, which I produced. He looked at it for a moment and said he would rather change the bill. I told him it was a perfectly good coin as I had made it myself, but even this failed to convince him....</q>
               <q>When we had the models well along, Dr. Bigelow proposed that we ship them to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>... It was not long before things began to happen. I got letters written on Congressional paper, Cabot Lodge paper and paper stamped with the stamp of the White House. We soon knew that we had a very good design: <persName>Mr. Roosevelt</persName> said so. The models were sent to the Mint and there slaughtered after the manner in which the Mint always treats designs. They milled the edge, chopped off the margin, re-modelled the feathers and did other damage....</q>
               <q>One of the principal advantages of this coin is that it is nearly friction proof, as nearly so as a coin can be made; the background being slightly above the level of the relief, and the broad surfaces of the background taking all the wear and being perfecdy smooth, the friction loss is very slight. It has been stated on good authority that the gold in circulation in the <placeName>United States</placeName> decreases daily in value from friction losses alone considerably over one thousand dollars. When it is borne in mind that this loss is absolute, not simply squandered or going elsewhere, but annihilated, it is evident that any saving of this loss should certainly be considered if it can be done without effecting in any way the real or artistic value of the coin itself. That is what it is hoped we have accomplished in this coin. Another of the clippings which I received was from Providence R.I., and ran something in this manner: "The new $5 and $2.50 gold pieces have just been received at a local bank.</q>

               <q>They are the ugliest things in the way of coins which have ever been seen outside the show cases of some museum where the coins taken from ancient tombs are exhibited as curiosities." Of course, the handsomest coins that were ever made were those made by the Greeks along about the fifth century B.C. and later.They had much greater freedom in treatment of design than is allowed by the Modern system, which sacrifices artistic effect to economic and practical value and facility of handling....</q>
               <p>By 1908 it seemed that Pratt was beginning to have a corner on centennial medals! In July of 1908, the same year his coins were issued, he was commissioned to model a medal commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of the Roman Catholic diocese of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. He writes:</p>
               <q>The only new excitement is that I am going to make a medal for Arch Bishop O‚ÄôConnal and I shall have to work on it some this summer. I‚Äôve got to have the model ready by Sept. 1st. The Bishop is a very fat man and looks the part to perfection. There will be at least 100,000 copies struck of the smaller medal and several hundred of the larger. I am to get $500 anyway and more if the sales warrant it. I expect to get my full price of $1000....</q>
               <p>The medal was indeed struck in two sizes, the smaller edition about the size of a quarter, with a loop at the top through which a small red, white and blue ribbon was run, long enough to be tied in a bow. It was speculated that every Catholic man, woman and child in the diocese of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> would wear one of these badges in their lapels, offered at ten cents apiece. The larger edition, illustrated here (<ref target="#fig-94">fig. 6</ref>), shows Pratt‚Äôs delicately precise bas-relief modeling which was never vague nor indefinite. The relative scale of the many objects was composed and proportioned admirably, the inscription becoming an integral part of the design. The fact that Pratt himself modeled his medals, as works of love and leisure, quite obviously gave them an added, personal dimension.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Pratt‚Äôs</persName> most active year in medal work was to be 1909. His <placeName>Indian</placeName> Head coins had brought him recognition beyond <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, and in the fall of 1908 after the coins were in circulation, he finished a relief of Abraham Lincoln for Lincoln Park in Lowell, MA, and adapted, from the same design, a medallion for the <persName corresp="#viaf_76349832">Abraham Lincoln</persName> School in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. Shortly thereafter, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> commissioned of him an <persName corresp="#viaf_76349832">Abraham Lincoln</persName> Centennial medal (<ref target="#fig-95">fig. 7</ref>).</p>

               <p>By January 25, 1909, he was making frequent trips to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>:</p>
               <q>I‚Äôm back all right (from N.Y.) with two orders for medals, one for the "<placeName>Spanish</placeName> Historical Museum" and another for the "New Theatre" these are both quite important things and are well paid for. They are ordered by <persName>Mr. Archer Huntington</persName> who inherits all the wealth of his father who was one of the richest men in the country... He was very much pleased to think that he had "discovered a new sculptor"! Well anyhow things do seem to be coming my way. Just think three medals for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and the little bronze figure bought by the Metropolitan Museum!...</q>
               <p>His confidence builds:</p>
               <q>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, Jan 31, 1909</q>
               <q>The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Lincoln Medals have been struck and I think they have come out better than could have been expected. They are making them in four sizes and of both bronze and silver. They expect to sell a lot of them and the money is to go for a big Lincoln Memorial in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. I think it is about the best medal I have made and I designed it in a very few minutes. I had it all finished in less than a week from the time I started it. I don‚Äôt enjoy hurrying things this way but I‚Äôm quite proud to think that I can do good work in a hurry when necessary. It was done at white heat of creativity, that‚Äôs for sure, and has the advantage of being spontaneous....</q>
               <q>I think I‚Äôm getting quite conceited about my medals.</q>
               <pb n="177"/>
               <q>I‚Äôm sure no one can do them any better just now! There are lots of men who can do "slicker"and perhaps more correctly finished things of the kind than mine but to me my things have "more stuff in them" and what pleases me is that other people seem to feel this too. I do hope that I can manage to hide my conceit! It would spoil all my chance of success if people knew how good I think work in this line is!...</q>
               <q>April 11th 1909</q>
               <q>I had to go "down" to N.Y. on Wednesday and I had one of the queerest experiences of my life! I went down to show Huntington the photos of the medals for the <placeName>Spanish</placeName> Museum and for the "New Theatre."</q>
               <q>He was very enthusiastic, especially about the Theatre medal. He said "I consider it the very best medal ever made by an American sculptor, the best ever made in this country, and I have seen them all." You know he is president of the Numismatic Society and has given them land and built them a building. Then he said, "By the way, there is another medal I should like to have you make if you would care to, it is for the Natural History Museum." Of course I said I should be delighted and then he said "There is another one for <placeName corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</placeName> University. It‚Äôs for President Butler. " This also I said I should be glad to do. Huntington allowed it was too bad that he did not have a better head for a medal and then asked if I had ever seen his father. He then showed me a fine photo of him and he had one of the most magnificent heads I have ever seen. "I want to get you to make a medal of him if you will?" I was beginning to get embarassed but as the head was realy so fine I accepted with enthusiasm, but when he said that he also needed a tablet of his father for the Museum I actually almost collapsed! Four jobs in 20 minutes! That is a record! I broak away at once fearing that I would use them all up at one sitting, and I had kind of a feeling that I might "wake up" at any minute....</q>
               <p>The following fall Pratt recounted an adventure on Oct 23rd:</p>
               <q>I had one excitement last week. Thursday evening I got a telegram from Archer Huntington requesting that I meet him at the <placeName>Spanish</placeName> Historical Building in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> at the "first possible moment." So I took the midnight train and could hardly sleep thinking of the big job I was going to get.</q>

               <figure xml:id="fig-96">

               </figure>
               <pb n="179"/>
               <q>But it turned out that he only wanted me to make some changes in the Theatre Medal which I had already been paid for and which was pronounced entirely satisfactory last spring. I shall charge him $150 for the trip although he gave me a fine ride in his big motor car almost the whole length of Manhatten Island and gave me a great chance to see the Hudson Fulton Naval parade which was impressive and quite worth while. The change is of no very great importance, I‚Äôm going to take out the central figure on the reverse to make room for inscriptions. When I made it first they said that they didn‚Äôt want any inscription except just space for the name of the person to whom it is presented....</q>
               <p>The gold medal was presented to <persName>Miss Ellen Terry</persName> on January 15, 1911, by the founders of the New Theatre, amongst whom was <persName>J. Pierpont Morgan</persName>. As may be seen here, the central figure on the reverse side of the medal was never actually taken out (<ref target="#fig-96">fig. 8</ref>).</p>
               <p>In 1894 Pratt joined the Tavern Club, a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> eating and drinking club, and a center to spirited, artistic and sympathetic minds. He enjoyed warm, lifelong relationships with a number of prominent artists, writers, musicians, academicians, lawyers, doctors, and bankers, all of whom were fellow club members.</p>
               <p>This club voted, in 1909, to have Pratt design a silver medal based on their club logo, a bear, which would be presented to members of 25 years standing. As he had done on previous occasions, he designed this medal on North Haven Island, ME, where he and his family summered in their <persName>Bartlett‚Äôs Harbour</persName> home, adjacent to his artist friend and colleague at the Museum of Fine Arts and fellow Tavern Club member, <persName>Frank W. Benson</persName>. Pratt‚Äôs delightful, loving interpretation of a segment of nature, which he so cherished, is particularly endearing (<ref target="#fig-97">fig. 9</ref>). It is difficult to label as "Beaux-Arts," "Gilded," or "Elegant."</p>
               <p>The Tavern Club produced silver medals which are still passed down from member to member, after their names and dates of membership have been inscribed on the reverse.</p>

               <q>I‚Äôve got the medal for the Tavern Club almost ready to cast and I think it is going to be a success. I have used the bear that we used to see last summer in the spruce tree against the western sky. Of course I have had to change it some but in general it is about the same....</q>

               <p>Pratt was quite an accomplished sportsman, carefully allotting much of his time away from his studio for fishing, golfing, hunting, or archery. He enjoyed competing on one particularly beautiful golf course at the Country Club in Brookline, MA. <persName>Pratt</persName> was actually startled to be elected a member at this highly exclusive club in 1910. One of three Pratt medals which is still distributed was commissioned by the Country Club. Whimsical in nature, the jaunty squirrel, logo of the club, lent itself well to the restrictive, circular format of the medal. Pratt‚Äôs love of nature again shines through in his treatment of this little creature. The medal today decorates various of the club‚Äôs silver sporting trophies. This illustration is of a silver edition presented to Pratt by <persName>G. Herbert Windeler</persName>, who introduced curling to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName>A. in 1898, and <persName>Herbert Jaques</persName>, a prominent architect, both overseers of the Country Club, "with grateful remembrances" (<ref target="#fig-98">fig. 10</ref>).</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Pratt‚Äôs</persName> monumental work had reached a point where the demand was such that he had little time to accept small commissions. He

made no more medals until 1914, when the <persName>Nicholas Murray Butler Medal</persName>, already begun in 1909, was finalized.</p>

               <p>The Children‚Äôs Hospital in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> is in the 1980s the most renowned and important hospital of its kind in the world. Their seal, which Pratt designed in March 1916, was soon adopted as the hospital‚Äôs logo and is today widely recognized and distributed around the world, although few people realize who designed it! The original bronze seal is located in the lobby of the Hospital‚Äôs Walbach building (<ref target="#fig-99">fig. 11</ref>).</p>
               <p>Although the medals, medallions, and coins he created represented barely five percent of the total number of works in <persName>Bela Lyon Pratt‚Äôs</persName> short lifetime, they were an important reflection of his constant search to marry subject to artistic interpretation. The diversity and depth of <persName>Pratt‚Äôs</persName> work are exhibited to a far greater extent in his portrait reliefs, portrait busts, colossal groups, monumental statues, religious figures, decorative tablets, as well as marble and bronze fountain and ideal figures.</p>

               <p>On June 19, 1915, Pratt was recipient of a Harvard College Master of Arts Honorary Degree. President <persName>A.L. Lowell</persName> bestowed the degree upon Pratt with these words: "<persName>Bela Lyon Pratt</persName>, a sculptor who has taught bronze and marble to whisper his secrets of beauty and power." No one, not even his closest friends and family, anticipated that heart failure would prematurely end <persName>Pratt‚Äôs</persName> life, on May 18, 1917, in his forty-ninth year.</p>

               <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName>, American sculptor, is best known for two of his early works: his figure of a desperately-tired <placeName>Indian</placeName> brave sitting on an equally-exhausted pony at the <hi rend="italic">End of The Trail</hi>, and his very famous "Buffalo" nickel. Some seventy-odd years after these two American icons were first created they are still universally recognized by the American public, while the name of their creator is not. <persName>Aline Loucheim</persName>, late art critic of the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Times</hi> called Fraser "<placeName>America‚Äôs</placeName> most famous unknown sculptor," in a <hi rend="italic">Times Magazine</hi> feature article, later reprinted by <hi rend="italic">

               </hi>.<ref target="#CH10-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the second and third decades of the twentieth century, Fraser was the single most influential individual responsible for the aesthetics of American coins. His wife, <persName corresp="#viaf_7296946">Laura Gardin Fraser</persName>, who survived him by a decade, was also a medalist of considerable stature and influence. She is responsible for three commemorative half dollars: the <persName>Alabama Centennial</persName> of 1921; the Fort Vancouver of 1925; and the <persName>U. S. Grant</persName>. Together the Frasers created the <persName>Oregon Trail Half Dollar</persName>, termed by Taxay the "most beautiful" U. S. coin.<ref target="#CH10-n2">2</ref> At the peak of her career in 1958, she was commissioned by the American Numismatic Society to design its Centennial Medal.</p>
            <p>Fraser was quite feisty when it came to the aesthetics of coins, and was a widely-commissioned sculptor, who served a five-year term on the National Arts Commission (1920-25). George Morgan, who in 1917 succeeded the younger Barber as Chief Engraver of the U. S. Mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, was challenged by Fraser with more success and persistence than anyone, including his early master <persName>Saint- Gaudens</persName>. As a Commission member and later consultant to the Commission for coins and medals, Fraser selected or approved the artists of most government medals and coins, and rejected, criticized and/or praised proposed designs, all to improve the artistic standards of American numismatics. He took on artists, bureaucrats, and even congressmen, but still managed to remain on friendly terms with those of the establishment who counted.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> earliest years were spent in the <persName>Dakota Badlands</persName>, where his father was an engineer for the new railroad lines which were being laid westward. In the rough and tumble of pioneer life a young boy could learn to ride his pony, and to admire the great outdoors of the American west. <placeName>Indian</placeName> children were often young Fraser‚Äôs playmates, and he learned to respect and admire the native American culture.</p>
            <p>In his early teens, <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> family moved back east, first to Minneapolis and then to Chicago. Fraser enrolled at the Chicago Art Institute, and apprenticed to the <persName>sculptor Richard Bock</persName>, just in time for the Chicago <placeName>Columbia</placeName>n Exposition of 1893. As an apprentice
<pb n="185"/>
to Bock he was introduced to the Great White City of the Exposition, which was the product of the largest gathering of American artistic talents to that day, and a wonderful conglamoration of Beaux-Arts with pride in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> as represented by architecture and sculpture. Two years later he was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, in the studio of Falgui√®re. Here his work brought him to the attention of Whistler and <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>. At the end of his schooling in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> he was hired by Saint-Gaudens to assist in the development of his sculpture of <persName>General Sherman</persName>, now at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City. <persName>Fraser</persName> stayed with <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> until shortly before the latter‚Äôs death, having become his chief and favorite assistant.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, with the sympathetic support of President <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName>, hoped to create a change in American coins. As President, Roosevelt brought with him a great interest in art in general, and a desire to improve the artistic quality of coins and medals in particular. His friendship led to the first assignment of an American artist, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, rather than the engravers of the mint, to create a U. S. coin.</p>
            <p>The mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> had been under the direct control of its chief engravers, the English trained Barbers, <persName>William</persName> and <persName>Charles</persName>, father and son, and their associate and chief engraver, <persName>George Morgan</persName>. They had all been trained as metallic artisans in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, which begins with the engraving of fine script on copper plate, and continues with rigid adherence to traditional decorative elements. The emphasis in the training of the Barbers was less on original design than was the practice across the channel in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. An aesthetic difference between a Beaux-Arts trained sculptor and technically-oriented metal artisans at the mint was inevitable.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was struck by the medals of the quattrocento and Pisanello in particular. He passed this interest along to the young sculptors who assisted him. In addition to <persName>Fraser</persName>, these included <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph Weinman</persName>, <persName>Phillip Martiny</persName>, <persName>John Flanagan</persName>, <persName>Frederick Mac-Monnies</persName>, <persName>Bela Pratt</persName>, <placeName corresp="#viaf_63957810">Charles Keck</placeName> and <persName>Henry Hering</persName>, all of whom in their more mature years created medals, coins and reliefs with much of <persName>Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs</persName> influence apparent.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Fraser</persName> settled in an old stable on <persName>MacDougal Alley</persName> in Greenwich Village about 1900. Here he met other young American artists who were also starting to make their way. Among them were <persName>John Sloan</persName>, <persName>Henry Glackens</persName>, <persName>George Bellows</persName> and others of the Ash Can School. He was instrumental in bringing <persName>Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney</persName> to the Village. For a time she was his student. <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> early work in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City consists largely of portraits of children and society

notables, both in relief and in the round. Through these commissions he earned his livelihood and made many friends in the worlds of art and society.</p>
            <p>In 1901 <persName>Fraser</persName> was asked to create a special medal for <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, to be awarded at the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo (<ref target="#fig-100">fig. 1</ref>). In the medal to honor his old master, the design elements‚Äî
<pb n="187"/>
the placement and relative size of the contents‚Äîare straight out of Pisanello and the Renaissance, a style which <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> admired so greatly. The undraped, profile bust of the sculptor faces left. While it dominates its circular field, the figure is well clear of the rimless edges. Above the head, circling from left to right, there appears PAN AMERICAN EXPOSITION. Horizontally, at shoulder height, is SPECIAL MEDAL OF HONOR CREATED FOR AUGUSTUS ST. GAUDENS, and at the bottom rim, BUFFALO NEW YORK MCMI. The signature of the artist appears in the straight line under the shoulder cut-off. On the reverse is found Pegasus, the winged horse symbolizing the Arts, an icon used on numerous occasions by <persName>Fraser</persName>, including his gargantuan Memorial Bridge figures in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>, D.C.</p>
            <p>A letter from <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to <persName>Fraser</persName>, dated November 11, 1904, tells <persName>Fraser</persName> that he has been selected unanimously by the jury of the National Sculpture Society to do a medal of Edison.<ref target="#CH10-n3">3</ref>
               <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> asks the younger man to make four or five sketches "showing modifications of your present idea, or of new ones that may occur," and concludes by writing "I congratulate you and feel very happy about it myself as I know you will do a good thing." A reverse side bronze casting of one of these sketches is in the collection of the Albright Knox Art Gallery. It shows a crouching male nude figure in profile, facing left, with hair reaching to his shoulders. He holds up a light bulb, and is cleverly curled to echo the tondo. The signature "Fraser" is incised under the figure. The modeling is loosely handled yet clearly shows the muscular structure.</p>
            <p>When <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was in his final illness, he recommended <persName>Fraser</persName> to do the official portrait bust of <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName>. Thus began a long and fruitful friendship between the two. The first version of the bust (1906) shows <persName>Colonel Roosevelt</persName> in his <persName>Rough Rider</persName> mode. The Senate, where the portrait was to be installed, wanted a more conservative dress however, and the second version in marble, now in the Capitol, shows Roosevelt in a business suit.</p>
            <p>While it was with the aid of <persName>Roosevelt</persName> that <persName>Fraser</persName> was first suggested as a designer for the five cent piece, it was during Taft‚Äôs presidency that he was commissioned. His relationship with American presidents continued throughout his career.</p>
            <p>The first Buffalo nickel was minted in 1913 (<ref target="#fig-101">fig. 2</ref>); not, however, without major discussions both before and since. <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> design won the approval of Treasury Secretary <persName>MacVeigh</persName> and of President Taft, chiefly because of its American subject matter. <persName>Fraser</persName> wanted to make a coin design "using symbols which would only be fitting to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States of America</placeName>."<ref target="#CH10-n4">4</ref> He believed that the majority of
<pb n="188"/>
U.S. coins used symbols that could be representative of almost any country. The eagle and other similar birds had been in standard use by many royal houses of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>; the American versions of this royal bird were little different. As to the classic heads, be they Liberty or <placeName corresp="#geonames_368110">Columbia</placeName>, their like had been used since Grecian times.</p>
            <p>Many years later, <persName>Fraser</persName> wrote "American coinage, outside of portraiture and lettering, might as well have belonged to any other country in the world. I felt that this was not as it should be and that is the reason for the American character of my design. In other words, I wanted a coin which could be mistaken for no other country in the world outside the <placeName>United States</placeName>."<ref target="#CH10-n5">5</ref>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> childhood experience in the west, and his admiration for the Indian made the choices of the Indian head and the buffalo natural ones. As a resident of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, finding a suitable buffalo for the obverse might have proved difficult except for the New York Zoological Park, where a suspicious beast kept his head turned toward the artist who wanted a side view.</p>
            <p>Although there has been considerable interest in who posed for the Indian on the reverse side, no single person, according to <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> frequent testimony, was the model. The head is a combination of three different men, including Chief Iron Trail, who was at the time employed at a Coney Island sideshow; <persName>John Big Tree</persName> and Two Moons were the others.</p>
            <p>Officials of the mint raised major objections, particularly to the coin‚Äôs extra thickness. A new patent had just been issued to a manufacturer of slot machines, designed to prevent slugs from being substituted for the older, flatter coins. The patent holders joined with the mint in raising objections. <persName>Fraser</persName>, with the aid of an attorney, found that the law required such devices to be adjustable to at least three types of coins. The mint was not yet ready to give in, however. It was claimed that the thicker coin would not stack well, and the engravers proceeded to make minute but critical alterations in the depth and thickness of the coin, much to <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> chagrin. Secretary <persName>MacVeigh</persName> came to the rescue and had the original design restored.</p>
            <p>Most critics have agreed with <persName>Fraser</persName> that he achieved his goal of
<pb n="189"/>
creating a first uniquely American and well-designed coin. Vermeule has called it "the ultimate homage to our native or Indian-prairie tradition. The small coin is overwhelmed by the mighty plasticity of the Indian‚Äôs rugged head and the majestic buffalo on his plot of prairie."<ref target="#CH10-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Harriman Medal of 1914 was awarded by the American Museum of Safety to the Southern Pacific Railroad. <persName>Fraser</persName> held strongly to the Renaissance ideals of coin design; using all of the surface without borders and bringing the lettering out to the rim, he treated his modeling in detailed romantic naturalism. The portrait of the railroad‚Äôs founder shows a fortyish gentleman with mustache, facing left. The reverse indicates <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> talent for combining the figure of a railroad worker walking the tracks with the ideals of his art, without sinking into the sympathy of social commentary.</p>
            <p>The Spanish American War Medal, for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> State, was issued in 1915 (<ref target="#fig-102">fig. 3</ref>). On the obverse the rimless circle displays an American doughboy in uniform, wearing a wide brimmed hat, puttees, and a blanket roll diagonally across the shoulder. His bayonetted rifle is fixed for a charge to the left. The rays of the sun and a warship are seen against the horizon in the background. On the reverse a sword is pointed vertically and down. Around the edge the inscription reads, AWARDED BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Beginning at mid-level and running horizontally are the words, TO ONE WHO SERVED THE NATION WITH HONOR 1898.1899.1900.</p>

            <p>The Gold Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters was a commission of 1915 (<ref target="#fig-103">fig. 4</ref>). Here again <persName>Fraser</persName> used the Pegasus as the icon of the reverse. In this version, the horse rears above the clouds from rim to rim toward the upper left; the right front hoof intruding over the lettering. The relief is quite low and flat. The obverse has a classically-described male nude seated on artfully-stepped boulders. He holds a lyre on his left, the right arm rests atop the boulders. AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND LETTERS appears

            <p>The <persName>Henry Elias Howland</persName> Medal was commissioned by Yale University in 1916. The obverse shows a well-muscled nude male facing right. The bow he holds with his left hand echoes the curve of the coin. Its rim is formed by a row of tiny rosettes. The reverse features a Greek warrior‚Äôs helmet with a galloping Pegasus worked into the bristled crest. The lettering is placed horizontally at midlevel and reads <persName>HENRY ELIAS HOWLAND</persName> at the bottom rim and MEMORIAL MEDAL. This face of the medal is cut with a shallower relief than the obverse, heightening the effect of the simple design.</p>
            <p>In 1919 <persName>Fraser</persName> created a medal memorializing the Peace of Versailles (<ref target="#fig-105">fig. 6</ref>). On the obverse, a warrior goddess strides toward us wearing a radiant crown and breast plates. She carries a shield and points her sword down, as a sign that the fighting has been completed. The figure is vertically-centered, the out-stretched wings offer horizontal opposition. The background is plain and smooth. On the reverse the fasce surmounted by the blade of a double-headed battleaxe is seen against the U.S. Shield. At the top edge of the round the inscription reads THE GREAT WAR FOR CIVILIZATION. At the bottom, six five-pointed stars are well-spaced. The participating countries are named and placed on either side of the shield.

additional signators of the treaty, Fraser was able to adapt the numerous additional letters to the basic design idea yet still keep his uncluttered feeling.</p>
            <p>The <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName> Medal of Honor dates from 1920. It was one of many images of <persName>Roosevelt</persName> created by <persName>Fraser</persName>. The medal was commissioned by the Roosevelt Memorial Association, and awarded for distinguished public service in an area of Roosevelt‚Äôs concern. The obverse profile likeness faces right. Roosevelt‚Äôs eyes are in a typical squint with the pince-nez indicated. He appears to be wearing a business suit. There is no rim. "<persName>J.E. Fraser</persName> 1920" appears behind his shoulder; MDCCCLVIII-MCMXIX on the right. The reverse features a flaming sword centered vertically. ROOSEVELT MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION circles around the top half, FOUNDER‚ÄôS MEDAL at the sword hilt. Running across the center is a favored quote of the President: "If I must choose betweeen Righteousness and Peace, I choose Righteousness." The lettering is occasionally overlapped or interlocked in the case of a double O, which helps to give an indication of Art Nouveau style.</p>
            <p>The <persName>Williams</persName> College Medal also dates from 1920, although the inscription on the obverse says FOR HUMANITY 1918. Eight bayonets on rifles point to the left, held by soldiers in World War I battle gear, although parts of only four are shown. On the reverse a Revolutionary War officer rides his mount toward the right, three foot soldiers appear partially behind him, and a marker stone reads <persName>LAKE GEORGE</persName> 1755. The rimless medal is lettered above <persName>E. LIBERALITATE</persName>. <persName>E. WILLIAMS, ARMIGERI</persName>, 1793, and below the groundscape, THE WILLIAMS MEDAL. The lettering seems a bit crowded, the modeling naturalistic.</p>
            <p>A poetic and well-thought-out pair of images occupies the two sides of the American Institute of Graphic Arts Medal of 1920. The obverse face presents a sturdy deciduous tree, its crown properly fitted to the medal‚Äôs top curve. Above it appears the single word BEAUTY. Below the tree branches the inscription reads SPECIAL MEDAL OF AWARD, below its roots UTILITY. The circular inscription along the bottom rim says AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF GRAPHIC ARTS. This quiet scene contrasts with the visually active reverse. The diagonal spokes of a printing press are contrasted with the varied angles presented by the printer‚Äôs arms and legs as he strains to turn the spokes and operate the press. In the upper right of the rimless circle the sculptor‚Äôs name appears, "Fraser 19¬©20."</p>
            <p>The Norse American Centennial is an eight-sided medal issued through a commission from the Congress in 1925 (<ref target="#fig-107">fig. 8</ref>). Both the obverse and reverse are modeled in clear simple lines and surfaces,

quite unlike the complex and scumbled surfaces of other <persName>Fraser</persName> medals of this decade. On the obverse a Viking warrior is striding ashore wearing a horned helmet, carrying a down-pointed sword and holding up a shield. The inscription above reads NORSE AMERICAN CENTENNIAL (1825-1925). On the reverse, a Viking ship is shown with the inscription, AUTHORIZED BY THE CONGRESS OF THE <placeName>U.S. OF A</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Among the many commemorative fifty cent pieces of the 1920s, in May of 1920 Congress authorized a half dollar honoring "The Fathers and Mothers who traversed the Oregon Trail" (<ref target="#fig-108">fig. 9</ref>). This became the only occasion in which both Frasers acknowledged working together. The obverse by <persName>James</persName> shows an Indian facing right with full trailing headdress and a blanket, left arm outstretched. He stands before a map of the continental <placeName>United States</placeName>, and holds a bow in his right hand, just below which is inscribed UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HALF DOLLAR appears along the lower rim. The reverse, by <persName>Laura</persName>, has a pioneer wagon moving toward a sunset at the left, inscribed across the rays of the sun IN GOD WE TRUST. OREGON TRAIL MEMORIAL appears in a slight curve just below the wagon. The coin is dated 1926. Taxay concludes his admiration for the combined design by noting "it testifies to the fact that authentic genius, even when trammeled by the necessities of a modern, mechanical mint, can transform our coinage into a work of art."<ref target="#CH10-n6">6</ref>

            <p>The Navy Cross Medal of 1919 was one of <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> most successful commissions (<ref target="#fig-109">fig. 10</ref>). He described his design in a letter of 1943:

               <q>Blades of battleaxes were placed head to head to form a cross. Symbols old enough so that there would never be a change in their meaning, I felt were necessary. For instance, as an emblem of the Navy, one of the early caravels was centered over the axe heads. On the opposite side, anchors and ropes were employed with the initials U.S.N. Between the blades were clustered laurel leaves. I purposely made the medal rich and full as I thought it would hang better and not have a tinny or disklike appearance.<ref target="#CH10-n7">7</ref>

            <p>Early in his career <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> relief work was mostly in portraits of children and society figures, cast in bronze. The greatest number of his coins and medals were completed between 1915 and 1925, after the success of his Buffalo nickel, and before he was overwhelmed with his commissions for major public sculpture. Through his medallic designs he was able to explore his <persName>Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs</persName>-inherited admiration for Renaissance coins, and gradually develop a more modern feeling through the use of san serif lettering and simpler modeling of the subject and coin surfaces, as well as freer place-

ment of the iconographic elements. The latter part of this period, Fraser also was serving as a member of the National Fine Arts Commission and from there was in a position that required him to review the work submitted by artists for government projects. It fell particularly to him to be the arbiter, not only for sculpture but specifically for coins and medals. Fraser was frequently and vociferously on record as clearly favoring and promoting the better designs and the more professional standards of sculpture as submitted to the Commission.</p>
            <p>As early as 1920, Fraser was asked by Commission <persName>Chairman Charles Moore</persName> to pass on a drawing for a proposed Maine Centennial half dollar. He rejected the design as very ordinary, and suggested that his assistant Anthony de Francisci be engaged to prepare a working model of the idea from which the mint might work. <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> aesthetic judgement spoke for the Commission, and this assured artistic standards for the U.S. government on commemorative coins including:

            <p>For many years <persName>Fraser</persName> continued to be looked to as a spokesman for better coins and medals. He served a term as president of the National Sculpture Society, and testified on its behalf before Presidents <persName>Coolidge, Hoover</persName> and <persName>F.D. Roosevelt</persName> at various times.</p>
            <p>During the late months of 1929, <persName>George D. Pratt</persName>, industrialist and art patron, along with <persName>Robert W. de Forest</persName>, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, invited Fraser to help found the Society of Medalists. Its purpose was to promote well-designed American
<pb n="197"/>
medals, and to commission for its members two or three artist-designed works each year.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1932, <persName>John Flanagan</persName>, <persName>Laura Fraser</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph Weinman</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_13127761">Paul Manship</persName>, <persName>Frederick MacMonnies</persName>, and <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName> were invited to represent the <placeName>United States</placeName> in an international exhibition of medals held at the Jeu de Pommes, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. Several of <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> pieces were purchased by the Louvre, including the Graphic Arts, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, <persName>Williams</persName> College and Harriman Memorial medals.</p>
            <p>In the last several years of his life, Fraser returned again and again to the pioneer west he so admired. He had received many major sculpture commissions which remained unfinished, or were long delayed during World War II; nevertheless the western theme occupied his attention. In 1952 The Society of Medalists struck his Pony Express medal as its forty-fifth issue (<ref target="#fig-110">fig. 11</ref>). In it <persName>Fraser</persName> returned to the covered wagon seen in the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar. The same theme was used again in his final and incomplete work entitled <hi rend="italic">Oklahoma Run,</hi> intended as a major-sized relief showing a settlers‚Äô stampede at the opening of a section of land. The obverse of the Pony Express medal has a youthful rider galloping on his pony toward the right, while he looks back aiming his revolver at a pursuer. The inscription reads PONY EXPRESS. TEN DAYS TO SAN FRANCISCO. The reverse is simply rimmed and shows a Conestoga wagon moving through mountainous country. The ground surface is slightly concave and toward the bottom is inscribed NEW FRONTIERS. Under it the date 18-49 is divided by a small cow skull. The name "<persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName>" appears at the rim below.</p>
            <p>In 1945 <persName>Fraser</persName> completed a logo for a South Dakota high school which is strongly reminiscent of the Buffalo nickel, the beast‚Äôs head is slightly bigger, and again the head touches the rim of the design. The style of the modeling is also unchanged. In the logo a background of rolling hills and a sunrise peeking over the farthest hill have been added. On this a wide rim has been added as well, to hold the inscription HOT SPRINGS HIGH SCHOOL SOUTH DAKOTA 1893.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> major contribution to numismatics was the Americanization of subject matter. He developed a uniqely American coin using symbols fitting only to the <placeName>United States</placeName>. But a second contribution was to bring to bear a strong Beaux-Arts esthetic, not only in his own coinage and medals, but through his strong leadership of an entire generation of others engaged in the field. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> had first held up the classic ideals in coin design, but it was <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> con-

            <p>The American woman medalist was not able to leap to life until the very end of the nineteenth century. The barricades which had kept women out of art schools had only begun to fall at the time of the Civil War, and life drawing classes with nude male models remained closed to young ladies until 1877. The first American female sculptors braved their way across the Atlantic in the 1860s to study the classics in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>. Their medallions and bas-reliefs, such as <persName>Harriet Hosmer‚Äôs</persName> portrait of her "beloved master," sculptor <persName>John Gibson</persName>, and <persName>Edmonia Lewis‚Äôs</persName> study of abolitionist <persName>John Brown</persName>, were highly romanticized neoclassical works, all executed in marble.</p>
            <p>The first American medals designed by a woman were done in the early 1880s‚Äîand the designer was not an American woman at that. The <placeName>United States</placeName>, which had initiated a "rent-a-medalist" policy in 1790 by hiring French artist <persName>Pierre Duvivier</persName> to create the "<placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> Before <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>" medal, continued in this practice with the Swedish Lea Ahlborn. Born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2673730">Stockholm</placeName> in 1826, <persName>Mrs. Alhbom</persName> succeeded her father as engraver to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2673730">Stockholm</placeName> mint when she was 27. Among her U.S. medals are the 1883 centennial commemorative of the evacuation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> by the British, and a Columbus medal executed for the 1893 World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>. Both medals, the first with its effective "camera angle" view of a statue of <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</persName>, the second of an armored Columbus confronting two awed Indians, seem extremely patriotic works to have been executed by a foreign hand.</p>
            <p>It was the 1893 World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> that gave two American women, <persName>Janet Scudder</persName> and <persName>Helen Mears</persName>, the foundation for their sculptural and medallic careers. The spunky Miss Scudder who, at age 18 had already shrugged off an impoverished childhood and the disappointment of a failed career as a wood carver, worked as assistant to <persName>Lorado Taft</persName> on the Exposition‚Äôs monumental sculpture. Her sculpture earned her a bronze medal, but of more importance to Scudder‚Äôs future was the opportunity to witness <persName>Frederick MacMonnies</persName> at work on the Exposition‚Äôs centerpiece, a monumental Beaux-Arts fountain. "That," Scudder told herself, "is the man who will teach me to sculpt."</p>
            <p>As soon as the Exposition closed, Scudder sailed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> where she brashly convinced <persName>MacMonnies</persName> to allow her to work in his studio. Years later, he was to refer to her as his finest assistant.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Janet Scudder</persName> went on to win wide acclaim for her delightful fountains of impish children in which the influence of <persName>MacMonnies</persName> is clearly evident. She was also the first woman whose medals were purchased by the French government for display at the Luxembourg Museum in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="203"/>
            <p>As <persName>MacMonnies</persName> was the author of few medals, it is difficult to compare the work of the pupil with that of the master. A more apt comparison would be between <persName>Scudder</persName> and <persName>MacMonnies‚Äôs</persName> mentor, <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>. We tend to revere <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> as the American Master of bas-relief, but <persName>Miss Scudder‚Äôs</persName> plaquettes show her to be of equal skill, giving the impression of fully fleshed-out individuals in whisper-low relief. Many of her works are self-framed, usually with nothing more elaborate than the suggestion of two Ionic columns and capitals. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> also used this device, although many of his plaquettes are set in actual frames designed by his friend Stanford White.</p>
            <p>Like <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, Scudder almost never placed her subject exactly in the center of her "canvas," and she too learned to use the device of having a hand or elbow brush the frame, and in some cases, actually protrude from the frame thereby jolting the viewer to the reality of the person posed therein. This trompe-l‚Äôoeil device had been used many times in other branches of art, notably by the early eighteenth century French engraver <persName>Pierre Drevet</persName> whose portrait of <persName>Hyacinth Rigaud</persName> features voluminous sleeving which drapes down from a window-like frame partly obscuring the inscription below. In <persName>Miss Scudder‚Äôs</persName> portrait of Bishop Hare, his chosen path in life is accented by his Bible which juts out at us over the thick ledge of the plaquette. She creates a similar effect with lovely <persName>Mildred Barnes</persName>, who seems oblivious of us as she sits, head bent over her picture book, yet who has unknowingly entered our world by leaning out of her "window."</p>
            <p>A 1906 silver plaquette of a little girl named Alice has the same plastic quickly-sketched look as have some of <persName>Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs</persName> renderings of small children. The innocence of youth comes through to us without being cloying. That the artist felt sympathy for her subject is evidenced by the lack of detail‚Äîthe modeling was done quickly before the child began to squirm in the discomfort of being held to a long pose.</p>

               <persName>Scudder‚Äôs</persName> portraits of <persName>Arthur Middleton</persName> Reeves and his daughter <persName>Caroline Reeves Foulke</persName> show her love of detail and her ability to utilize graphics to define the character of her sitter. That <persName>Arthur Reeves</persName> is a man of means is brought home to us by the elaborate frame which surrounds him with its lion and dragons. With her crisp rendering of the waves and curls of his full head of hair, his long moustache and fashionably-parted beard, as well as all the tiny details of <persName>Mr. Reeves‚Äôs</persName> clothing‚Äîeven to the lion‚Äôs-head tie tack in his cravat‚ÄîMiss Scudder has drawn a man of self-confidence and still youthful vigor.</p>

               <persName>Reeves‚Äôs</persName> daughter <persName>Caroline</persName> is portrayed as a haughty young beauty of imperial bearing (<ref target="#fig-111">fig. 1</ref>). She is seated on a throne-like chair, her wonderfully-modeled left hand resting lightly and naturally on its arm, the sweep of her long skirt enforced by the chair‚Äôs classic lines, lovingly traced by the artist. The lettering of the sitter‚Äôs name imitates Greek characters suggesting that we are in the presence of a muse. <persName>Miss Scudder</persName> does not invite the viewer into this plaquette, nor does the subject lean from it into our world. We are not meant to intrude on her patrician thoughts.</p>

               <persName>Young Helen Farnsworth</persName> Mears was also on the Exposition grounds in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> hard at work on a commissioned sculpture called the <hi rend="italic">Genius of Wisconsin,</hi> The nine-foot statue attracted honors, prize money, and the attention of a patron, all of which enabled Mears, who came from a poor Wisconsin family, to realize a dream. She moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> to study with <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>. Within a few short weeks she was promoted from student to assistant.</p>
            <p>In 1896 another generous gift from Mear‚Äôs patron enabled her to travel abroad for further study. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> she studied and worked with <persName>Frederick MacMonnies</persName>, <persName>Denys Puech</persName>, and <persName>Alexandre Charpentier</persName>,
<pb n="205"/>
and finally she rejoined <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> in his Paris studio to assist in the execution of his <persName>General Sherman</persName> monument. In between sessions on the heroic equestrian bronze, she modeled her master‚Äôs likeness in small scale relief.</p>
            <p>The portrait of the male sculptor, executed in 1898, depicts him standing in his studio, the equestrian statue of Sherman a subtle shadow in the background (<ref target="#fig-112">fig. 2</ref>). The pose reminds us of Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs bas-reliefs in which the subject stands or sits in a relaxed, informal manner. His right hand rests lightly on his hip holding his coat open and an engraving tool dangles loosely from his left hand. The magnificent profile with leonine nose, beard and a curly

mane of hair, is drawn with strength and has, to quote Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs own criticism of Mears‚Äôs sculpture, "a subtle tangible quality exceedingly rare and spiritual."<ref target="#CH11-n1">1</ref> The portrait has the appearance of a quick rough sketch, reminiscent of Charpentier with whom Mears had recently studied. Charpentier, who in a traditional time disdained traditional portraiture, executed a large number of bronzes with ragged edges which have the unfinished quality of wax models. Mears‚Äôs portrait of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> reflects her study with the French master, yet it perfectly captures both the essence of the subject and of his profession.</p>
            <p>Another woman sculptor who worked closely with <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> was <persName>Frances Grimes</persName>. Born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</placeName> in 1869, she spent seven years in Saint-Gaudens‚Äôs Cornish studio doing the actual cutting of some of his marble works and contributing to the modeling of at least one medal. Prior to working in Cornish, Grimes had

studied at the Pratt Institute and worked as <persName>Herbert Adams‚Äôs</persName> assistant from 1894 to 1900. She is best remembered for her portraits of children both in relief and in the round.</p>
            <p>The critic <persName>Adeline Adams</persName> described Grimes as an artist of integrity, one who knew where she was going with a piece from the moment she first set chisel to marble or immersed her fingers in clay.<ref target="#CH11-n2">2</ref> Her relief work bears out this analysis. The subjects are always placed "just so" and are masters of their surrounding space. There is a quiet dignity to <persName>Frances Grimes‚Äôs</persName> people, as true of the Coolidge baby as of <persName>Mrs. Parsons</persName> in her "Whistler‚Äôs Mother" pose. The Clement sisters, aged five and three when Miss Grimes sculpted them in 1921, are solemn little girls, the older standing almost maternally behind her sister (<ref target="#fig-113">fig. 3</ref>). There is loving detail in the smocking of the dresses, in the pudgy fingers and hands, and in the soft page-boy hair cuts. The artist‚Äôs sympathetic treatment of the sisters and her soft-edged style remind us of <persName>Mary Cassatt‚Äôs</persName> sensitive pastels of children.</p>

               <persName>Anna Hyatt Huntington‚Äôs</persName> overwhelming sculptural output includes no more than a handful of medals, but these, like her large works, are a rich gift to the world of art. Like her large works, they too reflect her lifelong love affair with the beauty and strength of animal locomotion. In the pamphlet which accompanied her 1943 Society of Medalists piece, <persName>Mrs. Huntington</persName> described her passion for observing and modeling animals as a selfish one, adding her vexation over not having "fingers enough to catch in clay all that [I] see."<ref target="#CH11-n3">3</ref> The medal is a plush tapestry of African animals‚Äîan elephant on the obverse smugly dining on flowers; a group of zebras and a gnu calmly drinking and feeding at a water hole on the reverse. Tails swish at flies and sunlight sparkles on the ripples created by the thirsty beasts. The ability to capture the vastness of the African tundra on the tiny surface of a medal without losing scope is the mark of a true master of scale.</p>
            <p>The reverse of <persName>Mrs. Huntington‚Äôs</persName> 1926 <hi rend="italic">Mitre</hi> medal for the Hispanic Society of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> features a toga-clad horseman astride a prancing horse balanced on the tightrope of a narrow inner border ringed by oak leaves. The steed‚Äôs head is tightly reined and two of its hooves are smartly raised in the air. Life and rippling musculature are suggested on a small scale, and a sense of arrested action is implied by the drape of the rider‚Äôs cloak, his uplifted right arm, the perpendicular torch, and the fact that he has twisted his head to stare behind him. The nervous energy here is reminiscent of the sculptor‚Äôs work in the round, particularly her Joan of Arc, and can even be likened to the tense moment created by Verrocchio in his

            <p>
               <persName>Anna Huntington‚Äôs</persName> 1925 medal for the American Academy of Arts and Letters shows that her abilities are more than those of a skilled animalier (<ref target="#fig-114">fig. 4</ref>). <persName>William Dean Howells</persName> appears on the obverse, his left profile to us, spectacles held in his upraised right hand, a thoughtful, dignified and thoroughly human man in his later years. By placing <persName>Mr. Howells</persName> off center, the artist has cleverly managed to draw our eyes to his as he studies something just beyond the medal‚Äôs edge. His chin is lifted, his moustache luxuriant, his hair is slightly unkempt. His body is "at attention" but certainly not rigid. We almost expect that he will complete his perusal of the unseen object, turn his gaze in our direction, and begin to speak.</p>
            <p>On the reverse are inanimate objects‚Äîsheets of writing paper, a quill pen and two palm branches‚Äîwhich pulse with life. On both sides of the medal the treatment of the lettering is exactly in balance with the design. For someone who has stepped out of her metier, this is a masterful work indeed.</p>
            <p>Another woman sculptor who specialized in capturing animal life was <persName>Gertrude Katherine Lathrop</persName>. Lathrop‚Äôs specialty was not heavily-muscled Percherons and lithe jungle cats but young domestic animals, which she rendered with a delicate and often somewhat-bemused touch. Born in <placeName>Albany</placeName>, NY in 1896, she studied at the Art Students League under <persName>Gutzon Borglum</persName> and with <persName>Charles Grafly</persName> in <placeName>Gloucester</placeName>, MA. After <persName corresp="#viaf_7296946">Laura Gardin Fraser</persName>, <persName>Gertrude Lathrop</persName> was the second woman to win the American Numismatic Society‚Äôs Saltus Award.</p>
            <p>For the eighteenth issue of the Society of Medalists in 1938, Miss Lathrop chose to do a pronghorn antelope and what she termed a "brilliantly colored wood duck."<ref target="#CH11-n4">4</ref> The use of the word "color" in her description is apt: the duck‚Äôs plumage seems to vibrate with the hues of the rainbow. The fiddleheads in the background also serve to intensify the impression of color. Her kneeling antelope is smooth and graceful in contrast to the prickly texture of the spines of a barrel cactus.</p>
            <p>Her 1942 medal for <persName>Brookgreen Gardens</persName> is very similar in concept. On the obverse a bright feathered parrot (again, it is easy to imagine color), in deep relief contrasts with the placid recumbent deer on the reverse. Lathrop‚Äôs creatures are contained within the boundaries of her medals. The birds are each caged within a ring of lettering, and her use of a vertical bar as a pediment causes the beasts to "stay put." Compare this with Anna Hyatt Huntington‚Äôs African animals, unfenced and free, filling the surface so that they seem part of a larger space.</p>

            <p>In her <hi rend="italic">Cervantes</hi> medal for the Hispanic Society, Lathrop trespasses from her normally calm, ordered world into one of chaos. <persName>Don Quixote</persName> sits awkwardly astride his bony mount, the blunt end of his lance about to burst the border of his world. Rocinante rears and flays about, eyes rolling, nostrils snorting at the medal‚Äôs edge. The artist has placed horse and rider off-center, adding to the feeling of disorder. Around the rim run a frantic flock of sheep and lambs which Lathrop has rendered with her usual loving attention to detail, nubbly fleece, pert hooves, and all. The reverse is a bit more ordered. A battered shield and sword act as background to a barber‚Äôs basin overflowing with books. The sword slashes across the field touching each edge of the medal, its tip an exclamation point after Cervantes‚Äôs date of death.</p>
            <p>As Beatrice Proske so aptly put it, "Miss Lathrop‚Äôs rigorous sense of design, carried out with a delicate touch and enlivened by a fertile imagination, lent itself to medallic art."<ref target="#CH11-n5">5</ref>

               <persName>Richard Byrd</persName> and <persName>Charles Lindbergh</persName>. Born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> in 1889, her art education was almost entirely with <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName>, whom she married in 1913. <persName>Sculptor Janet deCoux</persName>, who worked as an assistant to <persName>James Fraser</persName> during the 1930s, described Laura as "a very tense and serious person ‚Äî very difficult to know." In <persName>Miss deCoux‚Äôs</persName>s opinion, Fraser‚Äôs work was largely reflective of her husband‚Äôs sculpture, as she was never able to "develop as one would who had fought it through alone."<ref target="#CH11-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It would be a foolish waste of time to attempt conjecture of Fraser‚Äôs artistic development had she never met <persName>James</persName>. We know that, like <persName>Anna Hyatt Huntington</persName>, she was deeply interested in the anatomy and movement of animals, particularly horses, so certainly <persName>Laura</persName> would have honed her skills as an animalier with or without the tutelage of <persName>James Earle</persName>. Her love of animals is apparent in all of her medallic "portraits" of dogs and horses in which a fluidity of line and a feeling of joy can be detected. The stallion on her <persName>Morgan Horse</persName> Club medal of 1923 is a noble embodiment of the sire of the breed, while the mare and foal on the reverse are treated with a tenderness and delicacy befitting a <persName>Madonna</persName> and Child. For the Irish Setter Club of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, she created what Cornelius Vermeule described as a "very Renaissance, very Pisanellolike medal" featuring a portrait of a "most humanistic" setter (<ref target="#fig-116">fig. 6</ref>).<ref target="#CH11-n7">7</ref>

               <hi rend="italic">Better Babies</hi> medal done in 1913 for the <hi rend="italic">Woman‚Äôs Home Companion</hi> is her only piece which can truly be called feminine (<ref target="#fig-117">fig. 7</ref>). It is a well-balanced medal, nicely executed if a bit on the sentimental side. The babies‚Äô bare flesh is soft, almost palpable; their curls and dimpled elbows invite touch, thus appealing to exactly the audience the medal was meant to impress.</p>
            <p>That <persName>Mrs. Fraser</persName> is rarely paid tribute for her portraits of human

beings is a slight which should be remedied. Her 1930 portrait of <persName>Charles Lindbergh</persName>, which was modeled from life for presentation to him as the Congressional Medal of Honor, depicts a man startlingly young, as Lindbergh indeed was. To underscore his bold accomplishment, Fraser‚Äôs reverse is of an eagle, its wings outstretched, soaring above the clouds and the earth as the sun sets behind it. She has balanced the humanness of the man with a clear and powerful allegory.</p>
            <p>Her <persName>Admiral Byrd</persName> portrait, completed in the same year for the National Geographic Society, is similar in style. Both figures are truncated at mid-chest much like <persName>Fraser‚Äôs</persName> better known <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</persName> medal, a technique which harks back to such early masters as <persName>Pisanello</persName> and <persName>Niccolo Fiorentino</persName>. Byrd wears his fur-lined parka just as Lindbergh is clad in aviator‚Äôs cap and scarf. The reverse of the Byrd medal is of a winged man, Daedalus perhaps, gliding across the face of the sun. Both the Byrd reverse and the Lindbergh reverse, each with a figure cutting across a linear sunburst background, are similar in conception to the reverse design by Lucien Bazor for his famous medal of <persName>Richard Wagner</persName>.</p>

               </hi> medal marking the Massachusetts Bay Tercentenary in 1931 is of twin pear trees, their roots intertwined (<ref target="#fig-118">fig. 8</ref>). The trees are lovingly drawn with much attention to the detail of each leaf and plump round pear, the fruit of the Governor‚Äôs labors being passed on to future generations of the colony. It is the work of a medalist secure in her art, one who has gleaned from classic sources as well as from her Modern American husband.</p>

               <persName>Harriet Whitney Frishmuth</persName>, who was born into a comfortable home life in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> in 1880, showed early promise as a sculptor. At the age of 19 she entered <persName>Rodin‚Äôs</persName> Paris studio, and two years later she exhibited at the Salon. Her first commission was a life-sized bronze portrait plaque of <persName>Dr. Abraham Jacobi</persName> for the New York County Medical Society in 1910. <persName>Charles Aronson</persName>, the author of <hi rend="italic">Sculptured Hyacinths,</hi> a paean to <persName>Harriet Frishmuth‚Äôs</persName> sculpture, states that the plaque tells us nothing about either the sculptor or her style.<ref target="#CH11-n8">8</ref> In a sense this is true, for the half-figure of the gentleman of serious mien is detailed and natural. It has neither the hurried quality of <persName>Frishmuth‚Äôs</persName> early master, <persName>Rodin</persName>, and of most of her own early work in the round, nor does it reflect her later "lyric years" when she created her well-known sensuous female nudes. What the plaque does tell us is that <persName>Frishmuth</persName> was a patient artist with the ability to capture mood and the dignity of her subject.</p>
            <p>We can see this again on the obverse of her New York Academy of Medicine medallion executed in 1929 (<ref target="#fig-119">fig. 9</ref>).</p>

touch by centering the small rondelle between the graceful and caressing branches of two olive trees, the gnarled roots of which spring from the rim. On the reverse, she has allowed herself almost free rein. She could not, of course, place a dancing naiad there, but she has come as close as she dares with the draped female figure of Truth in Science. The young woman kneels toward the left but turns her torso almost directly toward us; her arms are upraised like those of a dancer as her fingers gently lift the folds of her evanescent garment. There is a peacefulness and a grace to this figure, so perfectly balanced on the circular field. The clever placement of the draperies draws our eye around and around‚Äîwe are swept into the medallion by <persName>Miss Frishmuth‚Äôs</persName> poetic workmanship.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to compare this kneeling figure with <persName>Adolph Weinman‚Äôs</persName> nymph on the Saltus medal for The American Numismatic Society. <persName>Weinman‚Äôs</persName> nude figure, in profile to us, is nicely contained on the medal‚Äôs surface; the tree she kneels beneath shares the same plane. The young lady is certainly curvaceous, but the design is definitely linear. <persName>Frishmuth</persName> has created depth on her medal by revealing both of the kneeling woman‚Äôs knees and by the attitude of the torso, neck and head‚Äîand yet she has suggested neither horizon nor background. <persName>Weinman‚Äôs</persName> nude is immobile, posed. <persName>Frishmuth‚Äôs</persName> nude is in motion, recalling the artist‚Äôs own words on a lesson well-learned from <persName>Rodin</persName>: "Movement is the transition from one attitude to another.

               <persName>Margaret Grigor‚Äôs</persName> most accomplished work is also in a style that emphasizes design rather than the more traditional and painterly scenic composition. Born in Scotland in 1912, <persName>Grigor</persName> was brought to California by her American parents when she was a child. She earned her B.A. at Mount Holyoke Colege in 1934 and only then did she seriously begin the study of art at the <placeName>Penns</placeName>ylvania Academy with <persName>Walker Hancock</persName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Margaret Grigor</persName> executed a number of medals for Mount Holyoke College. Among them is the Board of Trustees medal on which she depicted the towers of the <persName>Williston</persName> Memorial Library which grace the campus. The treatment of the architecture is realistic but sadly not successful. We are puzzled by the structure‚Äôs "wings" which are in fact the main roof of the building. Instead of giving an appearance of solidity and timelessness, the towers appear to be on the verge of soaring from the face of the medal.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Grigor‚Äôs</persName> 1937 Garvan medal for the Chemical Society of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> is perhaps her best and it is certainly her most original (<ref target="#fig-120">fig. 10</ref>). Hexagonal, it shows the sculptor‚Äôs masterful use of the spatial surfaces on both the obverse and reverse. The chunky torch of knowledge on the reverse fits perfectly into the center of the six-sided medal and is in correct proportion to the lettering and the banner on which the recipient‚Äôs name is boldly emblazoned. On the obverse, <persName>Grigor</persName> has set a cauldron snugly into the bottom niche. It fumes with the smoke of chemical experiments from which rise a caduceus at center, the steaming towers of industry at left, and the spires of modern city buildings at right. The design is neither crowded nor "floating free" like Grigor‚Äôs library towers. A simple and powerful

statement has been made by an artist with a true grasp of her medium.</p>
            <p>When <persName>Margaret Grigor‚Äôs</persName> design was selected for the reverse of the National Sculpture Society‚Äôs Seventy-Fifth Anniversary medal in 1968, it was both a fitting tribute to a prolific medalist and an apt selection for the organization. <persName>Miss Grigor‚Äôs</persName> design shows the hand of an experienced sculptor passing the tools of the profession to the hand of an aspiring youth. Behind them a rough block of stone waits to be carved. The legend around reads: TO FURTHER THE SCULPTURAL HERITAGE. The design is simple, the message direct. It is quite a contrast to <persName>Thomas LoMedico‚Äôs</persName> busy obverse design which features a full frontal head of Pegasus surmounted by a wreath-bearing Muse of Art and flanked by both an eagle and an owl.</p>
            <p>Eleanor Platt was active at the same time as <persName>Margaret Grigor</persName>, yet her medallic sculpture is entirely different. Born in Woodbridge, NJ in 1910, she studied at the Art Students League winning study awards and grants, among them a Guggenheim Fellowship, when she was in her mid-thirties. By the 1950s, <persName>Eleanor Platt</persName> had hit her stride and was turning out plaques and medals for the New York State Bar Association, Harvard University Law School, and <persName>Hebrew</persName> University in Jerusalem. She did portraits exclusively, mosdy of men in the legal profession.</p>
            <p>The bronze medallion of <persName>Henry B. duPont</persName> is typical of <persName>Platt‚Äôs</persName> naturalistic style of portraiture. It has a special appeal as the subject is dressed in a windbreaker, his hair mussed by the breezes which sweep across the deck of his yacht, unseen but clearly suggested. We are able to admire the rugged face in comfort without feeling like voyeurs, for even though the artist has portrayed <persName>Mr. duPont</persName> nearly full-face, she has avoided allowing us eye contact with the subject. His importance is emphasized by the fact that the bust nearly fills the medallic field, looming large in relation to the legend around and above it.</p>
            <p>The time has come to step into the realm of living artists. There are many fine American women working today‚Äîof the nearly 60 listed in the recent <hi rend="italic">Directory of Artists</hi> published by the American Medallic Sculpture Association, one third are women. Since it is impossible to cover them all, I have selected only two: <persName>Adelaide Toombs Sundin</persName> and <persName>Karen Worth</persName>. <persName>Sundin</persName> grew up in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> and began drawing as a child. Her art training was taken at the Massachusetts College of Art and at M.I.T. Mrs. Sundin‚Äôs primary medium is a marble look-alike called Parian porcelain which she herself makes up in daily batches. Her favorite subject, one with which she has a strong rapport, is the young child.</p>
            <pb n="219"/>
            <p>When we look at a medallion by <persName>Mrs. Sundin</persName> we feel the strong pull of the past, back to <persName>Frances Grimes</persName>, <persName>Janet Scudder</persName>, and other artists who worked in the Beaux-Arts tradition. A bronze of a father holding his young son on his lap has the charm of Scudder‚Äôs portrait of little Alice (<ref target="#fig-121">fig. 11</ref>). The little boy is not yet squirming even though his father holds him with a tender firmness. The child reaches out a hand for his pet dog which completes the design by stopping the eye at the medal‚Äôs edge and bringing the viewer‚Äôs gaze back into the circle. Details of clothing and hair are suggested rather than distinctly delineated. In all it is a warm and intimate family scene.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Quite a different direction has been taken by our last medalist, <persName>Karen Margulis Worth</persName>. Born in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, Worth was exhibiting work at the National Sculpture Society while still in her teens. World War II interrupted her studies with <persName corresp="#viaf_13127761">Paul Manship</persName>; then she married, raised a family, and did not return to sculpture until 1959. Since that year she has designed hundreds of medals including the Society of Medalists sixty-seventh issue and a series for the Judaic Heritage Society.</p>

            <pb n="221"/>
            <p>In 1977 she joined <persName>Laura G. Fraser</persName> and <persName>Gertrude Lathrop</persName> as the third woman in history to be honored with the Saltus medal.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Karen Worth‚Äôs</persName> 1982-1983 <placeName>Brookgreen Gardens</placeName> membership medal shows what a forceful and accomplished artist she is (<ref target="#fig-122">fig. 12</ref>). On the obverse, Pygmalion flings out his arms in astonished ecstasy as he sees the statue he has carved come wriggling to life as Galatea. Worth has kept the lettering to a quiet incuse background, and her border is a simple beaded one. The figures are amazingly muscled, and if not realistic, they are full of life and movement. In the art deco style, they are somewhat reminiscent of Paul Manship‚Äôs medallic work, although Manship‚Äôs is perhaps more stylized. Worth‚Äôs work is more akin to that of <persName>Donald DeLue</persName> and <persName>Abram Belskie</persName>, all of which can be described as potent. This medal also exhibits a strong diagonal pull and a feeling of depth created by Pygmalion‚Äôs left arm which seems to plunge into space at the medal‚Äôs center. On the reverse the motion is hypnotically circular as Orpheus lulls the wild beasts and birds with his lyre.</p>
            <p>Less than one hundred years separates <persName>Janet Scudder</persName> and <persName>Karen Worth</persName>. In this short span of time, the American woman medalist has made her mark, contributing work ranging from sensitive portraits of small children to nearly monolithic abstracts. Her delicate hands have played an important part in shaping the course of American medallic art.</p>

            <p>The year of the founding of The Society of Medalists, 1930, was an inauspicious time to begin such an art organization. The great economic depression of the fall of 1929 had deepened, and had spread worldwide. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, millions were unemployed. But, to place 1930 in a proper perspective, one needs to recall some other events of that year. An astronomer had discovered the planet Pluto; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> had banned all of the writings of Communist <persName>Leon Trotsky</persName>; meanwhile in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, <persName>Noel Coward</persName> wrote <hi rend="italic">Private Lives;</hi> the motion picture <hi rend="italic">All Quiet on the Western Front</hi> won the Academy Award; and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> started building the Maginot Line, the seeds of future events were already sown.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, <persName>George DuPont Platt</persName> proceeded to found The Society of Medalists. He was an optimist, an idealist and a wealthy private collector of medals. At the time of the founding of the Society in 1930, Pratt was 60 years of age and a dedicated benefactor of the arts and very much interested in ecological preservation. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, and for six years he had served as New York State Conservation Commissioner and was also President of the American Forestry Association. He was a member of various arts organizations and the Century Association. Unquestionably the idea for the founding of the Society of Medalists came from his experience two decades earlier as a member of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion, which had been organized in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City in 1909.</p>
            <p>The Circle of Friends of the Medallion was created by two men deeply involved in the arts. The first was <persName>Robert Hewitt, Jr</persName>., a real estate man by profession and an avid numismatist. His special interest was in the medals of <persName corresp="#viaf_76349832">Abraham Lincoln</persName>, and his extensive collection of over 1,200 pieces he eventually donated to the Smithsonian Institution in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>. In 1908 he published a book, <hi rend="italic">The Lincoln Centennial Medal,</hi> and bound in it was a portrait medal of Lincoln. The following year he issued a second Lincoln book with a different Lincoln medal bound in it. Undoubtedly, the success of these publications led him to join with <persName>Charles deKay</persName> to found the Circle of Friends. Noted author and critic, <persName>deKay</persName> had been the literary and art editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> for 18 years and the author of various art books including one on the french sculptor, Barye. <persName>Like Platt</persName>, he too was a member of the Century Association.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Hewitt</persName> was a quiet and studious man who understood what was needed to organize the project. Indeed, he had persuaded the <persName>Deitsch</persName> Brothers, a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City leather goods manufacturing company which owned a reducing pantograph which had been
<pb n="225"/>
made in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> by <persName>Janvier</persName>, to use the name "Medallic Art Company" for medal production. In fact, the Medallic Art Company struck the two Lincoln medals for him. <persName>DeKay</persName> was an affable and socially wellconnected leader in the cultural world and was well known among artists, writers and patrons. He served as the secretary of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion, and wrote the text for the short essays about the subjects of the medals and their sculptors published in the books which also held the medals.</p>
            <p>They publicized the medal series as follows:
<q>Circle of Friends of the Medallion is a band of artists and lovers of the arts, of both sexes, who hope to encourage in the public a taste for small sculptures and especially for bas-relief. Designs are chosen by the Art Committee. Medals and other sculptures issued by the Circle go to members only, without charge beyond the annual dues.They are not offered publicly for sale. They are of bronze, unless a costlier metal is called for at an additional cost.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The plan was to issue two medals a year bound in books with an appropriate essay. They illustrated a wide variety of themes such as motherhood or the ocean; portrait medals included <persName>Lafayette</persName>, <persName>Charles Dickens</persName> and <persName>Joan</persName> of Arc; and they commemorated special events such as the tercentenary of the City of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. Outstanding sculptors participated including <persName>John Flanagan</persName>, <persName>Victor Brenner</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_13127761">Paul Manship</persName>. The series ran from 1909 to 1915, with 12 medals issued; the first two and the last one were struck by the Medallic Art Company in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City and the others by <persName>Joseph K.Davison‚Äôs</persName> Sons, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>.</p>
            <p>For the first medal in the series by <persName>John Flanagan</persName>, <persName>Hewitt</persName> and <persName>deKay</persName> chose a subject which was sure to be popular in 1909. That was the year of the great <persName>Hudson-Fulton</persName> celebration which commemorated the 300th anniversary of <persName>Henry Hudson‚Äôs</persName> voyage to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in his ship the <hi rend="italic">Half-Moon</hi> in 1609, and the centennial of <persName>Robert Fulton‚Äôs</persName> invention of the steamboat, later named the <hi rend="italic">Clermont,</hi> which had inaugurated a new form of water transportation by steaming up the Hudson River from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City to <placeName>Albany</placeName> in 1807. Naturally, the medal carried the portraits of <persName>Hudson</persName> and <persName>Fulton</persName> on the obverse and the two ships on the reverse.</p>
            <p>From the subscriber lists, it is estimated that approximately 500 medals were struck of each of the 12 issues. It had been hoped that the venture would be profitable for the two organizers; however, the advent of World War I and the static number of members were apparently the cause of the demise of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion. (See below, Table l.)<ref target="#CH12-n1">1</ref>

            <p>Platt launched the Society of Medalists in 1930, 15 years after its precursor, the Circle of Friends, ceased production. Although he patterned it closely on the pioneer organization, the new society differed in one very important respect. From its inception, it was created as a not-for-profit membership organization. The low cost of the dues at that time, $8.00 a year, attests to that. In the certificate of incorporation, executed on March 16, 1934, the purposes of the organization were set forth:
<q>(a) To develop in the American people a knowledge and apreciation of medallic art;</q>
               <q>(b) To recognize and record, through the medium of medallic art notable events, personalities and cultural movements of the past and present;</q>
               <q>(c) To encourage the development of creative art.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These principles are still followed today and undoubtedly are the reason why the Society of Medalists is America‚Äôs oldest non-profit art medal organization. For the past 58 years, the Society has issued to its members twice each year an original work of medallic sculpture created by an outstanding artist. Membership is limited to 2,500 and each member receives at no cost beyond the payment of annual dues the two new medals struck each year, together with display stands and a descriptive brochure concerning the subject of the medal and the sculptor. Membership in the Society of Medalists is open to sculptors, collectors, and museums. The membership fee today is $ 100.00 per year which includes shipping to any part of the world.</p>
            <p>As a non-profit organization, the Society was set up to be administrered by a Board of Directors. Platt wisely brought on to the board others interested in medallic sculpture, both collectors and sculptors. In 1935, just five years after the Society‚Äôs beginning, its founder, <persName>George DuPont Platt</persName>, died; however, he had organized the Society in such an efficient manner that it continued with uninterrupted progress.</p>
            <p>From the origin of the Society, all of its medals have been struck by the Medallic Art Company. The choice of production facilities was made by Platt who was quite familiar with their work for the Circle of Friends of the Medallion. In the intervening years, the Weil brothers, <persName>Henri</persName> and <persName>Felix</persName>, who had previously bought the Medallic Art Company from their employers, the Deitsch brothers, in 1910, had sold the company to their associate, <persName>Clyde C. Trees</persName> in 1927. The interest of <persName>Clyde</persName> Trees and his dedicated staff was essential to the success of the Society. Over the years, the Medallic Art Company became the corporate sponsor of the Society. Upon the death of Trees in 1961, the Medallic Art Company was taken over by three of his associates, <persName>William Louth</persName> as president, <persName>Julius Lauth</persName> as vice president, and <persName>Mrs. Frances Trees</persName>, his widow, as vice president and treasurer.</p>

            <p>When they chose to retire during the years 1974-1979, the company was sold to an associate and its current president, <persName>Donald A. Schwartz</persName>. In 1972, for manufacturing reasons, the Medallic Art Company and the Society of Medalists moved from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City to <placeName>Danbury</placeName>, CT.</p>
            <p>The close collaboration between the Society of Medalists and the Medallic Art Company has been productive for both. For the Society, it centralized responsibilities and facilities for high quality production, and the Medallic Art Company has had the opportunity of producing the finest of art medals without the usual constraints of commercial production.</p>
            <p>Medals do not exist in a vacuum, they reflect the interests and concerns of the public at large as perceived by the sculptor. Medals, like all art forms, echo the hopes and fears and the aspirations of the civilization in which they are created.</p>
            <p>The first medal issued by the fledgling Society of Medalists in 1930 was by <persName corresp="#viaf_7296946">Laura Gardin Fraser</persName>, and it was on a popular subject (<ref target="#fig-123">fig. 1</ref>). The sculptor wrote in the accompanying brochure, "I felt that a sporting subject would be a departure from what one has been accustomed to seeing in medallic art. Therefore, I chose the hunter with his dog because it presented the opportunity of telling a story embodying a human and animal element. The ruffed grouse forms the reverse." It is interesting to note that although the medal depicted a popular sport, it did not reflect the economic catastrophe of the depression of 1929 which was overwhelming the country. However, two years later in 1932, the fifth medal, by <persName>Lee Lawrie</persName>, an austere and disciplined work, bore the inscription, WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP. The artist commented, "The medal is intended to cause reflection upon this age-old saying, and those who pause to look at the medal may each read into it meanings of his own."</p>
            <p>The preceding medal in 1931, by <persName>Frederick MacMonnies</persName>, presented the portrait of <persName>Charles Lindbergh</persName>, the American pilot who had been the first to fly the Atlantic Ocean (<ref target="#fig-124">fig. 2</ref>). At a time when <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> desperately needed a hero image, Lindbergh, a modest boyish flyer, aroused the spirit of the nation. The reverse of the medal depicted the <persName>Lone Eagle</persName>, as Lindbergh was called, eluding the allegorical figures of Storm and Death.</p>
            <p>In retrospect, we see the second medal by <persName corresp="#viaf_13127761">Paul Manship</persName> only as a well-designed and disciplined medal in which lettering and a portrait of the Greek god of wine, Dionysus, are combined in an effective manner (<ref target="#fig-125">fig. 3</ref>).</p>

            <p>When it was issued in 1930, however, it aroused controversy. Some years before, the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution had been enacted which prohibited the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages. Many people, and artists in particular, found prohibition to be intolerable and Paul Manship wrote, "The medal is not conventional. It is subtly humorous, and is symbolic of a present-day attitude toward certain restraints of the times. Thus it is commemorative of an era." Happily, a few years later, the eighteenth amendment was repealed.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that <persName corresp="#viaf_13127761">Paul Manship</persName> also had produced a medal for the Circle of Friends of the Medallion as did <persName>John Flanagan</persName>. His medal for the Society of Medalists in 1932, number 6, encompassed a neoclassical portrait of the goddess Aphrodite and on the reverse the torch race (see above, p. 131, <ref target="#fig-72">fig. 11</ref>).</p>
            <p>A particularly effective and powerful medal was created by <persName>Carl Paul Jennewein</persName> in 1933, issue 7, in which the themes of glory and fame were presented (<ref target="#fig-126">fig. 4</ref>). <persName>Glory</persName> was depicted as a winged child, symbolizing the purity of motive in achievement. This was contrasted on the reverse with the representation of a cicada symbolizing the fame which comes from public notice achieved by the noisy and shrill self-assertion of the obstreperous but insignificant creature, the cicada.</p>
            <p>There are several themes which have been repeated again and again in the medal series; "Peace" is one of them. With the war clouds gathering over <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> in 1936, <persName>Albert Stewart</persName> created issue 14. He wrote, "In arriving at the subject matter for a contemporary medal, I was guided by the belief that man‚Äôs voice of protest against war is growing from an inaudible whisper to a resounding concordance which may bring ‚Äòbetween all men peace and good fellowship‚Äô." The following year, 1937, Chester Beach in issue 16 made a stronger statement. The obverse bore the inscription, IN PEACE SONS BURY THEIR FATHERS, and on the reverse, IN WAR THE FATHERS BURY THEIR SONS (<ref target="#fig-127">fig. 5</ref>).</p>
            <p>The themes chosen by the sculptors clearly reflect the time of their creation. In 1939, with World War II already beginning to engulf <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, there was a movement toward isolationism in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, and this is reflected in issue 19 by <persName>Edward McCartan</persName>, which contrasts the peace of the new world to the pestilence of war in the old world (<ref target="#fig-128">fig. 6</ref>). However, World War II was inevitable.</p>
            <p>Despite the shortage of materials and manpower during the war, the Society continued to produce two medals each year.<ref target="#CH12-n2">2</ref> Inexplicably, the Society did not issue a medal with a wartime subject during the entire period of the war in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>.</p>

            <p>In 1945, issue 31 by <persName>Rene P. Chambellan</persName> was based on a photograph of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima in the war in the Pacific. The following issue in the fall of 1945 at the close of the war was by <persName>Berthold Nebel</persName> and depicted the burst of an atomic bomb.</p>
            <p>The same motif was repeated in allegorical form in 1971 by <persName>Elbert Weinberg</persName> in issue 84 which equates the creation of the atomic bomb with the opening of Pandora‚Äôs box. Peace medals have included issue 33 in 1946 by <persName>Joseph Kiselewski</persName> at the end of World War II. <persName>Cecil Howard‚Äôs</persName> medal, issue 42 in 1950, and issue 48 in 1953 by <persName>Peter Dalton</persName>, both related to the Korean War. <persName>Mico Kaufman‚Äôs</persName> medal, issue 87 in 1973, contrasted a carefree youth with a battlefield scene at the time of the Vietnam War. In 1986, issue 114 was the medal <hi rend="italic">One Planet</hi> by <persName>Alex Shagin</persName> (<ref target="#fig-129">fig. 7</ref>). It presents a view of the planet Earth as seen from space, and complements it with a symbolic scene of children dancing around the globe. Shagin has a unique perspective on this subject because formerly he was a medalist working in the Leningrad Mint, and now he is an American citizen continuing to create medals.</p>
            <p>Over the past 58 years, the Society of Medalists has issued 116 medals. The sculptors have worked in a wide variety of styles and techniques and the medals have often deviated from the conventional circular disc. Patinas and surface texture also have varied widely. One hundred of the medals have been created by men and sixteen by women. (See below, Table 2.)</p>
            <p>Each sculptor has his or her individual style and personal thoughts concerning the creation of a medal. <persName>Robert Aitken</persName>, who created issue 15 in 1937, expressed his philosophy in a very cogent manner:
<q>In making a medal or medallion the main problem is to add, if possible, to its metallic alloy the one ingredient which makes bronze imperishable‚ÄîBeauty‚ÄîBeauty in thought and execution. For Beauty inspires Love‚ÄîLove creates Beauty. The next step is to use the metal disc as a conveyor, so to speak, in which a beautiful arrangement of lines, forms and spaces can be compressed.</q>
               <q>With the above in mind this Medallion began to enfold a symbolic group of two figures, interwoven into a composition, which appears to penetrate the bronze so that one side is the completion of the other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Mr. Aitken‚Äôs</persName> style was highly realistic, whereas that of <persName>Anthony deFrancisci</persName>, who created issue 12 in 1935, is very much in the art deco school. The medal by <persName>Robert Cook</persName> in 1978, issue 97, is semiabstract. It is his personal interpretation of dance and music. Some
<pb n="237"/>
medals are highly detailed, such as that of <persName>Marcel Jovine</persName>, issue 100 of 1980; whereas others, such as the 1976 medal by <persName>Harvey Weiss</persName>, issue 93, has large and simplified forms. Some sculptors use no lettering on their medals as <persName>Gifford Proctor‚Äôs</persName> issue 47 in 1953; whereas one sculptor, <persName>Edward Grove</persName>, on issue 88 in 1973, created his composition solely with a variety of lettering styles.</p>
            <p>The height of the relief of the medals varies greatly. In 1954 <persName>Ivan Mestrovic</persName> executed issue 50 in very low outline relief; issue 18 by <persName>Gertrude Lathrop</persName> in 1938 is in medium relief and <persName>Donald DeLue</persName> used extraordinarily high relief on his issue 111 in 1985. Most medals are solid discs of metal, such as the portrait medal, issue 52, by <persName>Georg Lober</persName> in 1955; whereas, <persName>Richard Miller</persName>, in creating issue 112 in 1985, pierced his medal with two perforations. Issue 113 of 1986 by <persName>Marika Somogyi</persName> is not only perforated but also breaks away from the conventional round form of the standard medal (<ref target="#fig-130">fig. 8</ref>). With issue 115, created in 1987 by <persName>Robert A. Weinman</persName>, the Society of Medalists broke free of other conventions and issued a free-standing piece which can be considered either a medal or a small sculpture (<ref target="#fig-131">fig. 9</ref>).</p>
            <p>The Society invites all sculptors of the world to participate in the open and continuing competition for the creation of its medals. The following are the guidelines:
<q>The Society of Medalists strives to produce the finest series of medals in the world, therefore, the sculptors participating may be citizens of any country in the world.</q>
               <q>A sculptor who has created a medal for the Society of Medalists will be eligible to compete for the commission to create another medal in the series after ten years.</q>
               <q>The Society of Medalists issues two medals each year, one in the spring and the other in the fall. Accordingly, the competition for new issues is ongoing, and sculptors may submit original sketches in any form for both obverse and reverse designs at any time. The subject matter is the choice of the sculptor. At the time that sketches are submitted, it would be helpful if photographs of other work by the sculptor and a resum√© also be submitted.</q>
               <q>Sketches will be reviewed by the Society of Medalists and the sculptors will be notified whether their designs are selected or rejected. If rejected, the submitted material will be returned. Once the designs are accepted, the sculptor must prepare 12 inch plaster models suitable for production of the accepted design. The sculptor must both design and execute the models for the medal.</q>

            <pb n="240"/>
            <q>Medals usually are struck in bronze 2 7/8 inches in diameter.</q>
            <q>The honorarium for the completed, delivered, and approved plaster models, including all design rights thereto, is currently $3,500. Upon payment, the models and designs become the property of the Society of Medalists and are copyrighted as such.</q>
            <p>From the foregoing, one will note that the Society of Medalists encourages the sculptor to choose the subject unfettered by restrictions. It permits unlimited experimentation in technique of sculpture and of production and finishes. Sculptors are encouraged to explore the medium of the medal to the utmost. This is the goal of the Society of Medalists.</p>
