            <p>This study of the coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name> was started many years ago in the reasonable
               expectation that it might provide information that would parallel or clarify the procedure at the mints of its neighbors and add valuable data to
               the history of these Greek cities in South Italy. The destruction of Caulonia in 389/388 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> with the consequent
               stoppage of its coinage affords a fixed date of considerable significance and some convenience. The scantiness of the literary sources for
               Caulonia makes the evidence which the coins provide of increased importance.</p>
            <p>In the beginning there was no intention of attempting to find a definitive explanation of the enigmatic type. The years which have intervened
               have shown this to be a wise decision, and although in the discussion I cite many who have attempted an explanation "darkened counsel with
               wisdom" I leave the solution of this sphinx-like question to some daring student of the future — someone who will perhaps bring an unbiased
               approach to the elucidation of what the creators of this symbolism had in mind.</p>
            <p>To make acknowledgement for the courtesies received during the preparation of this study would involve citing again the names of the many
               cabinets and collectors listed in the catalogue which follows. Casts, photographs and information have been furnished with prodigal generosity by
               the Curators of all the great national collections and my thanks to them are both heartfelt and entirely inadequate. Many individual collectors
               have been no less kind—some of them are no longer with us to receive this expression of gratitude. An initial advantage lay in that <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Mr. Newell's</name> gathering of the coins of this mint was unusually comprehensive. The debt to my
               colleagues is great. To Professor <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Alfred R. Bellinger</name> and to the late <name type="pname">Mrs.
                  Agnes Baldwin Brett</name> I am under great obligation for helpful advice. To <name type="pname">Miss Margaret Thompson</name> and to <name
                  type="pname">Mr. Sawyer McA. Mosser</name> and the members of his editorial staff I owe a debt for cooperation and encouragement that beggars
               words. To <name type="pname">Mr. Raymond W. Johnson</name> is due the credit for the photographic results, often wrung from material that was
               unpromising. Last but not least, to the American Numismatic Society and the unmatched facilities of its museum, I am glad to make acknowledgement
               for the opportunity and for the means for completing this work.</p>
            <p>The objective, first of all, is to establish a sequence in the coinage, which started with the incuse format (customary in this region) and
               later, after a period whose length has been estimated largely by conjecture, changed to the double-relief form (customary elsewhere in the Greek
               world). Little if any effort to place the double-relief staters in order had been made previously; for example, the engraved reproductions of
                  <name type="pname">Carelli</name> and <name type="pname">Garrucci</name> are deplorably inaccurate and inadequate.</p>
            <p>As most students of the coinage of South Italy know, it was the practice of many of these mints to continue using the survivor of a pair of dies
               with the newly cut die which replaced the outworn one. Because the upper die had to withstand greater stress, it usually broke before the lower
               one whose longer life was due to the bolstering or buttressing <pb n="2"/> it received from the anvil in which it was set. Although there is
               little data other than the coins to tell us anything regarding the material from which the dies were made, we do find that the anvil die would
               often outlast three punch dies and sometimes more. Once this has been recognized it is possible to build up groups of connected dies—GROUPS which
               often reach considerable extent. By employing other criteria, such as the evidence provided by hoards, or the recurrence of symbols probably to
               be identified as the badges of magistrates, it is possible to eliminate doubt as to which of two groups must have preceded the other. When all
               the data has been gathered, a sequence frequently may be established which carries conviction except for the placement of a relatively few
               singletons for which no connecting combinations exist as yet. Generally, the interpolation of these is unlikely to affect radically the final
               arrangement.</p>
            <p>The sequence submitted here does not claim finality. Perhaps an unpublished variety in possession of some fortunate collector will be all that is
               needed to clarify uncertainty in the arrangement. Among the double-relief staters there are many known by a single specimen only, and since some
               of the flans are too small for the dies, the symbol and the form of the inscription are often uncertain. The coins show that dies were often used
               after cracks or fissures had developed and long beyond the point at which they would have been discarded in larger or better regulated mints. It
               is the growth of these defects, however, which frequently dispels any doubt as to which of the accompanying dies, whether obverse or reverse,
               precedes the other.</p>
            <p>There is some ground for the feeling that the date in the <hi rend="italic">Historia Numorum</hi> for the beginnings of coinage at Caulonia (550)
               is too early. It would be most helpful if we could fix the date for the change at this mint to coins having both sides in relief and the hoard
               from South Italy appended (p. 59) provides reason for placing this before 473 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> The bronze coins of Caulonia are to
               be dated shortly before the city's destruction; they are of very great rarity. The introduction of symbols in addition to the type occurs soon
               after the change from incuse to double-relief. These symbols precede the introduction of single letters, which herein are usually considered to
               be the initials of die-cutters. At Caulonia these do not extend beyond a two-letter form.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>

               <hi rend="bold">THE TYPE</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A consideration of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia's</name> coin type should precede the catalogue. A discussion of the
               interpretations will show the thorniness of the problem. There is very little evidence that is new. Even the excavation of the site by Orsi<ref
                  target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> was disappointing in that it disclosed little of significance for our purposes.</p>
            <p>A careful description of the coin type is given by Macdonald:<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> "Naked male figure, standing with one foot planted in
               advance of the other; hair bound with diadem and falling in ringlets; in raised right hand a branch; on left arm, which is outstretched, a small
               figure running forward with head turned back, holding a branch in each hand; in front, a stag on basis, with head reverted." The identification
               of the larger figure as Apollo seems to be generally agreed upon, <ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> but several differing interpretations exist
               concerning the identification of the smaller figure. <ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref> Head, offering an unique interpretation to both figures,
               states the following: <q>"I am inclined to believe that the original name of the town (Kαμλών) may have had a simpler though humbler origin in
                  (Kαμλ ός), a vegetable with a single stalk, such for instance as the <hi rend="italic">Pastinaca sativa</hi>, a tall erect plant the stalk of
                  which is flanked by a row of pinnate leaves. The roots of this plant have been cultivated from very remote times as a valuable esculent.
                  Subsequenly, here as elsewhere, a nobler origin and an eponymous <hi rend="italic">oekist</hi> would naturally be sought for and identified as
                  Kανλος, son of the Amazon Kleite; and the local plant would be assigned to him as an emblem, just as the σέλινον leaf became the emblem of the
                  eponymous hero of Selinus. On the coins of Caulonia the principal figure would thus represent the mythical founder holding in his raised right
                  hand the παρ άσημον of the city, and on his left arm a small genius running at full speed and carrying apparently the same emblem in each
                  hand. If the earliest coins of Caulonia, like those of so many other cities, were chiefly used on special occasions, e.g., recurrent agonistic
                  festivals ..., then the small running genius with winged feet may have been intended for a personification of 'Аγών or Hermes άγώνιος or
                  δρόμιος ...<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If Head's statement on the founding of Caulonia shows but little connection between the legendary beginning and the coin type, his explanation of
               that type shows its significance to be far from obvious and his usual acumen in analyzing published opinions to be lacking. This reasoning, based
               as it is on a series of assumption, discloses its weakness as soon as the initial premise—the identification of the branch—is challenged. The
               size of <pb n="4"/> this growth is more similar to the laurel than to the <hi rend="italic">pastinaca sativa</hi>. Furthermore, the leaves on the
               coin are pinnate whereas those of the <hi rend="italic">pastinaca sativa</hi> are irregular.</p>
            <p>The large standing figure is identified by <name type="pname">Raoul-Rochette</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> as Apollo. He points out that such a nude, virile figure is to be identified, if this is possible, by the
               distinguishing attributes and peculiarities or symbols. The long hair of this beardless figure, as well as the diadem, are of a form which can be
               associated with the youthful Apollo. He feels that the small figure is "Katharmos" a personification of the genius of lustration and rejects
               Hermes, Perseus, and Boreas as possibilities. The subordination of the winged figure to that of Apollo precludes the suggestion of Hermes and the
               absence of a single occurrence the caduceus among the symbols on the coinage of the city is surely conclusive evidence that the figure is not
               Hermes. The lustral branches make it unlikely that this figure is Perseus as does the absence of further symbols associated with him.</p>
            <p>Boreas, however, seems a preferable identification for the smaller figure to Lloyd. <ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> He endeavors to connect it with
               the tradition quoted by Pausanias<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> that Caulonia was founded under the leadership of Typhon of Aegium. An
               unconvincing effort to connect Typhon with the <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> of stormy winds is not pressed, but support is claimed from the name
               given to Cape Zephyrius (between Caulonia and Locri) as the indication of a local cult of this particular wind-god.</p>
            <p>It is possible that due to certain climatic conditions Caulonia's <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> type was a wind-god. The coin type of another
               southern Italian town reflects its climatic conditions; e.g., Metapontum used the ear of barley which was an indication of its agricultural
               wealth. Caulonia, situated on the coast in a mountainous region, seems to have derived its chief source of wealth from the nearby forests.
               Apparently this town enjoyed a rather constant water supply furnished by the streams Alaros on the south and Precariti (the modern name) on the
               north. <ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> Lying on the southern slope of the watershed, Caulonia was in the lee and consequently protected from the
               west and northwest winds in the winter. During the remainder of the year a sea breeze tempered the heat<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> and the
               south and southeast winds prevailed at that time. These favorable conditions may possibly have been attributed by the Cauloniates to a
               wind-god.</p>
            <p>Each figure on the coin carries a lustral branch, an essential part of every sacrifice. <ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> Could these branches
               indicate that Caulonia was cleansed from a pestilence? This is not true of the healthy and prosperous Croton whose later type shows Herakles <hi
                  rend="italic">Oikistas</hi> holding a lustral branh<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> as <hi rend="italic">Raoul-Rochette</hi>
               <ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> points out. Although southern Italy is know to have been conducive to miasmatic conditions, the fact that
               Caulonia was surrounded by forests and had adequate drainage facilities would seem to indicate that she enjoyed healthful <pb n="5"/> conditions.
               We may therefore the more warrantably concur with <name type="pname">Raoul-Rochett's</name> belief that the coin type did not refer to the city's
               having been cleansed from a pestilence.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Robinson</name>, in discussing the association on coins of olive and bay with the head of Apollo as signifying his function as
               god of midday light and heat, recently suggested the following interpretation regarding the coin type in question: <q>It may be suggested that
                  this aspect of the god was well-known in this particular corner of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, and should
                  also be recognized in the familiar coin type of neighboring Kaulonia: a youthful figure striding with a branch in his hand and with a
                  secondary figure, sometimes with winged heels, also holding branches, running along his outstretched arm (Traité III 1, Pl. LXX 14–5, Pl. LXXI
                  1–5). This figure has from time to time been interpreted as a river-god, but the deer that always accompanies him should mark him for Apollo;
                  the lustral branch which he is swinging is the means of fertility, and the little winged figure on his arm symbolizes the same power as the
                  swastika or triskeles, to which incidentally it bears some resemblance. It is interesting to note in this connection that on an early
                  Kaulonian obol (<hi rend="italic">B.M.C. Italy</hi>, p. 336, No. 16) Apollo as type is replaced by the triskeles, and that on a group of late
                  fifth-century staters the hair of the striding figure is deliberately treated so that the locks rise from his head like rays...<ref
                     target="#CH2-n15">15</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The resemblance of the <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> to a swastika or triskeles and the interpretation of the lustral branch as a "means of
               fertility" do not cary fullness of conviction.</p>
            <p>These divergent conceptions by four distinguished numismatists show how difficult it is to arrive at a convincing exposition of the meaning of
               the type. Let us conclude merely that the chief figure is probably that of Apollo, presented as the city's founder, that the <hi rend="italic"
                  >daimon</hi> figure still eludes identification, and that the stag is the <hi rend="italic">parasemon</hi> of the city.</p>
            <p>For some time students of Greek sculpture and numismatics have questioned whether this coin type was originated by a die-cutter or was derived
               from a sculptural prototype. Percy Gardner rejects the latter suggestion when he writes, "exact and servile imitations of things (statues)
               however beautiful did not suggest itself to the mind of the artists who executed coin dies..." and concludes, "as long as Greek art was alive, an
               exact or slavish copy of a statue or a relief was all but unknown"<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> Regling holds a similar view but at the same
               time he feels that the persistence of a coin type almost unchanged for 150 years may indicate derivation from a statu. <ref target="#CH2-n17"
                  >17</ref>
               <name type="pname">Raoul-Rochett</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> as well as Macdonald<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> consider the latter as a possibility only in the case of the
               Apollo figure. Macdonald, however, rejects the idea that the stag might be an integral part of a group because it rests upon a separate
               groundline. <ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> But the attitude of dependancy or expectancy to be seen on the part of the small figure and on that
               of the stag seem to me to indicate a relationship between them. Such an attitude is retained even by the crudest die-cutters up to the time of
               the disappearance of the two figures from the obverse. The separate groundline of the stag might even be taken to support the possibility of a
               sculptural prototype.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> figure is in opposition to any consideration of the obverse types as derived from a group sculptured in the
               round because of the technical difficulty of supporting it mechanically. Nor do known remains of other groups provide a satisfactory analogy. The
                  <pb n="6"/> colored terra cottas found at Locri by Orsi, <ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref> may have been inspired by such an earlier monumental
               relief. The remarkable metopes found at Paestum in recent years by <name type="pname">Dr. Zanconi Montuori</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> demonstrate how limited the known examples of sculpture from Magna Graecia are, and suggest that important
               additions to what we know may be awaiting excavation at this site or at the sites of other Greek cities in Italy. But even on the earliest of the
                  <hi rend="italic">incusi</hi> at Caulonia, the treatment of the reverse details, especially the delineation of Apollo's long locks of hair,
               remind one of the like care taken with the folds of the <hi rend="italic">chlamys</hi> worn by Poseidon on the reverses of the incuse staters of
               Poseidona. <ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> And certainly the way in which the lustral fillet hangs over the arm of the figure on the latest
               staters (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XIV and XX) implies that the figure is inanimate. As for the stag, the attachment of a long and thin
               fillet (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 139–unique piece from <name type="pname">Mr. Newell's</name> collection) as well as the wreath about
               the stag's neck (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> VI and VII, 69–70, 72–75, and 77) also seem reasonable as additions to a statue and difficult
               otherwise to explain as accessories of the type. On only a few of the staters with both sides in relief is the animal represented as moving (<hi
                  rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IX, 102–3, 106, 110–114).</p>
            <p>Although these conditions may not be enough to <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> that the type of Caulonia was originally inspired by a sculptural
               prototype, they do show, it seems to me, that such a derivation is admissible.</p>
            <p>The completed form, KAVΛO<graphic url="NS9_sym1.jpg"/>IATAM, which does not occur until well along in Caulonia's coinage, is analogous to what is
               found on the coins of neighboring Croton, Poseidonia, and Sybaris (in a single instance). The inscription occurs sometimes on the obverse and
               sometimes on the reverse, and sometimes singularly enough, it occurs on both. Variants include the interchanging of the letters O and Ω, and also
               the final <graphic url="NS9_sym1.jpg"/> and M (i.e., a prostrate Σ). The customary form of Σ occurs on the coins of the last group in this study.
               None of the known specimens of nos. 119-23, 160, and 161 show any inscription. Macdonald, in discussing the significance of inscripionss on
               ancient coins, mentions that the characteristically Italiot use of the nominative singular adjective of the national name standing by itself is
               found on Caulonia's coins among othes. <ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> In the double-relief coinage with Apollo on the obverse and the stag on
               the reverse one might supply the words "<hi rend="italic">oekist</hi>" and "<hi rend="italic">parasemon</hi>" respectively—thereby rendering the
               readings "(this is the) Caulonian (oekist)" and "(this is the) Caulonian (<hi rend="italic">parasemon</hi>)."</p>
            <p>The coinage of Caulonia has two clear-cut divisions; namely, incuse and double-relief. The <hi rend="italic">incusi</hi> are separable according
               to flan-diameters. Four steps or gradations are distinguishable. The broadest flan-diameters are found on the earliest coins and the changes to
               smaller flan-diameters are abrupt rather than gradua1. The last incuse staters approximate in size the first double-relief coins as well as
               contemporary coins of the neighboring cities of Croton, Metapontum, and Tarentum, <ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> and the Sicilian mints of
               Agrigentum, Gela, Leontini and Syracuse, as the overstrikes testify.</p>

               <p>Cf. <hi rend="italic">NSc</hi>, 1912, 1913, 1915. These excavations afford evidence regarding the temple and the walls of the city. Of the
                  former, the floor and the foundations alone remain, but it was possible to reconstruct a peripteral structure with a fa�ade of six columns,
                  having a roof of Parian marble tiles. This may be an indication that the wealth of the city was greater than the extent of its coinage would
                  have led one to suppose. The city's walls were constructed of boulders from the beds of the streams on either side of the site.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The Caulonian <hi rend="italic">incusi</hi> are herein sub-divided into four groups. The first, and the largest numerically, uses the largest
                  flan (c. 30 mm.). Throughout this group, the inscription is limited to the first four letters of the city's name, and it occurs on the obverse
                  only. Fifteen obverse dies with twenty-seven reverses have heen distinguished. On the reverse, the outlined figure of the <hi rend="italic"
                     >daimon</hi>, being incised in the die, would have been susceptible to possible deepening, but neither this nor any other modificaionn has
                  been detected. Throughout this group, the obverse has a cable border, with the possible exception of no. 25 on which the border is not
                  preserved.</p>
               <p>Some justification for the order within Group A should be submitted. These staters will be seen to have their inscriptions in larger letters
                  than are to be found for the succeeding group. Of these letters, the V is different in the later coins of Group A, where it takes a curved
                  form which resembles Y. There is also support for this sequence in the posture of Apollo. On what have been considered the earlier pieces he
                  is shown with his right heel raised, giving a sense of forward movement. For the pieces on Plate II, and notably on nos. 23–25 of <hi
                     rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, both feet are flat on the groundline, thereby lessening the feeling of movement. The frontal eye on both
                  obverse and reverse is consistently present. The order of the first four pieces on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I is determined by the
                  die-flaw between the initial letters of the inscription. The break behind the head of Apollo, not to be seen in no. 1, is present in nos.
                  2–4.</p>
               <p>The intriguing changes in the posture of the reverse <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> should be noted. There is a slight shrinkage in the
                  diameter of the flan so that the transition to Group II is less noticeable than between Groups II and III. In this shrinkage, it is the
                  borders which suffer.</p>
               <p>Nos. 11–15 come into position because the branches held in each hand of the <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> are minimized as though their
                  significance has been lost. Again, because this figure wears a chlamys it is less simple and direct than in the earlier form. For no. 15, the
                     <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> figure has been omitted from the reverse, a condition which recurs in succeeding groups. The reverses of only
                  twro dies (nos. 1 and 11) show this figure carrying a branch. Can the reason for this omission have been that it offered more complication
                  than the die-cutter was willing to face?</p>
               <p>Of the pieces on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> II and III (nos. 16–26), a sharply bent left arm distinguishes nos. 23–25, with the fore-arm
                  slanting upward instead of horizontal as heretofore. No. 20 is a variety which Garrucci<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref> desribes from a
                  specimen in his possession as bearing in tiny letters IKETEΣI(A). The first three of these letters are read by him to the left of the head of
                  Apollo and parallel with his arm; the other four follow the rim in front of the stag. The specimens which I have examined show that this
                  reading is unwarranedd and fanciful.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Throughout this group the flans are slightly reduced and a tiny circle or annulet, usually with a pellet in its center, is frequently placed
                  above the obverse stag. This is usually and perhaps correctly identified as the letter <hi rend="italic">theta</hi>, although Regling reads it
                  as the fifth letter of the ethnic. <ref target="#CH3-n27">27</ref> This letter, if it is a letter, also occurs on the reverses of nos. 27, 29,
                  34(?), 35, 36 and 39–40, but is is not uniformly placed. These reverse occurrences and the well-defined central dot preclude associating it
                  with the ethnic. Another letter, resembling epsilon or digamma retrograde, occurs between the feet of Apollo on one obverse die (37-39) and is
                  also found on the reverse of one of the varieties associated with this die (nos. 39–40). The first four letters of the city's name occur on
                  the reverses with three exceptions (nos. 21, 28, 29). The assignment of the varieties at the beginning of the group is due to their retention
                  of the cable border. This is almost immediately replaced by a border with dots between two linear circles. Besides this, these first three
                  varieties share with the latest issues of Group A the omission of any reverse inscription. To replace the <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> on the
                  reverse, Apollo is sometimes given a second lustral branch (nos. 30–32, 36, 39), the branch held over his shoulder being indicated very
                  summarily throughout the group. No. 36 has a branch in front of the stag.</p>

               <p>This group hardly deserves the distinction of being classed separately, since there are but five varieties with a single obverse die. The
                  shrinkage of flan is now more marked (27–26 mm.). The inscription is in five letters and now appears on both obverse and reverse. A
                  long-necked water bird resembling a swan replaces the letter above the rump of the stag. None of the five reverses omit the <hi rend="italic"
                     >daimon</hi> figure, which, however, does not have the linear outline previously customary.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The last of the four incuse groups shows further shrinkage of the flan (from 24 to 21 mm. for the smallest) and a growing crudity in the
                  die-cutting, especially for the reverses (cf., no. 58). The ethnic, usually occurring with three letters but sometimes with five letters, is
                  confined to the obverse except for nos. 49, 53, 54, 56, and 57. On nos. 59, 60 and possibly 61, a heron or crane occupies the reverse space
                  usually reserved for the inscription, paralleling the procedure at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_croton">Croton</name>. The interval
                  between may have been considerable since almost all of the refinements of the incuse process seem to have been forgotten.</p>
               <p>Certain of the technical features of these incuse staters call for comment. In their beginnings, there is little or nothing that might be
                  called primitive about either the type or the workmanship. The incuse format itself marks an advanced stage in coining, and although at <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name> this might be explained by its having been borrowed from Croton, this can hardly
                  be claimed for the type. For analogy regarding the type, we must go to Poseidonia, where the figure of Poseidon immediately reminds one of the
                  heroic statue <pb n="9"/> found in the sea of Cape Artemesion. <ref target="#CH3-n28">28</ref> As has been mentioned, Regling makes a specific
                  exception of the Caulonia and Poseidonia types in formulating his opinion that the die-cutters did not draw their inspiration from statues
                  until the Hellenistic period. <ref target="#CH3-n29">29</ref> In studying the composition or design of the Caulonia type, we note the
                  effectiveness with which it fills the circular field, the nice placement of the inscription and the <hi rend="italic">daimon's</hi> figure,
                  and, not least, the proportions of the stag. The avoidance of awkwadnesss in the Apollo figure commands admiration—the torso frontal, the head
                  and lower limbs in profile. The shortening of the right arm is disguised by the hair tresses, so that the contrast is less noticeable.</p>
               <p>By comparison, the earliest issues of Poseidonia are less finished and much more primitive than those of Caulonia. For Croton, there are too
                  few elements in common to permit a decision as to difference in incidence. We do not know how long the disaster at the River Sagras antedated
                  the coinage beginnings at Croton (Head dates the latter as 550 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>). Croton must have suffered a severe setback,
                  however, in which Caulonia would have shared, being within a short distance from the Sagras. At Caulonia, such refinements as the cutting of
                  the small-scale <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> suggest an interval between the coinage on which it first appears and those of the other cities
                  using the incuse convention. Moreover, the outlining of this figure on the reverses is a technicality not found at Metapontum until well along
                  in the coinage of that city. These conditions point to an earlier beginning at Metapontum, it seems to me, but there is not yet sufficient
                  data for establishing how much earlier.</p>

               <p>In submitting the reasoning behind the arrangement of the double-relief staters, it is fortunate that for the purposes of comparison this
                  group does not greatly overrun a single plate. In one of the fasciculi<ref target="#CH4-n30">30</ref> of the <hi rend="italic">Sylloge</hi>,
                  the type for the reverse with the branch in front of the stag (here Group F) is given precedence over this group (E), and for that reason the
                  cause for differing should be made clear. In Group E, the obverse inscriptions are of three letters only whereas in Group F they are
                  consistently of four letters. The cable border, a convention inherited from the incuse format, gives place to a dotted border before we reach
                  the end of Group E. Whether the branch characteristic of Group F is considered a symbol or part of the type may be open to question, but the
                  varieties without this accessory are more likely to precede than to follow its introduction, and stylistically, they come earlier rather than
                  later.</p>
               <p>The arrangement within the group is simplfiied by the die combinations which dictate the sequence. I have found but seven obverses combined
                  with sixteen reverses; there must be further dies not represented. No. 62 is placed at the very beginning because of the form of its reverse
                  rim and because 64a which immediately follows (by reason of the scale of the inscription letters) occurs in the hoard discussed hereafter (cf.
                  p. 59). This stater is the latest of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name> issues in that hoard — along with it
                  is a single double-relief stater of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_poseidonia">Poseidonia</name>. The hoard must have been secreted not long after the transition to the double-relief form had
                  taken place at Caulonia and Poseidonia, and to judge from the staters of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</name> and Croton in this hoard, before the change took place at
                  those two cities. The small-scale letters of the inscription for Group E give place almost immediately to larger ones. The reverses of this
                  group bear no inscription. Those showing the <hi rend="italic">parasemon</hi> of the city with a wreath about the neck of the stag (nos. 69,
                  69a, 69d and 70) are joined to obverses also combined with a wreathless stag which show by the lessened wear of the obverse die that the
                  wreathless form preceded the other, as was to be anticipated. Finally, no. 62 has a reverse, unique among double-relief staters, which has a
                  countersunk rim bearing a border of dots — a form obviously derived from the rim of the incuse reverses. The border of dots on the reverse
                  which immediately follows is minimized at first, but attains decorative importance in Group F.</p>

               <p>In Group F both obverses and reverses bear inscriptions. In addition the reverses have either a leaf or a branch in front of the stag. The
                  sequence is achieved by working backwards. No. 101, which has the longest inscriptions so far, is placed last because a tendency toward longer
                  inscriptions becomes common in the following group. It also shares the same <pb n="11"/> obverse die with no. 100, where there is a complex of
                  branches on the reverse. Because nos. 88–90 are closely copied from no. 87, the complex of branches is simpler for no. 87 than for the
                  following dies. It is reasonable that the simpler branch should precede the more complicated form, and although we may not determine the
                  progression die by die, it is fairly certain. This suggested evolution is confirmed by changes in the inscriptions, by the placement of the
                     <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> figure, and by the proportions of the stag on both obverse and reverse. It is not certain that nos. 78 and
                  79, with the leaf instead of the branch, belong at the beginning of the group. The three letter reverse inscription and the scale of the stag
                  seem to entitle them to precedence.</p>

               </head>
               <p>There is a marked change in style between this group and Group F. If the arrangement submitted is correct, there is a clear indication of an
                  extended interval between nos. 101 and 102. In this group both the figures of the obverse Apollo and the reverse stag, instead of having their
                  customary quiet pose, are represented in motion with a vigor little short of violence, alternating with and ultimately returning to a static
                  position. There is notable improvement in the die-cutting which seems to partake of the new vigor in the types. Another innovation is the
                  introduction of symbols or accessories to the type. Except for the reverse of no. 102 these are placed on the obverse. For the succeeding
                  group, these additions are made on the reverse.</p>
               <p>Within the coining interval for this group, the <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> figure disappears. Although it had previously been minimized to
                  some extent, it here reaches a limit of crudity and unintelligibility (cf. enlargements of nos. 104 and 107 on Plates XIX and XX
                  respectively). The <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> figure is omitted from nos. 105, 106, 116 and 117 while there are possible traces on nos. 110
                  and III. On no. 104 the stag is badly placed and on no. 105 which shares the same reverse there is no stag at all. The stag is again omitted
                  on the obverses of nos. 110 and 111. Another change is so casual that it might easily evade observation. The obverse stag, up to this time,
                  has been shown with head reverted, indicating a dependent relationship to Apollo. Beginning with no. 112 the stag's head is like that on the
                  reverse — forward looking — and, except in no. 118, continues in this position.</p>
               <p>The order reached is best explained by working backward from no. 117. Nos. 115–117 have a common reverse and on this reverse, the progression
                  of the die break shows that this must be the order. Nos. 113–115 share the same obverse die, the deterioration of which gives this sequence.
                  The bounding stag of nos. 110–113 ties them together. On nos. 107–109, the reverse stag is stationary but the obverse figure of Apollo is not.
                  It agrees perfectly with either no. 106 which precedes or no. 110 which follows. Nos. 105 and 106 (same obverse) have contrasting reverse
                  stags while a common reverse brings no. 104 into place. Nos. 102 and 103 have a common obverse, the latter being more worn. Perhaps the leaves
                  on the reverse of no. 102 are a stylization of the branch of Group F rather than a symbol. On the obverse of no. 116, the spray of three
                  leaves seems to be the prototype of the reverse spray on nos. 118–126, although two berries have been added to the latter.</p>
               <p>The additions to the obverse type for this group are very interesting, partly because they successfully elude classification. Their nature is
                  quite different from the more personal <pb n="12"/> symbols (plough, star, oinochoe, etc.) which are accompanied by the initials of the names
                  of magistrates on the late fourth century staters of Metapontum. In the fifth century there are paralells or analogies to the Metapontine
                  symbols. Their occurrence on the reverse generally gives them a less obvious relation or connection with the main type. For if the reverse
                  branch which is common to Group F at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name> is a symbol for woods or the forest (a
                  natural enough connotation to indicate the habitat of the stag), the branch added to the obverse of nos. 110 and 111 would have the same
                  significance, although its appropriatenesss or relation to Apollo is less clear. The connection between the conventionalized tree form on no.
                  107 and the obverse stag is almost obvious, but the sprig on the reverse of no. 102 is so conventionalized as to deprive it of any connection
                  with the stag. The wreath on no. 112 and the birds on nos. 105 and 113 are less easily associated with Apollo although the birds are logical
                  enough as wild life. Moreover, on no. 108 the mask of a fox or hind in a frame of branches would have the same implication.</p>
               <p>We thus have an indication that the regularity which had marked Group F has yielded to a period of innovation in Group G, a characteristic
                  which carries over into Group H to a lessened degree.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Whereas Group F was marked by the branch on the reverses, this group is distinguished by a twig or spray with berries or a single leaf. The
                     <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi>, which disappeared in the preceding group, is also completely lacking here. There seems to be a slight
                  deterioration in the die cutting and notable changes in the treatment of the inscription, including its omission from both obverse and reverse
                  on nos. 119–123. The figure of Apollo is generally smaller in scale, and the sense of movement on both sides which marked the issues of Group
                  G has quite disappeared by the end of Group H. The die mulings bring into close relationship several pieces which one would have hesitated to
                  associate otherwise.</p>
               <p>The ten pieces placed at the beginning of this group, as already noted, have in common a spray of three leaves and two berries in the field of
                  the reverse. It seems reasonable to see in the three-leaved twig on the obverse of no. 116 the prototype of this reverse symbo1.
                  Stylistically, these initial reverses of Group H are inferior to those of nos. 115–117 which fact may imply an interval between nos. 117 and
                  118. Die combinations and progressing die breaks dictate the order shown as will be seen from the diagram of die combinations.</p>
               <p>No. 118 shows a reversion to an earlier form in that the head of the obverse stag is turned back. As with Group G, we occasionally find
                  obverse additions. On nos. 121–123 there is a large insect (in my judgment not a cicada) which also occurs on nos. 127–129, possibly
                  indicating a closer relation between these coins although the mulings seem to indicate the contrary. The reverse symbol on no. 129 is a tree
                  which is far more conventionalized than the other tree forms described previously. On nos. 130 and 131 the reverse spray is given a summary
                  treatment, which marks a time separation from the form used on nos. 118–126.</p>
               <p>In the discussion of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name>'s type I gave reasons for thinking that the placing of the
                  stag in the field with a separate groundline was perhaps an indication that the two figures had been inspired by a local cult statue of Apollo
                  accompanied by a stag with some <pb n="13"/> traditional implication impossible to follow now. In Group G we find the stag's groundline, which
                  had persisted throughout the incuse format, undergoing a change. On nos. 107–109 and 112 there is something resembling the capital of a column
                  beneath the stag. On nos. 130–135 this support has been modified so that it is very much like a statue-basis having high and narrow
                  proportions. On nos. 124–126, however, this basis, which ordinarily is crowned by the figure of the stag, bears a strange animal without
                  antlers and with a huge head which is lowered in somewhat the same way as the head of the charging bull on the staters of Thurium is
                  represented. Gross carelessness seems a more likely explanation than an intentional substitution for the figure of the stag.</p>
               <p>Many of the varieties in this group are known in a single or in a small number of specimens, and no. 139 is one of the former. Inscriptions,
                  although worn and in shortened forms, are present for both dies. The fillets hanging from the antlers of the stag, however, give this piece
                  its greatest distinction. Their delicate linear treatment is best seen in the enlargement on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIX.
                  Stylistically, the spread legs of this stag are like those of certain others in this group. The size of the letters of the inscription might
                  give it a placement earlier in the group than is shown here.</p>
               <p>Only two specimens of no. 140 are known to exist; one is in Paris and the other in Naples. These have long been known and <name type="pname"
                     >Raoul-Rochett</name>
                  <ref target="#CH4-n31">31</ref> has written about this type. Although I have included these coins, I consider them suspect. Looking at the
                  reverse first, one notices the rectangular position of the inscription with three letters in a vertical line, which is unlike any found
                  elsewhere in this city's coinage. The position of the stag's antlers is an awkward one when the stance with the spread forelegs is employed.
                  It is the obverse, however, that is most questionable. Both the thick groundline and the heavy, clumsy body of Apollo standing upon it are in
                  contrast to the presentation we have come to know. Moreover, such a clutter of symbols is not found elsewhere. The fountain is not unlike one
                  on the reverse of nos. 155–157, but the lion's-head water spout would more appropriately empty into a basin or pool as it does on the staters
                  of Terina than into a stationary font. In the right field there is an ithyphallic herm facing to right with a filleted bucranium above it.
                  These are unrelated to the figure of Apollo or to each other, and suggest a hand or a mind that is not Greek. The whole design, if such it can
                  be called, bears the earmarks of the counterfeiters of a century or more ago.</p>
               <p>It should be noted that die combinations unknown to me may alter the arrangement submitted. For example, nos. 127–129 with the obverse insect,
                  and nos. 130–131 with the reverse leaves and berries may come later rather than where they have been placed. The reverse letters ΔE on no. 127
                  and Δ on no. 128 might with equal appropriateness entitle these dies to a place in Group I, and the long vertical inscription in tiny letters
                  on the obverse of nos. 130–131 might follow rather than precede nos. 132–134.</p>

               <p>This group, as was true of some of the preceding classes, provides evidence that the mint of this city was not a large one and that strict
                  regularity of procedure, whether stylistic or mechanical, is lacking. As in previous groups, die combinations bring together staters <pb
                     n="14"/> which have little else in common (cf. nos. 150–151). For this group an ivy leaf symbol is to be found on either obverse or reverse
                  of some of the pieces. Other symbols such as the crab, wreath or octopus occur sometimes with the leaf on the same die and sometimes with the
                  leaf on the combining die. The letter <hi rend="italic">phi</hi> (is this a signature such as we find at Terina?) is usually of moderate size.
                  It is found beneath the right arm of Apollo on no. 142, below the base line of the stag on nos. 143–147 and on the reverses of nos. 149–151
                  and 154 The letter <hi rend="italic">theta</hi>, larger in scale, appears on the obverse of no. 150 and in the form ӨE on the obverses of nos.
                  152–153 and on the reverses of nos. 155–158, as well as on the bronze pieces (nos. 233–234).</p>
               <p>The inscriptional data are puzzling, differing forms sometimes occurring on the same stater. As early as nos. 101 and 102 we have the fifth
                  letter, an <hi rend="italic">omicron</hi>. This is repeatedly changed to an <hi rend="italic">omega</hi> on later dies (nos. 124–125, 130–131,
                  135, 139, 146, 150, 152, 170–178, 180–181). The final letter of the inscription when given in full, is sometimes N, sometimes M (the prostrate
                     <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi>), and on the last dies, <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> in its normal form. The archaic form of the <hi
                     rend="italic">iota</hi> (three-stroke) here persists as late as no. 166. <ref target="#CH4-n32">32</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There are other irregularities. The obverse stag is sometimes present, sometimes not. In the earlier pieces of the group, he resembles a goat
                  more than a deer. The stag's size differs widely. The figure of Apollo grows steadily heavier — almost pugilistic. His attitude of striding
                  becomes one of running in nos. 158 — 161. His hair is usually short, but in nos. 153–154, tresses over his shoulder are clear. A knot at the
                  back of the head is visible in nos. 162–163. The branch in his right hand interferes with the inscription in nos. 141–145 and, consequently,
                  is so modified that it would scarcely be recognized as a branch if there were no other dies to establish this intention. The reverse stag is
                  frequently heavy and wooden and faces left rather than right in no. 161.</p>
               <p>The accessories to the type are intriguing; e.g., the bird with upraised wings in a font on the reverse of nos. 155–156, and on the obverse of
                  no. 155 what seems to be an altar (cf. enlargements on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XX). The palmettes at its corners, the strut and the
                  manner in which the legs are joined to the top indicate a structure made of meta1.</p>
               <p>On the obverse of nos. 153–154 there are long fillets tied to both arms of Apolllo. <ref target="#CH4-n33">33</ref> I know of no parallel to
                  explain the purpose of these fillets. The tetrobols on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV afford a hint. On no. 216, which is connected with
                  this group by the presence of the letter Φ, the obverse die is first used without the fillet, and then with the fillet. Is it possible that
                  fillets such as this have been added to the city's cult statue (which may originally have inspired the coin type) during an agonistic
                  celebration, and have been used on the coinage with this commemorative implication? This is but one of the unresolved questions raised by
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name>'s coinage.</p>

               <p>Both the die combinations and the style of these coins leave hardly any alternative as to the order submitted. The <hi rend="italic"
                     >top-knotted Apollo</hi> continues on the earliest staters in this group (nos. 162–163), giving way to a god with clipped hair which bears
                  some resemblance <pb n="15"/> to a wig. On nos. 158–161 there is a running Apollo which is replaced on nos. 162–166 by a figure standing with
                  the weight on the left foot, a much more awkward stance than that of the striding Apollo to which we had become accustomed, and to which there
                  is a return in nos. 168–181. The heavy-bodied figure continues to the end of the coinage.</p>
               <p>The additions to the type are mostly on the obverse; e.g., turtle, dolphins, star and fibula. There are also large single letters — A on the
                  reverse of nos. 168–173, Ө on the obverse of nos. 173–175, and E on the reverse of no. 175. If these letters are initials of die cutters,
                  those with one letter on the obverse and another on the reverse would show that there were two engravers working concurrently, an indication
                  of a stepped-up coinage which is supported by the relatively large number of surviving specimens of nos. 179 and 180. The significance of the
                  two dolphins is difficult to fathom. The fillet laid across the arm of Apollo on the obverse of the last type is of a familiar form; i.e.,
                  wool with terminal tassels. The puzzling symbol on nos. 176–181 has never been satisfactorily explained; it does not resemble a fibula any
                  more than it does a bird trap. The increased scale of the letters in the inscriptions is consistent throughout this group as opposed to that
                  of Group I.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">ENLARGEMENTS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The selection of the coins shown on the two plates of enlargements was given careful thought. The arrangement is designed to emphasize some of
               the ideas presented in the preceding text, and therefore it does not follow the sequential order in the catalogue. The liberal, yet limited,
               number shown may be supplemented by the other plates. It would have been highly instructive if a series of enlargements devoted to the <hi
                  rend="italic">daimon</hi> had been included to show the changes in form which occur before final disappearance from the obverse. Two of the
               misunderstood presentations (nos. 73 and 104) appear on these two plates. Enlargements are not so necessary for the incuse staters as they are
               for the smaller double-relief pieces because of their greater flan diameter.</p>
            <p>On nos. 62, 102, 104, 108 and 113 of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIX the increased stride of the main figure is to be noted. This is most
               marked on no. 102, which, in my opinion, provides a clear indication that Apollo was being presented as moving from the very beginning — nearly
               or quite as much so as the subsidiary <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi>. The static stag on the reverse of no. 62, which comes at the very beginning
               of the double relief, changes for only a few dies to a realistic and lively animal (see reverses of nos. 102 and 113). The return to the quiet
               position is observed on no. 139 as well as on no. 155 of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XX.</p>
            <p>Some of the comparisons emphasized extend from one plate to another. The suggested statue basis on no. 108 is to be compared not only with no.
               112 but also with nos. 121 and 124. The addition of the fillet to both obverse and reverse types is shown for the entire bottom row of both
               plates. Its significance is far from obvious; for discussion see page 6 and for descriptions the catalogue entries (105, 139, 153 and
               176–181).</p>
            <p>Several of the enlargements have individual interest. No. 73, for instance, is not overstruck as one might think, but in some manner the die has
               been injured and recut for the injured section. It must have been deplorably bad from the beginning. There are several examples and combinations
               with differing reverses. The stylized tree on no. 107 differs from previous tree forms; compare also the reverse of no. 129. No. 121b is
               noteworthy for the large insect symbol and for the long-haired head of Apollo. No. 112 has a fine wreath which differs from the much later die of
               no. 151. Both obverse and reverse of no. 155 are shown — the obverse to display the altar which seems to be entirely of metal to judge from the
               palmettes and the supports for its top, and the reverse to illustrate the stylized treatment of the antlers of the stag as well as the bird with
               upraised wings in a pedestalled water-basin. The letters ӨE connect this with the obverses of the bronze issues.</p>
            <p>The reverse of the tetrobol (no. 216) shows the <hi rend="italic">kantharos</hi> symbol which does not occur among the staters. Further, the
               fillet of the obverse is a later addition to this die. The fine style of the heads on nos. 231 and 232 deserves attention — I am unable to find
               any parallels from which they might have been derived. Except on the bronze coins, heads such as these do not occur in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name>'s coinage, and as conceptions they are of outstanding quality aside from their originality.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">FRACTIONS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Even though there are fairly clear indications that the four divisions of these fractions are not continuous, no sharp separation exists between
               the two later divisions.</p>
            <p>The coinage of small denominations in the incuse form is not prolific. This condition is similar to that found at Metapontum for its incuse
               coinage. Very few of the incuse fractional issues at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name> examined by me have been in
               good condition; there is seldom one without considerable evidence of circulation. This makes it difficult to find stylistic parallels among the
               incuse staters. The three-leterr obverse inscription on nos. 201 and 202 and the five-letter inscription on nos. 203–205 do not occur among the
               dies of the early staters until Group D (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V). Likewise, the reverse inscriptions such as those of nos. 202
               (mistakenly numbered 203 on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV), 204 and 205 appear relatively late among the staters. The obol bears the
               triskeles for its obverse type (nos. 206 and 207) and this may have been conceived as a correlative of the <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> as
               Robinson suggess. <ref target="#CH6-n34">34</ref> That this issue belongs with the incuse pieces is shown by the reverse border which is like
               that of the staters and tetrobols (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV and no. 208).</p>
            <p>The group which follows (nos. 208–214) with the later issues having the subsidiary branch on the reverse, is interesting for the occasional
               change in orientation for both obverse and reverse types (any significance for which escapes me) and for the minimizing or entire omission of the
                  <hi rend="italic">daimon</hi> figure. The striding attitude is more pronounced here than in the first group. The order within the group
               becomes clear by comparing the rim of no. 208 with that of no. 62 of the staters. This reverse rim, sunken at first, changes to a beaded
               form.</p>
            <p>The third group is significant for the <hi rend="italic">kantharos</hi> symbol which does not occur among the staters known to me. There is a
               further distinctive peculiarity in the fillet which hangs from the arm of Apollo and also in the circumstance that this has been added to a die
               already in use (no. 216). <ref target="#CH6-n35">35</ref> The sprig with two leaves (obv. of no. 217) is also found among the staters (nos.
               120–126) although in the latter occurrence it bears three leaves and two berries.</p>
            <p>The youthful head of the fourth group (nos. 229–232) has been thought by <name type="pname">Gagliardi</name>
               <ref target="#CH6-n36">36</ref> to represent a river god because of the horn-like projection on no. 231. In earlier discussions this head is
               supposed to have had better claim to being that of Apollo. The exquisite style of these dies as well as the ivy leaf symbol on the reverse of no.
               230 (paralleled on nos. 150–152 of the staters) marks them as late in the coinage of the city and therefore not much before 389 <hi
                  rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> I do not trace any notable resemblance to the issues of neighboring mints, with the possible exception of Terina
               where certain staters and late sixths bear a somewhat similar head.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The bronze coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name> present problems, some of which have been outlined admirably
               by <name type="pname">Gagliard</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n37">37</ref> It is generally thought that the introduction of bronze for coins in the
               Greek cities did not much antedate 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH7-n38">38</ref> and since Caulonia was destroyed in 389 <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> these bronzes provide significant data.
               Before the introduction of bronze for coinage small silver coins of low denominations seem to have sufficed for currency needs. Of the four
               bronze pieces cited by <name type="pname">Gagliardi</name>
               <ref target="#CH7-n39">39</ref> two are of the same denomination and a third is an issue which <name type="pname">Garrucci</name>,<ref
                  target="#CH7-n40">40</ref> with strong probability, rejects as the core of a plated coin. <name type="pname">Gagliard</name>
               <ref target="#CH7-n41">41</ref> thinks that this conclusion is less likely because of the patination and the excellent condition of the coin.
               This coin seems to me to be what Regling calls a mystification."<ref target="#CH7-n42">42</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Gagliardi's</name> proposed identification of the head on the fractions and on the bronzes as a river god does not carry
               complete conviction, although the suggestion is an intriguing one.<ref target="#CH7-n43">43</ref> If this theory were correct, it would seem that
               we should have a greater number of appropriately related symbols or other indications associated with a river god than can be cited. The letters
               ӨE which occur on the obverses of two varieties also occur on the staters (nos. 152–159). The scanty number of bronze pieces known is indicative
               of their introduction not long before the destruction of the city.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">PLATED COINS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Plated coins are fairly frequent in the coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name>, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                  >Plate</hi> XVI has been devoted to them. Some of these may prove to be counterfeits which are not ancient; e.g., nos. 8, 11 and 12.</p>
            <p>The first piece is one of the rare, plated <hi rend="italic">incusi</hi>. Comparison with genuine dies will be found rewarding, especially for
               the reverse where the failure to understand the incuse technique is most noticeable in the rim. The silver coating of the torso and left arm is
               wanting.</p>
            <p>Of the thirteen pieces illustrated, the fruit of a fairly exhaustive search, ten of these plated pieces have a branch or branches in front of the
               stag on the reverse, an interesting indication that the coinage with this branch extended over a considerable period. In most instances the hand
               at work is obviously one not familiar with the practices of the mint and betrays itself in one or more of the details; e.g., the over-sized
               letters on the obverse of no. 3, the letter beneath the body of the stag on the reverses of nos. 6 and 8, the obverse stag facing in the wrong
               direction on no. 7, and the form of the lustral branch on no. 12. In addition there is usually the tell-tale break in the silver coating and
               excessive aberrations of weight. This corroboration as to weight is lacking for no. 12, but I believe it is safe to recognize this piece as not a
               genuine one on the basis of comparisons with the authentic types.</p>

            <p>The descriptions in the catalogue which follows are of the respective dies rather than of the particular specimen illustrated which may have been
               selected for its superior condition even though part of the design is off-flan. In some cases all of the known specimens are in poor condition
               because of wear or over-zealous cleaning, in consequence of which the given coin's inscription will have been taken from a specimen which is not
               illustrated. As an example, there is but a single example of no. 155 which gives the reverse inscription. This is shown on the plate of
               enlargements (XX). Occasionally the off-flan portion is supplied by a second variety whose reverse is combined with that of the first.</p>
            <p>The abbreviations will, I trust, be self-evident. The great national collections are indicated by their respective cities — Paris, <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#viaf_2648579">Glasgow</name>, with added citation of
               catalogue numbers, as Glasgow, Hunter 234. "BM-Lloyd SNG 207" is, being interpreted, Specimen in the British Museum, from the Lloyd Bequest,
               illustrated in the Sylloge Numorum Graecorum (Lloyd), No. 207. ANS-ETN indicates that the specimen is in the collection of the American
               Numismatic Society, from the benefaction of <name type="pname">Edward T. Newel</name>.</p>
            <p>The first piece listed is the one illustrated on the plates. When other pieces from the same pair of dies are illustrated an asterisk appears
               before its catalogue listing and its letter has been added to the number on the plates. Those specimens with a dagger before their catalogue
               listings are illustrated in enlarged size on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> XIX-XX and commented upon specifically on p. 16. Reference to
               illustrated auction catalogues is by the name of either the dealer or owner, with the year of the sale, and the number in the catalogue. The
               numbers at the bottom of the plates indicate the die-combinations. Thus 38—39—40 shows that the obverses of 38 and 39 were struck from the same
               die and that the reverses of 39 and 40 come from the same die.</p>

                  ethnic. On the reverse dies of 39 and 40, there is a pellet at the center of the annulet. In view of the preponderence of dies without this
                  pellet, it seems questionable to interpret it as the letter <hi rend="italic">Theta</hi>.</p>

            <p>This hoard is said to have been found in 1929 southeast of Taranto near the coast. The facts known about it have been generously communicated to
               me by a numismatist who wishes his name withheld. According to his information, the hoard did not contain more than thirty-eight coins. Similar
               hoards previously unearthed in South Italy have been inadequately recorded, if at all, and therefore the value of studying this find is enhanced.
               What may be learned from this hoard could probably have been deduced from earlier discoveries if we had an accurate statement regarding them.
               Since almost all of the pieces have been reproduced on the plates and since those not so reproduced have their dies identified with published
               pieces to which reference is comparatively easy, the descriptions have been abbreviated. The entry in the Hoard Bibliography <hi rend="italic"
                  >NNM</hi> 78 is under No. 507. The catalogue follows:</p>

               <p>Because the study of this South Italian hoard had to be made from casts or photographs without reference to the coins themselves except in a
                  few instances, deductions from relative wear are not dependable. Nos. 2, 36 and 37 in double relief are comparatively the sharper. The stater
                  of Poseidonia seems weakly struck rather than worn. The staters of Sybaris show more wear than the earliest staters of Metapontum, and the
                  late small-flan issues of Croton are sharper than the spread-flan varieties. There is, consequently, confirmation of the accepted belief in
                  the gradual constriction of the flans for the coinage of Metapontum and Croton. The presence of the tetradrachm of Gela suggests a
                  relationship between Magna Graecia and Sicily (not sufficiently recognized hitherto) for which over-strikes (cf. no. 36) offer supporting
                  evidence as I have tried to show in a separate paper.<ref target="#CH9-n44">44</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The double-relief stater of Poseidonia (no. 37) along with the one of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caulonia">Caulonia</name> (no. 36)
                  and the Tarentine seated-oekist type (no. 2) have great significance considering the length of the output of their respective mints. Tarentum
                  had always favored the small flan staters <pb n="61"/> except for a brief dallying with the incuse form, which, however, never approached the
                  30 mm. diameter reached by the finest incuse pieces of nearby Metapontum (cf. no. 8). Gela, Agrigentum and Leontini were growing in importance
                  at this time, and all three were putting forth extensive issues of didrachms. Can it be that their example had some influence on Caulonia and
                  Poseidonia? Applying Keary's theory of morphology,<ref target="#CH9-n45">45</ref> the choice of the smaller, thick flanned form might have
                  been induced by competition in a market in which such forms were prevalent. Velia and Naples would have provided this condition for Poseidonia
                  since neither of these cities had struck incuse coins. Only in weight do these coins resemble the Corinthian staters struck at this time.</p>
               <p>As Babelon<ref target="#CH9-n46">46</ref> recognized, the change to the size of the Sicilian didrachms at Metapontum can be dated rather
                  closely, since a Metapontum stater (no. 234) is struck over a scarce didrachm of Syracuse which Boehringer<ref target="#CH9-n47">47</ref>
                  dates after 474 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> If this is so, the Metapontum overstrike would have been struck after 474 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                     >b.c.</hi>; at present a more exact date cannot be determined.</p>
               <p>Considering that the present hoard is said to have been found not far to the southeast of Taranto and near the coast, it seems strange that
                  there should have been only two coins of that city among the thirty-eight. Evans<ref target="#CH9-n48">48</ref> thought that the seated-oekist
                  type was initiated in 473 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, in which year the army of the Tarentines was defeated by the Messapians and many of
                  the younger men of the city were slain. Vlasto<ref target="#CH9-n49">49</ref> dates the introduction of this type as c. 485 <hi
                     rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The oekist-type coin in this hoard shows wear. The style seems to indicate a date earlier than 473 <hi
                     rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Vlasto's date, therefore, seems preferable.</p>
               <p>The defeat of the Tarentines could have provided ample inducement for the secretion of this hoard in 473 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                  numerical preponderance of staters from Metapontum and Croton in a hoard found not far from Tarentum is striking. A fleeing citizen of
                  Tarentum <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have hastily gathered these coins in the belief that they would have been more easily exchangeable than
                  the staters of his own city. The preponderance of issues other than Tarentine might be interpetted as indicating the holdings of a maritime
                  trader. It is difficult, however, to read any significant evidence from the make-up of the accumulation. In any event the staters of Sybaris,
                  destroyed more than two decades previously, must have been still circulating at Tarentum. The total amount, sevent-eight drachms, hardly
                  indicates a wealthy owner. I believe that these sparse findings point to a quick gathering together of resources rather than to savings made
                  over a period of years.</p>
               <p>No close parallel is provided by any of the three comparable published hoards. The Taranto Hoard, to judge from the portion published by
                     Babelon,<ref target="#CH9-n50">50</ref> is earlier, but it gives very little help. The Cittanuova Find (Bibliography 253) is inadequately
                  described and is without illustrations; it seems to have been buried shortly after this one. The Curinga Hoard was found at a considerable
                  distance from Tarentum, and had no Tarentine issues in the portion published — it offers the closest analogies, especially as to the date of
                  buria1. There is the same heavy proportion of Metapontum staters, the same inclusion of a few <pb n="62"/> staters of Sybaris and a showing of
                  the staters of Croton and Caulonia similar to that in this South Italy Hoard. Although the Curinga Hoard is not intact, there is good reason
                  to think that a dependable cross-section is provided in what is recorded. Its burial must have come close to 470 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                     >b.c.</hi>, possibly a little later.</p>
               <p>There would be a step forward if we could use the presence of no. 36 to fix the date for the change at Caulonia from the incuse form to double
                  relief, for we should then have determined the length of the period during which the coinage had both sides in relief, since the date for the
                  destruction of the city in 389/388 is unquestioned. Within these years, a period slightly less than a century, there are seventy-six obverse
                  dies recorded in this study. Since for several years there have been no additions to this list despite diligent searching, additions in any
                  considerable number seem improbable. But to reason that we can estimate the average life of these obverse dies by dividing the number of years
                  in this period by the number of dies is over-simplification. In the first place there are indications that the coinage of this moderate-sized
                  colony of Croton was not continuous. Regling is of the opinion that this was true for Terina, where he records only thirty-eight obverse dies
                  for its entire coinage.<ref target="#CH9-n51">51</ref> Head suggests that in some cities coining may have been coincident with agonistic
                  festivals — periodic rather than annu1.<ref target="#CH9-n52">52</ref> The stater commemorating games in honor of Achelous at Metapontum
                  offers an illustration of such an issue. A group of Caulonian tetrobols have for symbol an amphora, and this symbol does not occur in the
                  stater issues. An interval during which only tetrobols were struck seems highly probable. Secondly a steady or regular supply of silver ore is
                  unlikely. The coinage needs of the city must have varied from year to year. Finally, the obverse die frequently outlived the reverse. There
                  are nineteen combinations of one obverse with two reverses, nine with three and one with no less than six; in consequence there must have been
                  variance in the period during which the individual dies were in use. Under these circumstaness the "life span" can have little chronological
                  dependability.</p>
               <p>It is probable that the defeat of the Tarentines in 473 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> caused the secretion of other accumulation, and the
                  value of our find may be greater for comparison than for its inherent evidence. It clearly seems to indicate that Poseidonia and Caulonia had
                  changed the form of their coinages to double relief some years before it was buried and that Croton and Metapontum had not done so, and this
                  deduction is supported by the Cittanuovo and Paestum hoards. Vlasto's date (c. 485) for the introduction of the seated-oekist type<ref
                     target="#CH9-n53">53</ref> gains support as against that of Evans. The presence of the single tetradrachm of Gela bolsters the implication
                  of commercial relations with Sicily which is further emphasized by overstruck coins of that island. Finally, the continuing circulation of the
                  staters of Sybaris is an interesting phenomenon.</p>
