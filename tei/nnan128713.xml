            <p>The material in the following pages was used, in one form or another, in the <name type="pname">Winslow</name> Lectures given by me at <name
                  type="pname">Hamilton College, N.Y.</name>, in May 1957, in a lecture to the American Numismatic Society in the same month, and in a lecture
               which formed part of the Society's summer seminar in <name type="place">New York</name> in July and August of the same year. It deals with
               ancient coinage only, and seeks to be generally informative and comprehensive without touching any very fiercely controversial ground. For the
               invitation to publish it, through the American Numismatic Society, thus making it available to other seminar students, I am grateful, and I owe
               my thanks especially to <name type="pname">Mr. Louis C. West</name> and <name type="pname">Mr. Sawyer McA</name>. Mosser, whose joint enthusiasm
               and kindness are, as I know, from personal experience, a great factor in making that annual seminar so remarkably successful and stimulating.</p>

               </hi>
            </head>
            <p>The study of coinage, regarded as a humane and aesthetic pursuit, is very old—as old, no doubt, as the Greeks and Romans themselves, whose
               collections of <hi rend="italic">objets d'art</hi> must sometimes have included specimens of the best work by the finest coin-artists of the
                  day.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> Regarded as a science, however,—the science of money in relation primarily to history, art, and
                  economics<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>—it is comparatively new. Numismatics (as it has been called since the eighteenth century)<ref
                  target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> was infantile until that time; it was adolescent through much of the nineteenth century, and adult only from the late
               nineteenth century onwards.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> Like epigraphy, therefore, it is comparatively, one of the newcomers in the historical
               field.</p>
            <p>This will perhaps be found surprising. Coinage, after all, has been issued in <name type="place">Europe</name> and the Near East (to say nothing
               of the fabulous continuity of <name type="place">China</name>) for 2500 years past; and this long western stream, often profuse, and never
               totally interrupted, has resulted in a truly vast accumulation of coin material—so vast, indeed, that its precise limits will probably never be
               defined. Ever since the Renaissance one scholar after another has set himself bravely to catalogue the known body of this material as it existed
               in his own day: for example, <name type="pname">André Morell</name> in the seventeenth century planned resolutely to record 25,000 ancient coins;
                  <name type="pname">T. E. Mionnet's</name> original plan in the eighteenth century to record ten or twelve thousand Greek coins expanded at
               first to include more than 20,000, and finally (and astonishingly) embraced more than 50,000.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> Completeness, of
               course, has always escaped the compilers. Yet they have pressed on: as the Frenchman <name type="pname">Jobert</name> wrote in 1715,<ref
                  target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> the study never stops, there is no limit, everything is instructive, the eyes are constantly stimulated and the
               spirit aroused. Why, then, if coins have existed in such great numbers, was the systematic study of coinage born so late—that is, in anything
               like a <pb n="2"/> scientific sense? Why was the significance of coinage (and above all of ancient coinage) neglected for so long? For today it
               is everywhere recognized as an integral branch of ancient history, now vigorous and becoming very fruitful.</p>
            <p>Any systematic knowledge of past coinage that might have existed was forgotten, overwhelmed and lost when Greco-Roman civilization sank into the
               dangerous and disjointed chaos of the Dark Ages, in which even the very faculty of coining money sank to an astonishingly low level of
                  aptitude.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> As the darkness became less dark the chief and most pressing care of medieval scholars was to shield
               the precious flame of humanism by cherishing—and rightly so—the most perishable, the most precarious, the most subtle and the most intimately
               authentic of historical testimony, namely, ancient manuscripts. The learned clerks of the middle ages thus guaranteed, in safe transmission, the
               works of classical poets, historians, philosophers, orators, mathematicians and scientists—the <hi rend="italic">ipsissima</hi> verba of the
               Greco-Roman epoch, and all its finest thought. By doing so they bridged the horrifying gap separating the ancient world from the invention of
               printing, which, once established, ensured more powerfully than any other agency the continuity of ideas on which western civilization is now
               largely based.</p>
            <p>The success was a brilliant one, as western civilization will eagerly confess. And yet, to some extent, it was achieved at the cost of leaving
               the whole wide field of archaeology—the physical remains of history—in abandoned obscurity. The factual evidence for antiquity, familiar, old,
               often imperfect, and nearly always taken for granted, was allowed to decay. Changes of social economy and of climate played their part. A people
               impoverished could drift away from <name type="place">Roman Silchester</name> in <name type="place">England</name>, leaving the great circuit of
               the walls virtually intact, enclosing nothing more than crumbling ruins which pastureland covers today. The breakdown of irrigation could allow
               arid sands or soil to bury many a town in <name type="place">North Africa</name> or, like <name type="place">Jericho</name>, in the Levant. <name
                  type="place">Athens</name> herself, after the Persian invasion, embedded the material of older buildings, now derelict, in what she was now to
               build afresh. The material débris of one culture will always, in any case, be impatiently kicked aside by the next, as surely as is being done
               with nineteenth century <name type="place">New York</name> and <name type="place">London</name>. And so the town-walls and buildings and
               inscriptions of antiquity have nearly all suffered <pb n="3"/> severe, and sometimes fatal, neglect while the full fragrance of classical history
               was sought in the words of the classical authors themselves.</p>
            <p>Coins, too, were taken for granted—more so, perhaps, than almost any other branch of archaeological evidence for <name type="place">Greece</name>
               and <name type="place">Rome</name>. The reason for this was their very abundance. Indeed, ancient coins survive in such vast numbers, and their
               numbers are so constantly swollen by new finds, that they have often enjoyed a revival of circulation centuries later than their original date.
               In 1788 a pot of Roman coins was found by one <name type="pname">Lawrence Leadley</name> at <name type="place">Northallerton, Yorkshire</name>,
               and these were soon current locally as farthings, known as "Laurie's farthings";<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> the "black money" at <name
                  type="place">Dorchester-on-Thames</name> was circulating at an even later date; miscellaneous Roman coins mingled in currency with many
               subsequent issues in the <name type="place">Sahara</name> in the nineteenth century;<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> and many a remote village in
               immediately prewar <name type="place">Spain</name> used a quota of old Roman coppers alongside modern pieces<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref>—and
               probably does so still. And yet this very abundance has been helpful, for ancient coins have been all the more easy to come by. That great
               polymath <name type="pname">John Evelyn</name> wrote in 1697:<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> "Every one who is a lover of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Antiquities</hi>, especially of Marbles and <hi rend="italic">Inscriptions</hi>, may yet neither have the faculty to be at so vast a charge,
               or opportunity of Collecting them at so easie and tollerable an Expence, as he may of Medals ... the most lasting and (give me leave to call
               them) vocal Monuments of Antiquity." Ancient coins, sharp and fresh as when they left the mint, may be quite cheap. Their symbolism is full and
               unimpaired: as <name type="pname">Evelyn</name> said again,<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> they "seem to have broken and worn out the very Teeth
               of Time, that devours and tears in pieces all things else," and they "have ... outlasted the most ancient Records and transmitted to us the
               knowledge of a thousand useful things of twice a thousand years past."</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Evelyn</name>, it will be noticed, called coins "medals"—a word which takes us back in a single stride to the infancy of
               numismatic study, set in a still darkened Europe on which the Renaissance had yet to dawn. Early in the twelfth century the late Latin word <hi
                  rend="italic">medalla</hi> (or medallia), <pb n="4"/> and its Italian form medaglia, were used to signify the medieval halfdenier or obol.
               These obols in time went out of currency and gave way to the <hi rend="italic">grosso</hi>, losing all value except that of curiosity; and by the
               fifteenth century the term <hi rend="italic">medaglia</hi> had come to mean any coin of an earlier period which had become obsolete, and then, by
               an extension of meaning, any newly made money-like piece not intended for currency.<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> In other words a <hi
                  rend="italic">medaglia</hi> could be, by then, either an old coin surviving from a former age, or (in the strict sense in which the word
               applies today) a medal—something which is in certain ways like a coin but lies outside the range of currency.</p>
            <p>From this dual meaning we can see all too well the confusion into which the earliest numismatists were bound to fall once the impact of the
               Renaissance was felt. We ourselves are born into a world of printed knowledge, stored and classified in vast bulk in millions of volumes in
               thousands of libraries. The medieval world had hardly any books at all: learning was the prerogative of the few who could read: oral legend and
               tradition were as vigorous as they were certainly dangerous for keen, lively yet uninformed imaginations. Such were the conditions in which the
                  <hi rend="italic">medaglie</hi> of <name type="place">Greece</name> and <name type="place">Rome</name> were first noticed, admired and
               studied. For us ancient coins are indispensable checks in matters of chronology, administration, portraiture, economics, commerce and art—all of
               them elements in the narrative of pure history.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> The medieval scholar's field was far narrower. His main interests
               in coinage lay in religion, portraiture and mythology. His enthusiasm was as great as ours: his powers of imagination certainly greater: his
               comprehensive knowledge very much less. It is easy, in such circumstances, to miss the truth: even in our own day there are able and, indeed,
               otherwise intelligent and quite reasonable persons who, in the face of all evidence, insist that Stonehenge is Egyptian (if anything, it is much
               more Mycenaean), or that the people of <name type="place">Britain</name> constitute the lost tribe of <name type="place">Israel</name>.</p>
            <p>Thus the two exciting strands of truth and imagination could easily be intertwined. The Greek coins of Sicilian Gela showed a manheaded bull,
               which was in fact the personification of the local rushing river. Mythology taught that the Minotaur was a man-headed bull. The false syllogism
               prevailed: the bull of Greek Gela—its Greek inscription brusquely banished—was forcibly paired with the Latin <pb n="5"/> explanatory inscription
                  "Minotaurus":<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> a medaglia had been manufactured: a marginal gloss on antiquity—incorrect at that—was made. Many
               other such examples could be quoted: for example, Hercules slaying the Nemean lion could be regarded as Samson, or he could be <name type="pname"
                  >David</name>, who invited recognition also in the figure of Perseus with the head of the Gorgon. Pagan mythology was, indeed, heavily
               overlaid with Old Testament or later Christian colour. For example, the very origin of coinage could be ascribed to Tubalcain, whom Genesis
               called "forger and smith in all the working of bronze and iron."<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> And the thirty pieces of silver were sought,
               prized, and sanctified in many holy places, in the shape of ancient Greek coins of Rhodes.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> These showed on one
               side a long-haired facing head of the Sun-God Helios, and the rays streaming from the head were interpreted as those of Christ's divinity. On the
               reverse appeared a rose—the badge of Rhodes, indeed, but now regarded as the rose of Sharon. It mattered not if the reverse also showed the
               inscription PO∆ION—"a coin of the Rhodians": this was plainly in error for HPO∆ION—"a coin of Herod," unless it was, still more, a mistake for
               POMAION—"a coin of the Romans." Such, anyhow, was the belief of one fifteenth-century enthusiast who manufactured a medaglia with these designs
               and placed upon it the inscription <hi rend="#smallcaps">imago cesaris</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> Here, he might feel, was the answer
               to the question, "Whose image and superscription is this?"<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> Such pieces, treasured for their supposed magical
               qualities, were invested with a glamour which, even today, still lingers in the coin-dealers' catalogues around the enormously common denarii of
               the Emperor Tiberius, one of which Christ may conceivably have handled in answering the question—though almost certainly it was another sort of
               coin altogether.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <p>From the outset, therefore, the study of coinage was damaged by a confusion of classical and Christian associations. It was damaged also by a
               fundamental ignorance of the chronology of history, allied with a passionately uncritical fervour for anything that struck a classical note. If
               Tubalcain, eighth in descent from <name type="pname">Adam</name> and <name type="pname">Eve</name>, invented coinage, the scope for portrait
               pieces was obviously wide. The famous and now rare <hi rend="italic">Promptuaire</hi> written by Guillaume Rouille, and published at <name
                  type="place">Lyons</name> in 1553, contained a noble gallery of coin-like representations: <name type="pname">Adam</name> and <name
                  type="pname">Eve</name> themselves, <name type="pname">Noah</name>, <name type="pname">Abraham</name> and <name type="pname">Moses</name> are
               found in <pb n="6"/> company with Deucalion, Agamemnon, Dido and Osiris—to mention only a few. Of none of these has any true portrait come down
               to us; and the author frankly admitted that his portraits were false. Yet his defence merits attention and may be paraphrased at length. "In
               order," he said, "that no one may accuse me of falseness in putting out, as I have done, various counterfeits, and argue that I have done what
               the forger does when he introduces false coins among the genuine, let me state my case. I will confess that the early patriarchs like <name
                  type="pname">Adam</name> and <name type="pname">Abraham</name> have found their first patron in me, and that I have represented them
               imaginatively. And why should I not have the same freedom as Phidias, who relied on a few lines of Homer to form his conception of the invisible
               Zeus? After all, it was said by Pliny that one counterfeits the non-existent, and that things unseen stimulate a passion to see them. So," he
               concluded, "I have relied on the advice of my most learned friends and, looking only to history and fantasy, have imagined the features, never
               seen, of the earliest of mankind."<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the spirit of pure inquiry was tempted away from historical truth by imaginative fantasy. In any case, many men of Rouille's time honestly
               believed of ancient coins, owing doubtless to their high relief and eloquent decoration, that they were not coins at all, but medals in the same
               sense as contemporary Renaissance medals, and so it was easy to argue that, so far from muddying the waters of truth, fantastic pseudo-coins
               stimulated a thirst for more copious draughts of truth itself. Certainly it seems that the example of Rouille and others like him stimulated the
               production of a vast number of false medaglie with classical allusions, which form in many numismatic museums of today a singularly attractive,
               enormously varied and by no means uninstructive rogues' gallery. As average examples one can often see the piece showing Priam on one side and a
               fine Renaissance conception of Troy on the other; or the portrait of the pious Artemisia, with her dead husband's Mausoleum; or the likeness of
               those famous antagonists, Hannibal and Scipio Africanus; or the piece of Caesar as Dictator, with the proud inscription "Veni, Vidi, Vici."</p>
            <p>These, then, were imaginative concoctions. Few would have been deceived by them, and indeed we may well doubt if deception was their object: it
               was simply that, as the spirit of humanism was re- <pb n="7"/> kindled in <name type="place">Europe</name>, interest in classical origins was so
               strong that any medaglia, any coin-like curio, that could help to satisfy it was worth its place. Even when artists of rare technical skill and
               aesthetic perception set themselves to make exact copies of indisputably ancient coins in early Renaissance times—famous men like Giovanni and
               Vincenzo Cavino at Padua<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref>—we cannot certainly assume that their primary object was at first, or even necessarily,
               to take in the unwary:<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> they may simply have wished to multiply objects of interest for a world hungry for
               knowledge. Nevertheless, although the modern eye can fairly easily pick out a "Paduan," they must at the time have opened cunning minds to less
               reputable ideas, for, by the standards of their time, these copies were clever and exact enough to look plausible—in a way much more reputable,
               even if judged as forgeries, than the medallic portraits of Christ which, though at first made as admirable sixteenth century works of art, were
               later mass-produced, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as copies of allegedly genuine prototypes.<ref target="#CH1-n24"
                  >24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Interest, then, had been re-awakened in ancient coins, and curiosity was being satisfied, partly by genuine examples, partly by counterfeits
               which possessed a strong classical flavour. Interest and curiosity, however, take a man no further by themselves: one might collect and possess a
               handful of Greek coins, half a dozen Greek vases and gems, a few terracottas and an inscription or two, and still have only the most elementary
               idea either of Greek coins, vases, gems, terracottas and inscriptions individually, or of their integrated chronological, artistic and historical
               connection. The one way along which true progress could be made was the multiplication of material; in other words, the formation of relatively
               well balanced collections, however much limited, however amateurish, these might appear to modern eyes.</p>
            <p>Petrarch himself, who has been called "the first modern man," formed a collection of classical coins in the 14th century, and was able to give
               certain Roman coins of gold and silver to the emperor Charles IV with the injunction, "See, my prince, those to whom you are successor! See those
               whom you may learn to imitate!"<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> Jean, <pb n="8"/> duc de Berry, was another famous collector of the same period.
               The fifteenth century saw the great d'Este collection growing—all stamped, proudly, and to modern eyes rather shockingly, with the d'Este
               mark—while King Alfonso of Aragon searched far and wide for Greek and Roman coins to add to the collection which he carried everywhere with him
               in an ivory cabinet, so that by constant examination of them he might (like the emperor Charles IV) be stimulated to rival the virtues of those
               whose images he saw. The Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519) formed the nucleus of the present glorious collection at Vienna: Matthias Corvinus
               (1458-90) did the same for Hungary. By now, indeed, the formation of a representative coin-collection was a normal mark of education and polished
               taste and, as <name type="pname">John Evelyn</name> was to write two centuries later in <name type="place">England</name>, was "not only an
               Ornament, but an useful and necessary Appendage to a Library."<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Many of these early collections were doubtless small, and the genuine scholar must have felt, anxiously and increasingly, the limitations and
               imperfections of the material. The only remedy was to multiply that material still more; and how thoroughly that was done can be judged by the
               estimate, at the end of the seventeenth century, of the existence, by that time, of 380 notable collections in Italy, 200 in the Low Countries,
               175 in Germany, and a further 200 in France,<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> where <name type="pname">Louis XIV</name>, himself a collector on a
               truly princely scale, housed his own coins in cabinets of the utmost splendour—some of them still at Versailles to this day. <name type="place"
                  >England</name>, too, though lagging behind in time, had acquired the sumptuous basis of a splendid royal collection.<ref target="#CH1-n28"
                  >28</ref> The Stuart <name type="pname">Prince Henry</name> purchased <name type="pname">Abraham</name> van Goorle's Antwerp collection of
               4000 gold, 10,000 silver and 15,000 bronze coins—a staggering acquisition. On <name type="pname">Henry's</name> death this passed to <name
                  type="pname">Charles</name> I, himself a notable connoisseur of the arts, who is said to have placed it in the Bodleian Library at <name
                  type="place">Oxford</name>, where but for the rapacity of Cromwell's fanatic revolutionaries it might have remained. As things were it was
               sold to help pay for a Puritan revolution—some of it to the bluestocking <name type="pname">Queen Christina</name> of <name type="place"
                  >Sweden</name>—and England's royal chance was gone.</p>
            <p>Such, then, was the scale of numismatics in the seventeenth century. The emphasis varied, of course, in different countries, but everywhere the
               study of coinage was being regarded as a science—some- <pb n="9"/> thing with a discipline and rules of its own. The famous antiquary <name
                  type="pname">Charles Patin</name> published in 1665 his "Introduction" to the "Science" of coins. In 1692 his compatriot <name type="pname"
                  >Louis Jobert</name> published La <hi rend="italic">Science des Médailles</hi> which, like Patin's book, ran into several editions and was
               widely translated and widely read. <name type="pname">Jobert</name>, indeed, was in love with his subject. He could say of the study of
               numismatics that, owing to all its intrinsic delights, it was "moins une étude qu'un divertissement."<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> He meant, of
               course, that its scientific satisfaction amounted to a conscious pleasure. Yet he was severe upon those who shirked the real labour and the real
               difficulties, and even more severe (as it is interesting to note of so early a scholar) upon those unethical and commercializing persons who, by
               trading upon—and with—the obviously uninitiated, turned numismatics into a tricky means of self-enrichment.</p>
            <p>The same serious approach was shown in an extraordinarily interesting book published, also in 1692, by <name type="pname">Obadiah Walker</name>,
               Master of University College, <name type="place">Oxford</name>, who wrote of coins as being "Necessary for the Introduction of Youth into all the
               useful Knowledge of Antiquity." This book, which escaped the eagle eye of Ernest Babelon when he reviewed the progress of earlier work in his
               great <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi>, is a model of arrangement, information and keen criticism. By now, too, the time had come when, on the basis
               of dozens of fine private collections, comprehensive catalogues could begin to take shape. <name type="pname">Evelyn</name>, that great scholar,
               expressed in 1697 the need for more and better catalogues in English. "We should," he wrote,<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> "as in <name
                  type="place">
                  <hi rend="italic">Italy, France, Germany</hi>

               of <hi rend="italic">Ancient</hi> and Useful <hi rend="italic">Erudition</hi>, derivable from those Precious <hi rend="italic">Remains</hi> in

                  rend="italic">Repositories</hi> would give Notice, and exercise their Talents by publishing something of Use and Advantage to the Republic of
                  <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> ... and not Keep them so wholly to themselves, as few or none are the better for them.</p>

               <l>—'Tis nothing worth that lies Conceal'd,</l>
               <l>And Science is not Science till Reveal'd.'"</l>
            </lg>
            <p>For the eighteenth century, then, still wider and more discriminating collecting was to go hand in hand with better cataloguing. Of the first
               activity the famous <name type="pname">Dr. William Hunter</name> (1718-83)—an <pb n="10"/> outstanding medical man in his day—serves as an
               example in collecting some 30,000 fine coins. Between the years 1770 and 1782 he spent no less than £22,000—a very large sum in those days—in
               amassing material, and when he died his will not only endowed a Museum for the reception of the coins but also stipulated that they were to be
               used in the manner "most conducive to the improvement of the students ... of Glasgow."<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> Of the latter we may
               exemplify the illustrious Joseph Eckhel (1737-98), an Austrian priest who spent the greater part of his life as Keeper of the Imperial Austrian
               collection and prepared the noble catalogue—in eight fine volumes—which, still a standard work, revolutionized the study of coinage alike by its
               principles of arrangement, its critical skill and its width of comparative learning.<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> Men like Hunter and Eckhel
               were not alone, of course. But many of their contemporaries lacked the intense degree of their scholarship. The eighteenth century was, after
               all, the Augustan age, and in the Augustan age learning was still polite and its atmosphere (as seen from the coin-cabinets of the time)
               extremely elegant. <name type="pname">Joseph Addison's</name> famous Dialogues upon <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Usefulness of <hi rend="italic"
                  >Ancient Medals</hi>, published in 1769, were set in an artificially pastoral atmosphere designed to illustrate coinage by relation to the
               beauties of classical poetry, and were prefaced by Pope's splendid lines calling dramatic attention to the historical value and permanence of
               numismatic evidence:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"Ambition sigh'd. She found it vain to trust</l>
               <l>The faithless column and the crumbling bust; ...</l>
               <l>Convinc'd, she now contracts her vast design;</l>
               <l>And all her triumphs shrink into a coin ...</l>
               <l>The metal, faithful to its charge of fame,</l>
               <l>Thro' climes and ages bears each form and name:</l>
               <l>In one short view, subjected to our eye,</l>
               <l>Gods, emp'rors, heroes, sages, beauties lie."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This, of course, is elegance rather than learning, and in the nineteenth century the balance swung again: more catalogues still, much less
               elegance and much more learning, though traditional conservatism was still to be seen in the terminology of the usual title-page. And suddenly,
               in the late nineteenth century—that century of earnest <pb n="11"/> endeavour and scientific application—numismatics stood forth, a science
               itself, not yet in any way advanced, indeed, but at least sure both of its essential material and of its essential methodology. The numismatist
               might still be (and very often still was) a collector, but he could also be a first-class numismatic scholar and a competent historian. The
               beacon-lights that suddenly shone out were Mommsen's <hi rend="italic">History of Roman Coinage</hi> in 1860 and the beginning, in 1873, of the
               massive series of British Museum coin-catalogues, Greek, Roman and English. The series, some fifty volumes in all so far, is still in progress
               today.</p>
            <p>The fruit of the special methods of modern inquiry which have been evolved, seen in the great accumulation of scientific knowledge in the last
               eighty years, will be glanced at in what follows. For the moment it is enough to have seen the main tendencies in the four hundred year prelude
               to these last eighty years. At first there was little more than a passionate interest in coins as the easily acquired and curiously vivid symbols
               of a magnificent antiquity. Slowly this interest crystallized, and men began to relate coins more closely with all the other evidence for
               classical antiquity—literary and monumental. Next came the desire to multiply the coin evidence and integrate it in a form which allowed of
               proper analysis and criticism. From this stage, in turn, came the necessity to make national or quasi-national collections more broadly based
               than was possible for all except a very few private individuals. And, finally, from the formation of great national collections, gathered by
               whatever means—the taking over of a royal collection as in <name type="place">France</name> or <name type="place">Austria</name>; the
               establishment of a University collection (that at <name type="place">Oxford</name> was started in 1636); or the foundation of a privately
               financed institute, seen with characteristic success in the <name type="place">United States</name>—from such causes sprang the necessity to
               catalogue in mounting detail the integrated treasure that had been amassed.</p>
            <p>The present status of numismatic study was recently defined by someone who is not a specialist in that study—Professor <name type="pname">A. H.
                  M. Jones</name> of Cambridge. "Numismatics," he wrote, "is a science in its own right. Coins deserve study both from the technical and the
               artistic point of view, and must be classified topographically and chronologically. Some of this work depends on what may be called purely
               numismatic expertise ... But, as coins have almost invariably been issued by governments, and commonly bear emblems or inscriptions (or both) of
               the authority which issued them, their classification depends to a very large extent on historical data. Numis- <pb n="12"/> matists must in fact
               be historians to do their own work satisfactorily, and in practice the large majority ... have been historians by training before they
               specialized in the study of coins."<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref>
            </p>
            <p>That analysis and definition is increasingly borne out in the yearly progress of numismatic studies. The good numismatist today could, indeed,
               begin by being a highly intelligent collector on a large scale. If, however, he wishes to extract all the benefit from his subject he must either
               be, or become, an historian. He must know, or know where to consult, the relevant writings of ancient authors, together with the papyri and
               inscriptions and monuments and general archaeology. He must, in fact, be a general scholar if he is to specialize; and this is an obligation
               which it is perilous to neglect in almost every branch of human activity.</p>
            <p>In the next section four main aspects of the study of coinage are considered. These four aspects are designed to show the wide variety of
               historical information which has been built up as a result of the disciplined and comparative study of the classical coinages. The first is that
               of chronology and identity. Coins are, above all, documents which say something about a ruler or a people; and it is as personal documents in a
               chronological setting that they must always be mainly regarded. Secondly, there will be the examination of coins in an extended sense; what can
               be learned of them in their behaviour as currency, whether moving through time and space or regarded absolutely as pieces of a certain worth?
               Thirdly, what information do they contribute on the purely political problems of the past, and to what extent is it legitimate to seek such
               information? Fourthly, what have they to teach about artistic and religious activity and thought in classical antiquity?</p>

            </head>
            <p>A coin is primarily an absolute document. It nearly always says something about a ruler or a people at a particular moment of time. This is a
               view which, however obvious it may seem once it is defined, nevertheless deserves emphasis. In every age men have been accustomed to the constant
               movement of coins to serve the restless and ever changing purposes of currency. And they have also been accustomed to the survival into their own
               generation, unread, unexamined, and accepted as a social habit, of the coins of a previous generation. The legal tender of <name type="place"
                  >Britain</name>, for example, includes coinage up to 140 years old. In our own day it is only when a new coinage is produced that attention is
               momentarily directed to what that coinage states in relation to the time in which it is issued; and since a new coinage—new, that is to say, in
               the sense that its verbal or pictorial content is substantially changed—is rare in most modern states we have lost the readiness to look at it
               for what it is, or was, at the time of production. Yet it still remains true, even of modern coins, that they convey certain absolute documentary
               information relating to a person or a people at a definite moment of time. Thus the United Kingdom coinage of <name type="pname">Queen
                  Elizabeth</name> II has already emphasized, by titular changes in the second main group after 1953, that it is struck for her as Queen of the
               United Kingdom only, and not as Queen of her other and individual realms overseas. In numerous ancient coinages this essentially informative
               element was a much stronger and more constant property. It was to be seen, of course, in a specially clear form in those many Islamic coins which
               said, quite simply, that such-and-such a man coined them at this or that city in this or that year, adding a religious motto to remind men that
               the temporal authority inherent in the very act of coinage was held only by the indulgence of Heaven-a reminder that is still to be seen in the
               retention of the formula "Dei Gratia" on current <name type="place">British</name> money.</p>
            <p>The study of chronology as a branch of ancient history is astonishingly recent in view of the passionate interest which ancient history has <pb
                  n="14"/> for so long aroused. It was only in 1834 that <name type="pname">Henry Fynes Clinton</name>, an <name type="place">Oxford</name>
               scholar, began to publish his revolutionary <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici.</hi> The origins of this famous work are not without interest.
               Fynes Clinton's original plan was to work out the sequence, and then the exact chronology, of certain works of the ancient authors. "The
               grammarians of later [i.e., later classical] ages," he wrote,<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> "from whose hands we have received the relics of
               antiquity, so much neglected this necessary point that no copy of Aristophanes now exists which has the Comedies disposed in the order in which
               they were exhibited; nor any copy of Demosthenes, in which the Harangues and Public Causes are placed with any regard to the order of time." From
               this primary and limited objective he finally progressed to an epoch-making work which, for the first time, placed in relatively secure order all
               the main events of Greek antiquity—a monumental achievement never before realized, and probably never even contemplated.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fynes Clinton's</name> use of coins, however, as checks whether for Greek or Roman chronology was negligible: his emphasis was
               laid, rightly, on the correlation of historical statements made by ancient authors. However, the later development of numismatics, side by side
               with epigraphy, has enormously increased the material evidence for chronology. Two major examples will suffice, each involving a degree of
               numismatic criticism which an earlier age could not command. The origin of a true coinage in Greece proper (i.e., the transition from metal by
               weight to coined metal) has usually been linked, on the strength of a statement by Pollux, Orion, Ephorus and others, with King Pheidon of Argos,
               whose traditional date is much disputed. It has recently been shown that the coinage attributed to Pheidon is probably later than any traditional
               date historically acceptable for Pheidon.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> In that case, therefore, if it is his, Pheidon too must have been that
               much later. Alternatively the statement linking Pheidon with the institution of coinage in Greece is erroneous. In either case the chronological
               implications are very great. As a second example, of similar importance, one might look to the chronological value of the coinage of Uranius
               Antoninus in Syria in the third century <hi rend="#smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> A few scraps of information have come down to us, e.g., from the <pb n="15"/> historian Zosimus, concerning the
               rebellion in that area of two usurpers, respectively Uranius and Antoninus, during the reigns of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_severus_alexander">Severus Alexander</name> (<hi
                  rend="#smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 222-35) and Gallienus (<hi rend="#smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 259-68). Coins exist, however, of a single usurper who
               quite distinctly called himself Uranius Antoninus, and these coins for various reasons (principally stylistic) cannot be placed earlier than <hi

               different rebels is wrong: in any case they prove that, even if it is right—as is most improbable, there was another rebellion (hitherto unknown)
               under a leader who bore both names jointly.</p>
            <p>Questions of absolute chronology are often combined, as in the last instance, with those of absolute identity; and here the numismatic yield has
               been singularly large. In the field of Greek history the very existence of many small cities or towns would be unknown but for the coins they
               issued, as witness Phistelia and Uxentum in Italy, Silerae in Sicily, and Phytia and Trierus in Thrace—to name a few at random. Coins of the
               Greek period also tell us of many a tribal chieftain or kinglet otherwise unknown or obscure, especially in the Thraco-Macedonian area: there are
               Mosses and Docimus of the Bisaltae, Getas of the Edonians, a round half-dozen or so from Thrace; and the formerly unknown Carausius II in <name
                  type="place">Britain</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> Nor is the new knowledge confined to petty kings only. Writing of the great
               Indo-Greek kingdom of Bactria, one of the fruits of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great's</name> eastward thrust, <name type="pname">Percy
                  Gardner</name> said in 1886:<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref> "In regard to all but two or three of the kings ... the ancient historians are quite
               silent; and the coins and inscriptions alone save us from ignorance even of their names." It is, indeed, the coins especially which have
               preserved to us the identities of many great and powerful kings in this area, like Amyntas and others, and the order in which they reigned.</p>
            <p>For the history of pre-Roman <name type="place">Britain</name> (from about 75 <hi rend="#smallcaps">b.c.</hi> for a century onwards) coins have
               similarly contributed knowledge of the utmost value. A mere hundred years ago the ancient British coinage was unclassified and its physical
               distribution in <name type="place">England</name> virtually unknown. Thus Beale Poste could ascribe to Boadicea certain coins <pb n="16"/>
               bearing the name Bodvoc.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Now in this his philology was bad; his chronology worse, and his identification worse
               still. Since then a succession of accurate scholars have carefully mapped the find-spots of the great majority of the pre-Roman coins of <name
                  type="place">Britain</name>, and they have shown with absolute clarity the various regions occupied by the various coin-producing tribes, and
               the approximate periods of the different regional kings. As a result we know beyond doubt that what Beale Poste misconstrued as the name of
               Boadicea was in fact the name of King Bodvoc who ruled the Dobuni—a tribe centred upon Cirencester, and extending up to but seldom beyond the
               Cherwell at Oxford—early in the first century <hi rend="#smallcaps">a.d.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As an additional contribution in the field of identity coins often portray those who, though well known to history, have left no other record of
               their features. This is specially true, for instance, of the Bactrian kings mentioned above:<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> here the coin-portraits
               of the few kings independently known are conspicuous and compelling. But we can point to many others as well: Tissaphernes, for example, the
               famous satrap of Xerxes of Persia for whose favours Athens and Sparta competed;<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> Hamilcar and Hannibal;<ref
                  target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> Scipio himself;<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Carausius I, the notorious British usurper in the late third century
                  <hi rend="#smallcaps">a.d.</hi>,<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> together with many others, like the Gaulish Postumus,<ref target="#CH2-n13"
                  >13</ref> who set themselves up against the legitimate Roman emperors in those torn and troubled <pb n="17"/> times, and whose official
               portraits in stone would inevitably have been destroyed by imperial order after their death. And, portraits apart, it is valuable to find the
               literary evidence of a ruler's activity specifically confirmed by coinage, as in the case of the fourth-century Pharaoh Tachos of <name
                  type="place">Egypt</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The evidence of coins in matters of chronology and identity is, therefore, often powerful and conclusive, and has been recognized as such for a
               long time. For trade and economics (in which chronology is again often involved) it is certainly no less, though recognition of this has perhaps
               been rather slower. The delay in appreciating the commercial and economic information furnished by ancient coinage is probably due, to a
               considerable extent, to the attitude of the ancient historians themselves. In antiquity neither trade nor economics was organized or controlled
               governmentally in the sense to which we are now accustomed. Trade was a matter for traders, and not for governments; and, though governments
               formed their policies on the assumption that trade was necessary if men were not to starve, and though they took care to control the content and
               value of their coinages, nothing like an integrated view of economic policy ever seems to have existed: indeed, in the case of vast units like
               the Roman Empire, it can hardly have been possible. Xenophon,<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> it is true, was alive to the existence of certain
               internal economic necessities. Aristotle,<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> with the awkwardness of a groping and uneasy research student, was aware
               of such things as the obvious urgency in Solon's sixth-century economic reforms at Athens—though he almost certainly misconstrued their basis
               seriously. The pages of Herodotus abound in references to international commerce—without, however, telling us of its trends or its intimacies or
               its relative importance. And Thucydides, the historian of a war in which exceptionally fierce commercial rivalries played a part (however little
               they were generally understood at the time) makes no mention of economic factors at all.</p>
            <p>Set against the uninformative pages of the ancient historians the coins give a startlingly vivid picture. Its significance was first realized
               fully by <name type="pname">Sir William Ridgeway</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref> and now forms a strong aspect of the modern science of ancient economic history. The flow of coinage, <pb n="18"
               /> the movement of money, from one state or country to another, is necessarily one index of trading relationships. Until half a century ago few
               scholars had attempted to measure the flow or trace its directions. It is in fact a question simply of accurate recording. What coins are to be
               found in what places and in what quantity? Half a century of observation has supplied many answers: the mounting details of coin-hoards and of
               site-finds are richly significant.</p>
            <p>"Hoards" are not always well named thus, for they may be of various kinds: a purse of miscellaneous current money suddenly put aside or lost;
               accumulated savings, year after year, of the best and heaviest coins; a shop's till, hidden away for safety; an exact sum of money put on one
               side for some specific payment; or an administrative or military treasure chest.<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> All these have their own special
               value in the study of the internal economy of a state or region. More important for our present purpose, however, are the purely mercantile
               hoards which illuminate international commerce.<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> These enable us to see and also to date with astonishing certainty
               the main directional trends of ancient trade. For example, the abundance of late sixth-and early fifth-century Greek coins of a certain date
               hoarded in the Nile Delta proves the willingness of the Persian Empire to allow Egyptian trade with Greek states well after <name type="place"
                  >Egypt</name> had been absorbed by <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>: <name type="place">Egypt</name>, lacking silver, needed silver as badly
               as the Greeks needed corn.<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> The transmission of Greek coins in bulk to remote Afghanistan testifies to the ultimate
               terminal points of an overland trade route of which the Syrian Levant (with its own hoards of Greek coins) could be the beginning.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n21">21</ref> The primary focus and the duration of Corinthian trade in its heyday is shown beyond doubt by the massive hoards of
               Corinthian silver coins found in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_magna_graecia">South Italy</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name>—and by the astonishing scarceness of
               those same coins at <pb n="19"/> Corinth itself.<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> Or, turning to <name type="place">Rome</name>, one can give
               special colour and directional emphasis to the frequent complaints that her wealth in precious metal was leaking away over the imperial frontiers
               in exchange for imported luxuries of no real necessity. Free Germany absorbed great quantities of Roman silver coins up to the third century <hi
                  rend="#smallcaps">a.d.</hi>: Roman gold of the early empire flowed eastwards in considerable bulk down to southern India, across to the
               further coast and up to Madras and probably beyond.<ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Closely related to the study of mercantile coin-hoards is the evidence obtained from measuring the approximate coin volume of ancient states in
               relation to their general activity and status. There were, for example, various states or tribes in northern Greece which, though they coined in
               great profusion, have otherwise left singularly little mark in the pages of Greek history. It cannot be doubted that such cities as
                  Damastium,<ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> or tribal kingdoms like those of the Letaioi and Edonians, on the northern fringe of the Greek
               cultural orbit, issued their very large coinages simply as a means of exporting their great natural resources of silver in handy form, exactly as
               Athens did with the silver of Laurium. Indeed, metal ingots are shown on Damastian coins, and coins of the kind made by the Letaioi are found
               hoarded in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. We know, in any case, how hungry the ancient world was for
               precious metals, and the profits that could be made from a monopoly either of production or of distribution. The Phocaeans, driven from Ionia in
               540 by <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>, emigrated en masse to <name type="place">Corsica</name>, where they could straddle the rich silver
               trade-route from Tartessos (Tarshish) to Sicily: it was a mere five years before a jealous Carthage eliminated them.<ref target="#CH2-n25"
                  >25</ref> And the emperors of <name type="place">Rome</name> were relentless in acquiring a monopoly of any mines which could supply precious
               metals for coinage.</p>

            <pb n="20"/>
            <p>The flow of ancient coinage is seen in other ways as well. One method, recently developed, consists of the study of those coins on which the
               original designs of the issuing state have been overstamped, often to the point of near-obliteration (and presumably with this purpose), by the
               later designs of another state. This is a process which could only be widely employed when both states coined on the same weight-standard, and
               hence the significance, for the intensive absorption of the coins of A by B in these circumstances is usually an index of intensive commercial
               contacts. A most instructive example is given by the so-called "overstrikes" of <name type="place">South Italy</name>, where a curious and
               elaborate technique was, it seems, specially adopted to make easier the obliteration of the types of state A by those of state B; and it is
               significant that the evidence of South Italian overstrikes coincides with that of hoards in showing the great prominence of Corinthian money in
               this area. It should be added, of course, that the study of overstrikes is very important for chronology too, since a super-imposed design is <hi
                  rend="italic">ex hypothesi</hi> later than what lies under it, and it is certain that the absolute chronology of many Greek coinages will
               profit from it.<ref target="#CH2-n26">26</ref>
            </p>

            <p>Further information comes from studying the changing form of the designs stamped on coins, especially when a given prototype is imitated or used
               in a derivative form which is found elsewhere. Thus the distribution of the Greek cow-and-calf type illuminates the ties between the northern
               city of <name type="place">Eretria</name> and her colonies in the West. The frequent importation of Athenian coins by Levantine areas, already
               evidenced by hoards, is shown further by the imitation of Athenian types found in <name type="place">Arabia</name>. The heavy southward flow of
               the coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</name> gives rise to a large family of imitations found (and presumably made) in Crete. Along the Danube
               valley the penetration of the silver of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</name> of <name type="place">Macedon</name> is reflected in the abundant
               copies which it stimulated in a wide area of S. E. <name type="place">Europe</name>. Similarly <name type="pname">Philip</name> II's famous gold,
               which was unloaded onto the Roman west after arriving as military booty, was seized on as a model for imitation by many tribes of Gaul, whose
               imitations became in turn the models <pb n="21"/> for further, more extreme, and artistically very significant imitation across the Channel in
                  pre-<name type="place">Roman Britain</name> from c. 75 <hi rend="#smallcaps">b.c.</hi>

               <ref target="#CH2-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This wide vision of international—often intercontinental—trade in antiquity can of course be seen in other aspects of numismatic research. A good
               example is provided by weight-standards. For a very long time—indeed until about the nineteenth century—the weights of coins were seldom
               recorded. But after that it came to be realized in the cataloguing of coins that when their metal is carefully refined (as was the case with
               nearly all Greek and much Roman coinage) one of their most significant features must consist of weight; and ever since then the careful weighing
               of ancient coins has been standard practice. This practice led inevitably to the definition of certain prevalent weight-standards.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n28">28</ref> The distribution and variation of these standards, as checked by later studies, can in turn be considered in the
               clear light of known political and commercial factors. For the Greek period especially the rival activity of great commercial blocs emerges with
               extraordinary clarity from consideration of weight-standards, and the comparative distribution of standards at different times shows very
               significantly when the prosperity of a particular commercial bloc waxed or waned. The commercial aggrandizement of Athens, for example, in the
               fifth century and her subsequent downfall; the extension of Persian power, or the great influence later exerted by Rhodes, can in this way be
               accurately mapped and also measured chronologically.<ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The preceding illustrations show, fairly enough, the characteristic contribution of numismatics in estimating the direction and volume and
               fluctuation of external trade in the ancient world and so providing some, at least, of the economic background to politics. Comparable
               importance, of course, attaches to the internal economics of ancient states individually. Most notably, modern studies have concentrated on
               measuring the relative output of the coins issued by a given state <pb n="22"/> from time to time: this has involved the assumption that, even in
               an age when coinage could be issued even more irregularly than today, an issue of good coins in high volume indicates a brisk economic condition
               and vice versa. Such measurement of volumes can be made, to some extent, by the simple observation of coinage-volumes surviving now. This method,
               however, is subject to many dangers—the most obvious being the possibility that a particular coinage in the past may have been affected by
               Gresham's Law, under which bad coinage drives the good into the melting pot. Far more reliable, therefore, is the actual counting of the dies
               which a state used, from time to time, to strike its coinage.</p>
            <p>It used to be said that no two ancient coins could be found which were struck from the same dies: indeed, this was for long an article of faith,
               although a scholar as early as William Hunter could know that it was untrue.<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref> Superficially there might have seemed
               to be justification for the view. Only a mere fraction of one per cent of ancient coinage can have survived, and the possibility of coming across
               such die-linked specimens might well appear remote. And yet this tiny sample, this fraction of one per cent, has transmitted a very high
               proportion of die-linked coins to us, and in case after case, after minute observation of enough specimens, it is possible to arrange a
               coin-series in an integrated order corresponding exactly to that in which it was issued. A long list of Greek mints has in fact been successfully
               treated in this way.<ref target="#CH2-n31">31</ref> This method possesses obvious value in enabling a coin, and thus its message, to be tied more
               firmly to a chronological context or a geographical area. It can be proved, for example, that coins issued by Tiberius in honour of his
               stepmother Livia refer not to her death in <hi rend="#smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 29 but to her recovery from illness in 22/3, since they are die-linked
               with others of this latter year.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref> It can be proved, again, on the evidence of die-links, that coins of Vespasian
               previously assigned to the Spanish mint of Tarraco are in <pb n="23"/> reality Roman issues of unusual style, which, as has been demonstrated
               elsewhere, could be simultaneously good or bad according as workmen were more or less skilled.<ref target="#CH2-n33">33</ref> From the point of
               view of internal economics, however, the study of dies is potentially of equal importance, for it enables a count to be made, within very fair
               limits of accuracy, of the number of dies made and operating at or over a given period of time.<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref> Thus it is
               possible to see at such cities as Athens or Syracuse the sudden monetary expansion caused in periods of great naval and military expansion, and
               to measure monetary fluctuation—for example at the Roman imperial mint of Alexandria, where in one year over 600 dies could have been made.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n35">35</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Economic evidence of various other kinds is also freely available. Fluctuation in weight is obviously significant: a steady decrease in weight is
               obviously more so, especially when shrinking weight is combined with a shrinking volume or fineness of metal. The economic decline of the Roman
               imperial coinage has still to be written in full. But its main elements are now known, from the first light-weight coinage of Nero down to the
               desperate efforts of Diocletian and Constantine and their successors to arrest a disastrous inflation.<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref> For we know
               just how serious inflation could be. Such hoards as that from St. Albans<ref target="#CH2-n37">37</ref> show the imperial coinage of the third
               century reduced by imitation to mere token status, while the hoard from Lydney in Gloucestershire is grim evidence of British economy around the
               time of the Roman evacuation, with coins so small that fifty will lie, edge to edge, on an English halfpenny an inch across.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n38">38</ref>
            </p>
            <p>So far, in considering the application of numismatics to problems of chronology, trade and economics, we have seen that the evidence to be
               abstracted is for the most part absolute and depends little, if at all, on supplementary evidence from other sources. In the field of politics
                  <pb n="24"/> and constitutional theory coin-evidence is more often seen as a check to be used against other evidence, though even here its
               contribution can be of absolute value at times. For example, the ancient historians have left no even briefly explicit account of the political
               policy of the usurper Carausius I, the burly admiral of the Roman Channel fleet who used that fleet, at the end of the third century, to isolate
                  <name type="place">Britain</name> as the seat of his independent empire for some seven years. Of this episode the coins teach much: we know
               from them that Carausius exacted a grudging acceptance of his position from Rome's legitimate emperors, that he studiously adapted Roman military
               institutions to serve his rebellious purposes, that his concentration on naval power remained intense, and that his desire for economic
               improvement led him to institute a coinage-reform actually preceding that of Diocletian himself.<ref target="#CH2-n39">39</ref>
            </p>

            <p>However, the political evidence of Greek coins is generally tied to evidence of other kinds, as is well shown by the example of the Athenian
               empire in the fifth century <hi rend="#smallcaps">b.c.</hi> For this phenomenon we can point primarily to historians like Thucydides, to the
               tribute-lists which specify the amounts payable by the unwilling subject-allies of <name type="place">Athens</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n40"
                  >40</ref> and to the various fragments of the law prohibiting the use of any but Athenian coinage by those allies. It is only when a detailed
               comparison is made between the coin-producing cities in the tribute-lists and the coinage actually produced throughout the Athenian empire that
               the varying efficacy of Athenian domination can be judged in this particular respect:<ref target="#CH2-n41">41</ref> the sudden, flaunting
               brilliance of such coins as those of Amphipolis is evidence enough of the passionate determination that drove so many to throw off the Athenian
               yoke and, in doing so, to issue independent money of their own.</p>
            <p>In contrast with this Athenian picture we may set that of Alexander's great empire, rooted in mainland <name type="place">Greece</name>, bridging
               the Aegean, and extending deep into southern and eastern lands. In this case the extent of a vast empire is most accurately reflected in a
               universal coinage-the first of its kind the world had ever seen—with standard coins of uniform weight and design, and on a new gold-silver ratio,
                  <pb n="25"/> struck all over the empire at mints which differentiated their coins only by small symbols.<ref target="#CH2-n42">42</ref> Such
               world-extension of coinage was, of course, one of the most powerful political instruments in the hands of the Roman emperors, whose vast issues
               enjoyed a width of circulation which gave special significance to the subtle political and constitutional types they bore. Unlike the coinage of
               Greek mints, which changed their types but seldom, in deference to commercial interests, Roman imperial coinage was always saying a new thing,
               outlining a new policy, announcing a new achievement, painting a new political philosophy. Hence the sudden quickening of interest when the coins
               of Augustus are quite suddenly found with an entirely new propaganda line in 16 <hi rend="#smallcaps">b.c.</hi>,<ref target="#CH2-n43">43</ref>
               or when the otherwise austere coinage of the emperor Tiberius bursts into a period of obviously inspired comment in the middle of his reign:<ref
                  target="#CH2-n44">44</ref> hence the significance of the coins of Claudius, with their emphasis on the new triad of imperial
               "virtues"—Constancy, Liberty and Peace:<ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref> hence the fascination of Nero's early coinage as a princeling under state
               advisers compared with the later coins which speak with the autocrat's voice alone.<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref>

            </p>
            <p>The political importance of Roman coin-types—of both the Republic and the Empire—has for long been accepted as fundamental. The coins of the
               Greek city-states and kingdoms very seldom changed their designs: thus Athena and her owl trademarked the silver of Athens for about two
               centuries without essential alteration, proclaiming its importance in international currency as clearly as the designs on the dollars of Maria
               Theresa—still struck in their millions even today.<ref target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> By contrast the vast territories of Rome comprised an immense
               closed-economy bloc, and the functions of Roman coinage included, from an early date,<ref target="#CH2-n48">48</ref> the necessity of
               interpreting Roman administrative policy to a world-wide audience of widely varying cultures and interests. As a result the content of Roman
               coin-types normally showed <pb n="26"/> the utmost change and variety. In the last 40 years very great progress has been made in the recognition
               of the policy underlying these often rapid changes, and their significance in both political and constitutional matters has been deeply—and
               profitably—probed. It has been objected<ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> that the process has gone far enough, or even too far, and that subtleties
               have been read into the astounding range of Roman types of which the Romans themselves cannot have been aware. The fact remains, however, that a
               coinage is seldom topically eloquent when topical eloquence is not expected of it. Thus when, as at Rome, we find an immense stream of coinage,
               with a basic content referring directly to the emperors and their policy, and types which could and did change year by year, it is hard to resist
               the conclusion that a system which must have entailed so much more labour and planning than an unchanging range of standard types was
               deliberately adopted for a special purpose.<ref target="#CH2-n50">50</ref>
            </p>

            <p>What that purpose was is easily seen.<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> We have to imagine an immense empire stretching from <name type="place"
                  >Britain</name> to <name type="place">Arabia</name>—restless, active and often critical of the imperial government, strongly differentiated in
               its various parts, but bound together by a deep veneration of Rome herself. This world-empire had no information-services like the newspapers and
               television and radio which are today regarded as fundamental means of communication; and travelling itself was a slow business. An emperor who
               wished to preserve loyalty must preserve interest; and interest could be maintained only by the careful dissemination of news. And that, with all
               the bias and the overstatement and (equally important) the understatement that an emperor could give it, was exactly the purpose of the imperial
               coinage. For this reason an accurate analysis of what the coinage did or did not say at a given time is of the first importance in judging the
               history of that time through the eyes of the government itself. To some extent the informative content of the imperial coinage is to be found
               elsewhere—in the pages of the ancient historians, in monuments and in inscriptions—and, when it is, the modern historian of ancient Rome accepts
                  <pb n="27"/> it as significant and apt corroboration. When it is not, however, he is often more sceptical, and though the numismatist may
               sometimes have strained subtlety in the political interpretation of imperial coinage there is little doubt that his interpretation, in the main,
               has been correct. It is, for instance, most revealing to compare the simpler range of types found on coin denominations which circulated most
               commonly among the ranks of the soldiery with those of coins mainly current either in the "officer-bracket" or in Rome itself.</p>
            <p>Let us turn, lastly, from politics to art. Here the contribution of ancient coins to ancient history is wide, and of long standing. Three
               quarters of a century ago Greco-Roman coinage was systematically reviewed as a source from which an astonishing number of classical statues and
               statuary groups, since lost, could be recognized and related to literary references.<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> The yield, large then, has
               been increased since,<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> especially with the realization that the figures of gods and goddesses found on many Greek
               coins—archaic, transitional and classical—are almost certainly to be regarded as representations of the actual cult-figures of these deities set
               up locally. But the artistic contribution of ancient coinage goes much further than this. The record of Greek sculpture would not, by itself,
               have taught us the full brilliance of the artistic tradition in South Italy and Sicily at the end of the fifth century <hi rend="#smallcaps"
                  >b.c.</hi> This brilliance is magnificently seen in a series of city-coinages of which the beauty has seldom been equalled.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n54">54</ref> In many cases the names of the artists are known—for this was an age, unlike earlier Greek times, when an engraver
               could achieve personal fame and proudly signed his own dies, like the famous Kimon and Eukleidas, sometimes in larger and sometimes in
               microscopic letters. Cities like Syracuse and Akragas in Sicily attracted their services; and it is possible, in the case of an engraver like
               Phrygillos, to trace his activity on behalf of a considerable orbit of Greek cities in <name type="place">Italy</name> as well as Sicily. These
               were master artists, whose names and achievements are now preciously preserved by means of coinage.<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref>

            </p>
            <pb n="28"/>
            <p>In many Greek coinages there was little or no scope for artistic development, when the primary needs of commerce made it advisable to retain a
               particular design as an unchanging trade-mark on silver. At Athens, indeed, the types of Athena and owl continued with only minimum variation for
               two centuries. More often, however, Greek states thought it a matter of civic pride to change their designs as fashions in art themselves
               changed. As a result, since it is possible to arrange a city's coinage in exact order by means of die-linkage, it is possible also to study the
               growth of local or regional schools of art. Many examples could be cited, but it is enough to point to the rise of a superb tradition of
               coin-artistry at Elis, prompted by the four-yearly Olympian festival and displaying the work of really great masters,<ref target="#CH2-n56"
                  >56</ref> or to the less spectacular but equally revealing development shown by Sicilian Naxos,<ref target="#CH2-n57">57</ref> where the links
               between coins and sculpture and painted vases can be studied in association. It must not, of course, be forgotten that, however great the
               commercial importance of Greek coin-design, the element of religious feeling was never far removed from their choice. And religion, which has
               inspired so much of the finest art in many later ages, was beyond all doubt a compelling and ennobling factor in the direction which the best
               coin-designers of Greece took.</p>
            <p>In Rome the influence of religion was differently felt, and although its effect on the coinage was great it is seen much less as an aesthetic
               stimulus than as a philosophical comment on political institutions. This curious and characteristic intermixture of religion and politics is
               prominent in the coinage of the Roman Republic, from which, indeed, much of it has been primarily learned.<ref target="#CH2-n58">58</ref> For the
               semireligious, semi-mystical basis upon which the Roman Emperors gained acceptance we have, again, to look at the coins, which present an
               imperial claim upon sentiment and imagination of which the ancient historians, so often hostile to the emperors, give only slight suggestion.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n59">59</ref> From the coins, too, has been learned the importance to the Roman mind and conscience of those half-divine
               agencies—like Fortune, Good Faith, Well-being, Piety and Fair Dealing—which operated on a human level in ordinary public life.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n60">60</ref> It is from the <pb n="29"/> coins, once more, that a clear and continuous picture has been built up (more complete
               than from any other source) of the immense importance of the ceremonial—almost hieratic—details of the clothing and external trappings of the
               Roman Emperors.<ref target="#CH2-n61">61</ref> Finally, the coins exemplify, in a way at once more direct and less prejudiced than elsewhere, the
               mounting struggle between paganism and Christianity under Rome, with its great climax in the fourth century.<ref target="#CH2-n62">62</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Within the scope of this brief survey it has not been possible to call attention to the remarkable manner in which numismatic studies are
               begining to seek the partnership of natural science. In many branches of humane study this is now increasingly common and increasingly welcome
               practice. Indeed, it is the sign of a return, on the far wider basis of modern knowledge, to the happy state of affairs in the seventeenth
               century, when such men as <name type="pname">Evelyn</name> and <name type="pname">Ashmole</name> thought it impossible to study either natural
               science or the humanities without the other. The numismatist of today is beginning to call upon the chemist, the physicist and the mathematician
               to tell him more about those detailed material properties and methods of behaviour in coinage which he must know if his attributions and
               conclusions are to be firmly founded.</p>
            <p>Numismatics, then, calls now for the collaboration of the scientist. It enjoins the discipline of history in the fullest sense. It walks hand in
               hand with archaeology. It contributes regularly to the recorded sum of chronological truth. It is one of the physical reflections of economic
               policy. It points to the major currents of trade and commerce. It may spring from religion, and speak with the voice of politics. It deals with
               the creations of craftsmen whose work may frequently be admired, and sometimes even recognized individually. As a treasury of historical evidence
               it is virtually inexhaustible. It is, in a very real sense, the business of every student of antiquity.</p>
