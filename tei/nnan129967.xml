               <p>SHOWING MINT CITIES, OTHER LOCALITIES AND THE ROMAN ROADS</p>
               <p>The purpose of this map is to show the location of the Imperial mints, some of which were working a limited time only, and of the places
                  mentioned in the constitutions. Some of the main Roman roads have also been indicated on the map, but the actual distances have not been
                  noted. We may, however, record that a strong and healthy man was supposed to travel 50 Roman miles a day on foot (Procop. <hi rend="italic">Hist. arc.</hi> 34, p. 85 C), and that as an instance of exceptional speed a messenger is said to have covered the distance from <placeName>Aquileia</placeName> to <placeName>Rome</placeName> in three days, i.e. about 150 Roman miles (= 125 English miles) a day (cf.
                     <persName>Seeck, RE IV</persName> s.v. <hi rend="italic">Cursus publicus,</hi> col. 1856). We may add that e.g. the distance from
                     <placeName>Rome</placeName> to <placeName>Spoleto</placeName> was 84 Roman miles, and from <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> to
                     <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> more than 400 miles (the Via <placeName>Egnatia</placeName> from <placeName>Dyrrachium</placeName> at the <placeName>Adriatic</placeName> to <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> measured 267 Roman miles, from <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> to <placeName>Cypsela</placeName> 268 Roman miles, <placeName>Cypsela</placeName> being about half
                  that distance from <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>). We could roughly calculate a good travelling speed for the Emperor in normal
                  circumstances as something like 75 Roman miles a day. The mints of <placeName>Londinium</placeName> and <placeName>Carthage</placeName>
                  have out of practical considerations been excluded from the map. <placeName>Carthage</placeName> was closed in 307, <placeName>Londinium</placeName> in 326, and neither struck any Constantinian gold.</p>

            <p>Contemporary history is always written by the victors, by the conquerors. When posterity treads the laborious path to truth in an attempt to find
               out <hi rend="italic">wie es eigentlich gewesen</hi>—to quote the famous words of Ranke—great difficulties lie ahead. The written account, biased
               already when conceived, leads us astray. The chronicles with their unimaginative lists of sundry events and officials, compiled by industrious
               clerks and civil servants, had a long way to go before they reached the present day editions. The record which confronts us is the product of
               many rounds of mechanical copying in the monasteries, where the eye of a monk all too easily missed a line and thus created a chronological
               confusion.</p>
            <p>In discussing the reign of <persName>Constantinethe Great</persName>, one of the great watersheds of history, out of which was to emerge Western
               Christian <pb n="2"/> Civilization, we are faced with these very difficulties. Yet there is one source, continuous and inexhaustible when treated
               properly, which can corroborate or refute the eulogies of the panegyrists, namely, the coinage.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Constantine</persName>’s road to sole-rulership covered a period of eighteen years, from the summer day in 306 when his
               father’s faithful soldiers acclaimed him Augustus in York, to the September day in 324 when he finally, at Chrysopolis, defeated his last
               opponent, <persName>Licinius</persName>, his fellow-ruler and rival during thirteen of these years. The triumph of
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> indubitably was the triumph of the Christian faith, but the question whether the Church would have been
               persecuted and paganism championed by a victorious <persName>Licinius</persName> can never be truthfully answered. The school of the
                  <persName>Belgian Henri Grégoire</persName>, ingeniously claiming <persName>Licinius</persName> as the true defender of Christianity,<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> and disputing the authenticity of <persName>Eusebius</persName>’ <hi rend="italic">Vita Constantini,</hi> one of the main sources for
               the history of the Constantinian epoch, has by now suffered defeat.<ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Nevertheless, it would be wrong to accept at their face value all the accusations directed against <persName>Licinius</persName> by the
               supporters of <persName>Constantine</persName>. During the last three years of Licinian rule the rupture between East and West was apparent. This
               period in the East has been named the "last persecution,"<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> though on feeble grounds. Admittedly, the freedom of the Church was curtailed, Christian courtiers, civil servants and officers dismissed,
               and, possibly owing to over-zealous provincial governors, some adherents of the Church killed. But this does not warrant calling
                  <persName>Licinius</persName> a persecutor.<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> The religious policy of the years immediately preceding the final clash was an intrinsic part of the general policy of the Emperors;
                  <persName>Licinius</persName>, indifferent in religious matters, might well have appeared as a sponsor and supporter of Christendom had the
               wheel of fortune turned the other way.</p>

                  Chairman of the ANS Publications' Committee, has read through the typescript more than once with keeneyed criticism. I am much obliged to him
                  for numerous suggestions arising out of his familiarity with the subject matter and his demands for lucidity in presentation. <persName>Mr.
                     George Kustas</persName> of Buffalo University, kindly read the manuscript and corrected its English. For this I want to express my sincere
                  gratitude. However, it goes without saying that the author is solely responsible for the views expressed and the errors remaining in this
                  volume. My thanks are also due to the staff of the ANS for friendly co-operation during the process of finishing the typescript and producing
                  the plates. <persName>Mr. R. A. G. Carson</persName> of the <placeName>British Museum</placeName> has not only encouraged my research work but
                  also assisted in providing casts for the illustrations.</p>
               <p>In the text below references to the actual coins have been made through reference to the numbers of the items listed in the Index of Reverse
                  Legends (comprising the gold coins only). Illustrations have been indicated by inserting the number of the plate together with the number of
                  the rev. leg., e.g. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 100. To avoid confusion the bronze coins illustrated have been accorded letters
                  instead of numbers. The corresponding reference will accordingly be e.g. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, a. All the bronze coins
                  illustrated are from the ANS collection except the <persName>Domitius Alexander</persName> coin (Ratto, December 1932, 722).</p>

            <head>II. THE BATTLE OF THE MILVIAN BRIDGE</head>
            <p>Three battles mark <persName>Constantine</persName>'s progress to supreme power; the Milvian Bridge, Cibalae and Chrysopolis. The first gave him
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, the second the <placeName>Balkans</placeName>, the third the entire East. Now, let us
               follow him from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName>,
               from a barely accepted <persName>Caesar</persName>ship within the framework of the tetrachic system to acknowledged sovereignty, surrounded by
               oriental splendor, in the whole Roman empire.</p>
            <p>In view of later events we may assume that <persName>Constantine</persName> from the beginning aspired after something more than a subordinate
               rank in the Western provinces. The precarious position of <persName>Constantine</persName> and Maxentius drew the rulers of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> together, and the alliance was confirmed
               through the agency of the old Herculius when <persName>Constantine</persName> in 307 was married to <persName>Fausta</persName> and encouraged to
               assume the title of <persName>Augustus</persName>. A year later Maximian, ambitious of power but failing to discharge
                  <persName>Maxentius</persName>, was expelled from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and forced to seek refuge with
                  <persName>Constantine</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> The relations between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> were
               broken, but about the same time <persName>Maxentius</persName>' attention was distracted from the Gallic scene by the usurpation of
                  <persName>Domitius Alexander</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The two following years may be described as a time of gathering storms. The quiet was broken when, as the story goes, the old conspirator
                  <persName>Maximian</persName> was found responsible for an attempt on <pb n="4"/>
               <persName>Constantine</persName>’s life. In 310 he was killed, or killed himself, in besieged Massilia.<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>This event was probably the signal for a major change in the political constellations. The filial devotion of <persName>Maxentius</persName>
               flared up once more and, according to literary sources, he was resolved to avenge his father’s death.<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> The African usurper, however, prevented him from taking instant action. In these circumstances <persName>Constantine</persName> and
                  <persName>Domitius Alexander</persName> naturally formed an alliance, the evidence of which can be found on the African milestone mentioning
               these two Augusti only.<ref target="#CH1-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> At the same time, possibly a little later, <persName>Constantine</persName> appears to have broken the isolation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>; both <persName>Licinius</persName> and
                  <persName>Daza</persName> are depicted on the coin obverses of this time.<ref target="#CH1-n10">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> The consent of <persName>Licinius</persName> was of paramount importance to <persName>Constantine</persName> when engaged in a war for
               supremacy in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>. A ruler <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> since 307, <hi rend="italic">de

                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref>
               <persName>Licinius</persName> might in ordinary circumstances have been reluctant to accept <persName>Constantine</persName>’s interference
               south of the Alps, but in 310 <persName>Galerius</persName> was taken seriously ill<ref target="#CH1-n12">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> and the stakes in the prosperous East were higher than those in the West. Both <persName>Licinius</persName> and <persName>Daza</persName>
               concentrated on the future division of the Eastern provinces, and the West was left to settle its disputes on its own. The fact that after the
               death of <persName>Galerius Daza</persName> captured Asia, reached the Bosporus and was halted only by the arrival of his rival<ref target="#CH1-n13">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> demonstrates how far-sighted <persName>Licinius</persName> had been.</p>
            <p>Thus the stage was set. <persName>Maxentius</persName> made the first move and in early 311 dispatched Rufius Volusianus to cope with the
               rebellion <pb n="5"/> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n14">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> At the same time that tension grew in the East, <persName>Galerius</persName>' condition was rapidly deteriorating. In the spring of 311
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> celebrated his second <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> and struck, among other reverses, the exceptional type SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI in gold at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 201–2).</p>
            <p>The date of this gold type can be established with a high degree of certainty. The early Treveran gold portraits of
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> are very distinct in character; after the very first coins naming <persName>Constantine</persName>
               <persName>Caesar</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> we get a series of solidi of small module, thick flan, and high relief. The minting of this kind of solidus comes to an end when, shortly
               after the decisive victory at <placeName>Pons Milvius</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> discontinues its gold
               series and Constantinian gold minting is concentrated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, first at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ostia">Ostia</placeName>, later at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>. Gold coining was resumed at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> only
               towards the end of 313, possibly not before 314, and then with coins of distinctly thinner flans and larger module.<ref target="#CH1-n16">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Now the second group of Constantinian obverses can be classified chronologically, and the systematic arrangement shows the coins with the obverse
               legend CONSTAN-TINVS PF AVG (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 201) to be of earlier date, the coins with the obverse legend CONSTANTI-NVS PF
               AVG <hi rend="smallcaps">(PLATE I</hi>, 202) to be later. By a stroke of luck the chronological dividing line between these two kinds of obverse
               breaks can be dated to <persName>Constantine</persName>’s quinquennial year, because a part of the obverses of the type VOTIS V MVLTIS
               X/VICTORIA AVG has the break N-T (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 312), another part the break I-N (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 313).
               The coins of the type SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI can be grouped in the same way.<ref target="#CH1-n17">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>Thus it remains to establish when the Constantinian <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> were celebrated. The point of departure for the
               reckoning of regnal years was the <hi rend="italic">natalis imperii</hi> of the ruler, regardless of the title conferred upon him on his ascent
               to the throne. With regard to <persName>Constantine</persName> the situation is unusually complicated. His original <hi rend="italic">dies
                  imperii</hi>, regularly celebrated in later years, was July 25th. The realization of the weakness of his position—the very fact which led him
               to accept the early alliance with <persName>Maximian</persName> and <persName>Maxentius</persName>—made him to a certain extent dependent on his
               allies. Thus he appears to have accepted the title of <persName>Augustus</persName> from <persName>Maximian</persName> on the occasion of his
               marriage to <persName>Fausta</persName>, although he seems to have delayed using it for some time.<ref target="#CH1-n18">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> March 31, 307 was thus considered his <hi rend="italic">natalis imperii</hi>
               <ref target="#CH1-n19">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> until the conquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>; when the Roman senate conferred upon him the title of <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Maximus Augustus</persName>
               </hi>, he can be supposed to have resumed his original <hi rend="italic">natalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dies imperii.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi>, however, would have been celebrated according to the earlier reckoning, on March 31, 311 and 312.</p>
            <p>We return now to the legend SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI. The reading was no novelty, but it had scarcely been in use since the days of
                  <persName>Trajan</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n20">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> A slogan revived after 200 years is not commonplace, but in this context two additional facts enable us to appreciate the true
               significance of this issue. The first is that the same type was struck by the usurper <persName>Domitius Alexander</persName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, a) in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n21">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> This can be no mere coincidence. Clearly we have here another piece of evidence of the alliance between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>. But let us take the other fact, the
               fact that the type SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI was struck in two mints <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</placeName>, out of reach of the Senate. The <pb n="7"/> implication of the type is that the Senate pays
               homage to an Emperor (<persName>Constantine</persName> or <persName>Alexander</persName>) on the verge of war or actually engaged in a war with
               the master of the Senate (<persName>Maxentius</persName>) ! Therefore, there is but one way of interpreting the evidence of the coins, namely
               that <persName>Constantine</persName> and, accordingly, his African ally, had reached an understanding with the Senate or with an opposition
               faction of the Senate. In itself this is not surprising, for we have ample proof of senatorial discontent with the tyrant of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n22">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Treveran gold coins of the type SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI have given us the ramifications of the Italian campaign of
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> and, indeed, the date: the spring 311 instead of the generally accepted year 312. We conclude that the battle
               of the Milvian Bridge was fought one year earlier than traditionally has been believed.<ref target="#CH1-n23">

               </ref> Additional numismatic evidence can be brought forward in support of this.</p>

               mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ostia">Ostia</placeName>).<ref target="#CH1-n34">

               </ref> Only in early 312 were the first solidi struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>, among them the VICTORIAE
               LAETAE PRINC PERP, before the expiration of the quinquennial year with VOT X, after <persName>Constantine</persName>’s <hi rend="italic">dies imperii</hi>, with VOT PR. Whether the gold coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> are indicative of

               say, but it is quite likely. The other contemporaneous types are no mere repetitions of earlier Roman reverses, but to a large extent new
               creations. After the conference at <placeName>Milan</placeName> the Ticinese gold issues were discontinued; <persName>Constantine</persName>

               <p>The chronology of these events is not undisputed. I have here accepted the theory propounded by <persName>Seston</persName> (La conférence de
                  Camuntum et le “dies imperii” de <persName>Licinius</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Röm. Forsch. in Niederösterreich</hi> III, 1956,
                  pp. 178ff.) which breaks away from the traditional adherence to Lactantius' account, more closely follows <persName>Zosimus</persName>, and
                  enables us to restrict the number of <persName>Maximian</persName>’s visits to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> to
                  two. According to <persName>Seston</persName> the conference at Camuntum, a much less elaborate meeting with Diocletian than has usually been
                  believed, took place in 307, when <persName>Licinius</persName> was charged with the reconquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, whereas the rank of <persName>Augustus</persName> was conferred upon him only a year later. Cf. also <persName>Dr.
                     Kent</persName>’s arguments in <hi rend="italic">NC</hi> 1957, pp. 21ff. Andreotti, op. cit., p. 982, does not entirely accept
                     <persName>Seston</persName>’s theory, but concedes that preliminary discussions might have taken place before November 308, though not
                  earlier than the Spring 308.</p>

                  were struck in two <hi rend="italic">officinae</hi>, the latter in one off. only, and that the <graphic url="NNM47_023.jpg"/> series was the
                  first to be struck in two off. And then, until well after Civil War I, the off. were marked A and B, whereas the <hi rend="italic">Iovi
                     conservatori aug</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Victoriae laetae princ perp</hi> both have the off. mark P and S. If this suggestion is
                  correct, the gold rev. <hi rend="italic">Victoriae laetae princ perp</hi> would have been a creation of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and this would, in fact, strengthen my contention that the coins had been struck in the course of
                  the decennial year. I propose to return to this question in the forthcoming volume of Roman Imperial Coinage (vol. VII). Cf. also note 1, p.

                  required for the transfer of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ostia">Ostia</placeName> and that an opening date of 313 at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> "presupposes an operational

               <p>This, of course, is conjecture based on an estimate of the duration of the transfer of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ostia">Ostia</placeName>n mint. The coins themselves are much <pb n="12"/> more outspoken, regardless of the fact that of the early series
                  comprising mainly the reverse types MARTI CONSERVATORI and SOLI INVICTO COMITI, the date of two coins only can be definitely assessed as 315,

                  obverses in the course of the first series and is absent from the two following. This conflict immediately preceded the nomination of the
                     <persName>Caesars</persName> (officially confirmed at the settlement at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName> on March
                  1, 317). The absence of <persName>Licinius</persName> from certain series cannot be due to pure chance, as the coins preserved to our days are
                  fairly numerous. Of the <graphic url="NNM47_026F.jpg"/> mark a single <persName>Licinius</persName> obverse is known against 27 Constantinian;
                  for the subsequent <graphic url="NNM47_026G.jpg"/> my material contains 6, for the <graphic url="NNM47_026H.jpg"/> mark 31 obverses of
                     <persName>Constantine</persName>. The ratio of Constantinian to Licinian obverses for the other pre-317 marks is PARL 78/31 (15/7 63/24)
                     <graphic url="NNM47_026I.jpg"/> 50/22 <graphic url="NNM47_026J.jpg"/> 19/3 <graphic url="NNM47_026K.jpg"/> 55/31 Except for the <graphic url="NNM47_026L.jpg"/> issue we have a substantial representation of Licinian obverses. Assuming for the sake of argument that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> started coining in mid-314, and that Civil War I was fought in 314, <pb n="13"/> as the
                  British scholars contend, we are faced with the inexplicable fact that <persName>Constantine</persName> throughout the war and the
                  preliminaries to the war faithfully remembered his adversary on the coins, but a couple of years later, when peace ruled the Empire, ignored
                  his fellow-ruler. The short series of PARL coins (with large flans and with the long obverse legend IMP C CONSTANTINVS PF AVG) undoubtedly
                  struck before the consular coins of 315 marked PARL,<ref target="#CH1-n50">

               <p>It is time to leave <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> and continue to the other Western mints. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_londinium">Londinium</placeName>, strangely enough, remained completely unaffected by the events, and regularly coined
                  Licinian obverses up to the settlement at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>; but almost as an afterthought the Licinii
                  do not appear on the coins after the war at all, obviously an indication of the isolated position of the British Isles.<ref target="#CH1-n51">

               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> reacts differently to the political development. <persName>Licinius</persName>

                     <persName>Licinius</persName> was eliminated from the coinage. From the death of <persName>Daza</persName>
                  <persName>Licinius</persName> is well represented on the issues marked <graphic url="NNM47_027A.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM47_027B.jpg"/>

                  of knowledge, we have no means of telling definitely the internal order of these vota coins, it seems natural to assume that the <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> were celebrated twice, just as ten years later first in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>, then in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, and that the coins with the plural <hi rend="italic">Augg</hi> were struck in 315, those with the singular <hi rend="italic">Aug</hi> 316 when the war was imminent.</p>

               <p>Moving south to the coins of Lugdunum, we find a mint extremely reluctant to remember <persName>Licinius</persName>; altogether I have

                  during the hostilities between <persName>Constantine</persName> and <persName>Licinius</persName>. The puzzling feature of the sequence is the
                     <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> with the Constantinian obverses dominant. <persName>Dr. Kent</persName> dates this type to 317 and
                  presumes a discontinuance of coining between 314 and 317.<ref target="#CH1-n65">

               <p>The two first of these series were struck in the names of both <persName>Constantine</persName> and <persName>Licinius</persName> with
                     <persName>Licinius</persName> dominating, as is natural. The third had exclusively Licinian obverses, whereas the fourth had both
                  Constantinian and Licinian obverses, the former being predominant. The type remains the same throughout, Jupiter standing holding Victory on
                  globe with an eagle carrying a wreath at his feet.</p>
               <p>The puzzling character of the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> issue calls for an explanation. Viewed in the light of the events in
                  the theatre of war, the fate of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> can be interpreted in four different
                  ways:</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Dr. Kent</persName> accepts the first hypothesis and remarks that no bronze coins are attributable to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> in the years 314–317.<ref target="#CH1-n66">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> This, however, appears to be incorrect as is shown by the gold multiple VICTORIAE LAETAE AVG N/VOT X/MVL XX (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 272) struck to <persName>Constantine</persName>’s <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi>. The immediate prototype was the
                  Ticinese medallion VICTORIAE LAETAE AVGG NN/VOT X/MVL XX of exactly the same imagery (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 273). Now,
                  supposing that both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> were in the hands of <persName>Constantine</persName> during the decennial year (315/316), why should the Emperor
                  have chosen to hail the <hi rend="italic">concordia</hi> of the Augusti at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> but not
                  in Thessa- <pb n="18"/> lonica? It should also be noted that scarcely any other gold pieces are attributable to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> at so early a juncture.<ref target="#CH1-n67">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> No satisfactory explanation for these extraordinary circumstances can be found.</p>
               <p>Should hypothesis (ii) be accepted, we can find no reason for <persName>Licinius</persName> to discontinue coining after the war in one of his
                  chief mints. The fact that it started working as soon as it fell into the hands of <persName>Constantine</persName>, proves that the staff had
                  not been evacuated. Two years of inactivity at one of the major mints appears impractical and inexplicable. The probability that
                     <persName>Licinius</persName> should have struck the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> dominated by <persName>Constantine</persName>
                  at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> during these years is negligible.</p>
               <p>Turning from numismatic surmise to political reality, hypothesis (ii) can be dismissed as impossible. If military operations had ceased in 314
                  or early 315 and the peace treaty was signed two years afterwards, <persName>Constantine</persName> must have withdrawn his troops from
                  Licinian territory during the negotiations for peace. It should be remembered that during the campaign he advanced very far into Licinian
                  territory, actually to Philippopolis, thus cutting off his adversary, who had retreated to the northwest in the direction of Beroea,<ref target="#CH1-n68">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> from Macedoon and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. Now, can we really believe that
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> gave up this advantageous position, his sole guarantee of gaining anything in the would-be-settlement ?
                  The answer is an emphatic "No” !</p>
               <p>The disposition of the opposing armies in the theatre of war should be kept in mind when discussing the two remaining possibilities (iii) and
                  (iv), both of which imply that the war was fought in 316. In either case <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>
                  would have been isolated from the Licinian main army during the war, while the Constantinian fleet threatened the communications with its
                     sovereign.<ref target="#CH1-n69">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> In actual fact the problem whether (iii) or (iv) is the correct solution boils down to the question whether
                     <persName>Constantine</persName>, having gained possession of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>,
                  continued striking the Licinian <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> as the Augustan counterpart to the types of the
                     <persName>Caesars</persName> (PRINCIPIA IVVENTVTIS, CLARITAS REIPVBLICAE, VIRTVS MILIOTVM DD NN).</p>
               <p>A close examination of the bronze coins shows that the patron of Christianity, who many years earlier broke away from the tetrarchic <pb n="19"/> system, after the war hailed Jupiter his tutelary god. For <persName>Constantine</persName> two different obverse legends were
                  used in the course of the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> issue, namely <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf inv aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, s) and <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, u). Of these
                  obverse legends the former is the earlier; in prewar times <persName>Constantine</persName> had been depicted as a bearded middle-aged man
                  (the portrait employed was probably a Licinian one), in the earlier part of the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> issue we find a broad
                  tetrarchic portrait of a youthful man without beard; in one instance a Licinian portrait with beard is connected with the obverse legend <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf inv aug</hi>. This portrait is subsequently superseded by a new, narrow Constantinian portrait, the same
                  portrait we encounter on the first Constantinian gold coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 235), and except for a few instances of the <hi rend="italic">inv (ictus)</hi> obverse legend (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, s), all these portraits are coupled with the short obverse legend <hi rend="italic">pf aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> II, u).</p>
               <p>The pattern is now clear. At <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> a new portrait of
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> was created in the traditional style, and issued together with obverses of <persName>Licinius</persName>.
                  The obverse legend for this part of the issue was <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf inv aug.</hi> Before the obverse legend was curtailed
                  once more a new Constantinian portrait was created, this time an entirely different one, breaking away from the tetrarchic tradition. It is a
                  fair inference that this happened when <persName>Constantine</persName> took possession of the city after the settlement at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>. At the same time the Licinian obverses disappeared. Expressed in terms of political history
                  this shows that <persName>Constantine</persName> did not capture <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> during
                  the war, but that the mint city itself during the war tried a policy of appeasing both <persName>Constantine</persName> (named <hi rend="italic">invictus)</hi> and its legitimate sovereign <persName>Licinius</persName>, a very natural reaction for a city in such an
                  awkwardly isolated position as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>’s. After the war the city fell into
                  the hands of <persName>Constantine</persName>, the tetrarchic portrait was superseded by a new one, gold coining started and
                     <persName>Licinius</persName> disappeared from the bronze coinage. Thus hypothesis (iv) proves to be the correct solution of our
                     problem.<ref target="#CH1-n70">

                  <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> as struck by <persName>Constantine</persName> after the war, there is always
                     the possibility that the Jupiter type was continued as an emergency, very much in the same way as anachronistic gold types were issued. But
                     would any mint official have taken the responsibility for this if <persName>Constantine</persName> really was considered Christian or an
                     ardent champion of the Christian faith? We should also note that <persName>Constantine</persName> was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> very shortly after the settlement at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>, and that the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> must have continued to be struck for some time. The material
                     is abundant and the obv. of curtailed obv. legg. (<hi rend="italic">pf aug)</hi> appear to be twice as common as the <hi rend="italic">pf
                        inv. aug</hi> legends. If we assume that the <hi rend="italic">pf inv aug</hi> were contemporaneous with the Licinian obv., all of them
                     struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> during the war, i.e. during at least 2–3 months, the
                     numerical strength of my material (35 coins of each against about 70 of the obv. leg. <hi rend="italic">Imp Constantinus pf aug),</hi>
                     suggest that the <hi rend="italic">Iovi Conservatori</hi>, almost literally struck under the very eyes of <persName>Constantine</persName>,
                     cannot have lasted a shorter time than the previous series. On the other hand we should note that the presence of the Emperor and the court
                     in the mint city naturally increased the local need of cash, and therefore the intensity of striking. Again, the theory that the <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> was allowed to continue as an emergency finds little support in the fact that at the same time new
                     types were introduced both for gold and for bronze coining. It is therefore very unlikely that Jupiter appeared on the bronze coins against
                     the intentions of the Emperor.</p>

            <head>IV. THE THEORY OF THE TRAVELLING MINT</head>
            <p>The brilliant Austrian numismatist <persName>Georg Elmer</persName> once made the provocative suggestion that the late Roman gold mint was a
               travelling mint.<ref target="#CH1-n81">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Unfortunately the paper in which he developed this idea was never published in full; it has therefore been impossible to test his
               arguments in detail. Nevertheless <persName>Dr. Kent</persName> of the British Museum later followed the same line of thought in his study of the
               late fourth century gold coinage<ref target="#CH1-n82">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> and in a survey of the tetrarchic gold coinage <persName>Professor Pink</persName> hinted at a similar phenomenon by noticing how the
               center of gravity with regard to the coining changed according to the political activity of the Emperor.<ref target="#CH1-n83">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>I now propose to demonstrate that the travelling mint was a reality, and venture to illustrate how the organization worked in Constantinian
               times. I do not pretend to be able to give more than an outline, and I am fully aware of the fact that future research might occasion revisions
               in details.</p>
            <p>The notion of a travelling mint is closely connected with the fact that the Emperor, particularly before the foundation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>, had a moving headquarters and no fixed capital as an ad- <pb n="24"/>
               ministrative center. Thus it becomes of primary importance to establish his itinerary; again this has previously largely been done on the basis
               of his legislation, his edicts, rescripts and so on, grouped around certain events, unanimously fixed geographically and physically by our
               literary sources. Yet the milestones available are few, and the itineraries have remained largely conjectural. It is my conviction that a close
               analysis of the gold coinage enables us to construct and reconstruct the Imperial chronology with an accuracy almost equal to that derived from a
               study of the legislation. The final result will, of course, emerge out of an effort to reconsider the “<hi rend="italic">Regesten</hi>”
               in the light of numismatic research. In this context, however, I have thought it wisest to touch upon these legal matters only when they directly
               have affected the arrangement of the gold issues; a systematic revision of the dates of the Theodosian Code, the most important source for a
               study of Constantinian legislation, would certainly be outside the compass of this paper.</p>
            <p>Before attempting a discussion of details, a few words should be said with regard to the gold coinage as a whole. A striking characteristic is
               the wide range of types employed, particularly in the earlier part of the reign of <persName>Constantine</persName>—contrary to the practice
               adopted for the bronze coinage. Whereas the bronze coinage, at least in geographically restricted areas, generally speaking, was uniform, the
               gold coinage clearly was highly differentiated. Certain mints never coined any gold at all (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_londinium">Londinium</placeName>, Lugdunum), others short series only (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName>, Heraclea). Only rarely can we find exactly parallel sets of gold types in any two mints. We
               may find Sirmium exclusively striking the <hi rend="italic">vota suscepta</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> (263, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 264, 266, 267) of the <persName>Caesars</persName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>
               as the only mint commemorating the fifth consulship of <persName>Constantine</persName>, Nicomedia striking <hi rend="italic">votis x</hi> (i.e.
                  <hi rend="italic">soluta) caess nn</hi> (315) but <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> coining <hi rend="italic">votis x caes n</hi> (314) of exactly the same reverse type. This, I believe, is an indication that many of the gold issues are
               not contemporaneous but successive.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it should be stressed that in most cases the individual mints, also when striking gold, retain their particular style of
               portraiture, an indication that the mints remained stationary whereas the organizers or controllers were mobile.</p>
            <pb n="25"/>
            <p>In order to establish the chronological sequence of the gold issues we should begin by studying the travels of the Emperor and as far as possible
               ascertain his whereabouts throughout his reign. On the whole, I propose to do this without the aid of the numismatic material. Once
                  <persName>Constantine</persName>'s itinerary is worked out, the next step will be to discover how far the gold minting coincides with the
               temporary residences of the Emperor. Once the general principle is placed beyond dispute, we may be entitled to infer that certain locally
               limited gold series presuppose a visit of the court to the mint city in question. My aim is to reconstruct the itinerary and to demonstrate how
               the literary sources, mainly the Imperial constitutions, and the numismatic material can be correlated.</p>

                  “the travelling mint," though not strictly accurate, will be used in the sequel as a matter of convenience. In actual fact it seems
                  impossible to ascertain at present to what extent the minting was mobile and to what extent the mobility of the mints coincided with the
                  travels of the Emperor. Though the general rule probably was that the mints (the bronze minting) were stationary and that the Emperor (or
                  court) when travelling employed the services of these mints, there are certain signs suggesting a great deal of mobility among the mint
                  employees, signs not entirely compatible with <persName>Dr. Kent</persName>’s theory of the fourth century bronze as struck not
                  continuously “but in spasmodic outbursts of intense activity” (Pattern, p. 31).</p>

            <p>The basic source of our knowledge of the travels of the Emperor is the Theodosian Code.<ref target="#CH1-n84">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> A great number of Imperial constitutions record both date <hi rend="italic">(datum)</hi> and place of issue. The year is indicated by the
               consular year. In many instances either the date or the place is fragmentary or missing.</p>
            <p>Occasionally the subscriptions of the constitutions state also, or exclusively, the date and/or the place where they were received <hi rend="italic">(acceptum)</hi> and properly exhibited or proposed <hi rend="italic">(propositum</hi>). If nothing but the <hi rend="italic">acceptum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi> has been preserved, we get a <hi rend="italic">terminus ante</hi> for the constitutions as
               such but, of course, no indication of the date and place of issue. If, however, we know from other sources (possibly other constitutions) the

            <p>The only way of escaping contradictory statements about dates and places is an examination of the principles underlying the com- <pb n="27"/>
               position of the Code. Mommsen, of course, laid a firm foundation for future research, and <persName>Otto Seeck</persName>, using his intimate
               knowledge of the Late Roman Empire and the legislative procedure finally succeeded in working out a logical and consistent arrangement.<ref target="#CH1-n88">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Any such arrangement necessarily involves a great deal of emendation and interpolation. The ruling principle is to make certain dates,
               established independently of the constitutions, points of departure, and then consider the constitutions which by their dates and/or places of
               issue clearly conflict with other evidence. Thus we are compelled to evaluate the possible sources of errors occurring in the Code.
                  <persName>Seeck</persName> devotes some 150 pages to an excellent analysis of all the problems arising in this context.</p>
            <p>It would certainly take us too far to recapitulate <persName>Seeck</persName>’s arguments. Some points of importance for the subsequent
               discussion should, however, be mentioned.</p>
            <p>The fundamental reason for the inaccuracies with regard to the consular years is the Emperor <persName>Theodosius</persName>’ instructions
               that in any case of conflicting constitutions the chronologically later should be valid.<ref target="#CH1-n89">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> All the material of the Code should therefore be arranged in chronological order within each book and title. In addition each constitution
               was to be dated in an easily recognisable way, according to the <hi rend="italic">Fasti.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH1-n90">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref>
               <persName>Seeck</persName> shows conclusively that the subscriptions frequently are interpolations based on the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi>, and
               more regularly so for the earlier parts of the period covered by the Theodosian Code (311–438). The result is, to quote his words: <hi rend="italic">“Wir haben hierdurch den methodischen Grundsatz gewonnen</hi>, da<hi rend="italic">β Datierungen</hi>, die <hi rend="italic">den Fasten genau entsprechen</hi>, minder <hi rend="italic">vertrauenswürdig sind als solche</hi>, die <hi rend="italic">von

            <p>For the Constantinian time the dates of the subscriptions therefore on the whole correspond to the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> except for <hi rend="italic">“kleine Textfehler</hi>, <hi rend="italic">me die Weglassung oder Entstellung der Iterationsziffern</hi>, Ver<hi rend="italic">wechslungen ähnlich lautenden Namen</hi>, z. <hi rend="italic">B.

               </ref> The close correspondence to the <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> is also shown by the complete absence of postconsulates (to be discussed

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>(1) The first point of importance is accordingly that the consular years of the Constantinian period frequently are interpolations, that the
               iterations easily may be faulty<ref target="#CH1-n95">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> and that a confusion between rulers with similar names (<persName>Constantine I and II</persName>, <persName>Constantius</persName> and
                  <persName>Constans</persName>) can be expected to occur. The same, of course, applies to <persName>Licinius</persName> and his son.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking the consulships of private persons can be expected to be correct.<ref target="#CH1-n96">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Invaluable aid for chronological considerations is rendered by extant or reconstructed lists of officials, particularly by the list of urban

                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> In fact, a study of Late Roman prosopography is intimately connected with any examination of the Theodosian Code.
                  <persName>Seeck</persName> regarded his Regesten as a <hi rend="italic">“Vorarbeit zu einer Prosopographie</hi>
               <hi rend="italic">der christlichen Kaiserzeit”</hi> and he consistently tried to reconstruct the lists of the holders of Imperial offices.
               When the consulships are in doubt, the addressees of the constitutions frequently give valuable clues as to the date.</p>
            <p>(2) The second point of importance is therefore that we have to examine dubious dates (as indicated by the consular years in the subscription) in
               the light of the prosopographical data available; these as well as the geographical dates given in the subscriptions are even more important as
               chronological criteria than the consulates of the Emperors. <hi rend="italic">“Im allgemeinen gilt für die Kaiserkonsulate der methodische
                  Grundsatz</hi>, da<hi rend="italic">β sie sich bis auf die Zeit des <persName>Valens</persName> herab fast beliebig untereinander vertauschen

                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The postconsulate is another conception, which should be mentioned here. Dating by postconsulates was employed when the consuls were unknown or
                  unacceptable.<ref target="#CH1-n99">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>
               <persName>Seeck</persName> states two important facts with regard to the postconsulates, (a) that they do not occur exclusively in the beginning
               of a year (when conceivably the authorities concerned had not been notified of the consuls of the year), and (b) that the compilers did their
               utmost to eliminate the postconsulates from the consular reckoning in the Code.<ref target="#CH1-n100">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> Another source of error was, of course, the unconscious omission of a postconsulate.<ref target="#CH1-n101">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>(3) The third point is thus that a seemingly incorrect date may depend on an omitted or deleted postconsulate. In these cases the right date
               would be either a year earlier<ref target="#CH1-n102">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> or later<ref target="#CH1-n103">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> than suggested by the subscription. Again, if the subscription records Imperial consulates, we may have several starting points when
               counting backwards or forward.<ref target="#CH1-n104">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>We have noted above that the <hi rend="italic">accepta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proposita</hi> have little chronological significance with
               regard to our particular purpose. The computers of the Theodosian Code appear to have held the same view. When, however, constitutions recording
               solely the note of acceptance or proposal were included in the Code, this appears to <pb n="30"/> be due to lack of complete records of the
               Imperial legislation.<ref target="#CH1-n105">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Consequently texts with solely <hi rend="italic">accepta</hi> or <hi rend="italic">proposita</hi> were added as a kind of emergency. In an
               effort to reconstruct the original text an <hi rend="italic">acc.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">p(ro)p(ositum)</hi> frequently appears to have been
               substituted by a <hi rend="italic">dat</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n106">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Otherwise the guiding principle seems to have been that preferably the <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> should be recorded rather than the <hi rend="italic">acceptum</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">propositum. Datum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi> in the same text are clearly
               due to negligence.<ref target="#CH1-n107">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>(4) The fourth point emerging out of <persName>Seeck</persName>’s examination is accordingly that a <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> may be a
               substitution either for an <hi rend="italic">acceptum</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">propositum.</hi> This, however, applies only to constitutions
               where the place of the <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi> is located in the administrative area of the addressee except in the case of high court
                  officials.<ref target="#CH1-n108">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> In certain cases this obviously enables us to date a constitution a year later than suggested by the text.<ref target="#CH1-n109">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Seeck</persName> regards the passages giving the time of the year (month and day) as more reliable than the consulates. Dubious points
               can usually be interpolated by ordinary philological methods. As the exact date of each constitution was required, we may expect to encounter
               some interpolations in this context, too.<ref target="#CH1-n110">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> The place of issue or of acceptance was, however, of secondary importance to the compilers. It is therefore little surprising that this
               part of the subscription in many cases has been omitted. On the other hand, we may assume the places recorded mainly to have been rendered
               correctly. <persName>Seeck</persName> regards them as by far the most trustworthy part of the subscription,<ref target="#CH1-n111">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> though mistakes do occur. Dubious points can usually be explained with recourse to philological analysis. Most cases suggest a confusion
               of common, frequently occurring names with little known localities of similarly sounding names.</p>
            <p>It remains to say a few words about the preambles of the constitutions, consisting of two parts, (a) the name of the legislator, <pb n="31"/> and
               (b) the addressee. The former must frequently have been supplied with the aid of the consular year noted in the subscription. The original
               wording may have been e.g. <hi rend="italic">idem A</hi> or <hi rend="italic">idem AA.</hi> This had to be altered in the text of the Code, and
               consequently this called for a conclusion of the computer.<ref target="#CH1-n112">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Occasionally the names of the Emperors may aid us in identifying the Imperial consulships recorded in the subscriptions.<ref target="#CH1-n113">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, the second part of the preamble may be classified as one of the trustworthiest passages of the constitution,<ref target="#CH1-n114">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> though slight corruptions occur. This concerns the names, whereas particularly the abbreviations of the offices held by the addressees
               could have been easily distorted or confused.<ref target="#CH1-n115">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>(5) As a fifth point we may note that, (a) the dates of the Calendar year, (b) the geographical names, and (c) the names of the addressees are by
               far the most reliable parts of the passages of the constitutions important for dating purposes.</p>
            <p>(6) The sixth point is that in dubious cases little heed should be paid to the titles of the addressees.</p>
            <p>In the sequel the dates of certain Constantinian constitutions will be discussed with the explicit aim of establishing the Emperor’s
               itinerary. This implies that only dated constitutions with an indication of the place of issue will be considered. In so far as revisions of the
               dates of certain constitutions appear necessary, the picture of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s legislation should be drawn anew. This
               task without direct bearing on the chronological problems must, however, be reserved for future research.</p>
            <p>The basis of the subsequent survey is the redating of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s first Licinian war, proposed earlier by me,<ref target="#CH1-n116">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> further confirmed in the first part of these studies, and recently wholeheartedly accepted by <persName>Dr. Habicht</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n117">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> The revision of the date of this war affected the dates of certain constitutions, and <persName>Habicht</persName> went even further on
               the path suggested. Now the redating of certain con- <pb n="32"/> stitutions<ref target="#CH1-n118">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> is likely to affect the dates of others. <persName>Seeck</persName>’s <hi rend="italic">Regesten</hi> are more or less a series of
               interpolations based on a brilliant analysis of the principles governing the conception of the Theodosian Code. Once a part of the Emperor’s
               itinerary is adjusted, a chain reaction is started. The purpose of the following pages is to see how this chain reaction started by the redating
               of Civil War I affects our conception of the Constantinian Chronology as a whole.</p>
            <p>The first brief part of our examination indicates, with reference to earlier studies that the travels by <persName>Seeck</persName> dated to 313
               really belong to the year 314.</p>
            <p>As a point of departure for our study of the dates of the Theodosian constitutions, we may take the fact that <persName>Constantine</persName>
               left <placeName>Milan</placeName> after the conference with <persName>Licinius</persName> in the spring of 313 to fight the German tribes on the

            <p>Curiously enough we have no proofs that <persName>Constantine</persName> took up residence at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> until December 27, 313 (CTh XI 29,1; 30, 1).<ref target="#CH1-n120">

                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> and on March 26, 314 (CTh III 30, 1). Towards the end of the year the Theodosian Code shows him to have been in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> on October 29, November 3 and 8 and on December 30,<ref target="#CH1-n125">

            <pb n="33"/>
            <p>The following section purports to show that <persName>Constantine</persName> stayed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>,
               using <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> as his headquarters until and past his initial decennial celebrations. The first
               part of the inquiry concerns the constitutions accepted by <persName>Seeck</persName> as showing <persName>Constantine</persName> staying
               elsewhere during this period. This will take us through the controversial years 314–5 to the Civil War in 316, and actually to 318 as there seems
               to be little disagreement with regard to the Emperor's movements in 317.</p>
            <p>The rich and varied coinage of the year of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s fourth consulship and of his decennial celebrations (315/316)
               suggests that <persName>Constantine</persName> remained in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> until the initial decennial
               celebrations, and a study of the Constantinian constitutions confirms our hypothesis. The presumed decennial celebrations at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> prove to be based on an erroneous conjecture. Modern research has without hesitation accepted
               Mommsen's views as expressed in <hi rend="italic">CIL</hi> I, p. 397 <hi rend="italic">“Testibus legum subscriptionibus circa illud tempus
                  in urbe morabatur”</hi> The Theodosian Code, however, gives little support to his theory. The incorrect date of the CTh VIII 7, 1 has

               be wrong. The correct consular dating according to him was <hi rend="italic">Constantino A et Licinio conss</hi>, i.e., 312, 313 or 315. By
               choosing the latter year he is forced to alter the place of issue, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> to Aquaviva, some

               or 21. The crucial point is the mention made of the urban prefect Vettius Rufinus. There were two contemporary Vettii Rufinii, the urban prefect
               of 315/316, <persName>C. Vettius Cossinius Rufinus</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n129">

            <p>Before concluding this negative chronological argument, we should consider evidence in favor of his staying elsewhere. That is, what evidence can

            <p>The dates of the Theodosian Code are highly controversial for the years 318–319. Of fifty-six decrees fifty-two have the dating of 319, <hi rend="italic">Constantino A V et Licinio C conss</hi>, whereas only one is dated with <hi rend="italic">Licinio V et Crispo C conss.</hi>

               <persName>Seeck</persName> decided that two series of decrees had been confused and endeavoured to reconstruct the itinerary of the Emperor with
               the aid of addressees, acting under the assumption that the name of an addressee was less likely to be corrupt than the subscription.</p>
            <p>The urban prefect <persName>Septimius Bassus</persName>, who held office from May 15, 317 to August 31, 319, is the addressee of several of the
               constitutions in question. This implies that no decree directed to Bassus in his capacity of <hi rend="italic">praefectus urbi</hi> can be later
               than August 31, 319; thus we are compelled to alter the year of CTh III 17, 1, given at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, to 318. In actual fact, similar alterations of the dates of several other constitutions appear necessary; it would be
               unnatural if no decrees had been issued in 318. One particular case illustrates how a dating with a Licinian consulate might have been altered.
               CTh XI 29, 2 gives <hi rend="italic">Constantino A V et Licinio C conss,</hi> whereas the corresponding CIust III 11, 3, from a different source
               than the present day version of CTh, records the probably correct <hi rend="italic">Licinio V et Crispo</hi>. On the whole, however, the
               reconstruction of the Emperor’s itinerary should be made warily, with due regard to the prosopographical implications.</p>
            <p>Accepting the Emperor as staying in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> on October 12, 318, we may also accept
                  <persName>Seeck</persName>’s theory concerning the dates and the places of issue of the following decrees:<ref target="#CH1-n142">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                  <persName>Seeck</persName> recorded from the end of the year 318, CTh II 6, 2 (October 24, Sirmium), V 2, 1 (December 1, Sirmium) and XIV 25,
               1 (December 12, Sirmium) create some difficulties if we maintain that <persName>Constantine</persName> celebrated his <hi rend="italic">processus
                  consularis</hi> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> on the New Year 319. <persName>Seeck</persName>’s
               arrangement means that the Emperor had left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> by the autumn 318 and was moving east. The
               crucial one of these three decrees is CTh XIV 25, 1, addressed to the <hi rend="italic">proconsul <placeName>Africae</placeName>

            <p>For the sake of clarity it should be recorded that of the two constitutions mentioning Catullinus at a time when Proculus already had succeeded
               him, the first, CTh XI 16, 1 of August 27, 319, is a <hi rend="italic">propositum</hi>; the date of issue, impossible to ascertain, must fall
               within Catullinus’ tenure of the African proconsulate. The other decree, CIust VI 56, 3 of July 28, 320 is badly corrupt.

                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> who succeeded Ablabius in 329.<ref target="#CH1-n160">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The second constitution is directed “<hi rend="italic">Ad Symmachum vicarium</hi>” (CTh II 15, 1). On formal grounds no objections can
               be raised against it: a Symmachus is known from February 4, 318 (CTh II 4,<ref target="#CH1-n161">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> 1), and this decree is cited in another of October 12 of the same year (CTh III 17, 1). The dating appears to be correct, too.
               Nevertheless, as we are compelled to move CTh II 16, 2 to 329, the same should be done with CTh II 15, 1, because it would be highly unlikely
               that the Emperor should have stayed twice on exactly the same day in such a small township as Naissus (despite the fact that it was his
               birthplace; on the other hand, <persName>Constantine</persName> does not seem to have attached much <pb n="40"/> importance to this. Other cities
               were renamed after him or after members of his family, Cirta - Constantina in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>-Constantina in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>, Byzantium -
               Constantinopolis, Helenopolis, the new foundation at the Propontis, but not Naissus), and because <persName>Constantine</persName>, even
               regardless of these two decrees is known to have been in Naissus in 329 (CTh XI 27, 1 of May 13),<ref target="#CH1-n162">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> In addition it should be mentioned that Symmachus by 329 must have been a man of considerable standing; he was one of the consuls of 330.
               The character of his office, by CTh II 15, 1 recorded with <hi rend="italic">vicarius</hi> only, is uncertain. The necessity to alter the
               Imperial consulships recorded is no serious obstacle for our arrangement, particularly if one considers the unreliability of the records
               concerning the consulates of the Imperial Houses.</p>
            <p>It remains to discuss the CTh IX 37, 1 issued at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName> on November 26, addressed to a certain
               Ianuarinus. First of all the proper dates should be restored to the CTh V 10, 1 of August 18, and the CTh XII 1, 16 of September 29, both issued
               at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>. The consulates recorded are correct for 329 except for the slight error <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VIIII et Constantio IIII conss</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VIII et Constantino C IIII.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH1-n163">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Formally the date of CTh IX 37, 1 is in order, but physically it is impossible for the Emperor to have been in Sirmium on October 24, 319
               (CTh I 16, 3), in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName> on November 26 and anew in Sirmium on December 1 (CTh V 2, 1). This
               must be explained as a case of an omitted postconsulate.<ref target="#CH1-n164">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> This would give us the year 320, the end of which the Emperor spent in this important city. The fact that we have a decree (CTh IX 34, 3)
               addressed to the same Ianuarinus and posted on December 4, 320 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> (thus issued in November ?)
               makes the likelihood of this arrangement even greater. Furthermore, both deal with actions at law, CTh IX 34, 3 with defamatory writings and CTh
               IX 37, 1 with annulments of suits.</p>
            <p>The constitutions discussed show that <persName>Constantine</persName> spent the entire year 320 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName> except on two possible occasions, May 22 (CTh IX 1, 5) and July 22 (CTh XV 1, 4). Now the consular dating of the <pb n="41"/> former is <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VII et Constantio C conss,</hi> the correct formula of 326. Although the years 320 and 326
               are easily confused<ref target="#CH1-n165">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>, there seems to be no reason for an alteration in this case. It is true that the editions of CTh record the addressee as Maximus <hi rend="italic">p(raefectus) u(rbi),</hi> and that a Maximus (Valerius Maximus Basilius) held that office from September 1, 319 to September 12,
               323. On the other hand, two generally reliable mss., B and N,<ref target="#CH1-n166">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> record the office as <hi rend="italic">P(raefectus) p(raetori)o.</hi> This reading has not been accepted though it offers a far easier
               solution of the problem of the decree than either the acceptance of the date or the insertion of a <hi rend="italic">p(ost) c(onsulatum)</hi> in
               the subscription. As, however, the decree was accepted, and accordingly posted in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, this
               implies that the pretorian prefect must have been the administrative head of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>. According to
                  <persName>Seeck</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n167">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> such was not the case, since starting from the appointment of Rufinus (from December 1, 318 according to <persName>Seeck</persName>, from
               the same day in 319 according to me)<ref target="#CH1-n168">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> we get pretorian prefects in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n169">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> This, however, appears to be a misinterpretation of the evidence although the persons referred to by <persName>Seeck</persName> must have
               been officials of considerable standing. Neither <persName>Menandros</persName> (June 22, 320–July 6, 322, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>), nor <persName>Acilius Severas</persName> (December 18, 322–January 23, 324, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>), nor <persName>Volusianus</persName> (August 1, 321, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>) is addressed as pretorian prefect in any constitution in CTh. The only official referred to in that capacity is actually
                  <persName>Vettius Rufinus</persName>, and <persName>Seeck</persName> justly remarks that his tenure of office appears to coincide with
                  <persName>Crispus’</persName> first command in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n170">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref>
               <persName>Seeck</persName> argues further that the custom of addressing a decree to a pretorian prefect became necessary when the number of
               prefectures was increased and the holders were acting far away from the court. As long as there had been one prefect only there had been no need
               to direct decrees expressly to him. Obviously <persName>Vettius Rufinus</persName> created a precedent, and when after the defeat of
                  <persName>Licinius</persName> the East fell to <persName>Constantine</persName>, and the pretorian prefects necessarily must have been
                  two,<ref target="#CH1-n171">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> the custom adopted during his tenure of office was developed further. <persName>Ulpius Maximus</persName> appears to have been the Western
                  <pb n="42"/> prefect in charge both of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>, and this accounts for the decree having been posted in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, although
               Maximus later appears solely in his capacity of <hi rend="italic">praefectus praetorio Galliarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second constitution mentioned (CTh XV 1, 4) is more easily dealt with. Despite the physical impossibility that
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> stayed in Sirmium on July 22, 320, it is more natural to regard CTh XV 1, 4 as a case of an omitted post
               consulate and date it as 321. The subscription is also otherwise corrupt with <hi rend="italic">Constantino A IIII et Constantio</hi>
               <hi rend="italic">C conss</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">Constantio A VI et Constantino C conss.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the year 326 <persName>Seeck</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n172">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> records two constitutions (CTh IX 24, 1 of April 1, and CTh IX 8, 1) which, if correctly dated would be incompatible with the decree CTh
               IX 1, 5 addressed to <persName>Ulpius Maximus</persName>, considered above. The addressee of the latter is <persName>Bassus</persName>, <hi rend="italic">vicarius Italiae</hi>, this being the only constitution where he is referred to in this capacity. This
                  <persName>Bassus</persName> must be <persName>Iunius Bassus</persName>, <hi rend="italic">praefectus praetorio Italiae</hi> in 329 and consul
               in 331.<ref target="#CH1-n173">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> The only evidence that he was <hi rend="italic">vicarius Italiae</hi> is CTh IX 8, 1. Thus the other decrees mentioning a
                  <persName>Bassus</persName> (possibly <persName>Septimius Bassus</persName>, the former urban prefect) do not prevent us from redating this
               decree as 318, when <persName>Constantine</persName>'s presence in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> is otherwise
               firmly attested. The list of <hi rend="italic">vicarii Italiae</hi> as recorded by <persName>Seeck</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n174">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> is headed by <persName>Iulius Severus</persName>, first in evidence on June 27, 318. That <persName>Iunius Bassus</persName> was the first
                  <hi rend="italic">vicarius Italiae</hi> is thus very likely. This arrangement implies that the subscription of CTh IX 8, 1 is restored as <hi rend="italic">Licinio A V et Crispo C conss</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Constantino A VII et Constantio Caes conss</hi> in the present day
               editions.</p>
            <p>The unreliability of the Imperial consulships as recorded by CTh has been demonstrated fully before and stressed by all editors. An extract of
               the <hi rend="italic">apparatus criticus</hi> of the Mommsen-Meyer edition goes to show how much at variance the textual tradition is:
                  <q>"Constantino (constantio <hi rend="italic">PM,</hi> const. <hi rend="italic">C</hi>) a <hi rend="italic">(om. H)</hi> uii <hi rend="italic">(i G)</hi> et constantio <hi rend="italic">(sic VBEC,</hi> Constantino <hi rend="italic">NGPMS</hi>, constante <hi rend="italic">HO)</hi>
                  caes <hi rend="italic">(sic VHN</hi>, om. <hi rend="italic">reliqui) libri.</hi>”</q>
            </p>
            <p>The second Aquileian constitution CTh IX 24, 1 is closely connected with the one discussed above, both with regard to content, place and date of
               issue. The proper year is accordingly 318.</p>
            <pb n="43"/>
            <p>With regard to the constitutions of later years we may in passing note that the proper year for CTh XII 5, 1<ref target="#CH1-n175">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> is 327, the constitution being probably a case of an omitted postconsulate, and restore CTh XI 7, 4 and IX 12, 2 to their proper dates,
               those indicated in the subscriptions, i.e. the years 327 and 326, respectively.<ref target="#CH1-n176">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Similarly the date of CTh VI 1, 4, by the manuscript given as June 27, 317, can be maintained despite <persName>Seeck</persName>’s
               attempts to change it to 330.</p>

                  the selection of the material of early date shows that a considerable number of the consitutions were not to be found in the capital. Material
                  from other places must therefore be brought together, and the compilers in some instances most certainly had to be satisfied with incomplete

                  course, comes first. As <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> was the only mint to strike gold for
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> in the five first years of his reign, we have little reason to go into details of internal chronology.
                  Suffice it to say that the earliest group comprised aurei marked TR depicting <persName>Constantine</persName> as <persName>Caesar</persName>,
                  the second solidi marked PTR showing <persName>Constantine</persName> as <persName>Augustus</persName>. The latter group was struck in the
                  years immediately preceding the Italian campaign.<ref target="#CH1-n183">

               <p>The next Treveran group of gold coins is different in many respects, the flan larger and thinner, the relief flat, the portrait broad and
                  squarish. To this group belong the dateable gold pieces commemorating both the fourth consulate and the <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> of
                  the Emperor, although certain types appear to have been struck before these years (315–July 316). However, before dealing with this group of
                  coins it seems appropriate to study the early Italian gold coins struck by <persName>Constantine</persName>.</p>
               <p>The influence of Treveran prototypes upon Italian issues has been noted by previous research.<ref target="#CH1-n186">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> to be mechanically and thoughtlessly copied at first until it was refashioned with the

               <p>The session at <placeName>Milan</placeName> was not a long one. Germanic tribes threatened the Rhine frontier and

                  the way he chose when travelling to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> and the time of his arrival in the Gallic capital.
                  It is tempting to assume that he journeyed by way of Southern <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>, i.e. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>, and to regard the first solidi of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> as struck during a visit of the Emperor to the mint city, but, as <persName>Constantine</persName>’s presence in
                     <placeName>Milan</placeName> is attested for March 10, 313, his visit to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> would

                  that the unusual reverse types PRINCIPIS PROVIDENTISSIMI-SAPIENTIA (164) and the varieties of VIRTVS AVGVSTI (289) were struck then.<ref target="#CH1-n196">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> The unique character of the reverses cannot, I think, be explained except by assuming an Imperial visit to the mint city to have been
                  the reason for creating them.</p>
               <p>The return of the Emperor to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> in 313 brought about a new period of gold coining in the
                  Gallic capital. We cannot tell exactly when he took up residence in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, nor when the
                  coining started. It is quite possible that this happened only after the Francian war. This is suggested by the rich array of consular coins
                  and decennial types. Except for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>, no other mint struck anything corresponding. Thus
                  the coins corroborate the results of our study of the Theodosian Code that <persName>Constantine</persName> celebrated his <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> for the first time in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, and travelled to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> only after August 3, 315.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Constantine</persName>’s stay at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> in 315 appears to have been of very short
                     duration,<ref target="#CH1-n197">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> at any rate not long enough to make it worth while to bring the court and the administration down to the old capital. The absence of
                  gold coins struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> would otherwise be inexplicable. His main reason for visiting
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> might have been the inauguration of his triumphal arch.</p>
               <p>Instead of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> became his residence, a fact amply attested by the rich issue of gold coinage.

                  issue, marked PT, is shown by a <pb n="53"/> consular coin to have been struck within the same period. The PT coins were: <hi rend="italic">Gaudium Romanorum[Franc et Alatn, Pm trib p cos IIII pp procos</hi>, Restitutor <hi rend="italic">libertatis</hi> (Emp. seat. w.

                  the earlier Treveran coinage, the second phase of coining introduces the new facing portrait and, for the old legend <hi rend="italic">Restitutori libertatis</hi>, a new imagery. The symbolism of the few coins marked ·T· is new in the Constantinian coinage, as are two of
                  the three types of the following issue. In the last series, the second SMT issue, only the legends remind us of the Treveran gold coinage,
                  whereas a number of types were continued later in other mints.</p>
               <p>The fact that no obverses of the <persName>Caesars</persName> appear in the Ticinese coinage during any of the series mentioned shows that
                  they all were issued before the settlement at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>, probably even before the New Year

                  <p>It is, of course fairly difficult to establish the exact time when gold minting was discontinued at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>. I have earlier contended that this probably happened after the Italian campaign, i.e., that, e.g., the <hi rend="italic">SPQR optimo principi</hi> and the vota coins with the later obv. break CONSTANTI-NVS PF AVG were struck after the battle
                     of the Milvian Bridge, but before the expiry of the <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> on March 31, 312. This is not necessarily correct,
                     though there is no doubt as to the chronological significance of the two obv. breaks N-T and T-I. Gold coining possibly continued in
                        <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> until the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> could
                     start supplying <persName>Constantine</persName> with cash in that precious metal; there might even have been some overlapping as regards
                     coining in these two mints. I cannot believe that the personnel of any one mint, nor even certain groups of workers in precious metals,
                     were transferred to other mints as long as their original mint continued to work, except in special cases (cf. <persName>Mrs.
                        Alföldi</persName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, p. 109, note 55). Otherwise it would be very difficult to
                     account for the individual style of the mints.</p>

               <p>Gold coining at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> was discontinued for the obvious reason that the court, the

               <p>Before following the travels of the Emperor and the court any further, a few words should be devoted to the gold struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> at this time. Both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> and Treveri were
                  coining, the former mint for a short period only. Two types common both for the West and for the East, originating in Ticinese solidi of the
                  second SMT issue, illustrate how the central mint distributed prototypes as modified versions of the original reverses. The <hi rend="italic">Virtus exercitus Gall</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Virtus augusti n</hi> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>) was
                  struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> (304), <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> (303),
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName> (Plate IV, 305) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (306), the <hi rend="italic">Felicitas perpetua</hi>

These two were the only later gold types of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>,
                  whereas the Treveran gold coinage was more varied, and included also special types for the <persName>Caesars</persName>. Some of the types of
                  316–317 were clearly influenced by earlier Ticinese types. The chief Gallic mint, however, retained a very high degree of independence until
                  the last years of <persName>Constantine</persName>'s life, possibly owing to the fact that Crispus in 318 was given the <hi rend="italic">praefectura Galliarum</hi> (after Civil War II <persName>Constantine II</persName> was in charge of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>). The mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> can therefore be disregarded in the sequel.</p>
               <p>To return to the Danube provinces, the court and <persName>Constantine</persName> can scarcely have stayed long in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName>, and on March 1 the literary sources attest the Emperor’s presence at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName> for the reconciliation with <persName>Licinius</persName>.

               <p>Only a few specimens are known of each type. It is possible that the correspondence between the Ticinese and Thessalonican types was even more
                  complete than the list suggests. Clearly here is another case of models brought from one mint to another. The two vota types are of particular
                  interest, partly because both were struck after the actual decennial year, partly because of the significant singular <hi rend="italic">aug.</hi>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> struck the <hi rend="italic">Victoriae laetae</hi> type with the plural <hi rend="italic">augg nn,</hi> whereas <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> used <hi rend="italic">aug n</hi>,
                  thus showing that the legend must have been altered before the peace treaty of 317. The “anachronism” of a decennial type being
                  struck after the decennial year is explained by the celerity employed when starting the Constantinian issues at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>.</p>
               <p>From <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> the central mint moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>. The exact time is in doubt, but although gold issues of the years 319–322 are known from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> also and from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>, the fact that the
                  Emperor’s fifth consulate (in 319) was celebrated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> only (73), <pb n="57"/>
                  makes it a fair inference that the consular coin was struck for the New Year 319. An <hi rend="italic">Adventus</hi> coin of the same mint (2)
                  implies that the <hi rend="italic">processus consularis</hi> that year took place in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n210">

                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> Generally speaking, my survey of the Imperial constitutions has shown that the Emperor spent almost all the year 318 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, 319 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> and 320 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>. The last Serdican decree (of this period) was issued in February 321. On April 4 his
                  presence is established in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>, and in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> he appears to have remained until July 20, 322 with a necessary break for the Sarmatian War. After the war he returned
                  to his residence, but in the autumn he starts moving; in December he is in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>, in
                  February 323 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> preparing the Gothic War, in April he violates Licinian
                  territory when marching against his enemies. The victory must have been easily won, because on May 25 he is back in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>. By now it is clear that an open war against <persName>Licinius</persName> is unavoidable,
                  and the seriousness of the situation is stressed in a letter to <persName>Helpidius</persName> (CTh XVI 2, 5), in which
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> threatens severe punishment to any official found guilty of such anti-Christian measures as evinced during
                     <persName>Licinius</persName>’ quindecennial celebrations (November 322). In early Spring 324 (after January 23) the Emperor moves
                  south, making <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> his military headquarters. War breaks out and in July we
                  have the first encounter between the Emperors at Hadrianople.</p>
               <p>Let us now view the coinage against the background of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s itinerary. <persName>Constantine</persName> and,
                  with him, the central administration stayed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> during all 318, in so far as the
                  Emperor’s movements during this year can be traced. Very likely gold coining started in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> the same year, logically with the <hi rend="italic">Adventus</hi> (2) type (the type <hi rend="italic">Victoria
                     Constantini aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 236) constitutes the link to the preceding gold issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>) and comes to <pb n="58"/> an end with the consular coin and the multiple honoring
                     <persName>Licinius II</persName>, both issued for the New Year. Very soon after the celebrations of the New Year,
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>. The central administration, except for the officials travelling in the Imperial suite, remained behind, and actually
                  were transferred to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>. It is quite likely that no gold was issued for a while; the new
                  types to be struck during the following bout of coining had to be planned, designed and executed. Towards the end of the year (319) an
                  impressive series of gold, solidi as well as multiples, was issued. <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos vi aug n</hi> (75) gives the date,
                  New Year 320. The friendly relations with the fellow-ruler <persName>Licinius</persName> are eloquently illustrated by the multiple <hi rend="italic">Iovi conservatori</hi> (114) with Licinian obverse, by the type <hi rend="italic">Concordia augg nn</hi> with obverses of
                  both Augusti and Crispus (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 8; 9–10), and by the plurality of Augusti stressed in reverse legends such as
                     <hi rend="italic">Virtus augg nn</hi> (288), <hi rend="italic">Victorib augg et caess nn/vot xx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III,
                  279). The vota coins recording the <hi rend="italic">vota vicennalia suscepta</hi> (277) give us the <hi rend="italic">terminus post</hi> for
                  the end of this gold issue, July 25, 320. It may be noted that Sol still appears to be the tutelary god of the Emperor (the multiple <hi rend="italic">Soli invicto comiti</hi>, 197, the solidus <hi rend="italic">Soli comiti aug n,</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 189).</p>
               <p>However, few older types were represented in the Ticinese issue of 320/321. The <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince hold, spear
                  and globe, 135) and the two Sol types both represent old type stock; the new types, however, were distributed farther from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>. The <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos vi aug n</hi> was struck both in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> (76) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> (74, 77), where the <hi rend="italic">processus consularis</hi> of the year must have taken place. In addition, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> received from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> the types <hi rend="italic">Soli comiti aug
                     n</hi> (190),<ref target="#CH1-n213">

                  although no specimen has survived to our days.<ref target="#CH1-n214">

               <p>
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> spent almost the whole year 320 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>, probably
                  reorganizing the frontier defense and preparing the Sarmatian War. To have a central administration in faraway <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> must have been a serious disadvantage, and in the later part of 320 the court moved north
                  and made <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> its residence. According to a preconceived plan
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> joined the court in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> in early 321. About the same
                  time, if not earlier for the consular procession at New Year, his sons, the <persName>Caesars Crispus</persName> and <persName>Constantine
                     II</persName> had arrived for their quinquennial celebrations. Hence the medallion <hi rend="italic">Felix adventus caess nn</hi> (65). The
                  center of gravity of the Sirmian gold issues belongs to the year 321/322 when the <persName>Caesars</persName> celebrated their consulates,
                  the <persName>Augustus</persName> his expiring <hi rend="italic">quindecennalia</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 280) and the
                     <persName>Caesars</persName> their <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 266; 267; 263; V, 264). The
                  mint had, however, been opened well in advance of this festival year. The necessary arrangements had probably been made during
                     <persName>Constantine</persName>’s stay in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> in 320. The first Sirmian gold
                  coins are from this year (m. m. · SIRM ·) and reflect their Ticinese prototype <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos vi</hi> (74).<ref target="#CH1-n215">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The next series of gold (m. m. SIRM) reflects considerable Ticinese influence with its types <hi rend="italic">Victorib augg et caess

               </p>
               <p>The gold series of 321 demonstrate convincingly that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> now had become the center of
                  the Constantinian Empire. Here, and here alone, the <hi rend="italic">quinquennalia</hi> of the <persName>Caesars</persName> were celebrated,
                  here the consulships, here the arrival of the <persName>Caesars</persName> were commemorated on the gold coins. The types are, generally
                  speaking, new. However, <persName>Constantine</persName> himself retains the Sol symbolism though in a fairly watered down version. That we
                  now have reached the first year of tension between East and West can be seen in the wording of the reverses, <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>
                  (218) or <hi rend="italic">Virtus aug et caess</hi> (287) instead of the plurality of Augusti in <hi rend="italic">Victorib augg et caess
                     nn/vot xx</hi>. To a certain extent <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> makes its imprint felt (237, 238).</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> was to remain the administrative center until Civil War II; no mint is known to have
                  issued coins in precious metal until <pb n="60"/> 324.<ref target="#CH1-n217">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The earliest gold issues of 324 are the consular types of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos iii</hi> (· SIRM ·, 70) hailing the consulships of the young Western <persName>Caesars</persName>. The
                  series of gold initiated with this consular type is of exceptional interest. The first series marked · SIRM · (comprising also two varieties
                  of <hi rend="italic">Gloria Romanorum</hi>, 103–4, and the type <hi rend="italic">Perpetua felicitas</hi>, 123), must have been struck to the
                  New Year, whereas the second marked SIRM in addition comprised the first type for Constantius II (145) nominated <persName>Caesar</persName>
                  on November 8, 324, and the <persName>Augustae Helena</persName> (182) and <persName>Fausta</persName> (198), and further the first diademed
                  upward-looking portrait of <persName>Constantine</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(Constantinus aug</hi>, Vict. seated on throne, 19).<ref target="#CH1-n218">

               <p>From <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> instructions were sent to the other mints required for the gold coining.
                  Obviously <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> by now played a very modest part in the economic life of the Empire. Two
                  types only are known from the last postwar issue, the outdated <hi rend="italic">Concordia augg nn</hi> (11) and the <hi rend="italic">Principia iuventutis</hi> (163) with an obverse of Constantius II. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> still served
                  the needs of the central part of the Empire and struck a more varied series with both multiples and solidi of the types of the Augustae, the
                     <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (20) and two varieties of <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (one with an obverse of
                  Constantius II, 142, 146). Finally we have <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, the operational headquarters
                  of <persName>Constantine</persName>, where no coins had been struck since 318. Here we can attest two new types, not known from any other
                  contemporaneous issue, <hi rend="italic">Victor omnium gentium</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV, 208) and <hi rend="italic">Virtus

               <p>Only a study of the first Nicomedian gold series explains the exact mechanics of gold minting during the first postwar years. The relevant
                  series are two: As there is no difference in the mintmarks, the <pb n="61"/> obverses must decide the grouping of the individual coins.<ref target="#CH1-n219">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The first series of coins basically comprised types employed earlier at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> and
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. This applies particularly to the solidi. Among the multiples, however,
                  certain modifications of earlier conceptions were introduced.</p>
               <p>Although one new type was created, the 2-solidi piece <hi rend="italic">Pietas augusti n</hi> (125)—with an obvious reference to the capture
                  of Byzantium and with a suggestion of the great future in store for that city<ref target="#CH1-n220">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>—the common denominator of the first Nicomedian gold coins struck by <persName>Constantine</persName> is the fact that all reverses were
                  “old” types. I believe that two different groups can be distinguished representing successive stages of coining, the first
                  comprising slightly anachronistic types created several years earlier, the second comprising comparatively recent inventions. To the first
                  group I would refer the multiples <hi rend="italic">Crispus et Constantinus iun nobb caess</hi> (48), <hi rend="italic">Felix adventus aug
                     n</hi> (63), <hi rend="italic">Securitas perpetuae</hi> (180), <hi rend="italic">Victoria aug et caess nn</hi> (219), and the solidi <hi rend="italic">Adventus augusti n</hi> (3),<ref target="#CH1-n221">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>
                  <hi rend="italic">Concordia augg nn</hi> (13), <hi rend="italic">Victorib augg et caess nn</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 281), and
                     <hi rend="italic">Vota publica</hi> (309–10). The second group would have the multiples <hi rend="italic">Crispus et Constantius nobb
                     caess</hi> (51), <hi rend="italic">Pietas augusti n</hi> (125), and the solidi <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (Victory seat, on
                  throne <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 22), <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (148), <hi rend="italic">Salus reipublicae</hi>
                  (174), <hi rend="italic">Securitas reipublice</hi> (185), <hi rend="italic">Victor omnium gentium</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> IV,
                  209) and <hi rend="italic">Virtus caesarin</hi> (294). Now the latter group of solidi is almost identical with the one struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> in 324 and consisting mainly of types created at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n222">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> whereas the former was composed of old stock, partly outdated. I therefore suggest that <persName>Constantine</persName>’s
                  expeditionary force had been equipped far in advance with <pb n="62"/> coin models in order that coining could start as soon as the mint was
                  captured. On the other hand, the civilian administration followed slowly in the tracks of the Emperor, and its arrival at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> changed the types brought forth by the army into new up-to-date ones. Thus it seems that
                  the financial administration, having created and distributed the types of 324 followed the Emperor to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> and from there to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n223">

               </p>
               <p>The following bout of gold coining at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> bears the stamp of independence. A series
                  of new types is created, the multiples paying homage to the senatorial (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 186) and equestrian estates (54)
                  and to Roman glory (107), the solidi celebrating the <hi rend="italic">vicennalia</hi> (248) of the Emperor and the courage of the
                     <persName>Caesars</persName> (295, 300). But before studying their echo in the West we should follow the way of the older types of the
                  East, to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> struck no gold under <persName>Licinius</persName>, but immediately after
                     <persName>Constantine</persName>'s conquest of the East a short gold series marked SMKE was issued with (as far as our knowledge goes) the
                  types <hi rend="italic">Concordia augg nn</hi> (14), <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (obv. of Constantius II, 149) and <hi rend="italic">Victorib augg et caess nn/vot xx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 282), all of them of old stock, the first and the
                  third clearly “anachronistic.” This suggests that the coins were issued already in 324. The second gold issue of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> (marked SMK) cannot be of much later date, as the <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi>
                  type (Prince hold, two standards, 150) seems to have disappeared finally about 326. The second reverse is the <hi rend="italic">Constantinus
                     aug</hi> (Victory advancing l. holding wreath, 28) known previously from a Ticinese mule (26).</p>
               <p>The first small gold issue of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyzicus">Cyzicus</placeName> gains in importance when compared with the three first
                  Constantinian issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The dominating characteristic of the gold coins of the three first Constantinian series of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> (marked SMAN, SMAN ·, and SMAN*) <pb n="63"/> is that all reverse types are "old”;<ref target="#CH1-n224">

                  only one obverse of Constantius II is known.</p>
               <p>The reverses of the SMAN series were:</p>

               <p>We may note that these coins correspond with their prototypes even in significant details such as unusual obverse legends (<hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis,</hi> 3-standards type: DN CONSTANTINVS IVN NOB CAES, 141, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 143) or busts <hi rend="italic">(Concordia augg nn,</hi> Crispus with spear and shield, 12, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 15) or reverse variety <hi rend="italic">(Principi iuventutis,</hi> 3-standards, 141, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 143, common to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName>, whereas all later

                  evidence for his travelling either to or from the East. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> was, after all, the
                  capital of the East. A Church council convened in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> in December–January<ref target="#CH1-n228">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> (324–25) to prepare the council of the following summer. Possibly owing to interference on the part of the Emperor, plans were altered
                  and, instead of the council of the Eastern church scheduled to meet at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ancyra">Ancyra</placeName>, an ecumenical
                  council was summoned at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicaea_bithynia">Nicaea</placeName>. We have ample evidence of the interest the Emperor
                  at this time took in matters concerning the Church.<ref target="#CH1-n229">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> Already for this reason a visit to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> might have appeared imperative to
                  him. As a point of curiosity we may note that at approximately this time, the time of the Antiochene council, the last Sol type was issued,
                     <hi rend="italic">Soli comiti aug n</hi>. Subsequently, until the last years of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s life no gold was
                  struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName>.</p>
               <pb n="65"/>
               <p>We now return to the regions of the Bosporus, to <persName>Constantine</persName>’s initial vicennial celebrations on July 25, 325. For
                  this occasion the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> had created a number of special types, the majority of
                  which, however, stressed less the Imperial anniversary than things Roman in general. But the <hi rend="italic">vicennalia</hi> were celebrated
                  twice, for the second time a year later in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. The Roman gold of 326 (marked SMR) is very
                  scarce, an indication of the short duration of the Emperor’s stay in the old capital. Only two gold types are known, namely <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> (multiple, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 187) and <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xx</hi>
                  (solidus, 247, and submultiple).</p>
               <p>Now the execution of these Roman gold pieces is truly remarkable. We note particularly the heavenward gazing portraits and the unusual
                  arrangement of the obverse legend with <hi rend="italic">Constantinus</hi> along the left edge and <hi rend="italic">aug</hi> under the
                     chin.<ref target="#CH1-n230">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> One other mint had previously employed exactly the same technique, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>,
                  on the <hi rend="italic">Equis Romanus</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 55) medallions,<ref target="#CH1-n231">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> which are closely connected with the <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> type. Also in point of style the resemblance is striking, and I
                  regard it as quite possible that <persName>Constantine</persName> when visiting <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> in 326
                  brought ready-made dies with him from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. Again, the Nicomedian and
                  Thessalonican multiples cannot be exactly contemporaneous; the <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi> aurei of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 186) have a plain diademed upward looking head, the corresponding 3-solidi
                  piece of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> a consular bust (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 188).</p>
               <p>Thus <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> struck for the vicennial year 325, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> for the consular year 326. The conclusion is evident; on his way from Asia Minor
                  to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> and, with him, the travelling mint, i.e. the travelling officials of the central mint administration stayed
                  for a while in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> in early 326.</p>
               <p>Before we follow <persName>Constantine</persName> on his journey to the West we should deal with a short but important Thessalonican issue,
                  exceptionally marked THES. A submultiple of the reverse <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xx</hi> (246) gives the general date,
                  the vicennial year. Two other THES marked coins are known, the splendid multiples of the type <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi>
                  (Prince hold. standard, behind another standard, <pb n="66"/> 151). The fact that no obverse of Crispus is known must be accidental. Thus we
                  must conclude that the THES issue was struck in the Winter 325/326 before the SMTS issue with the <hi rend="italic">Senatus</hi>
                  medallion.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> for the year 326 created an entirely new set of types depicting all rulers with
                  diademed upward looking portraits. The reverse simply records the name of the ruler in question, the obverses have no legend at all. The type
                  struck for <persName>Constantine</persName> shows two interlaced wreaths (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 23), the type designed for the
                     <persName>Caesars</persName>, Crispus (44), <persName>Constantine II</persName> (35) and Constantius II (40), Victory advancing left,
                  holding wreath and palm branch. This set of gold coins was probably issued at New Year at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> and, it seems, at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 36; 41) during the Emperor’s short stay in the Macedonian capital.<ref target="#CH1-n232">

               <p>
                  <persName>Constantine</persName>’s journey to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> in 326 brought about a concentration
                  of the gold coining in the East, or at least, in the mints close to the Bosporus. The mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> were closed, while coining at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> had been suspended slightly earlier.</p>
               <p>The Emperor returned from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> by way of Pannonia. On the last of December 326 he was in
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>; a short issue, by the vota type <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis/vot

               <pb n="67"/>
               <p>Acting on instructions previously received, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> during the Emperor's absence issued
                  a special type to the <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> of the <persName>Caesars</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Votis x caess nn</hi> (315).
                  The type was subsequently forwarded to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, but at the time of issue Crispus
                  had been put to death. The wording was accordingly altered to <hi rend="italic">Votis x caes n</hi> (314), and the medallion issued together
                  with the special type <hi rend="italic">Votis decenn DN Constantini caes</hi> (311), the multiple <hi rend="italic">Gloria Constantini
                     aug</hi> (Plate VII, 97), a slight variation of the similarly worded Siscian type, and the <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi>
                  (solidus, 29).<ref target="#CH1-n236">

               <p>The opening of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> displays some unusual features. We know
                  that the first bronze coins were struck in 326 at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>, and one gold piece
                  unequivocally belongs to the same year, namely the <hi rend="italic">Gloria Romanorum</hi> with an obverse depicting Crispus as consul (105).
                  The disturbing feature is that we know of no precedent of this type, although the Crispus coin points to a prototype struck during
                  Crispus’ third consulship in 324. Connected with the vicennial celebrations of <persName>Constantine</persName> is the uninscribed
                  reverse with the Emperor standing in a quadriga (318). The first Constantinopolitan gold series was probably issued before the mint had been
                  wholly established; the personnel of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> appears to have been moved to the
                  capital-to-be before the mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> were closed and transferred to the Bosporus.</p>
               <p>The first Constantinopolitan issue probably also comprising the reverses <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (27) and <hi rend="italic">Constantinus caes</hi> (34)<ref target="#CH1-n237">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> with diademed heads reminds us once more of the types created for 326 and brought by the Emperor to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> during his journey to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. True, the types
                  survive for several years in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>, but they lose their festival character,
                  the obverses receive the ordinary legends, the busts become draped and cuirassed as was customary, <persName>Constantine</persName> wearing a
                  rosette diadem, the <persName>Caesars</persName> laurel wreaths (e.g. 33).</p>
               <pb n="68"/>
               <p>During the busy years 327 (latter part)–330 (early part) <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> was the residence of
                  the court and its mint the central mint of the Empire. Before the inauguration of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> on May 11, 330 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> issued three gold series, the
                  first reflecting the series struck slightly earlier at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. The multiples were
                     <hi rend="italic">Gloria Romanorum</hi> (108), <hi rend="italic">Gloria Constantini aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 98), <hi rend="italic">Virtus Constantini caes</hi> (298) and <hi rend="italic">Virtus Constanti caes</hi> (Emperor advancing r., holding trophy and
                  spear between two captives, 296), the only solidus type being the <hi rend="italic">Constantinus aug</hi> (Victory advancing l., holding
                  trophy, 30) as in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. Not much later a multiple varying the same theme was
                  issued but with a different mintmark <graphic url="NNM47_082A.jpg"/> namely, <hi rend="italic">Gloria Constantini aug</hi> (Emperor standing
                  between captives, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 99) and finally, on the eve of the dedication of the new capital, the rejoicing of the
                  Empire was expressed in terms of the <hi rend="italic">Gaudium augusti nostri</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 83) and <hi rend="italic">Pietas augusti nostri</hi> (the latter struck both as multiple and solidus, 126). Here the creative phase of the Nicomedian
                  mint ends. This issue appears to have been continued to the twenty-fifth anniversary of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s ascent to the
                  throne, when a series of <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 255) was issued. The
                  characteristic truncation of the obverse head as well as the short hair on the nape of the neck connects these coins with the previous issues
                  and distinguishes them from the subsequent vota issues of 335–336 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 256–7).</p>
               <p>Before the responsibility of the central mint was conferred upon <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>,
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_thracica">Heraclea</placeName> struck a group of gold. The 3-solidi piece <hi rend="italic">Salus et
                     spes reipublicae</hi> (170) was shortly to be repeated in the new capital. The solidus type <hi rend="italic">Victor omnium gentium</hi>
                  had been struck after Civil War II in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>, but the rosette diademed bust of
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> indicates a later time of issue (210). The third type was <hi rend="italic">Victoria caesar nn</hi>
                  (Victory advancing l., holding wreath, 221).<ref target="#CH1-n238">

                  <p>The fact that all the coins are solidi or multiples of the solidus (except the heavy <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos vi aug n)</hi>
                     proves the coins to have been struck after <persName>Constantine</persName>'s conquest. Strictly speaking this is not correct of the <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos ii. We</hi> know only a <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos iii</hi> of Crispus marked · SIRM · (in
                     BM) and another marked SIRM (Hirsch XXIV 2613). In the Hunter coll. there is an irreg. <hi rend="italic">Felix processus cos ii aug</hi>
                     (68) of Const. II. This coin may, however, be a barb, copy (of distorted rev. leg.) of a regular Sirmian original. Because of the date
                     clearly indicated on the consular coins they have caused confusion among scholars, and so Maurice was moved to declare them false <hi rend="italic">(Num. Const.</hi> III, pp. 198f.). On formal grounds there would be no objection to a legend recording a certain consulate
                     (n) until the person in question acquired his following consulate (n+1.). Thus e.g. the consular legend COS VI for
                        <persName>Constantine</persName> would be valid throughout 320-325 (incl.) until he in 326 entered his seventh consulship. In practice,
                     however, the consulships recorded on the coins of the Constantinian epoch appear to have been struck in the actual year of office. Be that
                     as it may, the consular coins recording the second consulships of the <persName>Caesars</persName> were outdated in the year 324. On the
                     other hand, we know that <persName>Constantine</persName>’s appointing of his sons as consuls for the year 321 actually broke off the
                     friendly relations between <persName>Constantine</persName> and <persName>Licinius</persName> (<persName>Seeck</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Regesten</hi>, p. 172, my <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>
                     </hi>, p. 33, also note 3); the latter did not accept the Western consuls, appointed himself and his son opposition consuls for this year,
                     and started a consular reckoning according to the formula <hi rend="italic">consulibus quos iusserint dd nn</hi> (I, II, III and IV), cf.
                     Kase, <hi rend="italic">P RollPrinc,</hi> p. 34. Clearly, the two consular coins cannot have been struck by
                     <persName>Licinius</persName>—and on no account at solidus standards.</p>

                  <p>It is possible that the second consulships of the sons of <persName>Constantine</persName> were noted according to the Antiochene <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi>, where only one previous consulship must have been recorded, since <persName>Licinius</persName> had refused to
                     accept the consuls of 321 (Crispus and <persName>Constantine II</persName>). Even so the reverse types illustrate the rush to provide the
                     army with cash.</p>

               <p>In connection with the inauguration of the new capital the central mint moves to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>, a fact signalled by the reverse legend <hi rend="italic">Adventus augusti n</hi> (5). An impressive array of
                  magnificent multiples is issued, the 30-solidi piece <hi rend="italic">Gaudium Romanorum</hi> (90), the 9-solidi <hi rend="italic">Salus et
                     spes reipublicae</hi> (171) and the 3-solidi <hi rend="italic">Gaudium augusti nostri</hi> (84), a link with the preceding issue of
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>. The ordinary solidi continue the series issued in 327 with Victory advancing
                  1., holding wreath and palm branch. The reverses include individual legends for each ruler (33, 39). At this juncture the first
                  Constantinopolitan <hi rend="italic">vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="italic">suscepta)</hi> appears to have been struck; the only solidus known (252)
                  has an anachronistic consular bust, a reminder of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s eighth consulship in 329. The corresponding
                  sub-multiple (253), the first one to be struck, employed the obverse legend CONSTANTINVS AVG, whereas all others regardless of mint
                  subsequently used CONSTANTINVS MAX AVG (258).</p>
               <p>For the following years we have but scanty information on the Emperor’s whereabouts. Most of the notices put him in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>. The gaps are considerable and give almost any amplitude for travels over

               <p>Although the coin reverses now grow increasingly stereotyped, we occasionally get indisputable evidence of the Emperor's travels. The first
                  after the celebrations in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>—if we except some tricennial <hi rend="italic">vota suscepta</hi> both of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> (255) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> (252) struck July 25, 330/331—is a Thessalonican issue (mintmark MTS) with a
                  submultiple <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xxx</hi> (258).<ref target="#CH1-n239">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> As important innovations in the same issue we may note the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug</hi> (Victory
                  advancing l., holding trophy, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 239), and <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince standing,
                  holding <hi rend="italic">vexillum</hi>, behind two standards, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 154). The third solidus type is the <hi rend="italic">Victoria caesarum</hi> (Victory advancing l., holding wreath, 223). The date of the following issue of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> (marked TS), repeating the two former types (240, 155), is in doubt. A sojourn of
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> any of the years 332–334 is
                  possible; the absence of Constans, however, in this rich issue, excludes the year 334, and this, I believe is as close as we can get the
                  date.</p>
               <p>In the same years, i.e. in connection with Constans' elevation to the rank of <persName>Caesar</persName> and with Constantius' <hi rend="italic">decennalia</hi> we get the first gold issue of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> after
                  the inauguration of the city and after the first vota issue of 330–331. The former event is attested by the 9-solidi piece <hi rend="italic">Securitas perpetua</hi> (176), the latter by the solidus <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constanti caes/vot xv</hi> (225). That the sons of
                     <persName>Constantine</persName> were in the foreground is further attested by the heavy medallions <hi rend="italic">Principi
                     iuventutis</hi> (152, no obverse of Constans known). With the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Gaudium augusti nostri</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VII, 85)<ref target="#CH1-n240">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> no medallion obverse of <persName>Constantine</persName> is known. The solidi of this gold series were of the traditional type, Victory
                  advancing l., holding wreath.</p>
               <p>Before we arrive at the special issues of the tricennial year we should mention a gold series struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName> in 334,<ref target="#CH1-n241">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> comprising two <pb n="71"/> types introduced 331 at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug</hi> (Victory advancing l., holding trophy, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 242), and <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince holding <hi rend="italic">vexillum,</hi> 157). The latter type was shared by Constans
                  also.</p>
               <p>The tricennial issues are not easy to grasp. Rich series were minted at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 249–50, 260), <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 256–7) and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> and a very small one at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> (259). <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> struck a
                  special type of medallion (316, <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 317) but not the ordinary tricennial solidus. Finally <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> coined the unique <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xxxx</hi>
                     (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 262) together with the ordinary <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 254). We have, however, two different series of gold coins struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> during the two last years of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s life, the
                  first continuing the traditional solidus type (Victory advancing l. with wreath) and introducing special types both for Constans (17) and
                  Delmatius (53). This takes us past September 18, 335. The only vota type that possibly could belong to this series is the <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 254), but both stylistic criteria and the scarcity of the
                  type refer it to the later vota issue of the summer 336. It would certainly have been unworthy of the occasion for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> to coin so sparsely for the <persName>Augustus</persName>, had the first
                  tricennial celebrations taken place in the Eastern capital.</p>
               <p>It now appears highly likely that he did not celebrate in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> in 335 but
                  in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>. This we can deduce from the enormous output of tricennial vota solidi,
                  multiples, and special types of the latter mint.</p>
               <p>The Nicomedian gold of 335 was probably struck in two phases, the first using the upward looking portraits (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi>
                  VIII, 256), the second the diademed draped busts (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 257). Together with the vota type <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xxx</hi> we find the magnificent multiple <hi rend="italic">Felicitas perpetua aug et caess nn</hi> (58), and
                  the solidi <hi rend="italic">Virtus Constantini caes</hi> (299) and <hi rend="italic">Virtus Constanti caes</hi> (297).</p>
               <p>The belief that <persName>Constantine</persName> celebrated his initial <hi rend="italic">tricennalia</hi> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> has been deeply rooted and ultimately goes back to
                     <persName>Eusebius</persName>’ assertion that he read his eulogy to the Emperor in the Imperial Palace on this occasion. Already
                  Valesius thought this <pb n="72"/> highly unlikely,<ref target="#CH1-n242">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> and Heikel is of the same opinion; the eulogy was not a speech but a treatise, probably written in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n243">

                  August-September 335 visited <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName>, and two mintmarks, the first (SIS) with three varieties
                  of the reverse <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug/vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 249–50, 260), the second

                  (Prince standing, holding spear and globe, 139) reverse and the type <hi rend="italic">Victoria caesarum</hi> (224) were minted.</p>
               <p>Returning from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName>, obviously towards the end of October,<ref target="#CH1-n249">

                  <persName>Constantine</persName> stayed for a short while in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>. On this

                  (316) was issued together with the customary solidus <pb n="73"/> types <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug</hi> (advancing l., holding
                     trophy),<ref target="#CH1-n250">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince holding <hi rend="italic">vexillum,</hi> 156), the dynastic multiple <hi rend="italic">Salus et spes reipublicae</hi> (172), and, as a new creation, <hi rend="italic">Gloria exercitus</hi> (Emperor standing, holding trophy,
                  100). This concludes the Constantinian issues in gold in this mint.</p>
               <p>The Emperor then returned to his capital. The gold series issued in this context included the previous Constantinopolitan solidus reverse,
                  varieties for the <persName>Augustus</persName> and all four <persName>Caesars</persName>, and the dynastic multiple (some months earlier
                  struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>) <hi rend="italic">Salus et spes reipublicae</hi> (173), and the
                  new creation <hi rend="italic">Securitas perpetua</hi> (177).</p>
               <p>The final gold coining at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName> followed in the summer of 336 for the second
                  tricennial celebrations, comprising not only the <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug</hi> with both <hi rend="italic">vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 254) and <hi rend="italic">vot xxxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 262), but also the <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini caesar</hi>/vot <hi rend="italic">xx</hi> (265) for the vicennial celebrations due on March 1, 336/37.
                  Other types were <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> (Prince holding <hi rend="italic">vexillutn,</hi> 159, 160), <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug</hi> (243) and <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constanti caesar</hi> (226, both: Victory advancing l., holding trophy,
                  a new reverse for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</placeName>), the multiple <hi rend="italic">Gloria
                     Romanorum</hi> (106) and the aureus, without legend, showing the Emperor in a quadriga scattering coins (319).</p>
               <p>It remains to account for two mints more or less out of touch—at least as far as gold coining goes—with the happenings in the rest of the
                  Empire, namely, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> ceased to issue gold after the coining of the winter and spring 324-325
                  and of early 326. During the tricennial year we find a series of solidi coined at the Syrian mint, <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini
                     aug/vot xxx</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 261) followed by some solidi of the reverses <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini
                     aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 245) and <hi rend="italic">Victoria caesar nn</hi> (222, both: Victory advancing l.,
                  holding trophy). The solidi without vota must have been struck in the last year of <persName>Constantine</persName>, and both the series
                  mentioned should be viewed in the light of the Sassanian war planned by <persName>Constantine</persName> (possibly also Calocaerus’
                  rebellion) at the end of his reign. The tricennial series was preceded by a small issue of the reverse type “Victory advancing l.,
                  holding trophy,” at first with the reverse legend <hi rend="italic">Con</hi>- <pb n="74"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">stantinus aug</hi> (31), subsequently altered to <hi rend="italic">Victoria Constantini aug</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 244). In addition some <hi rend="italic">Principi iuventutis</hi> solidi of the type “Prince holding <hi rend="italic">vexillum”</hi> (153) were struck. It is natural to assume that this series, also connected with the preparations for the
                  war, was struck immediately before the tricennial year. These issues must have been ordered to be struck by the central mint.<ref target="#CH1-n251">

            </head>
            <p>To express in a few words the conclusions of the present study is quite impossible. In a way the preceding analysis has been a conclusion in
               itself, based on material collected and studied over a considerable time. Those trying to follow the arguments have probably been irritated by
               the summary account of the basic material, the coins, and by the scanty references to the pertinent collections, publications and sale
               catalogues. Nevertheless, scarcely any coin mentioned is unpublished.<ref target="#CH1-n254">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Summing up the results of the study of the relations between <persName>Constantine</persName> and <persName>Licinius</persName> as reflected in
               the coinage, we note that the bronze coinage is far more explicit than the gold coinage. The main reason is that bronze was struck continuously
               in most of the mints, whereas gold was issued sporadically and, generally speaking, only in one mint at a time. Of the two chronological problems
               discussed, the first regarding the date of <persName>Constantine</persName>’s conquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> is solved mainly with the aid of the gold coinage; one of the fundamental dates in the history of
                  <persName>Constantine</persName>, the year of the “victory of the cross,” of the battle of the Milvian Bridge, has to be altered to
               311 from 312. The coins prove to be more accurate than the written tradition.</p>
            <p>The second problem is solved with the aid of the bronze coinage. The conclusions previously drawn from my study of the coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> are strongly supported by the survey of the bronze coinages of other mints. True, the smaller
               mints yield but meager results—they were obviously out of touch with the politics of the day—but all major mints eloquently show how
                  <persName>Licinius</persName> was eliminated from the Constantinian bronze coinage on the eve of the nomination of the
                  <persName>Caesars</persName>, and how the <persName>Caesars</persName> actually were appointed before the settlement of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName> on March 1, 317. The Licinian mints are equally outspoken and demonstrate how
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> disappears from the <pb n="76"/> obverses and how <persName>Licinius</persName> stresses his sole-rulership,
               how in one case in the course of a single mintmark the reverse legend subsequently to this is altered to the plural <hi rend="italic">augg</hi>
               and <persName>Valens</persName> appears as second <persName>Augustus</persName>, and how, finally, with the same mintmark,
                  <persName>Constantine</persName> reappears at the same time as the sons of the Augusti are introduced as <persName>Caesars</persName>. This
               mintmark certainly gives us the history of Civil War I in a nutshell.</p>
            <p>The revision of the dates of the Constantinian Civil Wars is the starting point for an investigation of the Constantinian financial
               administration.</p>
            <p>The main theory developed in this study is that gold coining<ref target="#CH1-n255">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> in the Constantinian Empire<ref target="#CH1-n256">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> was closely connected with the court and with the Emperor. As a rule gold was struck at the temporary residence of the Emperor. This
               implies that the administrator of the gold coinage, the organizer, was a <hi rend="italic">comitiva</hi> in the true sense of the word. Only in
               special cases, e.g., when the Emperor was campaigning and would have been hampered by bringing with him also a part of the civil administration,
               was the gold coining concentrated at the residence of the court left behind. Some instances of filial issues are known. In the years 320–321,
               e.g., we have parallel striking at three mints in the same area, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sirmium">Sirmium</placeName>, obviously necessitated by the
               military preparations of these years. The last Constantinian gold series of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName>
               should be explained in the same way—if our conclusion that the Emperor did not visit Syria in 336 is correct.</p>
            <p>The fact that in almost every instance we may assume that the Emperor and the court directed the issues and almost supervised the execution in
               person gives added significance to the imagery, to the reverse legends, and to the slogans distributed by means of the coins. I have, however,
               refrained from attempting a new interpretation of the religious and political program of the Emperor in the light of the gold coinage. This
               important but arduous task is something for the future.</p>
            <p>The iconography, too, is likely to appear in new light when studied against the background of the mobile gold minting. This concerns <pb n="77"/>
               particularly such details as the development of the diadem, and the successive changes in the arrangement of the hair.</p>
            <p>No doubt the new insight we have won of the working of the financial administration is likely to increase our understanding of the economic life
               of the later Roman Empire. It is remarkable that we can trace no tendency to cater equally to all parts of the Empire: <placeName corresp="#nomisma_spain">Spain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName> struck no gold in Constantinian times,
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> nothing (under Licinian rule a single issue was struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>), <placeName corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</placeName> nothing
               during the years 327–335, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> after the close of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> nothing except some odd pieces in the last years of <persName>Constantine</persName>. One would
               have expected the central mint to have organized transports to far-away parts of the Empire, but it is obvious that the mobility of the gold
               minting increased the difficulties of segular service if, indeed, such service existed during the reign of <persName>Constantine</persName>. It
               appears that the local need of currency and cash was satisfied mainly by the bronze coinages.</p>
            <p>The main results of this study, however, are, I believe of chronological character, partly as regards the readjusted itinerary of the Emperor and
               his suite,<ref target="#CH1-n257">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> partly in the discovery of a new numismatic method of checking the chronological evidence supplied by other sources. May the appended

            <p>Late imperial Delos rests in the obscurity of oblivion unworthy of its great past. Never wholly recovering from the catastrophic destructions in
               the first century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, the Roman (Hellenistic) way of life after the partial reconstruction nevertheless appears to
               have continued without noticeable break into Byzantine times. The shrine of Apollo, though within a relatively modest frame, retained its
                  fame<ref target="#CH1-n259">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> well into the fourth century, and Julian is said to have asked for its advice before starting his ill-fated Persian campaign.<ref target="#CH1-n260">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> Later the existence of six Christian churches bears witness to the transition from Hellenistic paganism to the Christian faith.<ref target="#CH1-n261">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>[No particular incident during the Late Empire is attached to the name of Delos. Life just went on, one hopes peacefully. Something of the mist
               of anonymity, however, is shattered by an early fourth century bronze hoard from Delos. Its very existence invites comments, its highly unusual
               composition seems to explain something of the circumstances surrounding its burial. Moreover, the hoard as such both sheds some light on
               Constantinian numismatic chronology, and is suggestive of a new methodological approach to coin hoards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">I. The Composition of the Hoard</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The large Delos hoard comprising 3797 mainly Constantinian bronze coins was catalogued by Svoronos in 1910,<ref target="#CH1-n262">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> unfortunately at a time when only the first volume of Maurice’s <hi rend="italic">Numismatique Constantinienne</hi> had appeared
                  (even if the majority of the mints had been described earlier in various learned journals). Thus an under- <pb n="79"/> standable lack of
                  insight into the working of the early fourth century mints in an unfortunate way impaired the value of the work of the great Greek
                  numismatist; e. g. bust and reverse varieties were not recorded in sufficient detail according to present day standards. Printer’s errors
                  (?) in some cases had disastrous effects through the mechanical way of using repetitions as often as possible.</p>
               <p>The single coins of the hoard can therefore only hesitatingly be accepted as numismatic evidence, whereas the main groups, the general reverse
                  types and the issues distinguished by mintmarks can be expected to serve some useful purpose. Immediately after the publication of the hoard,
                     Kubitschek<ref target="#CH1-n263">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> drew attention to the fact that the hoard was an unusually closed one, the bulk of the coins having been struck during the years
                  308–318. In fact, a very negligible quantity of the coins exceeds these limits.</p>
               <p>The composition of the hoard presents some exceptional and interesting features. Kubitschek pointed out that the hoard, regardless of its site
                  in the Greek archipelago<ref target="#CH1-n264">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>, was formed in the West. The latest coins are the two Nicomedian ones marked <graphic url="NNM47_093A.jpg"/> belonging to an issue
                  initiated before Civil War II and struck during the war also. These coins are, however, the only ones struck by a Licinian mint after Civil
                  War I, and they seem to be somewhat later than the rest of the coins.</p>
               <p>The character of the hoard emerges most clearly out of a study of the last coins of the Constantinian mints integrated with the hoard.
                  Arranging the coins in chronologically significant groups we get the following subdivision: <list type="alpha">
                     <item n="(a)">marks and series with obverses of <persName>Constantine</persName> and <persName>Licinius</persName>, i. e. coins struck
                        before the rupture between the two Augusti interpreted as a prelude to the Civil War (all the earliest coins inclusive of those from the
                        early part of 316).</item>
                     <item n="(b)">marks and series with obverses of <persName>Constantine</persName> alone. These coins show that the relations between the
                        Augusti had been severed; the date is the later part of 316.</item>
                     <pb n="80"/>
                     <item n="(c)">marks and series with obverses of <persName>Constantine</persName> and his two sons. These coins were struck in the course of
                        the War, when <persName>Constantine</persName> reacted to <persName>Licinius</persName>’ appointment of <persName>Valens</persName>
                        as <persName>Augustus</persName> by elevating his sons to princely rank. This happened in the Autumn of 316.<ref target="#CH1-n265">

               <p>The most interesting feature of the hoard is probably its exceptional composition with its preponderance of coins struck in the West. Normally
                  a hoard “stands in a certain ratio to the amount of the coinage during the period covered by the find… and… this proportion reaches
                  increasing agreement the larger the find is numerically."<ref target="#CH1-n273">

                  </ref>
                  <pb n="83"/> “But," Thordeman continues, “this rule only applies to hoards which have been collected within the actual area in which
                  the coins were currency.” Now it is quite clear that the Delos hoard cannot reflect the coinage in circulation in Delos in the years
                  after Civil War I. The circulation of the bronze coins was ordinarily restricted to the area surrounding the mint in question. This has been
                  demonstrated in numerous cases, most recently probably for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n274">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> By common standards we would expect many more coins from the mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName>,

               <p>An analysis of the hoard reveals that, except for the coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_nicomedia">Nicomedia</placeName> (nos. 341–2, 847)
                  which are according to the present writer the latest coins of the whole hoard, all coins struck during or after Civil War I had been issued in

                  correct in assuming that it took some time to complete the necessary arrangements.<ref target="#CH1-n280">

               <p>In view of Delos’ exceptional position in earlier times, it appears very likely that the island in the armistice of 317 was considered
                  part of the Greek mainland and therefore in <persName>Constantine</persName>’s provincial reform referred to <hi rend="italic">Achaia</hi>. On the other hand it should be remembered that Delos was practically surrounded by parts of the province <hi rend="italic">Insulae</hi> belonging to the Licinian diocese <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi>.</p>
               <p>Now the hoard we are discussing was found buried in an earthenware jar. It therefore represents a treasure, the ready cash of an individual, a
                  body or an institution.<ref target="#CH1-n281">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> The fact that the hoard is an exceptionally closed one suggests the bulk to be, basically, a kind of cash payment from a stock of
                  bronze coins rather than a great number of coins gathered during a period of time. A further inference from the composition of the hoard is
                  that the main part of it was formed outside Delos. Accepting the year 321, when the last Nicomedian coins were incorporated with the bronze
                  treasure, as the approximate burial date,<ref target="#CH1-n282">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> we realize that it would have been abso- <pb n="86"/> lutely impossible for so many Constantinian coins of Roman origin to flow to
                  Delos through the ordinary channels. And if there had been regular connections with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>
                     (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>) rather than with the Greek mainland (and the nearest Constantinian mint, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>), why was the percentage of post-316 (groups c–d) bronzes struck at. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> so much lower than the corresponding figure of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> ? (Cf. the table above).</p>
               <p>The composition of the hoard seems to be most easily interpreted in the following way:</p>
               <p>The bulk of the hoard was received as a single sum somewhere in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> in 316 and this lot of
                  bronze coins can be assumed to have mirrored faithfully the bronze coinage in circulation in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> at that time—the closer to the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> the sum was paid, the greater
                  would be the proportion of recently struck coins issued by that mint, and the later the date.<ref target="#CH1-n283">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                  latter).</p>
               <p>The recipient (presumably an army contingent) then was transferred to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>; the percentage of
                  post-316 (groups c-d) <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>nsian bronze coins together with the remarkably high number of
                  coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>, points to the Via Aurelia as the travelling route up to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>. <pb n="87"/> Here additional cash was supplied—alternatively the coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> naturally poured in by way of exchange.<ref target="#CH1-n284">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The small total number of Treveran coins (75 against 239 struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>) is
                  particularly interesting in view of the fact that 54 pieces (72%) were post-316 (groups c–d). Two explanations appear to be possible, either
                  that the person or body in question travelled to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> but was forced to leave almost
                  instantly, or that the army contingent staying in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> received reinforcements from
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> and that some of the cash brought forth from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> trickled into the official treasure. At any rate, at a time suggested by the last date of the Gallic coins (probably
                  318) the contingent was dispatched to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> (57 coins, 44 of which are post-316 from
                  groups c–d), where mainly local coins trickled into the treasure, but also, in decreasing proportions, coins from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> etc. This accounts for the post-316
                  coins from these mints (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> only 9 coins out of 2011 in the table above, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> 28 of 269–10.41%, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName> 12 of 70–17.14%,
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> 14 of 106–13.20%. The corresponding percentage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> is 77.19, the highest of any mint represented in the hoard).</p>
               <p>To this comes a lot of almost 300 bronze pieces (group b, cf. p. 79 above) struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> at a
                  time when the bulk of the coins of this mint had already been incorporated in the treasure. The almost 300 coins in question were in my
                  opinion struck during Civil War I fought between Autumn 316 and March 1, 317 and seem to have been shipped to Delos directly from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> (Brundisium, cf. p. 96 below). The bulk of the coins had left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> on the eve or in the early days of the war, while these coins were struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> later, but before the end of the war. The 9 post-316 (groups c–d) coins are of later date.</p>
               <p>In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> the contingent embarked and headed for Delos. In Delos we would expect the
                  coins in circulation to influence the composition of the hoard, and clear traces of the money market in Licinian times can be found. If we in
                  the table above extract the coins struck by Licinian mints, we get a total of 361, less than 10% of the entire hoard. Some of these coins may
                  well have slipped in at <pb n="88"/> earlier stages of the travel of the treasure, particularly at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, but the Cyzicene quota (116 coins) cannot be explained in this way. Again the fact that only three post-316 (groups
                  c–d) coins struck in the East were found in the hoard, shows that peaceful intercourse between Constantinian Delos and the surrounding islands
                  of the Licinian province <hi rend="italic">Insulae</hi> was negligible.<ref target="#CH1-n285">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The majority of the 361 Licinian coins mentioned above must therefore have been in circulation on the island when the Constantinian
                  garrison arrived.<ref target="#CH1-n286">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, we must assume that the Greek mainland kept in touch with Delos, and through this channel coins representative of the bronze coinage
                  circulating in this area (mainly struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName>, but necessarily also to some
                  extent of old Licinian stock) oozed forth into Delos to be added to the hoard. The isolation of Delos must, however, have been fairly complete
                  in view of the chronological gap between the latest Constantinian coins and the latest coins of the hoard, the two Nicomedian coins mentioned
                  above. Remarkably enough no Thessalonican coins of later date than the Sol coinage belonged to the hoard.<ref target="#CH1-n287">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>It remains to explain the burial of the hoard. Kubitschek (p. 52) suggested the Spring of 324 and connected the burial with Crispus' moving
                  the Constantinian fleet from Achaia northwards. Although the relative isolation of Delos, stressed in the preceding paragraph, might account
                  for the absence of any coins later than 320–321, and thus explain such a late burial date, the very reason for burying the coins remains
                  obscure if Kubitschek's views are to be accepted. The present writer therefore prefers to regard the burial against the background of the
                  tension between <persName>Constantine</persName> and <persName>Licinius</persName> gradually growing from late 320 onwards. Our knowledge of
                  the prelude to Civil War II is scanty. We know of <persName>Constantine</persName>'s Sarma- <pb n="89"/> tian War and of his violations of
                  Licinian territory in the years preceding the Civil War. It would therefore be little surprising to find traces of similar actions along the
                  sea frontier. Delos with its garrison must have been a thorn in the flesh to <persName>Licinius</persName>, a threat to the Licinian
                  communications in the Aegaean, otherwise dominated by the East. It is feasible that a sudden raid finished the garrison on Delos; depending on
                  our estimate of the burial date this raid could either be regarded as Licinian reprisals for <persName>Constantine</persName>'s disregard of
                  the division of the Empire as agreed upon at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>, or as the reason (or one of the
                  reasons), for <persName>Constantine</persName> to operate with his army in Licinian <hi rend="italic">Thracia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <persName>Constantine</persName>'s decision to detach a contingent of his army to Delos<ref target="#CH1-n288">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> points to early planning of the second and decisive war against <persName>Licinius</persName>, and to an endeavour to use his

                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                  <p>The main source recording Rufinus’ career is <hi rend="italic">CIL</hi> X 5061: “praefecto urbi, comiti Augg nn, corr. Camp.,
                     corr. Tusciae et Umbriae, corr. Venitiae <hi rend="italic">(sic)</hi> et Histriae, cur. alvei Tiberis et Cloacarum sacrae urbis, cur. viae
                     Flaminiae, proconsuli provinciae Achaiae sortito, pontifici dei Solis, auguri, salio Palatino…” Groag, op. cit., pp. 17ff., however,
                     connects a passage in Firmicus Maternus’ <hi rend="italic">Mathesis</hi> (II 29,10, pp. 81ff., ed. Kroll-Skutsch) with Rufinus and his
                     father: “eius geniturae pater post geminum ordinarium consulatum in exilium datus est, sed et ipse ob adulterii crimen in exilium
                     datus et de exilio raptus in administrationem Campaniae primum destinatus est, deinde &lt;ad&gt; Achaiae proconsulatum, post vero ad Asiae
                     proconsulatum et praefecturam urbi Romae.” Groag appears to be correct in his interpretation of the father as the consul of 316 and
                     323 (despite the lacking iteration in the <hi rend="italic">Fasti)</hi> and the first praetorian prefect of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>, and the son as the urban prefect mentioned in the inscription quoted above. The details of
                     the career of the younger Rufinus are, however, obscure. The fact that Atina, a Lucanian township, clearly hails him as its patron, its <hi rend="italic">corrector</hi>, but nevertheless omits the <hi rend="italic">correctura Lucaniae</hi>, entitles us, with Groag, to supply
                     this office in the list and assign it to the time of <persName>Maxentius</persName>’ usurpation. The wide range of offices held in
                        <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> excludes the possibility that he was in office in <hi rend="italic">Achaia</hi> in
                     Diocletianic times (as suggested by <persName>C. Schuurmans</persName>, <hi rend="italic">De Samenstelling van den <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>inschen Senaat</hi>, no. 776, in typescript only). The chronological order of the highest
                     offices is hard to ascertain. Firmicus Matemus cannot be right when saying that the urban prefecture (315–16) followed after the
                     proconsulate of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>, the earliest date of which is 324 (note Groag, p. 20, n. 1
                     “Ich wiederhole, daß das Horoskop eines Astrologen kein staatsrechtlich maßgebendes Dokument darstellt”). It should therefore be
                     enough to accept Firmicus’ statement that he held these offices without paying attention to the seeming chronological arrangement.
                     Again, the <hi rend="italic">CIL</hi> X 5061 appears to enumerate the offices in groups without attempting to record their chronological
                     order (Groag, p. 19, n. 1). The younger Rufinus could therefore very well have been <hi rend="italic">proconsul Achaiae</hi> after his
                     tenure of the urban prefecture, and the present writer suggests that this actually was the case. (Groag, p. 19, n. 2, records a similar
                     case as such an unusual occurrence in the <hi rend="italic">cursus honorum).</hi>

                  <p>Though accepting Groag’s contention in this respect the author cannot agree with his reasons. He regards the Symmachus mentioned in
                        <hi rend="italic">Codex Theodosianus</hi> II, 15, 1 as holding the office of <hi rend="italic">vicarius</hi> (of the Moesian diocese).
                     But above p. 40 the present writer has suggested that this constitution should be dated to July 25, 329 instead of 319. This, of course,
                     has no further consequences in this context other than that we cannot automatically supply the title of <hi rend="italic">vicarius</hi> in
                     the <hi rend="italic">Codex Theodosianus</hi> II, 4, 1 of February 4, 318, also mentioning Symmachus as addressee. At that time he may well
                     have been <hi rend="italic">proconsul Achaiae</hi>: whether he preceded or succeeded Rufinus the younger is impossible to determine. At any
                     rate, it is very significant that two of the first officials charged with the administration of <hi rend="italic">Achaia</hi> were trusted
                     followers of <persName>Constantine</persName>, and Rufinus, one of the two, was an extremely experienced administrator. A third <hi rend="italic">proconsul</hi> of the same category was Ianuarinus (Groag, pp. 21f.). The importance of the proconsular province of <hi rend="italic">Achaia</hi> is also reflected in the rank and repute accorded to its governors within the bureaucracy (Groag, p. 22).</p>

                  <p>The question of the burial date is more complex than what would appear at first sight. The absolute <hi rend="italic">terminus post
                        quem</hi> is the turn of the year 320/321. Chronologically there is a puzzling gap of about two years between the latest Gallic coins
                     and the three Nicomedian coins mentioned above. This indicates that Delos must have been more or less isolated after the arrival of the
                     garrison. The Nicomedian coins show that the isolation was broken some time in 321, but nothing prevents us from assuming that the
                     isolation continued until the time of the incident, which forced the individual in charge of the treasure to bury it. This may well have
                     happened a couple of years after the 321 incident. It would therefore be more correct to give the burial date as 321–324 (inclusive). Our
                     estimate of the burial date does not, however, affect the interpretation of the composition of the hoard.</p>

               <p>According to views expressed earlier by the present writer, the Sol coinage dominated the years 317–319 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, and 317–320 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> (where it continued
                  to be struck contemporarily with other types during the years 321–322 although at that time forming a decreasing proportion of the entire
                  output of the mint).<ref target="#CH1-n290">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ticinum">Ticinum</placeName> the Sol
                  coinage was followed by the VICTORIAE LAETAE PRINC PERP issues in 317 and 318, respectively. No single coin of this type was included in the
                  hoard. But the author's contention that the plain vota coins (DN CONSTANTINI MAX AVG-VOT XX, CAESARVM NOSTRORVM-VOT V etc.) at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> were struck in <pb n="90"/> consecutive issues during the years 317–321,<ref target="#CH1-n291">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> contemporarily with the Sol issues, receives no corroboration through the Delos hoard. On the contrary, although the Sol issues were by
                  far the more numerous of the two, the natural selection of the current issues would have also included vota coins had both coinages been
                  contemporary, and had the later Sol issue of the two represented in the hoard <graphic url="NNM47_104A.jpg"/> really been struck as late as
                  319–320. Therefore, it seems necessary to squeeze the Gallic Sol issues within a shorter span of time, both in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName> and in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, and assume that no major
                  vota issues had been struck contemporarily (conceivably in 317–318; this would seem to support <persName>Mr. Carson</persName>'s and
                     <persName>Dr. Kent</persName>'s view that the issues were “consecutive and exclusive, not contemporary."<ref target="#CH1-n292">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> Even so that does not mean that the Sol coinage ceased to be struck simultaneously in all the Western mints).<ref target="#CH1-n293">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> As regards the controversial date of the commemorative consecration coins, the composition of the hoard does not seem to speak against
                  the date (317) suggested by the author.<ref target="#CH1-n294">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>

               <p>In the present hoard the coins struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> after New Year 317 were very scarce (9) and among
                  them one was of the type REQVIES OPTIMOR MERIT-understandable with regard to the very big issues struck of these series. The corresponding
                  REQVIES issues of the other <pb n="91"/> mints, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siscia">Siscia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessalonica">Thessalonica</placeName> were lacking. Again,
                  had these coins been issued before 317, the lack of more coins from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> would have been very
                  surprising indeed. At any rate, <persName>Kent</persName>'s notion that these issues dated from the time immediately preceding Civil War II
                  (recorded as belonging to the period 320–324, or 321–324), appears impossible.<ref target="#CH1-n295">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>Finally a few words remain to be said with regard to the extremely rich material from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.
                  Svoronos did not attempt any chronological grouping, and the flan sizes recorded by him are suggestive but not conclusive (in some cases even
                  controversial when e. g. all the coins mintmarked <graphic url="NNM47_105A.jpg"/> with obverses of <persName>Licinius</persName> have the
                  diameter 21 mm. whereas the corresponding coins with obverses of <persName>Constantine</persName> measure 22 mm.).</p>
               <p>Now, if we assume that all the coins preserved to our days are a fair representation of the coins struck in antiquity, and if we take a fair
                  selection of collections and calculate that, despite the haphazard way in which many of these collections have been brought together, the
                  various factors tending to give any one collection a particular character, are likely to counterbalance one another, something might be gained
                  by comparing the coins of a certain hoard with the number of the corresponding coins found in the collections. Taking the coins of the Delos
                  hoard struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and comparing them with the material collected by the present writer, we
                  get the following result:<ref target="#CH1-n296">

               <p>Before an interpretation of these figures is attempted, the sequence of mintmarks should be discussed briefly. The first mark employed after
                  the battle of the Milvian Bridge is RP using the long obverse legend IMP C CONSTANTIN VS PF AVG.<ref target="#CH1-n299">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> This mark was followed by <pb n="93"/>
                  <graphic url="NNM47_107A.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM47_107B.jpg"/> using the same long obverse legend, and subsequently by a second RP series
                  employing exclusively short obverse legends.<ref target="#CH1-n300">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> The latter series, of reduced standards, is the last one in which coins of <persName>Daza</persName> appear. The order of the
                  subsequent marks is more difficult to establish. The decrease in module is almost imperceptible,<ref target="#CH1-n301">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> but nevertheless the <graphic url="NNM47_107C.jpg"/> coins, which logically should form one group despite the varying serial marks,
                  seem to be slightly larger and therefore earlier than the others. The correctness of this assertion is shown by the fact that the type MARTI
                  CONSERVATORI was struck with the two former <graphic url="NNM47_107D.jpg"/> marks, and the striking of this type was discontinued well in
                  advance of <hi rend="italic">Soli invicto comiti</hi> in other mints,<ref target="#CH1-n302">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> and, therefore, probably in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> as well. Assuming a development of mintmarks from plain
                  marks to compound ones, we get the sequence <graphic url="NNM47_107E.jpg"/> after mid-313, the war against <persName>Daza</persName>. The
                  crucial question is now the internal order of the remaining marks. The decrease in module suggests the <graphic url="NNM47_107F.jpg"/> mark to
                  be the earliest (21 mm. according to Svoronos), the <graphic url="NNM47_107G.jpg"/> the last (19/21 mm.) with the <graphic url="NNM47_107H.jpg"/> as the second.<ref target="#CH1-n303">

                  </ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="94"/>
               <p>We now return to the table above and to the percentages of the entire material constituted by the Delos coins. In actual fact we get a
                  frequency curve, even if irregular on the right hand side of the diagram, representing the chronologically last mark of the series.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-004">
                  <graphic url="NNM47_108A.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <pb n="95"/>
               <p>One important sequence of coins has, however, been omitted in these discussions, the third and obviously late RP series, the diameter of which
                  was recorded as 19/21 mm. by Svoronos. The series comprises two types of <hi rend="italic">Soli invicto comiti</hi>, the ordinary "Sol
                  standing left, holding globe,” and the exceptional "Sol with captive.” Both types were struck exclusively with obverses of
                     <persName>Constantine</persName>.</p>
               <p>The difficulty in determining the position of the RP series in the sequence of mintmarks is the absence of other chronological criteria except
                  for the measurements of Svoronos. Minor inaccuracies in Svoronos' lists would not have affected the treatment of the other series, all
                  distinguished by clear serial marks. Now the type "Sol stg. l.” is common to all three RP issues. Here all the coins of a diameter of 24
                  and 23/24 mm. have been referred to the earlier issues, whereas the coins of 19/21 mm. have been regarded as belonging to the late issue.
                  However, in view of the difficulty of classifying coins on the evidence of measurement alone, Svoronos' figures should be treated with
                  caution. On the other hand, the figures concerning the type <hi rend="italic">SPQR populi Romani</hi> suggest that the maximum error cannot be
                  very significant.</p>
               <p>On the evidence of flan size the RP series should either precede or follow after the <graphic url="NNM47_109A.jpg"/> mark; the probability of
                  this contention is strengthened by the common feature of the two series: the absence of Licinian obverses. Theoretically, however, with the
                  frequency curve as a point of departure, the RP issue with its percentage 294 could fit in between the <graphic url="NNM47_109B.jpg"/>
                  (266.67%) and the <graphic url="NNM47_109C.jpg"/> (398.64%). In practice it appears very unlikely that the three RF's should not have been
                     consecutive.<ref target="#CH1-n304">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> On the declining (right) side of the curve the RP percentage<ref target="#CH1-n305">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> could possibly fit in between the peak and the <pb n="96"/>
                  <graphic url="NNM47_110A.jpg"/> (253.85%). The curve, interpreted in terms of political history would in this case give us the unexpected
                  picture of two conflicts with <persName>Licinius</persName> (an idea previously suggested by <persName>Seston</persName>, and later elaborated
                  by Andreotti)<ref target="#CH1-n306">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> with a peaceful period marked by the <graphic url="NNM47_110B.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM47_110C.jpg"/> series in between. Two facts
                  speak against this solution, the flan sizes and the short time shown to have passed e. g. by the bronze coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_treveri">Trier</placeName> between the rupture between <persName>Constantine</persName> and <persName>Licinius</persName>
                  on the one hand and the official nomination of the <persName>Caesars</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_serdica">Serdica</placeName>
                  on the other. Thus it remains to place the RP series as immediately preceding the <graphic url="NNM47_110D.jpg"/> mark. This gives us the
                  following curve—with two peaks (cf. p. 97):</p>
               <p>How can this curve be explained ?</p>
               <p>One would, naturally, expect the issue current at the time when the hoard was collected to show the highest percentage. We have here two such
                  instances. The bulk of the hoard would have been collected towards the close of the <graphic url="NNM47_110E.jpg"/> issue. Later an addition
                  was made in the very beginning of the <graphic url="NNM47_110F.jpg"/> issue, comprising mostly late RP coins (possibly delivered directly from
                  the mint as is suggested by the extraordinary high figure for the "Sol stg. l.” type). Some earlier coins could very well have flowed
                  into the treasure at the same time; in view of the few coins of the <graphic url="NNM47_110G.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NNM47_110H.jpg"/> (Sol
                  with captive) series little importance need be attached to the variations of the percentage figures of these series. It is feasible that this
                  part of the hoard never travelled very widely before it was shipped to Delos. It could have been shipped directly from Brundisium as cash for
                  the garrison to be sent to Delos, possibly together with some troops. (With regard to the chronological discrepancy between this part of the
                  hoard and the one shipped from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>, one might even advocate that the consignment from
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>-Brundisium constituted the primary part, and the consignment from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName>-<placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> the secondary part, the
                  reinforcement).</p>

               </figure>
               <pb n="98"/>
               <p>We may add that some of the earlier coins possibly were incorporated with the treasure at a later stage in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arelate">Arelate</placeName>, or still later, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName>. The
                  possible additions made when the army contingent was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aquileia">Aquileia</placeName> would chronologically be
                  slightly later than the expiry of the <graphic url="NNM47_112A.jpg"/> issue in view of the natural time lag.</p>
               <p>With regard to all the facts known concerning the Delos hoard, it seems possible to explain its structure in detail. As to the general
                  validity of the method employed, many objections can be raised. The basic material must be considerable and collected equally in the whole
                  geographical area covered by the hoard.<ref target="#CH1-n307">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref> It would obviously be wrong to compare an Eastern hoard with the coin material of the Western collections. Further, assuming that the
                  hoard contained coins of the same weight and module, no unequivocal conclusions as to the chronological sequence of marks could be drawn.
                  Considering the percentages only, the columns of the frequency curve could be grouped in many different ways. It must be assumed that a simple
                  hoard, collected in the geographical area of the burial, would give us a straightforward curve similar to that on p. 94, if we exclude columns
                  7–9. In this case, however, it would be easy to switch nos. 4 and 6, but nos. 1(2) and 3 must be consecutive, no. 4 or 6 must precede no.
                     5.<ref target="#CH1-n308">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> In the case of a composite hoard such as the Delos one, only certain clues as to the internal order of marks can be found, but without
                  other criteria it would be all too easy to draw a misleading curve with a single peak.</p>

                     further pinned down to 317 (ibid., p. 41). The hoard evidence should in the author’s opinion be accepted but the consecration coins

                  <p>This particular type was chosen as a means of checking the result. As no coins of this type with the early long obverse legend are known,
                     the type belongs to the later part of the issue; its percentage should therefore be slightly higher than the figure for the entire issue.
                     The table proves this assumption to be correct. Moreover, this also seems to show that Svoronos’ grouping of the less easily
                     classified Sol coins of the mark RP on the whole is correct. If we include the coins of <persName>Daza</persName> in the figures above the
                     percentages are slightly higher, as could be expected, 35.96 and 53.09, respectively.</p>

               <p>The foregoing notes on the Delos hoard have shown <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> and in particular the recreated
                  province of Achaia, now raised to proconsular status, to have been of particular importance to <persName>Constantine</persName>, no doubt on
                  strategic grounds. In Delos, <persName>Constantine</persName> got a bridgehead in the Aegaean archipelago, otherwise dominated by
                     <persName>Licinius</persName>, and <pb n="99"/> it is permissible to assume that the burial of the hoard was caused by a Licinian raid on
                  the island. In Civil War II the navies of the two adversaries played an important part; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName>Piraeus</placeName> seem to have been one of the foremost bases of <persName>Crispus</persName>, and
                     <persName>Licinius</persName>' later concern with his possibilities to master the sea is mirrored in an Egyptian papyrus.<ref target="#CH1-n309">

               </p>
               <p>The extraordinary composition of the hoard, in view of the burial place, allowed us to trace in detail the history of its formation, and at
                  the same time gave us some clues as to the date of certain of the coin series included in (or absent from) the hoard:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="(1)">The commemorative consecration coins should probably be accorded a slightly later date than the one previously suggested by the
                     present writer. The year 320 should nevertheless be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quern</hi>.</item>
                  <item n="(2)">The dates of the Sol coinages of the Western mints should probably be readjusted. It is feasible that they, generally speaking,
                     disappeared as early as 318–319.</item>
                  <item n="(3)">The earliest so called plain vota coins were scarcely contemporary with the Sol coinage. The hoard suggests that the bronze
                     coinages were consecutive and exclusive rather than contemporary and over-lapping.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Finally an attempt was made to compare the numerical strength of the different issues of the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> with the large material collected by the author, assuming this material to be a fair representation of the bronze coins
                  in circulation at the time covered by the hoard. This method, if used with caution, and with due regard to the individual characteristics of
                  each hoard, seems to give some clues as to the internal order of mintmarks.</p>

                  <p>The coins struck in the East were of no concern in this context; the subject of examination was the coins struck in the mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. These coins mainly circulated in the West, and the author's material comprised the coins of

            </head>
            <p>This index of reverse legends does not aim at recording the gold coinage completely, but at illustrating the coins and numismatic landmarks
               discussed in the text (where e.g. submultiples have been included only when they have contributed something to the chronological discussion).
               Occasionally a cursory rev. description has been added to keep apart types of identical legg. struck with the same m. m. The point has been to
               illustrate the type, not to mention all possible obverse varieties. When gold was struck in several off., one off. only has been indicated.
