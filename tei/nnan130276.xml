            <p>Of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, more than of any other country, is it true that the history of a nation reflects the character of its people. From the very earliest times, religious faith has played a prominent part in the life and in the history of the Spaniards. The oncoming of the Moor left no room for a passive theology—the kings and princes of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> of the Middle Ages were literally, and in very truth, "Defenders of the Faith". In consequence, and because theirs was so essentially a combination of the religious and the military life, it is not surprising to find many of the Orders of Chivalry originating in the Iberian peninsula during this troublesome period. Nor is it other than might have been anticipated that they gradually disappeared with the suppression of the Arab invaders.</p>
            <p>To trace the story of these Orders is peculiarly difficult. Even in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, where the records may still be in existence, the task would be Herculean. Fortunately, for the purposes of this monograph,
<pb n="2"/>
it is superfluous because it has already been very ably and very admirably done in a volume written by <persName>Professor Georgiana Goddard King</persName> and published by the Hispanic Society of <placeName>America</placeName>, entitled "A Brief Account of the Military Orders in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>". Our concern, herein, is rather with the badges and insignia of these brotherhoods and of those which have followed them, and reference to their history is made only where necessary to make clear facts regarding these emblems.</p>
            <p>A further brief word is required regarding our sources. For the earliest orders, the gathering of data and the sifting of conflicting statements regarding origins and reorganizations would be the task of a life-time. The centuries that have elapsed have thrown over such beginnings a veil difficult to penetrate. There is satisfaction, therefore, in finding that the importance of their records was appreciated in the seventeenth century, when the writers were not so removed in point of time from the circumstances which they attempted to fix. Favine in 1620, Ashmole in 1672 and again in 1715, and <persName>Giustiniani</persName> in 1692, endeavored to gather and sift such material as could be found in their day, and since much of what they wrote is carefully annotated and otherwise bears evidence of careful examination, there is the greater reason for considering it trustworthy. Even then, the writers, again and again, are at a loss. The days
<pb n="3"/>
when feudalism flourished were given to fighting for existence rather than in writing of what was done. The gathering under one cover of such information as is available regarding the badges of these Orders and of those of a later day, together with the military medals of award, is the object of this volume.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE <orgName>OAK OF NAVARRE</orgName>. This is the earliest Spanish Military Order known to us. It was founded in 722 A. D. by <persName>Don Garcia Ximines</persName>, a French prince and Count of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q859779">Bigorre</placeName>, born in 688 and crowned on May 3, 716, as King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3115609">Navarre</placeName>. He succeeded in driving the invading Moors from <placeName corresp="#geonames_3115609">Navarre</placeName> and parts of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>, and won for himself and his descendant kings the title of "Most loyal defenders of the Faith." He died in 758 after a reign of forty-two years, and was buried at the hermitage of <persName>Saint John Baptist de la Pegna</persName>, near his castle. He created this order in thankfulness for his great victory over the infidels, and pledged its members to the defense of the Christian faith. While marching against the Moors in the year 722, <persName>Ximines</persName> saw in a vision a red cross adored by angels, at the top of an oak. The badge is in the form of a verdant oak tree, at the top of which appears a plain red cross. The cross is described by <persName>Guistiniani</persName>, the Italian writer, as a cross flory. Andrew Favine,
<pb n="4"/>
the French writer of 1620, gives little credence to the accounts of the establishment of this Order. He states that <persName>Garcia Ximines</persName> changed the ancient arms of his family and adopted this device.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE LILY OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_3115609">NAVARRE</placeName>. This seems to have been created in 1048 by <persName>Garcia VI</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3115609">Navarre</placeName> (1034-1054) in honour of his recovery from "a languishing sickness". He dedicated it to the Virgin, hence it is sometimes called the "Order of <persName>Saint Mary</persName> of the Lily". Favine states that effigies of the successors to <persName>Garcia</persName>, with this order about their necks, may be seen in the churches of <persName>St. Mary</persName> of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q37247502">Nagera</placeName>, <persName>St. Saviour de Leyra</persName>, <persName>St. Mary la Reale</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3114472">Pampeluna</placeName>, <persName>St. John de la Pegna</persName>, and at <placeName>Ronceau</placeName>. The order disappeared about the middle of the seventeenth century. <persName>Giustiniani</persName>, <persName>Marquez</persName> and <persName>Perrot</persName> give credit for the institution of the order to <persName>Sancho IV</persName> (1023-1034), and fix the date of its foundation as 1023. They also differ on the form of the badge, a gold collar of two chains, on which the gothic letter M, for <persName>Mary</persName>, is repeated. From this collar an oval gold medallion with a lily, surmounted by the letter M, crowned, is suspended.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF <persName>SAINT SAVIOUR</persName>, also called the Order of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>, and <persName>Saint Sauveur de Mon-
<pb n="5"/>
tréal</persName>. In 1118, <persName>Alphonso I</persName>, "The Battler", King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3115609">Navarre</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>, <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q175276">Leon</orgName>, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510409">Toledo</placeName>, instituted this order. It consisted of French and Spanish noblemen who had assisted him in his wars. With the conquest of the Moors, the main purpose of the order was achieved; and in the 16th century, its property passed to the Crown. <persName>Giustiniani</persName> lists the Grand Masters until 1665. Favine says the badge was a red cross, ancrée—sometimes called moline, that is, with the ends divided and turned over.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF <placeName>TRUXILLO</placeName>. While there appears to have been an order of knighthood in <placeName>Truxillo</placeName> (<placeName>Trugillo</placeName>) in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> as early as 1227, little information concerning it is obtainable. In that year, <persName>Don Arias Perez Dallego</persName>, the Master, took <placeName>Truxillo</placeName> from the Moors. Pierre Daviti mentions the existence of this order as early as 1213. Ashmole states "But there is not any Writer that gives an account of what was the <hi rend="italic">Ensign</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Badge</hi> of the Order", and Clark holds that they combined with the Order of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q389205">Alcantara</orgName>.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE BAND OR SCARF Founded in 1332 by <persName corresp="#viaf_89811460">Alphonso XI</persName>, King of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q175276">Leon</orgName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> (1312-1350), in the city of <placeName>Vittoria</placeName>. Favine states that it was instituted in the city of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2509954">Valencia</placeName> in 1330; Sansovin gives the city as
<pb n="6"/>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_3127461">Burgos</placeName>, and the year as 1368, while Maigne gives credit to <persName>John I</persName> and fixes the date as 1390. The order was created as a mark of distinction for those who assisted <persName corresp="#viaf_89811460">Alphonso XI</persName> in the conquest of the Moors, and only men of noble birth were admitted. The insignia was a red silk band or scarf, worn across the left shoulder and under the right arm. Most of the authorities indicate it as having been shortlived, though Clark states that it was revived in 1700 by <persName>Philip V</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT (also called Order of the Dove). Founded at <placeName corresp="#geonames_6360915">Segovia</placeName> in 1390 by <persName>John I</persName>, King of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q175276">Leon</orgName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> (1358-1390), though Favine makes the date 1379, stating that the order was discontinued on the death of the founder. The badge was a gold collar ornamented with curved and pointed rays of the sun. From this a gold and white enamelled dove with eyes and beak of red, was suspended.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE LILY OF ARAGON. <persName>Ferdinand</persName> of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> (1379-1416) founded this order in 1403. Favine gives the date as 1410, and calls it the Order of the Looking Glass of the <persName corresp="#viaf_52482731">Blessed Virgin Mary</persName> in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName>. He states that it was transferred to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName> in 1413 when <persName>Ferdinand</persName> received that Kingdom, and that it was
<pb n="7"/>
continued by the sons of the founder and then abolished. The insignia was a gold collar composed of alternate griffons and pots of flowering lilies. <persName>Clark</persName> and <persName>Giustiniani</persName> describe an oval pendant, bearing the image of the Virgin and Child.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF OUR LADY OF MERCY. <persName>James I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>, having been a prisoner of Simon, Earl of Montfort, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, where he suffered many hardships, vowed if he escaped, to devote his time and energy toward the release of Christian prisoners in the hands of the Moors. This order seems to have been established about the year 1218, some state on <persName>St. Lawrence</persName>'s Day. In 1261, women were admitted to the order. It was combined with the Order of Montesa in 1317, and these two, later, with the Order of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName>. The badge is shield shaped, the lower part bearing red and white enamelled stripes (the arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>), and the upper part the white cross of the Church of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3128760">Barcelona</placeName>, on a red field. The whole is surmounted by a ducal coronet.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE ROSARY OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510409">TOLEDO</placeName>. Roderick, the Bishop of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510409">Toledo</placeName>, is the reputed founder of this order, in the year 1212. Its object was providing opposition to the Moors, but like most of these orders it had specified
<pb n="8"/>
religious requirements. The badge is given as a silver and black cross flory, on the centre of which is a gold medallion with the figure of the Virgin holding the Child on her right arm, and with a rosary in the left hand.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF ESCAMA OR THE SCALE. In 1420 <persName>John II</persName> (1406-1454), King of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> and <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q175276">Leon</orgName>, founded this order to encourage the nobility to war against the Moors. It was discontinued after the death of the king in 1454. The insignia is a red cross with a surface resembling fish scales, hence the name. Why this device was chosen, the historians fail to divulge.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF JESUS CHRIST, or Order of the Militia of <persName>St. Dominic</persName>. <persName>St. Dominic</persName> of the <persName>Guzman</persName> family of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> founded this order in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q206221">Languedoc</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, in 1206, to offset the schism of the heretic Albigenses. It was revived in the sixteenth century in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> under the influence of the Church, and combined with the Papal Order of <persName>St. Peter</persName> the Martyr. It flourished in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> for two centuries but is generally conceded to be strictly a religious order. Various names have been assigned, such as The Militia of <persName>St. Dominic</persName>, Order of the Cross of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, and Order of <persName>St. Peter</persName> and <persName>St. Dominic</persName>. The insignia is an oval of gold surmounted by a crown, on the
<pb n="9"/>
obverse of which is a cross of four fleur-de-lis joined, each arm being half white and half black. On the reverse is an upright cross, with an olive tree on the left and a sword with point upward on the right. The ribbon is red.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE BATTLE AXE. Founded in 1149 by <persName>Raymond Bérenger</persName>, Count of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3128760">Barcelona</placeName>, to reward the women of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3107677">Tortosa</placeName> who, armed with battle axes, contributed largely to the repulse of an attack of the Moors. Little is known of its existence, and the insignia is given as a red battle axe, which the members wore on their cloaks.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF CONCORD. Credit is given to <persName>Ferdinand</persName>, (1200-1252), King of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> and <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q175276">Leon</orgName>, for the foundation of this order, though Maigne gives the date as 1261 but without record of its insignia. Other writers do not mention it.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF THE STAR. This is said to have been founded by <persName corresp="#viaf_290606108">Alphonso V</persName> during his reign from 1416 to 1458. The name is derived from a star worn on the cloak by some of the knights. Little else is known of it.</p>
            <p>MILITARY ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">CALATRAVA</orgName>. <persName>Sancho III</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510409">Toledo</placeName>, King of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName>, instituted this order in 1158; it was the first military Order
<pb n="10"/>
in that kingdom. The castle of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName> had been taken in 714 from <persName>Rodrigo</persName>, King of the <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q23693" type="ethnic">Visigoths</orgName> by the <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q169260" type="ethnic">Moors</orgName>, who held it for over four hundred years. <persName>Don Alphonso I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>, recaptured it in 1147 and gave it to the Knights Templars as a bulwark against the infidels. Eight years later, the gift was returned. <persName>Sancho</persName> (son of <persName>Alphonso</persName>) gave it and the task of its defense to <persName>Don Raymond</persName>, Abbot of the Monastery of <persName>St. Mary de Fitero</persName>, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3115609">Navarre</placeName>. He, with <persName>Don Diego of Velasquez</persName>, fortified the castle and settled there with associates from <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510409">Toledo</placeName>. Thus arose the Order of the Knights of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName> or Militia of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName>. The Order was approved by <persName>Pope Alexander III</persName>, September 25, 1164. <persName corresp="#viaf_7549012">Pope Benedict XIII</persName> assigned them a "cross flory" in 1396. The Mastership of this and of the Orders of <persName>St. James</persName> of the Sword and of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q389205">Alcantara</orgName>, according to Ashmole, were perpetually vested in the crown of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> in 1523 by <persName corresp="#viaf_76430137">Pope Adrian VI</persName>. There was but one class of members—Chevaliers, who must be of noble birth. In 1219, the Ladies' Order of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName> was instituted by <persName>Dona Gazelas Maria Yonnes</persName>. The badge is the same as that for the men, a white-enamelled gold-edged diamond on which is a red-enamelled cross fleury, i. e. with fleur-de-lis at the ends; the outer leaves are elongated, to rest upon the arms, and the points turn out. This is surmounted by a trophy

of flags and a plumed helmet. The ribbon is bright red watered-silk. Favine says the badge is <hi rend="italic">"A Red Cross Flouredeluced"</hi>.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q594890">ALCANTARA</orgName>. The Order of <persName>St. Julian</persName> of <persName>Pereyro</persName> was founded in 1176 by <persName>Ferdinand II</persName>, King of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q175276">Leon</orgName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336902">Galicia</placeName>. It derived its name from the town in which their first monastery was built. The badge was a green pear tree sewed to their mantles. After <persName>Alphonso IX</persName>, King of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q175276">Leon</orgName>, had captured the Castilian town of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q389205">Alcantara</orgName> from the Moors in 1213, he gave it to <persName>Don Martin Fernandez de Quintana</persName>, Grand Master of the Order of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName>. In 1218, the city of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q389205">Alcantara</orgName> was given by the Knights of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName> to <persName>Don Nunno Fernandez</persName>, the third Master of the Order of <persName>St. Julian de Pereyro</persName> and his fellow knights, who then styled themselves the <hi rend="italic">Knights of Alcantara</hi>. In accepting the city they became subject to the Order of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName>, and changed their cross to what Favine calls <hi rend="italic">"A Greene crosse Flouredeluced"</hi>. This insignia is identical with that of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName>, save that the colour is green, as is also the suspension ribbon.

            <p>ORDER OF OUR LADY OF MONTESA, or of <persName>St. George</persName>. This order was founded in 1316 (or, as some state, in 1317) at Montesa, a city of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2509954">Valencia</placeName>, by <persName>James II</persName> (1291-1327), King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2509954">Valencia</placeName>. The knights were subject to the rules of the Order of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q756910">Calatrava</orgName>. In 1399, the Order of <persName>St. George</persName> of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q1078978">Alfama</orgName>, which had been founded in 1201 at <placeName corresp="#geonames_3107677">Tortosa</placeName>, was incorporated into this. Ashmole is the authority for the statement that in 1317 the Order of <persName>St. Mary de Merced</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName> was amalgamated with this Order of Montesa. The badge is diamond-shaped, enamelled yellow, with gold edges and with a plain red-enamelled cross in the center; the whole is surmounted by a trophy of flags and a plumed helmet. The ribbon is bright red watered-silk.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF <persName>CHARLES III</persName>. Sometimes called the Royal and Distinguished Order of <persName>Charles III</persName> or of the Immaculate Conception. The order was formed by the Sovereign of that name on September 19, 1771, to commemorate the birth of his grandson, <persName>Charles Clement</persName>. <persName>Charles III</persName> conferred upon the order the vast estates of the house of <orgName type="dynasty">Ximenes</orgName>. The order ranks next to the Golden Fleece in importance, and is awarded for merit and service rendered the State. It is sometimes conferred on foreigners. During the reign of <persName>Joseph Bonaparte</persName> (1808-1815), with the exception
<pb n="14"/>
of the Golden Fleece, this and all other Spanish Orders were abolished. There are five classes—Grand Cross, Commanders of the first and second class, Officers and Chevaliers. The insignia is a ball-tipped Maltese cross of gold, enamelled in light blue with white edges. In the angles are gold fleur-de-lis. It is surmounted by a gold crown for the Grand Cross, and by a gold laurel wreath for the other classes. The collar is of gold, composed of fourteen castles, fourteen lions, seven ciphers of <persName>Charles III</persName>, and six enamelled trophies. On the obverse oval medallion, edged with blue, is the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception. On the reverse is the cipher of the founder within two laurel wreaths, encircled by a blue band inscribed <hi rend="italic">VIRTUTI ET MERITO</hi>. The ribbon is light blue with a white band in the centre. The Grand Cross plaque, of faceted silver, is similar in shape to the cross, with gold fleur-de-lis in the angles, and has a centre medallion of the obverse of the cross and the motto <hi rend="italic">VIRTUTI ET MERITO</hi>. The plaque of the Commanders of the first grade is similar in shape and medallion, but with silver fleur-de-lis, while that for a second grade Commander is of silver but with a centre medallion bearing the cipher of <persName>Charles III</persName> within a laurel wreath.</p>

            <p>ORDER OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE. Founded at Bruges on January 10, 1429 (or 1430), by <persName corresp="#viaf_281367823">Philip le Bon</persName>, Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3030967">Burgundy</placeName>, on the occasion of his third marriage, with <persName>Isabella</persName>, the daughter of <persName>John I</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName>. The reign of <persName>Philip</persName> the Good (1396-1467) was a period of luxury and show, of pageant and display. Bruges, that ancient and attractive city of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q234">Flanders</placeName>, whose exchange is the oldest in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName>, was at that time the seat of the Court of the Dukes of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3030967">Burgundy</placeName>. The Letters Patent say the order was dedicated to the Glory of God, the Holy Mother, and to <persName>St. Andrew</persName> the Apostle. Its object was promoting the Catholic religion and exhorting all men to live virtuously. The Greek fable of the Argonauts under <persName>Jason</persName>, sailing from <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q183150">Colchis</placeName> in search of the Golden Fleece, is thought to have led <persName>Philip</persName> to institute the order, but some believe it was the great revenues he derived from the wool trade of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q234">Flanders</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Order of the Golden Fleece is claimed by <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> as well as by <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. <hi rend="italic">Philip the Good</hi>, Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3030967">Burgundy</placeName> (1396-1467), married <persName>Isabella</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName>; their son, <persName>Charles</persName>
               <hi rend="italic"> the Bold</hi> (1433-1477), left but one child, <persName>Mary</persName>, who, in 1477, married <persName>Maximillian I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>, a Hapsburg and Holy Roman Emperor. Their son <persName>Philip</persName> (1478-1506), who married in 1496 the Infanta Joanna of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> (<persName>Joan la Loco</persName>, the crazy, the

second daughter of <persName>Ferdinand</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName> and <persName>Isabella</persName> of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName>), thus became later, <persName>Philip I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q173063">Castile</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>. His son <persName>Charles</persName> (1500-1558) was <persName>Charles I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and also <persName>Charles V</persName> of the Holy Roman Empire. <persName>Charles V</persName> relinquished the Austrian throne to his brother <persName>Ferdinand</persName>, having in 1556 assigned the Spanish kingdom and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2750405">Netherland</placeName> provinces to his son <persName corresp="#viaf_88973996">Philip II</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> (1527-1598), to whom he gave the Grand Mastership and treasures of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Since that time the Kings of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> have claimed the order, while the Hapsburgs of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> claimed the sovereignty under one of its statutes, which says of the Order, <hi rend="italic">"dont serons nous chef et souverain et aprés nous nos Successeurs, Ducs de Bourgogne."</hi> While the territories of the Dukedom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3030967">Burgundy</placeName> went to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, the <hi rend="italic">title</hi> has been retained by the Hapsburg family without territorial claim. After the death of <persName>Charles</persName> the Bold in 1477, <persName>Philip le Bel</persName>, the son of his only child, <persName>Mary</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3030967">Burgundy</placeName>, wife of <persName>Maximillian I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>, became the Grand Master of the Order. The sovereignty of the order remained in dispute between the house of Hapsburg and the Kings of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, until <persName>Charles II</persName> died childless in 1702. <persName>Philip V</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, a <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q58389" type="dynasty">Bourbon</orgName> and the grandson of <persName>Louis IV</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, at this time claimed the Grand Mastership of the Order, and after a long dispute the question was
<pb n="17"/>
referred to the Congress of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3029030">Cambrai</placeName> in 1721, when the Order was recognized both for <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> and each portion independent of the other. Since the World War, <persName>King Albert</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2802361">Belgium</placeName> laid claim to the treasures of the order, in the name of the cities of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2800931">Bruges</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2800866">Brussels</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2797656">Ghent</placeName>, but this was rejected by a committee of three jurists, to whom the question had been referred by the Reparation Commission and which approved the decision of the Committee. The archives and treasures of the Order remain in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2761333">Vienna</placeName>, where they had been transferred from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2800866">Brussels</placeName> in 1700 by <persName>Charles VI</persName>, Emperor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>, owing to the French wars. The Spanish order is never given to an Austrian nor is the Austrian order awarded to a Spaniard.</p>
            <p>The order has always ranked as the most illustrious and distinguished order of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>; it was the only Spanish order which was not abolished by <persName>Joseph Bonaparte</persName> in 1808, and was actually confirmed by him in 1809. "The Duke of <persName corresp="#viaf_2465308">Wellington</persName> was created a grandee of the first class of the Spanish Order of the Golden Fleece, with the title of the Duke of <placeName>Cuidad Roderigo</placeName>, and appointed Captain General of the Spanish Armies. His Grace had two badges, one formerly worn by <persName corresp="#viaf_88598818">Emperor Charles V</persName>, and the other presented to him at <placeName corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</placeName> by the Countess de Chincona, a princess of the Royal house of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q58389" type="dynasty">Bourbon</orgName>, having

               </ref> The insignia of the order is a Golden Fleece suspended at the middle, from a blue-enamelled flint-stone, emitting flames of fire, enamelled red, which in turn is hung from a scroll and medallion. The ribbon is bright red. The grand collar of the order is alternate flint-stones enamelled blue with red flames and double fusils or firesteels interlaced to represent double B's for <placeName corresp="#geonames_3030967">Burgundy</placeName>. The insignia of the Keeper of the Rolls (<persName>Le Greffier</persName>) is an oval medal of gold (55 mm x 45 mm) composed of rays with twelve gold balls on alternate bars; with a white-enamelled oval in the centre, on which is a miniature of the badge, encircled by a red-enamelled band looped at the top. This oval is surrounded by a pointed border of gold, and the decoration is suspended by a bright red ribbon. The insignia of the Austrian order varies at the top and has, on a scroll, the motto <hi rend="italic">Pretium non vile laborum</hi> (Not a bad reward for labour).</p>
            <p>ORDER OF <persName>ST. JAMES</persName> OF THE SWORD (<persName>Santiago di Campostella</persName>). In 1175 this order and the rules governing it were sanctioned by a bull of <persName>Pope Alexander III</persName>. From this document we learn that its organization had taken place in 1170.

With the passing of the years, and with the repression of the Moors, the wealth of the order increased greatly, as did also the fame and prowess of its members.

There are five classes: the first and lowest consists of a gold Maltese cross, ball-tipped, of white enamel, bearing on the obverse medallion a figure of <persName>St. Ferdinand</persName>, surrounded by a blue band inscribed <hi rend="italic">AL MERITO MILITAR</hi>. The reverse has two globes, crowned, surrounded by a blue band inscribed <hi rend="italic">EL REY Y LA PATRIA</hi>. The various classes of this order are issued in several forms. The lowest, or first class, has the cross superimposed on a laurel wreath and surmounted by a similar wreath for suspension. The second class is without the laurel wreath above, the third class is like the first, and the fourth class has an ornamental leaf design above and is not superimposed on a wreath. The fifth or highest class is a plaque of faceted silver rays forming the cross superimposed on a green laurel wreath, with the figure of <persName>St. Ferdinand</persName> in the centre, encircled by a band inscribed <hi rend="italic">AL MERITO MILITAR</hi>. The plaques of the second and fourth classes have four red-enamelled swords, with handles meeting in the centre, the blades forming a cross. There is also a small silver cross for privates, which does not class them as Knights. Another form of this decoration, awarded during the reign of Queen Christina and still given to Generals and other high officers, is styled the Cross of <persName>Saint Ferdinand</persName>

and is composed of four swords with gold handles and red-enamelled blades. The handles meet at the centre with the guards forming a circle, while the blades make the arms of the cross. This is also issued superimposed on a green laurel wreath, but no authority for this variation has been found. The ribbon for this decoration is bright red with a yellow stripe each side.</p>
            <p>The highest class decoration of this order was presented to the Duke of <persName corresp="#viaf_2465308">Wellington</persName> on April 29, 1812, by the Cortes of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, and later in that year they bestowed on him the estate of Soto de Roma in Granada, "in the name of the Spanish Nation in testimony of its sincere gratitude".

            <p>There are five grades: Grand Cross, Commanders with plaque, Commanders, Chevaliers and Chevaliers of the Silver Cross. The insignia is a red-enamelled Maltese cross, indented at the extremities, with wide-edged gold borders and ball-tipped points, surmounted by a green laurel wreath, and with gold rays in the angles. On the obverse medallion are the pillars of Hercules<ref target="#CH1-n5">

Indian subjects, though this is not confirmed. A sixth class was instituted in April, 1907, by <persName>Alphonso XIII</persName>, consisting of silver and bronze medals, 32 mm. in diameter, bearing on the obverse a replica of the cross without the rays, and on the reverse the crowned monogram of <persName corresp="#viaf_286447916">Ferdinand VII</persName>.</p>
            <p>To judge from the varieties of this decoration, they were very generously bestowed and not very highly valued.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF <persName>MARIA ISABELLA LOUISA</persName> or <persName>ISABELLA II</persName>. Founded on June 19, 1833, by <persName corresp="#viaf_286447916">Ferdinand VII</persName>, in honour of his daughter by his fourth wife, <persName>Maria Christina</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>. Its purpose was to reward men of the Army and Navy who were loyal to the Infanta, the presumptive heiress. As Ferdinand had no sons, he abolished the Salic law in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> about 1830, and at his death in 1833, <persName>Maria Isabella Louisa</persName> was proclaimed Queen. The Carlist war resulted. For officers, the decoration is a white-enamelled cross moline, with a gold crown above. On the obverse medallion, in a red-enamelled field, is a gold bust of the Queen encircled by a blue band inscribed <persName>ISABEL II REINA DE ESPANA</persName>. On the reverse, in a red field is M. I. L. encircled by a blue band inscribed <persName>AL VALORE MILITAR</persName>. The cross for non-commissioned officers is of silver,
<pb n="34"/>
bearing on the obverse an oval medallion with the initials M. I. L. The reverse is plain and the ribbon is light blue. After 1839, the decoration was awarded for service in the Army or Navy of ten years or over. Many of these decorations were awarded to the detachment of Royal Artillery and Marines, who formed part of the British volunteer forces under <persName>General Sir De Lacy Evans K.C.B.</persName>, who in 1835 was sent in command of the "Spanish Legion" of ten thousand troops, to aid the Queen against <persName>Don Carlos</persName>. Evans remained two years and gained several brilliant victories. The cross in silver was also given to the British men for service at <placeName corresp="#geonames_3110044">San Sebastian</placeName> on May 5, 1836, and at <placeName corresp="#geonames_3128026">Bilbao</placeName> on December 24, 1836.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF MILITARY MERIT. <persName>Maria Isabelle Louisa</persName> (<persName>Isabelle II</persName>) was dethroned in 1868 as a result of the Civil War. The attempt of the Carlists to secure the throne was a continuous source of trouble during her reign of thirty-five years. In order to reward her adherents, <persName>Isabella</persName> founded this order on August 3, 1864, for the military and civilians and for deeds not of sufficient importance to warrant the conferring of higher orders. It was reconfirmed on December 30, 1889, and is now awarded for individual merit in military operations to officers and soldiers and also to civilians.</p>

            <p>The decoration is a plain gold-edged, red-enamelled cross surmounted by a royal crown, the upper arm of which is partly plain. In this plain space is engraved the action and date for which the award is made. The circular medallion bears the Arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> with a <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q58389" type="dynasty">Bourbon</orgName> shield in the centre. The reverse medallion bears the initials of the founder, <hi rend="italic">Y 2</hi>, and sometimes those of the reigning sovereign. When awarded to pensioners and for services not in actual combat, the cross is red with a white band on each cross-arm. The ribbon is red with a white stripe in the centre when awarded for war service. For the troops, the cross is all silver with no enamel and the ribbon is white with a red centre.</p>
            <p>The plaque is an eight-pointed star of faceted rays on which is a duplication of the obverse of the cross with fleurs-de-lis in the angles and a crown <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the upper cross-arm instead of surmounting it.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF NAVAL MERIT. This was founded August 3, 1866, for the men of the Navy under conditions similar to those of the Order of Military Merit. The decoration is similar, except that the lower cross arm is longer, and in place of the medallion a gold anchor is superimposed. The ribbon is red with a broad yellow stripe in the centre.

            <p>Another cross of Merit for the Navy was founded September 22, 1816, to be given to those who took part in the War of Independence of 1808, and a description will be found under the decorations for that period.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF CIVIL MERIT. This resembles the cross of Military Merit, except that the enamel is white and the ribbon is white with a red stripe in the centre.</p>
            <p>ORDER OF AGRICULTURAL MERIT. This was founded on December 1, 1905, by <persName>Alphonso XIII</persName>, for those eminent in agriculture. There are three grades: gold with a green ribbon, silver with a green and silver ribbon, and copper with a green knot of ribbon, according to the nature of the award. The decoration is a white-enamelled Maltese cross, double-pointed and ball-tipped, in the centre of which is a medallion with the symbols of agriculture.

and charitable work. Some authorities give <persName corresp="#viaf_286447916">Ferdinand VII</persName> credit for its recreation in 1820 at the time of the cholera epidemic in Manila, but that decoration differs materially (See page 88). There are three grades for the Order of Charity: Grand Cross, Commanders and Chevaliers, and these are awarded both to men and to women. The decoration is a six-pointed, ball-tipped star, enamelled white with black edges; gold rays are in the angles, and the whole is surmounted by a palm wreath. In the centre red medallion is a gold figure of Charity with children, surrounded by a band, on which is inscribed <hi rend="italic">A LA CARIDAD</hi>. The medallion on the reverse has in the centre the cipher of the founder <hi rend="italic">Y 2</hi> surrounded by the words <hi rend="italic">BENEFICENCIA PUBLICA</hi>. The ribbon is white with a black band on each side. The plaque of the first class consists of the six-pointed star as above described, superimposed on a gold laurel wreath and rays of faceted silver.</p>
            <p>CIVIL ORDER OF <persName>ALPHONSO XII</persName>.

His mother ruled as Regent during his minority, and he is the only surviving ruler of that once powerful <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q58389" type="dynasty">Bourbon</orgName> family from which so many European kings have sprung, and who have held such power in the politics of the continent.</p>
            <p>The order is bestowed for literary and artistic merit and is composed of three classes: Grand Cross, Commanders and Chevaliers. The badge is composed of rays of violet enamel, on which is a radiant disc representing the sun. Superimposed thereon and within a gold palm and green laurel wreath, is an eagle with spread wings. Above the eagle is <hi rend="italic">A XII</hi>, crowned—below, <hi rend="italic">ALTIORA-PETO</hi> and a shield bearing the Arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>.

            <p>ROYAL ORDER OF <persName>MARIA CHRISTINA</persName>. Founded by <persName>Alphonso XIII</persName> on July 19, 1889, for the Army, and in January of the following year for the Navy. It was discontinued on June 19, 1918, but reinstated March 16, 1925. It is to reward distinguished individual merit, and when given to Generals or Colonels is all gold; for Majors and Lieutenant-Colonels, it is of silver and gold, and for junior officers and enlisted men, it is of bronze and gold. The decoration is a

plaque of faceted rays on which is superimposed a cross with laurel wreath entwined and four swords with hilts outward. The arms of the cross have curved ends and bear on the upper arm a gold crown; on the others, a gold fleur-de-lis. In the centre are the Arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> in colour, surrounded by a blue band inscribed <hi rend="italic">AL MERITO EN CAMPANA</hi>.

            <p>In addition to the foregoing, there were many other decorations established and bestowed upon the Army, Navy and civilians for their efforts to support the throne of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. These are given below in order of the events. It will be noticed that many of them were not founded until long after the occurrences for which they were bestowed. In probably no other country have there been so many decorations given for military service and of so great a variety. It seems as if the designers of these have vied with each other in making each new decoration entirely different from its predecessor.</p>
            <p>CROSS FOR SAPPERS AT <placeName corresp="#geonames_3130616">ALCALA DE HENARES</placeName>, 1808. Founded on October 1, 1817, and awarded to the two Companies of Sappers and Engineers under <persName>General Legues</persName>, who, at the beginning of the French invasion after the events at <placeName corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</placeName> in 1808, refused to serve under the French, and assisted in saving the flags, the military stores and arms of the first division, and in escaping from <persName>Alcalá de Henares</persName> on May 2, 1808, and fleeing to <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q24001798">Sierra de Cuenca</placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="44"/>
            <p>The decoration is a gold cross ball-tipped and enamelled red, with blue triangles of enamel at the ends of the cross arms, and the whole surmounted by a royal crown. A white medallion in the centre bears six mountain peaks, from one of which flies a white flag bearing the letters <hi rend="italic">Z. M.

            <p>CROSS FOR VALENÇAY 1808. When <persName corresp="#viaf_286447916">Ferdinand VII</persName> was sent to Valençay (Indre) by the French in May, 1808, he was accompanied by a number of faithful adherents. He remained in the home of Talleyrand for five years, returning to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> in March of 1814, when Napoleon's Empire was tottering. On August 23rd of that year, he instituted this decoration for those who had gone with him into exile. It is a blue-enamelled Greek cross surmounted by a gold crown. On the ends of the cross and in the angles are gold flames, and on the blue-enamelled medallion is a gold head of the founder surrounded by a white band inscribed <hi rend="italic">FER NAN DO 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1814</hi>.

            <p>CROSS FOR ADHERENTS OF THE KING. The Spanish subjects who by their loyalty to the king, incurred the displeasure of <persName>Don Manuel Godoy</persName>, the Prince of Peace, were interned by him in the Chateau of <persName>St. Laurenzo</persName>. To honour these loyal subjects, <persName corresp="#viaf_286447916">Ferdinand VII</persName> founded this decoration on December 5, 1814. It is a white-enamelled cross moline with gilt balls in the angles, and surmounted by a green laurel wreath. On the blue medallion encircled by a red band is a golden grid and a palm. The reverse medallion of blue is inscribed <hi rend="italic">POR EL REY / PREMIO / A LA INO / CENCIA</hi>. The ribbon is bright red.</p>

The ribbon is yellow, with narrow green stripes at each side, for those captured; and for the wounded, a red cross is embroidered on the ribbon.</p>
            <p>CROSS FOR CIVILIANS IN <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">FRANCE</placeName>.
