            </head>
            <p>The study of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage has been pursued for a long time and has interested a number of eminent numismatists. It is, of course, merely a part of the study of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and a part which omits or only slightly illumines the most famous aspects of that famous man. Yet the coins have some things to show which the texts pass over in silence and their evidence is as yet far from exhausted. The prodigious number of coins still in existence which bear his name and types has made it natural that a large part of the interest of those who have dealt with them should be devoted to trying to determine where they were struck and when. Much has been accomplished in this primary task of arrangement but much is still to be done. And beyond this question is the more fundamental one of what part the coinage played in the total functioning of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> empire. We need to know not only where the coins were struck and when but by whose agency, in what quantity, with what purpose and to what effect. These pages raise and discuss some facets of the problem. They are essays only and far from a definitive treatment. In some cases they are premature, propounding questions which further evidence will presently resolve, and sometimes new evidence has accumulated during the time the book was being composed. I must beg the reader's indulgence on the plea that what I am trying to do is not to settle questions so much as to raise them in the hope that they may ultimately be settled by the combined efforts of many with new material at their command and with different points of view which may supplement or invalidate my own. I have set down the phenomena that seemed to me most important from the beginning of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage to the end of its imitations. If the essays should attract new students to the Alexandrine coinage and somewhat advance the understanding of the experts they will, I believe, have justified their existence.</p>
            <p>The book has been a pleasure to write. It was begun and finished at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, for me certainly the ideal place for such a composition. The thought of my colleagues there and in the American Numismatic Society will always color these essays with the happiest memories. As in other cases, I have submitted my ideas to my most valuable mentors: <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_51769105">E. S. G. Robinson</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_381705">Henri Seyrig</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_109772791">Margaret Thompson</name>, not always convincing them but always profiting by their counsel.</p>

            <p>
               <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coins are inscribed <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY</hi> or <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY BAΣIΛEΩΣ.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
               </hi> They are the king's money. Not in the way that the laws are the king's laws: abstractions of which he is the responsible source with the same relations to all men. Nor in the way that his sword and horse are the king's: by personal, absolute right, capable of being modified only by himself through gift or loan. Without the king's act, entirely without his knowledge, a man may acquire title to coins exactly as he can to any other piece of property. Doubtless the king could take them away from him, as he could take away his cattle or his house or his wife. Legally a man's money is no more vulnerable than any of his other possessions. There may have been a time when coins were the property of the king in an immediate and personal sense. Recently the interesting suggestion has been made that they were not originally intended for currency, but for payment of the Lydian king's mercenaries and that circulation was an incidental and unforeseen consequence.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> It is interesting to guess at the process by which the secondary function absorbed the primary one.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> It must have been early, for the silver of the Greek cities was surely intended as currency from the beginning. In any case, by <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time all thought of personal connection between the king and his money had long since been forgotten. To one of his subjects the genitive on gold and silver must have meant that the coins were struck by authority of the king, from his metal and that they were the medium by which his government paid his obligations and received his dues. They would be legal tender wherever his power extended, for both types and weights were uniform.</p>
            <p>Their bullion value was supposed to equal their nominal value: a silver tetradrachm was taken to be four drachmae of silver. Yet, if that had been
<pb n="2"/>
strictly true, the whole expense of manufacture would have been borne by the king. Originally that may have been so. A man who was accustomed to receive his pay in electrum by weight (and by metal content if that was determined) would hardly be satisfied with a less amount simply because it bore a device when there were still unmarked dumps in circulation of full weight. There must have been some critical point at which the cost of manufacture was transferred from the minting authority to the user and there is no way of telling when that came, but it was before <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. His tetradrachms were in competition with those of Athens whose minting, as we know, was an important economic asset of the state. She certainly would not consciously lose by the process, and the simplest way to break even was to reduce the weight of each coin a little so that the part subtracted should be metal equal to the cost of manufacture. That is presumably what Athens did and what <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> did also.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> How much the deduction was we do not know. The tetradrachm was supposed to weigh 17.62 grams.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> Four drachmae of silver must have weighed somewhat more, but while the coins themselves conform to standard very well, such other weights as are preserved are not nearly so uniform, so that the attempt to find the weight of the official non-monetary drachm is not likely to be successful. No doubt it was all governed by law and the difference a matter of record. We know, from a much later period, what precautions the Athenians took to keep their weights and standards true; we know also that they were perfectly acquainted with a coin weight which was different from the commercial

weight.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> If the Macedonian citizens were aware that the government was issuing coins of less than full weight they probably cared very little. The conveniences of a money economy were worth much more than the amount involved.</p>
            <p>The king's money was struck in three metals and in a variety of denominations of which the following are the most important:</p>

            <p>The types of the gold have occasioned much comment. They are new to the Macedonian coinage and are usually, though not universally, regarded as having an Athenian origin. To be sure, their general propriety to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> is sometimes held to be sufficient explanation without closer investigation into details. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14897764">Percy Gardner</name> represented this point of view:<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> the types of <name type="pname">Philip's</name> gold <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi>

The curiosity of other scholars, however, has not been so easily satisfied, and a considerable literature has grown up about the identification of Pallas and Nike. In 1847
<pb n="4"/>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_7485941">Charles Lenormant</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> deduced from comparison of the staters with the heads of Athena on vases and the later bronze coins of Athens that the goddess was Athena Promachus, Pheidias' heroic bronze statue which stood on the Acropolis between the Erechtheium and the Propylaea, a dedication, according to <name type="pname">Pausanias</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> from the spoils of the Persians defeated at Marathon. In 1890 Ernest <name type="place">Babelon</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> was quite willing to accept this and <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_2598262">Charles Seltman</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> regarded the head as probably a free adaptation of Athena Promachus, perhaps convinced by the hearty support of this solution by Philip Lederer.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> Considering the uncertainties in regard to this celebrated statue, a positive identification is hardly safe,<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> but the other suggestions that have been made are not persuasive.</p>
            <p>1) Prokesch-Osten,<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> followed by <name type="pname">E. J. Seltman</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> put forward as a possible original the ancient Palladium of Pella. This is met by Lederer<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> with the objection that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coins had and were intended to have an ecumenical importance and an obscure local deity would not suit his purpose at all.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> It may be added that when Pallas appears on the obverse of Pella's own coins<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> it is in the form of Athena Parthenus in obvious imitation of the New Style silver of Athens.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>2) <name type="place">Babelon</name>, recanting his previous acceptance of Athena Promachus believed
<pb n="5"/>
that the type was Pallas "des monnaies de Corinthe"<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> in which he was followed by <name type="place">Svoronos</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> who thought that the adoption of "Pallas Corinthienne" may have resulted from a decision of the Council of Corinth and who could not believe that relations between Athens and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> were such as to make his borrowing a device from her possible. This is a good example of an attempt to exalt likelihood into evidence. If there were no documents this might be regarded as an interesting possibility which, from frequent repetition, would come to be accepted as a fact. But here there is evidence, and one only has to compare the heads of Athena on the coins of Corinth (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, <hi rend="bold">I</hi>) and of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> to see instantly that it is impossible that the latter should be derived from the former. If <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> goddess had been supposed to be the same person as that on the Corinthian silver she would have been made to look the same. What other way would there have been for men to recognize her?</p>
            <p>3) In a recent study of the whole problem of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> imperial currency <name type="pname">Gerhard Kleiner</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> urges, on grounds of historical probability, that the goddess is Athena of Ilium and that it was not until after his visit to Ilium that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> began to strike his own types on gold.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name> work is a connected whole and cannot fairly be disposed of piecemeal; it will be treated more thoroughly presently. But it may be said here that, on purely numismatic grounds, his suggestion is a weak one. Athena Ilias, as she is known to us from many coins (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 2,3), was a deity of very special appearance: she wore a polos, over her shoulder she held a filleted spear, and in her other hand was a distaff; that is, she was an Anatolian deity with more oriental than Greek features. If <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had had her in mind he could have produced a head with a polos. Now it is true, as <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> says, that on later coins of Ilium the head of Athena has other forms, one of which is like that on the staters. But the first coins have on the reverse the cult statue of Athena Ilias; on the obverse a head of Athena with a round Attic helmet (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 3). These were issued under <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>; the head in Corinthian helmet comes later under Seleucus I, again with Athena Ilias as a reverse type. To assume that there was an image at Ilium of the appearance of Athena Promachus is purely gratuitous; there were two forms of Athena known earlier on the coins and one of them is clearly named Athena Ilias on the 2nd century silver<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 2).</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>A user who knew both Athena Promachus and Athena Ilias must conclude that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> type referred to the former and not to the latter.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> An Athenian model for the obverse of the gold is therefore still the most likely.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The reverse is quite as worthy of remark. Nike has a long and interesting career on ancient coins, but none of her previous appearances has any connection with Macedonia. This in itself raises no difficulty, and when the object in Nike's left hand was thought to be the frame for the erection of a trophy, it seemed a most appropriate augury of the future to which <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was entitled if any man ever was. But it was early noticed that the object assumed a great variety of forms and <name type="place">Babelon</name> presently showed that it was, in fact, a stylis,<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> which he took to be an instrument for propping up the aphlaston on the stern of a Greek ship. The naval significance was accepted by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_115419736">Ernst Assmann</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> who asserted however that what was represented was actually a <name type="place">Phoenician</name> standard, borne on the admiral's ship. Some part of his argument was met by <name type="pname">G. F. Hill</name> in the same number of the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Numismatik<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref>
               </hi>
               <pb n="7"/>
and <name type="place">Babelon</name> also answered him in a discussion much extended from his first essay<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> which proved that the object was not purely <name type="place">Phoenician</name>. Its function, however, was hardly adequately treated until 1914 when <name type="pname">Jean</name>
               <name type="place">Svoronos</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> argued with a wealth of illustration that the stylis was an image of the protecting deity set up on the stern of a ship. Whatever interpretations may be advanced in the future, one thing is clear: what Nike holds in her left hand has a naval significance. That does raise a difficulty, for it is well known that, at his accession, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had no fleet and therefore no reason to select a type that meant victory at sea.</p>
            <p>There are three ways in which this dilemma is met: 1) by assuming that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> looked confidently ahead to victory at sea; 2) by assuming that he did not strike this gold at the beginning of his career but at a later time when it would have been appropriate; 3) by assuming that the stylis was part of the original on which <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> type was based and that he copied it as it was without concerning himself about its propriety in detail.</p>
            <p>1) Is by its nature incapable of proof, but certainly not very likely unless at the beginning of his career he expected to have the help of some other naval power. We do not know of any plans of his looking to control of the sea.</p>
            <p>2) Has been argued more than once. Its acceptance means either that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> struck no gold in the first years of his reign or that he continued to issue the types of his father (<ref target="#fig-7">PLATE I, 1</ref>–<ref target="#fig-9">3</ref>). There is, I think, no defender of the first alternative now, for it is clear that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> cannot have conquered <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> without money, and the mines of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> were still providing gold. We may assume that the second alternative is the only one which needs to be argued. It is generally assumed that the capture of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> is the point at which such an announcement of naval supremacy would become appropriate. That is <name type="pname">Assmann's</name> theory in the article referred to: in 332 <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> found himself in the position of the <name type="place">Phoenician</name> admiral and could adopt his insignia. In replying to <name type="pname">Assmann</name>, <name type="place">Babelon</name> makes the interesting observation that by 332 there had been no sea battles (for the capture of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> can hardly be considered such) whereas the army of the Great King had been defeated at Issus and one would be inclined to expect that the real victory would be commemorated on any device adopted then rather than a strategic situation which was not, in fact, of capital importance to his great conquests.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Assman</name> is not the first to have put forward the theory that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage does not begin at the beginning of his reign. It appears as early as <name type="pname">E. M. Cousinéry</name> in whose <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Voyage dans la Macédoine</name>
               </hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>, 1831) there is a section, "<name type="pname">Monnaies d'Alexandre</name>" (pp. 229–270). It is naive and careless in
<pb n="8"/>
detail (particularly in regard to the correspondence of text and illustrations) but it advances the doctrine which has had fuller and abler treatment since: that the first coins struck by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> were not those with his own types but a posthumous continuation of those of his father. "<name type="pname">Nous ne pouvons—nous</name> refuser À croire qu'en entrant dans l'Asie, il ne soit borné À mettre en émission la monnaie de son père dans les trois metaux" (pp. 230f.). This is rejected by <name type="pname">Müller</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> but has been revived in an impressive presentation: <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Alexanders Reichmünzen</name>
               </hi>. It will be well, however, to deal first with Cousinéry's earlier and less important treatment, though this will make it necessary to anticipate our discussion of the silver.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Cousinéry's</name> theory is founded on two convictions: first, that the head on the obverse of the silver is invariably a portrait of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. "<name type="pname">Cette tête ne présente rien d'idéal</name>" he says (p. 236); he finds complete uniformity not only on the coins struck during <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> lifetime but also with the head in elephant-skin headdress issued by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 4) and that with the horns of <name type="pname">Ammon</name> issued by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 5), which he rightly recognizes as likenesses not of the kings who minted them but of their deified leader. Of these he gives engravings, but none of the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> types to let the reader judge whether they are of invariable style. He does, indeed, remark that the flans of the coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> after its division by the <name type="place">Romans</name> are thinner and broader, but there is no indication that he used this or any other criterion to distinguish the epochs to which <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> coins belong. Apparently he found the same face on the earliest <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n silver and on the spread-flan tetradrachms which succeeded the collapse of the Seleucid power. His second conviction is the surprising one that it was the Greek cities, grateful for their deliverance from the Persians, which selected the types and manufactured the coins. A modern numismatist would hardly feel called on to refute this but, of course, if it were true it would mean that the silver types could not have begun until the cities had been freed. The gold, as already remarked, he thinks was subsequent to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> visit to Ilium. The appearance of <name type="place">Athena</name> on the obverse would be a natural consequence of the devotion there paid to her by the conqueror; the Nike of the reverse appears to be no problem to the author.</p>
            <p>After the Granicus <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> could use Persian gold and silver, but he continued to issue his father's types "soit par respect pour sa mémoire, soit À cause du crédit que ces monnaies avaient acquis partout où le nom de Philippe était parvenu. Ce que nous le prouve c'est la grande quantité de ces pièces qu'on ne cesse de découvrir dans toute l'Asie" (p. 231). This last remark is the only appearance of what can fairly be called evidence in a fabric of conjecture, and it is evidence which we can test to some extent. It is essential to distinguish

between the gold and silver. The gold of Philip achieved a great success as an international medium and its popularity was such that it certainly was issued posthumously.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> The wide currency of the staters is shown by the hoards in which they occur. There are 19 such hoards listed by Noe:<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> they come from <name type="place">Bulgaria</name>, <name type="place">Romania</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref>
               <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver, on the other hand, had a more restricted territory. Among the barbarians of the north it was well received, so that from the mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> these types also were issued posthumously.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> The great number of Celtic imitations, much commoner than those copied from <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, is testimony to the success of the originals in that direction. But if the crossing to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> and the early campaigns there were financed with <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver as well as his gold, which is essential to Cousinéry's theory, the hoards containing his silver should be conspicuous in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>. There are 24 such hoards, and they come from <name type="place">Bulgaria</name>, <name type="place">Romania</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> It cannot be said that there is any lack of evidence from the territory with which we are concerned. From <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, the adjacent islands, and north <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> Noe's list has 140 hoards, and of these there are no less than 17 which contain silver of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref> And not one silver coin of <name type="pname">Philip</name> ! This is surely enough to justify us in asking "If <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver was used in the first campaigns, where is it?"</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> deals with <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage as a whole, which nobody had done since <name type="pname">Müller</name>. He has a familiarity with the literary sources which numismatists in general would do very well to match. He has supported his thesis with great learning and ingenuity, assembling much material on iconography with which also numismatists should be better acquainted than they are. It is quite impossible to do justice to the work in any résumé since it is a large body of related details but, though I feel called upon to disagree with him, I should like to do him as little injustice as possible.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name> thesis is that the imperial coinage—silver as well as gold—was inaugurated at the festival at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> in the spring of 331 after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> return
<pb n="10"/>
from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> It was at that time that Harpalus, induced by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> to return from his flight to Megara, was reinstated as treasurer. It is, of course, an attractive idea that so large and important a system should have been planned in advance and put into operation all at once, and the second visit to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> would certainly be an appropriate moment for such an innovation. But <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> does not rely on this appropriateness alone. Like others, he maintains the improbability of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> using Nike as a device before the capture of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> (pp. 12, 20, 21); he denies that Pallas is a probable deity for him to have honored in the earliest years of his reign, before his visit to Troy (pp. 18, 19); and he adds a more complicated psychological argument. In 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>
               </hi>., to celebrate the freeing of the Greeks, gold pieces were struck with the portrait of Flamininus on the obverse, and on the reverse, with the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">T. QVINCTI,</hi>
               </hi> an imitation of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> Nike with a palm substituted for the stylis (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">

               <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> regards this to be a presentation of Flamininus the Liberator as an equivalent for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Liberator. But he believes that if this type had been employed by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> at the beginning of his reign it would have been remembered as the money of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Destroyer of Thebes and so altogether unsuitable for the model of a type in honor of emancipation, whereas if it had been introduced after his freeing of the Greek cities of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> there would have been no such objection (pp. 5, 6).<ref target="#CH1-n41">41</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These arguments, to my mind, are based on probability only and are therefore bound to fail if confronted with <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> to the contrary. And we have contrary evidence in three places. The first is the absence of <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver in hoards from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, already discussed in connection with Cou-sinéry. The other two are alike. In discussing the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> coinage of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref> and Myriandrus<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref> Newell shows how directly it was based on the coinage of the Persian satrap Mazaeus which preceded it. Now <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> entered <name type="place">Tarsus</name> September 3, 333 and won the battle of Issus November 12 of the same year.<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref> If coins were issued from those mints as soon after falling into <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> hands as dies could be cut, obviously the theory that the first appearance of his
<pb n="11"/>
types was in the spring of 331 must be abandoned. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> does not undertake to prove that the Greek coins follow the Persian ones immediately, though he certainly believed it.<ref target="#CH1-n45">45</ref> But there are only two other possibilities: either the mints were idle from 333 to 331 or, conformable to <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name> general theory, there were intervening issues bearing <name type="pname">Philip's</name> types. In the first case, some reason ought to be alleged; in the second, the issues ought to be identified. Unless or until these conditions are met, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s hypothesis holds the field.<ref target="#CH1-n46">46</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Account should also be taken of the arrangement of the issues of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> in <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s study of the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard.<ref target="#CH1-n47">47</ref> They extend from "circa 336 <hi rend="bold">B.C.</hi> to circa 318 <hi rend="bold">B</hi>.c.," the latter being the date of the hoard's burial (p. 135); they are put in groups A to K. This arrangement the author justifies on pp. 68f.: "The dates here assigned the various groups of the <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> coinage are, perhaps, to a certain extent approximate. But even so, they cannot be in error by much more than a year either way." He points out that important confirmation for the dating of the earlier groups comes from a hoard buried at <name type="place" corresp="#pleiades_570397">Kyparissia</name> in 328 or 327.<ref target="#CH1-n48">48</ref>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name> theory, which does not affect the date of burial of the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard, would force us to compress this material by five years, reducing the groups from eleven to six. How is it to be done? It may be urged that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> himself had revised an earlier arrangement, and so he had, and in important respects.<ref target="#CH1-n49">49</ref> There has been much new information made
<pb n="12"/>
available since his second study and that needs to be worked through; a particular need is the systematic treatment of the issues of <name type="pname">Philip</name> II. But it is not enough to say that this arrangement is fallible. It is founded on careful study and unless or until a better arrangement is proposed, we are not justified in lowering the beginning of the coinage by five years.<ref target="#CH1-n50">50</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I cannot see that <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> has done justice to the evidence of style. The difference between the earliest <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> heads from the different mints is made much of in the article by Gebaur to be discussed below.</p>
            <p>3) Such being the weaknesses of our second possibility, we are left with our third: namely, that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> Nike is copied from one with which the stylis belongs. An <name type="place">Athenian</name> origin was an obvious possibility to those who believed that Pallas on the obverse was <name type="place">Athena</name> Promachus, but <name type="place">Babelon</name> made the suggestion very specific by pointing out<ref target="#CH1-n51">51</ref> that Nike with a stylis upon a column beside <name type="place">Athena</name> Promachus was painted on a Panathenaic vase of 336/5, the archonship of Pythodelos. This seemed to him more than a coincidence and he concluded that the two Nikai were related documents of a time of cordiality between the monarch and the city. Hill defended him against Assmann on matters of fact, but was not convinced by the suggestion that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had borrowed from Athens.<ref target="#CH1-n52">52</ref> Neither was <name type="place">Svoronos</name> who, as already remarked, could not believe that at this time <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> would have had any reason to flatter the <name type="place">Athenian</name>s as <name type="place">Babelon</name> thought. Instead, he suggested that it was the other way around and that the Nike on the Panathenaic vase was copied from "les types désormais historiques des statères qu' <name type="pname">Alexandre</name> venait de frapper dès son retour en Macédoine."<ref target="#CH1-n53">53</ref> This was dismissed by Lederer as impossible because there was not enough time for the coins to have been struck and become so well known as to invite imitation in the year 336/5 after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> return from the Congress of Corinth.<ref target="#CH1-n64">64</ref> On the other hand, he produced as evidence of the connection with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> a newly discovered gold stater on which the type of Nike was accompanied by Nike also as a symbol bearing an aphlaston and an obscure object which he thought might be a stylis. This unprecedented use of the same figures as both major and minor device he regarded as certainly calculated. Stylistically the coin belongs to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> earliest
<pb n="13"/>
issues; Lederer believed that it was the very first die cut for the new king's gold (and possibly cut in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> itself). Moreover, he made more specific an idea that had already been advanced by <name type="place">Babelon</name>. Golden Nikai had been dedicated in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> in the latter half of the 5th century, but in the critical days of 407/6 they had, with one exception, been melted down into money. One was restored in 374/3 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>.,<ref target="#CH1-n55">55</ref> others by <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q211326">Lycurgus</name> in the late 4th century. In this case we have a literary tradition and inscriptional evidence as well. The pseudo-Plutarchian <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Ten Orators</hi> (841 D and 852 B) and <name type="pname">Pausanias I</name>, 29 both record the fact that <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q211326">Lycurgus</name>, who was notable for the extent to which he restored her ancient riches to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, had presented to the goddess on the <name type="place">Acropolis</name>, among other things, golden Nikai. Two inscriptions, IG<hi rend="sup">2</hi> II, 333 and 1493 testify to that fact. Now when the gift was dated in 336, as understood by <name type="place">Babelon</name>, a connection between <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>' and <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> Nike is an obvious possibility, and <name type="pname">Lederer</name> (p. 202) definitely holds the coin to be inspired by those restored statues. One item that makes this attractive is the fact that the figure is not at all what we should expect from the 4th century, whereas it is perfectly appropriate to a restoration of a 5th century original.<ref target="#CH1-n56">56</ref> Unfortunately for the theory in this form, the two inscriptions are now dated 334/3.<ref target="#CH1-n57">57</ref> It has been rescued, however, by a daring conjecture of Homer A. Thompson:<ref target="#CH1-n58">58</ref> to wit, that the restoration of 336/5 was an act of munificence of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> himself, whose selection of the type would then commemorate an act of generosity toward a city for which he had recurring moods of affection. We have only to read the speeches of the later Attic orators to find that not all <name type="place">Athenian</name>s were his enemies; doubtless he had more friends than we know, and perhaps he thought he had more friends than he did. It is obvious that the only real objection to this solution is skepticism as to such cordial relations between <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> in 336.<ref target="#CH1-n59">59</ref> If that can be accepted, all difficulties are met. But we should have the candor to admit that the choice would not have been expected and is foreign to general historical probability.</p>
            <p>As to the obverse type of the silver, we are met with a different kind of question. The head of young <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> with a lion's skin covering had ample
<pb n="14"/>
precedent on <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n coins, having appeared under Archelaus I, 413-399, <name type="pname">Amyntas</name> III, 389-383, 381-369, Perdiccas III, 364-359 and <name type="pname">Philip</name> II, 359-336.<ref target="#CH1-n60">60</ref> The legend of the descent of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n kings from <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>, whenever it was invented, had been very useful to their claim to admission among the first families of the Hellenic world and no reason beyond tradition was needed for the adoption of the hero's portrait as a device. <name type="pname">Kleiner</name>, whose theory requires that the silver as well as the gold should have been inaugurated in 331, argues that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> interest in <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> was not conspicuous until the episode of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name>, after which his heroic ancestor assumes great importance in his life,<ref target="#CH1-n61">61</ref> but the conclusion is open to the same objections that have already been discussed in regard to the gold. The simplest explanation is that the new king adopted an old type but for a new denomination.</p>
            <p>It is natural that the question should have been repeatedly asked: "is the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> head a portrait of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> himself?" There are really two independent questions, not always distinguished by investigators. Was it the intention of the die-engravers to produce a likeness (which might be true without any effect on the general public, most of whom would not have seen the king at close enough range to judge)? Was it the general persuasion that the head was a likeness of the king (which might be true without any such intent on the part of the die-engravers)? We have sundry bits of evidence that the second was true in later tradition.</p>
            <p>1) A very interesting tetradrachm was issued in the 2nd century B.C. by <name type="pname">Agathocles</name>, king of Bactria, one of a number honoring his predecessors. The obverse has the familiar head in lion's skin with the inscription AΛEΞANΞPOY TOY ΦIΛIΠΠOY (<ref target="#fig-43">Plate II, 7</ref>).<ref target="#CH1-n62">62</ref> Here <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> is altogether ignored and the portrait is meant to be not that of the deified conqueror but of Agathocles' royal but human precursor.</p>
            <p>2) At Alexandria-ad-Issum bronze coins were struck in the 1st century <hi rend="bold">A.D.</hi> (to judge by their style and fabric) on the obverse of which there is a <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>
               <pb n="15"/>
head in lion's skin which, considering the town, must be understood as a picture of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n63">63</ref>
            </p>
            <p>3) A great many bronze coins were issued in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> in the 3rd century <hi rend="bold">A.D.</hi> with the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> on the obverse identified by the inscription <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY (P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">late</hi> II, 8).<ref target="#CH1-n64">64</ref> The most favored portrait seems to be one with diadem and flowing hair, obviously modelled on the coinage of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>, but there also appears the head in lion's skin headdress,<ref target="#CH1-n65">65</ref> which shows that at that period there was no doubt as to who was represented.</p>
            <p>4) Apollonia Mordiaeum struck a bronze coin in the time of Caracalla on which the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> portrait is identified by inscription as <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Founder of Apollonia.<ref target="#CH1-n66">66</ref>
            </p>
            <p>5) There is also an interesting mediaeval item in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">De Thematibus</name>
               </hi> of the emperor <name type="pname">Constantine Porphyrogenetus</name> (945-959 <hi rend="bold">A.D</hi>.).<ref target="#CH1-n67">67</ref> Speaking of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n kings who considered themselves descendants of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> who slew the Nemean lion, he reports that instead of taenia or crown or royal purple, they crowned themselves with the skin of a lion's head which they prized more than jewels. "Trustworthy proof of this is the coin of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> of Macedon adorned with that kind of portrait." So there were <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> tetradrachms to be seen in the 10th century and at so late a date the answer to the second question is still that the head was commonly supposed to be that of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, and surely it is not very daring to guess that the same answer would be right for a much earlier period, even the period of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own lifetime. But for lack of a statement it cannot be proven.</p>
            <p>The first question may be debated and has been. It is unnecessary to refer to all the writers who have had their say, since some have nothing new to offer. A few believed that the head is always intended to be <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. We have seen that this is the position taken, for different reasons by <name type="pname">Cousinéry</name> and by <name type="pname">Kleiner</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n68">68</ref> It was supported also by some of the older numismatists writing in
<pb n="16"/>
a day before the resource of abundant illustration, so that their conclusions could not be presented so as to convince the eye; nor, indeed, were their own convictions based on wide and intimate visual acquaintance with the material.</p>
            <p>Others have held that the head was never intended as a portrait. Such is <name type="pname">Eckhel's</name> belief,<ref target="#CH1-n69">69</ref> supported by a bookish argument characteristic of his time. He appeals to the words of Horace <hi rend="italic">(Epistles</hi> II. I. 239–41):</p>
            <p>"<name type="pname">Edicto vetuit</name>, ne quis se praeter Apellem</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Pingeret</name>, aut alius Lysippo duceret aera</p>
            <p>Fortis <name type="pname">Alexandri</name> vultum simulantia."</p>
            <p>He might have added the passage from Pliny the Elder <hi rend="italic">(H. N.</hi> VII. 37. 125): Idem hic imperator edixit ne quis ipsum alius quam Apelles pingeret, quam Pyrgoteles scalperet, quam Lysippus ex aere duceret; and the later passage (XXXVII. 4.1) where the authorization of Pyrgoteles seems to apply only to carving in emerald.<ref target="#CH1-n70">70</ref> Even so fortified the argument does not amount to much. The meaning of the edict (whatever form it took) must have been that the king was not going to sit for his portrait to any artists except those three. He cannot have hoped, or desired, to prevent the making of copies and copies of copies by any who felt so inclined. Indeed we have ancient references to other portraits besides those of the official appointees.<ref target="#CH1-n71">71</ref> Die-sinkers could certainly make portraits of the king without breaking the law.</p>
            <p>Most of the discussions have been, of course, parts of more general inquiries into the portraits of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> in all media, but whether other kinds are included or not, the scholars have taken one of two positions, either denying that there were any numismatic portraits of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> during his lifetime, or admitting that certain coins might be so considered. The former view has the weighty authority of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n72">72</ref> which is heartily supported by <name type="pname">Theodor Schreiber</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n73">73</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>According to them portraiture was an invention of the Hellenistic age, and the difference between one <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> tetradrachm and the next is to be explained by differences in time and place of striking and difference of die-sinkers. Both authors look to the issues of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi> II, 5) and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name>

            <p>But other scholars are not able to dismiss the differences so lightly and maintain, with greater or less conviction, that here and there <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own face does appear under the lion's skin. It is noticeable that the numismatists are mostly very cautions and show no disposition to cite specific examples. <name type="pname">Müller</name> who, in his time, had studied a much larger body of material than anyone else, lays down the general principle that the earliest <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> heads of the reign are like their predecessors on the coins of previous kings, but that sometimes later, and commonly after 323 a likeness appears, not as a result of any command of the king but at the choice of the several magistrates or of the artists themselves.<ref target="#CH1-n74">74</ref> But there is no indication of where to look for these appearances. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_100184717">George MacDonald</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n75">75</ref> is very reticent: "Tradition, indeed, has it that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> features are to be discerned in the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>—even if we grant that this is so, the very circumstance that portraiture was introduced in covert fashion, lurking under the shelter of religion, is highly significant." And <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> in a book where positive identification would certainly be appropriate,<ref target="#CH1-n76">76</ref> says only, "The silver coins invariably bear the head of the youthful <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> covered with a lion's skin—the features frequently resembling those of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> himself."</p>
            <p>There are those, however, who are willing to be more specific. <name type="pname">E. Q. Visconti</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n77">77</ref> finds indication of the king's features on tetradrachms of <name type="place" corresp="#pleiades_590031">Rhodes</name> and of <name type="place">Ake</name>. <name type="pname">G.

               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi> I, <hi rend="bold">II</hi>) and, to a lesser extent, the first from other mints, show a head which is perfectly characteristic of the mid-fourth century. Within the next half decade there is a breaking with tradition and a greater freedom and individuality, usually followed by a hardening into schematization. From this the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> mints never recover but those of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>, farther from the artistic dominance of the homeland, and inheriting the traditions of local schools of art, produce essentially new portraits. From <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> in 327 comes a die which he recognizes as the first true likeness of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> on a coin (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

Gebauer regards the development of the head in the years after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death as a combination of the conception of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> as a god with that of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> as an historic ruler, the various local streams finally merging in the full tide of Hellenistic art. The portraits which appear on the first silver of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> and on both silver and gold of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> are unmistakably identifiable as the deified <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>The article has excellent, clear and well-chosen illustrations. Its tone is logical and temperate and the case it makes is certainly a respectable one. Of course, the language of aesthetic criticism is hard. There is so much that the eye perceives that cannot be put into adequate words. And there are so many times when two beholders will perceive different things as to matters of expression and emotion. The difficulties are increased when the argument is not about single substantative works of art but, as here, about items selected as examples from a large group which has its inner differences as well as its common characteristics. Perhaps another scholar, working with the same material, might modify the course of this study and its conclusions. But it does seem to me that the argument is probable as a whole and supported by its details. It will be seen that it altogether rejects the idea that the broadcasting of his portrait was part of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> original plan, or, indeed, that he had anything to do with it at any time. <hi rend="italic">A priori</hi> it would be attractive to think that it <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been part of the plan for the imperial coinage—that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had anticipated <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> and <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> and <name type="pname">Demetrius Poliorcetes</name> in making use of his money to spread his fame. It has been suggested that he himself had been anticipated by his father and that the bearded head on <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver was

intended at once for <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> and for the king.<ref target="#CH1-n80">80</ref> But in this case we have no reliable portraits of <name type="pname">Philip</name> preserved for comparison and the unproven possibility cannot be used to strengthen the case for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>The different approach of Miss <name type="pname">Bieber's</name> "The <name type="pname">Portraits</name> of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Great" leads to a similar result. As none of her predecessors had done, she "distinguishes between the different periods in which the bewildering varieties of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> portraits preserved for us have been created." Her only addition to the numismatic material in Gebauer's article is the enlargement, as fig. 32, of another coin of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> of about 320 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

               <hi rend="bold">II</hi>).<ref target="#CH1-n81">81</ref> She would apparently not object to his theory that the first coin portrait came in 327, though she does not mention it. But none of her pictures which may derive from originals earlier than that time has any relation to the head on the first coins from <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>, <name type="place">Tarsos</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name>, and of these the series from <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> is surely the first of all on the evidence of style.</p>
            <p>Both of these studies assume, as do <name type="pname">Müller</name> and Hill, that the appearance of a real portrait is the achievement of an individual engraver or perhaps an individual magistrate or satrap. On the other hand, <name type="place">Erik <name type="place">Sjöqvist</name>
               </name>, publishing a head in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> Museum<ref target="#CH1-n82">82</ref> illustrates, as a parallel, a tetradrachm of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</name> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

This, he believes, is not merely the work of a single gifted die-cutter but a document of the gradual process of the deification of</p>

            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> during his own lifetime. "It marks," he says, "the first decisive step in the evolution of an iconography that was totally new to Greek art: that of rendering an image of a deified ruler." He enumerates convincingly the specific traits which make this seem to be an actual individual and not a mere traditional convention, and he believes that the original is the official portrait of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> in 332, probably by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_297421082">Lysippus</name>. If we are dealing with an official program the result ought to be that from this time on the coins show with increasing frequency and success heads that are recognizably those of an actual person, somewhat idealized to be sure, but not those of a conventional hero. But do they? Comparison of the different specimens selected as likenesses by the various scholars raises a certain uneasiness in the mind of the beholder and a feeling that we need much more material than even Gebauer has provided.</p>
            <p>There is a certain deceptive pattern in the situation. On the one hand there are the coins earlier than <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> with a beardless head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>. These cannot be portraits of him. They vary considerably in style but it is impossible that they should be portraits of the various rulers who struck them.<ref target="#CH1-n84">84</ref> They must be <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> alone. On the other hand there are the heads generally agreed to be posthumous portraits of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, issued by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>. Between are the issues of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> himself which should be related to one extreme or the other. But it is not quite as easy as this, for no one has yet demonstrated the uniformity of the testimony of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>. Indeed, a glance at Pl. IX of Hill's <hi rend="italic">Select Greek Coins</hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>, 1927) which shows enlargements of coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and his two successors tempts us to wonder whether we may not recognize the later heads because they bear the accessories of divinization—the elephant's head and the ram's horns—and not because they resemble each other. We must never forget that we are dealing with the craftsmanship of many die-sinkers who varied greatly in skill and also—as Professor <name type="place">Sjöqvist</name> reminds me—in sympathy with the idea of divinization. <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> mints never achieved, and probably never attempted the degree of uniformity shown in the <name type="place">Athena</name> heads of 5th century <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. But what is the proportion between the specimens which show conformity with an official program and those aberrations of intent or execution which would seem to deny its existence? An enormous task awaits some heroic scholar: analysis which shall be not selective but inclusive of the dozens of dies of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>' head
<pb n="21"/>
to see what generalizations can be safely made. It must be done without preconceptions—and it might well end in failure. Perhaps some guidance can be provided by Cahn's synopsis of the elements which form style<ref target="#CH1-n85">85</ref> but it is a work not to be undertaken by the impatient or the faint of heart.</p>
            <p>For the present let us content ourselves with concluding that a traditional type was selected by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> as suitable for an imperial currency, which proved its acceptability in an empire wider than he could have imagined and that, at some times and in some places, true likenesses of the king and his commanding personality inspired the hands of his artisans so that men came eventually to believe that he and <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> were one.</p>
            <p>The reverse type is invariable in its main features. <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> is always seated to the left, he has an himation over his legs but is undraped from the waist up, on his outstretched right hand he holds an eagle, with his left he leans upon a long scepter behind him. There are details, with which we shall deal presently, that vary. He is sometimes called <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> Olympios.<ref target="#CH1-n86">86</ref> Yet there are important differences from the statue of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> that was at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</name> in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time: the great chryselephantine statue by Pheidias. They have deterred most scholars from giving a title to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> deity. One other identification was put forward, but it cannot be seriously considered. Eckhel<ref target="#CH1-n87">87</ref> says "Jupiter hic Nicephorus (a mere slip for Aetophorus) haud dubie est Bottiaeus ille seu cultus in Bottiaea <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>e regione in qua sita Pella." Impressed by "haud dubie" from so great an authority, <name type="pname">Müller</name> accepted the name,<ref target="#CH1-n88">88</ref> and, in his early work<ref target="#CH1-n89">89</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> contributed a rhetorical flourish which his maturer judgment allowed to be forgotten: "on the reverse we see <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> of Bottiaea, who had a famous temple at Pella and was honored throughout <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>." But Bottiaean <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> is a very elusive figure indeed. The single ancient mention of him is by Libanius in connection with a dedication of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> at Antioch-on-the-Orontes (or rather where Antioch was later to be founded)<ref target="#CH1-n90">90</ref>. Any connection with the district of Bottiaea around Pella is conjecture and nothing more.</p>
            <p>The divergence from Olympian <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> is excellently stated by Cook in a passage worth quoting in full.<ref target="#CH1-n91">91</ref> "When <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Great placed upon his

silver coinage the design of a seated <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name>, it might have been expected that he would choose for the purpose the great cult-statue at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</name>—and the more so as Mount Olympos was a prominent feature of his own domain. In point of fact, he did nothing of the sort. He set aside all the improvements introduced by Pheidias and deliberately reverted to the old pre-Pheidiac type.

            <p>The inference is clear. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, ignoring the idealized ruler at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</name>, harked back to the more ancient and popular type of <name type="pname">Zeus Lykaios</name>. After all, <name type="place">Mount Lykaion</name> too was called Olympos. Yet so immense was the fame of the Pheidiac figure that tetradrachms issued later in the name and with the types of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> are increasingly influenced by it. The left leg is advanced instead of the right, and the throne is manifestly assimilated to that of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> Olympios—so even <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> failed to arrest the moral evolution of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name>." To the resultant questions, "What motive led him to make the attempt? Why did he select for his world-wide coinage the old eagle-bearer of <name type="place">Arkadia</name> rather than the newer and nobler creation of Pheidias?"—he has no answer to offer.<ref target="#CH1-n92">92</ref>
            </p>
            <p>But the particular form of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> was less important than the fact that, like <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> other devices, he was easy for inhabitants of the various districts
<pb n="23"/>
of the empire to accept as their own. <name type="pname">Seltman</name> has put the case clearly:<ref target="#CH1-n93">93</ref> "Though introduced in 336 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. these types were destined to appeal equally to <name type="place">Greeks</name> and to Oriental subjects of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> as yet unconquered; for the <name type="place">Phoenician</name> was to see in the obverse type his own god Melqart, the Cilician was to regard the seated deity as the god Ba'al of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, and the Babylonian, though he might not be able to read the Greek name of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, was to look on pictures that might recall his own <name type="place">Gilgamesh</name>, the lion-slayer, and the figure of Bel-Marduk, god of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. When it is realized that, next to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>, the greatest mints of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> were to be established precisely in <name type="pname">Phoenicia</name>, <name type="place">Cilicia</name>, and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, the uncanny foresight that the king showed in the selection of these types becomes apparent."</p>
            <p>Cook recorded the fact that the earliest pose, with the legs stiffly parallel, the right in front of the left, gives place to an easier position, more like that of Pheidias' figure, with the right leg drawn back and the right foot appearing in back of the left one <hi rend="bold">(PLATE</hi> II, 10, 11). This change does not take place everywhere at the same time, but it is general and is an indication of date rather than of place. But there are small differences which are useful for a more exact placing of the issues in their respective mints. Not only does the throne sometimes have a back (as mentioned by Cook) but the back may be decorated with little Nikai on the top, and the shape of the legs and the placing of the crossbars differ. The god is sometimes laureate; sometimes there are long locks on the nape of his neck, sometimes short ones, sometimes none. There may be a dotted exergual line beneath his feet, or a straight one, or a footstool, or nothing. Together with these items also goes a constant modification of style which is in itself sometimes sufficient to prove the relation between reverse dies without more objective variants.</p>
            <p>But far more important than other minutiae for the reverses of both silver and gold are the little ancillary figures—the symbols—or the letters or monograms which, with very few exceptions, occur in the field of the reverse type. They are not conceived as parts of the main design, as is evident from the fact that the scales of the type figure and the symbol are quite unrelated. Scholars were early convinced that symbols, monograms and letters alike were indications of the place of striking, and great ingenuity was displayed in recognizing civic devices and deciphering cities' names. Some of the suggestions were good and have been confirmed by later work with greater resources, though the original discoverer is sometimes forgotten. Some were quite fantastic and displayed an astonishing ignorance of ancient history and geography. It would be amusing to list the impossible guesses that have been made, but no serious

value would result. Any who are disposed to investigate this chapter in the history of human error might start with Eckhel's list of his predecessors,<ref target="#CH1-n94">94</ref> noting his own selective and conservative suggestions as to mints, based largely upon Pellerin "post infelices aliorum conatus."<ref target="#CH1-n95">95</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These early attempts have one common weakness: they do not distinguish between the first coins and the later ones, some of them very much later. Such differentiation is among the great merits of what is still the basic work in the field: <name type="pname">L. Müller's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Numismatique d'Alexandre le Grand.</hi> To a volume which discussed all aspects of the coinage of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, with that of <name type="pname">Philip</name> II and <name type="pname">Philip</name> III as well, was added an Atlas wherein is displayed in clear tabular form all the varieties known to him (1735 for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, 313 for the elder <name type="pname">Philip</name>, 142 for the younger) with drawings of the symbols and monograms, indication of their placing on the coin and of its fabric.<ref target="#CH1-n96">96</ref> The fabric was arranged in seven classes, the increasing breadth and flatness of whose flans was the sign of a chronological development, and they are illustrated by engravings on the first two plates. His discussion of them, on pp. 5-9, 97-104, allows for border-line cases, and would not now be accepted in all its details, but it added an important new instrument for the analysis of the huge number of coins with which we have to deal.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Müller</name> treats of symbols and monograms more than once (pp. 35-49, 90—93, 116-122). He began with the conviction that they represented towns or districts and in his Atlas the main headings are place names, with lists of Incerti for the various districts, the length of which might have given him some cause for doubt. Thus, in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> he lists 15 towns followed by 61 varieties from Incertae Urbes which, on the least reckoning, would amount to 11 more. He does at one point admit that symbols might be those of magistrates,<ref target="#CH1-n97">97</ref> but he is sure that the marks are generally those of towns.<ref target="#CH1-n98">98</ref> Of course, additions to his lists were made, but I think there was no published questioning of his principle until a quarter of a century later.</p>

            <p>In 1869 <name type="pname">Edward H. Bunbury</name> published<ref target="#CH1-n99">99</ref> two tetradrachms of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>, one (<name type="pname">Müller</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n100">100</ref> no. 112, Aenos) with caduceus and bee, the other (<name type="pname">Müller</name> no. 445 a, <name type="place">Chrysaoris</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#pleiades_991381">Caria</name>) with torch and bee; they were both struck with the same obverse die. "It appears to me, therefore," he said, "as certain as any conclusion can be, in a subject where we are necessarily left to inference, that the two coins in question belong to the same part of the country, and can only be referred to neighboring cities." This is as far as his disagreement with <name type="pname">Müller</name> went. But a much more serious doubt as to the validity of <name type="pname">Müller's</name> method was raised by von Sallet.<ref target="#CH1-n101">101</ref> He found three staters of <name type="pname">Philip</name> II with the same obverse die. Two of them were <name type="pname">Müller</name> no. 88 (<name type="pname">Philip</name>pi) with K and tripod; the third, the gold counterpart of <name type="pname">Müller</name> no. 237 (Incerti) with K and a broad hat but without the tripod. He concluded that these must all have come from the same mint, and that the mint was not <name type="pname">Philip</name>pi. The symbols, then, may be those of magistrates or emissions and not of places. In reviewing this essay with approval<ref target="#CH1-n102">102</ref> Head remarked, "It is becoming every year more and more apparent that the whole edifice rests on a foundation of sand. The symbols, however much they may resemble municipal devices or coin-types, are, as <name type="pname">Dr. von</name> Sallet clearly shows, merely the signets of the monetary magistrates, and only very exceptionally to be accepted as mint-marks." This was so much more drastic than <name type="place">Bunbury's</name> essays in revision that it drew a cry of distress from him.<ref target="#CH1-n103">103</ref> Head, he protested, was destroying the whole foundation for a reasonable arrangement of the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> coinage and leaving mere chaos. To this Head replied in a brief note.<ref target="#CH1-n104">104</ref> He granted that <name type="pname">Müller's</name> Classes V, VI, and VII, which were issued by free cities after the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, bore symbols, sometimes accompanied by initial letters, the devices of the cities which struck them. But, for the earlier coins, he expressed his conviction that three fourths of the signs were those of magistrates and not of cities. Head's doctrine convinced <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name>, who appealed to it in support of his identification of the mint of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n105">105</ref> Finally, in 1912, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>, in his <hi rend="italic">Reattribution of Certain</hi>

               <hi rend="italic">Teiradrachms of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Great,</hi> produced such a wealth of evidence on identical dies from the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard that the hypothesis of a large number of little mints had to be abandoned permanently.</p>
            <p>There are, to be sure, cases in which true mint marks do appear, and they are not all confined to the posthumous issues (for example, ĸ or <graphic url="NS11_sym1.jpg"/> for <name type="place">Kition</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>, <graphic url="NS11_sym2.jpg"/> for Paphos, <graphic url="NS11_sym3.jpg"/> for Arados, Σl for <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name>) but the great majority, as Head saw, stand not for places but for persons. Who these persons were we do not know; they had supervision over particular issues, holding office for a term, which would usually be a year after the regular Greek custom, seeing that the official standards were maintained and being allowed to put their private marks on the coins struck under their charge as a subordinate guarantee to the great guarantee of the king's name.</p>
            <p>The bronze was less common and is much less well known. The types refer to <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>, both obverse and reverse, though no one has raised any question about the portrait. The positions of the bow and club vary, and there are letters or symbols which will ultimately help in achieving an arrangement, but correspondences with the symbols on gold and silver are spasmodic and it is likely that the bronze issues were the care of separate officials. They were certainly not struck with the frequency and regularity of the gold and silver. The serious study of them has hardly begun.</p>
            <p>Such are the essential aspects of the major coins which formed the international currency of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> empire.</p>
            <p>These denominations were supplemented at one time or another by the following multiples and fractions:</p>

            <p>To translate these pieces of money with any thoroughness into terms of human existence would need far more information than we possess, but we are not without some useful indications of value. The first point to be remembered is that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, abandoning his father's choice of standard for silver, coined on that of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> according to which the drachm weighed 4.3 grams and was divided into 6 obols. There has been a good deal of discussion as to why he made the change, and talk of bimetallism which is, <hi rend="bold">I</hi> think, sufficiently dealt with by <name type="place">Théodore Reinach</name> who points out that the necessary conditions for real bimetallism never existed in antiquity.<ref target="#CH1-n118">118</ref> What <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> did was to follow the example of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> and strike a silver drachma of the
<pb n="30"/>
same weight as the gold drachma of which two made the stater. Of the relation of silver and gold we shall speak presently; the issuance of silver money on the standard used by <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> was certainly not surprising considering the assured reputation and universal acceptability of the <name type="place">Athenian</name> owls. Schlumberger, indeed, believes that his choice was influenced not only by their importance in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> but also by their imitations which had become so notable an element in the currency of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>. What <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> wanted to do, he says, was to give a generally recognized coinage to an empire which did not have one and to extend the use of coinage to the whole territory.<ref target="#CH1-n119">119</ref> This largeness of view, however, would only have been possible at a time when he could foresee the eastern extension of his empire. It therefore fits Schlumberger's idea that the imperial currency does not begin with the beginning of the reign. But with the difficulties caused by this theory we have already dealt. In any case, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had silver drachms 20 of which were equal to one gold stater in value.</p>
            <p>And what were they worth to their possessors? Any attempt to answer this question ought to be prefaced by a reminder that we have no evidence from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> itself. In the works of the orators and the comedians there is a considerable amount of economic information about 4th century <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, and this has been carefully gathered by August Böckh in his book <hi rend="italic">Die Staatshaushaltung der Athener.<ref target="#CH1-n120">120</ref>
               </hi> There a great deal can be found out about the range of revenues and expenses—rents, dowries, wages, fines, loans, and such matters. But these figures, while interesting and illuminating in themselves, must be used with caution for the economy of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> or <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>. Nevertheless, there is one figure so basic that it seems safe to use it. In the latter part of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Constitution of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>,</hi> which deals with the constitution of his own time, section 49 records the fact that the Council considered the case of paupers, and any who were found to have less than 3 minae capital and to be physically incapacitated received 2 obols a day for food at the public expense. In 4th century <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, then, 2 obols a day is the level of bare subsistence. This is borne out by <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</name>' proposal for an expedition against Macedon<ref target="#CH1-n121">121</ref> in which the foot soldiers were to get 2 obols a day which would keep them alive even if they were not supplemented by plunder. We know nothing of the cost of living in the country, and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> may well have been more expensive than any town in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>, but, if we keep that in mind, it is safe to calculate that a silver diobol was about the minimum that a man could get along on for a day. Then a drachma would support him for three days, a tetradrachm for 12.</p>
            <pb n="31"/>
            <p>This being the scale of values for silver, we need to convert it into gold and bronze. Since the gold stater (of two gold drachmae) weighed just twice the silver drachma, the ratio between gold drachma and silver drachma will be exactly the ratio between the bullion values of the metals. Now the value of gold and silver will vary according to supply and demand and will vary differently except in those instances in modern times where government control has produced a true bimetallism. Since in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> the standard was silver the result was an apparent fluctuation in the value of gold only, though sometimes ancient writers recognized the interaction of the metals.<ref target="#CH1-n122">122</ref> There is evidence that in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>n empire there was a fixed official ratio of 13⅓: 1;<ref target="#CH1-n123">123</ref> an <name type="place">Athenian</name> inscription of 434/3 (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. 352) gives a ratio of about 14: 1; two literary sources of the 4th century show that by then the proportion had sunk to 11 or 12: 1.<ref target="#CH1-n124">124</ref> In the middle of the 4th century the opening of the mines of Pangaeus suddenly increased the available gold supply which appears to have dropped the ratio to 10: 1,<ref target="#CH1-n125">125</ref> and this seems to have been maintained for a long time.<ref target="#CH1-n126">126</ref> It would be dangerous to suppose that it never varied during the period of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and his successors,<ref target="#CH1-n127">127</ref> but what testimony we have encourages us to assume that 10: I was the usual ratio.One gold stater, then, equalling 20 silver drachmae or 5 tetradrachms, would be subsistence for one man for 60 days, and a distater for twice as long.</p>
            <pb n="32"/>
            <p>When we come to speculate about the bronze we are in greater difficulties. It is generally agreed that bronze money was essentially fiduciary: that its value was not measured by the weight of the metal. This is confirmed, though it cannot be said to be proved, by what little information we have about the price of bronze.<ref target="#CH1-n128">128</ref> More conclusive is the variation in weight of individual pieces of the same denomination. In the Drama Hoard there are 94 bronze coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> all well preserved and in about the same condition; 13 of them weigh over 7 grams, 25 weigh less than 6. It is obvious that there has been no such attempt at exactness as even the fractional silver shows.<ref target="#CH1-n129">129</ref> To be sure, the loss or gain in value would be very small, but if a coin of 4.78 grams was supposed to be worth the same as one of 8.09 that must be because the bullion value did not matter. But too much can be made of the indifference. I may quote the conclusions to which I came in regard to Selucid issues where there are sometimes denominations not distinguished by difference in type.<ref target="#CH1-n130">130</ref> "Everyone will agree that the weighing of the original flans for bronze coins was less careful than in the case of silver because the bullion value was so much less. On the other hand, it is too drastic to assume that the bullion value was of no account whatever. The conception of token money with a value entirely independent of its material, like our paper, is a modern one which cannot fairly be attributed to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>tics of the third century <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. Doubtless the ultimate worth of the bronze coins was their theoretical ability to be exchanged for precious metals, and this allowed them to circulate freely in spite of variation in weight and at a value higher than that of their material. Yet the analogy of silver and gold must have affected the peasant or soldier user of bronze coins. The persistence of a system of denominations distinguishable only by weight must rest on the instinctive conviction that the more metal there is in your coin the more it is worth."</p>
            <p>Weight, then, may be helpful in separating denominations but is no guide to their relation with the silver issues, and we must look for other methods of analysis. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> tentatively proposed alternate schemes for identifying Seleucid bronze, based on the hypothesis of equality between the largest bronze and the smallest silver.<ref target="#CH1-n131">131</ref> As I have had occasion to remark,<ref target="#CH1-n132">132</ref> it is doubtful whether a single system can be substantiated for all the kings from <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I to Antiochus
<pb n="33"/>
III, and for all their mints, which by no means issue all the same denominations in silver and bronze. But aside from this his values are unsatisfactory for the period of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. According to his calculations the piece which he calls the unit would be either ⅛ obol or <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">16</hi> obol, and therefore <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sup">48</hi>ro<hi rend="sub">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">96</hi> drachma. On the evidence of a possible reduction in weight by Antiochus IV, he prefers the second ratio for the early Seleucid period. On the basis of convenience, however, the former or a lower one would be preferable. There is no denomination between the bronze unit and the silver drachma issued frequently enough to have been in common use, and 48: 1 seems a wide gap, let alone 96: 1. The relation of gold stater to silver drachm was 20: 1 and, as the tetradrachm was even commoner than the drachma, there was a ratio of 5: 1 between the most available large denominations. Why should the minor ones be separated by 48: I? Yet, as I have pointed out, in the case of Ilium the first local issues of that mint provided not multiples of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> denomination but fractions: half and quarter, <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">96</hi> and <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">192</hi> drachma according to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s lower reckoning, <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">192</hi> and <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">384</hi> according to his higher ! This surely must be rejected from its inherent improbability.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="place">Reinach</name>, who has done us the service of confuting some of the unsuccessful speculations of his predecessors, has made a cautious suggestion as to the values of Ptolemaic bronze.<ref target="#CH1-n133">133</ref> Since from 305 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. on the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>ian standard was Rhodian and not Attic, his definitions will not apply to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coins, but he gives voice to an interesting principle which ought not to be overlooked. "S'il me fallait" he says "À toute force hasarder À mon tour un système de dénomination, je verrais volontiers dans la classe de bronze B de <name type="place">Svoronos</name>, qui est de beaucoup la plus fréquente, l'obole, la pièce divisionnaire par excellence." The obol is, in truth, so prominent in the writers that it seems reasonable that it should be conspicuous as an actual coin. There is a silver obol but it does not seem to have been common enough to satisfy the requirement, and it is tempting to call our bronze piece an obol and so establish a ratio of 6: 1 between the minor denominations. The purely factual name chalkous "the bronze piece" we may safely assume was used of our unit as it had been used of the much-despised first <name type="place">Athenian</name> attempt to use token money;<ref target="#CH1-n134">134</ref> as it would presumably always be used of a bronze piece which was the only denomination or the dominant one. In more developed systems it may have been confined to a particular step in a series of denominations, having its multiples and divisions, as illustrated by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>"s tables, but for this early period it is almost certain that the commonest bronze piece would be called chalkous. That, however,
<pb n="34"/>
takes us no farther into the question of its value in terms of silver. There we have nothing to go on except reasonable conjecture. We are neither helped nor hindered by evidence from other places or other times,<ref target="#CH1-n135">135</ref> for it is clear that a coin without mark of value or necessary relation to its metal content would be very sensitive to circumstance, capable of being easily manipulated by authority or changed by conditions so that the work done by the unit of one situation might require a multiple in another. Let us assume, then, until we encounter evidence to the contrary, that the bronze unit was an obol and that two of them made a pauper's dole in the countries where <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> authority ran.</p>

               <p>The term "seigniorage" is an anachronism, but we are driven to employ it because we do not know what word the Greeks used. The amount of seigniorage in mediaeval and modern times might be enough not only to cover costs but to provide a revenue for the sovereign (the Bureau of the Mint of the <name type="place">United States</name> is reported to have made a profit of over $45,000,000 in 1957). But that is under conditions where the coinage does not have to compete with others whose bullion content is higher. Leaving out of consideration all other Greek coinages, Athens and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> were alike in the intention that their coins should be accepted widely and if they were to invade territory accustomed to an economy of barter it must be because their bullion value was only slightly lower than their face value. Athens presents the conditions where it would be easiest to calculate the expense of striking, and where that expense would be least: invariable types and the use of each die until it was worn out. The <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> coinage was almost as simple: the types were invariable but the varying symbols on the reverse meant that occasionally, at the end of an official's term, there may have been reverse dies which were not worn out but which must be abandoned or recut for the use of his successor.</p>

               <p>Indeed, <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> in a later passage (pp. 31f.) seems to me to compromise his position strangely: Harpalus the treasurer must have been influential in the choice of types; Harpalus may have become acquainted with Athens on his first mysterious flight to Megara in 333 and he was inclined to benevolence toward Athens by the celebrated Athenian hetairai Pythionike and Glykera; he was therefore probably responsible for the Athenian character of the gold types. "Durch Harpalos wird es auch am ehesten möglich, die Goldstatere mit Athen in Zusammenhang zu bringen." But then why introduce the Trojan episode at all?</p>

               <p>There is an interesting detail of the obverse type. The bowl of the helmet of Athena, when it is decorated, may carry one of four different kinds of ornament which have been discussed by <name type="pname">G. F. Hill</name> ("<name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Great and the Persian Lion-Gryphon," <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 1923, pp. 156-161). The first, and much the commonest, is a serpent in which Lederer saw a symbol of Athena <hi rend="italic">(ZfN</hi> 1922, p. 195). The second is a remarkable animal with straight wings, the body of a lion and the head of a bird. This type of gryphon belongs to the period after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death and to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, <name type="pname">Phoenicia</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. A rarer variant has the head of a lion, which is sometimes horned, with curved wings. "The lion-gryphon'' says <name type="pname">Hill</name>, "was conceived by the Greek as the enemy <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of the Persian." It appears at <name type="place">Ace-Ptolemais</name> and <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> (or perhaps Damascus) and possibly in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>, and its dates suggest that it may have been used for a short time as a symbol of the destruction of the Persian power. The rarest ornament is a Greek sphinx, used at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> and perhaps elsewhere in the East. If it is symbolic its significance is now lost.</p>
               <p>Professor <name type="pname">Machteld Mellink</name> of <name type="pname">Bryn Mawr</name> whose attention I called to this material points out that the horned lion-headed griffin occurs by itself in contexts where it is surely apotropaic and so can hardly be called "the enemy par excellence of the Persians." At the same time it appears to be unknown outside Persian art so that on <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coins it shows familiarity with a Persian art form. Of the other animals, all traditional as decorations on Athena's helmet, the most striking thing is the galloping pose of the bird-headed griffin. But there is no sure explanation of the significance of any of them.</p>

               <p>It might be asked, if relations later deteriorated, why was not the type changed? But this admits of an easy answer. It is obvious that what <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> wanted for his new currency was stability. No event and no sentiment was allowed to affect his types once they had been chosen. It is possible that there was, in his lifetime, variety in the appearance of the minor denominations, but there was none in the coins that did the main fiscal work of the empire.</p>

It might also be pointed out that while stylistically Baal on coins of Mazaeus at <name type="place">Tarsus</name> just before <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> is very much like <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>

            <p>From the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>
               <hi rend="bold">1,</hi> 498-454 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. the kings of Macedon had struck their own coins<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> and it was a matter of course that <name type="pname">Philip</name> II and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> III should strike theirs. But the size of <name type="pname">Philip's</name> output was altogether beyond that of any of his predecessors, and <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> dwarfed that of his father. Of course, the thing that made this possible was that <name type="pname">Philip</name> came into control of the gold and silver of the Pangaean district. When he took over the Thasian colony of Crenides in 357<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> he developed the neighboring gold mines until they produced an income of more than 1,000 talents.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> That undoubtedly took the form of coined money.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
               </hi> puts abundance of money at the beginning of the kinds of wealth, followed by real estate, movables, cattle and slaves. There is no mention of bullion, and while we read of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>n bullion captured by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and of gold objects included in the plunder, there is no record of royal transactions in bullion any more than there is of transactions on credit. This fact, that the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n kings, like the Greek cities, used not merely a money economy but a specie economy is of importance to keep in mind. If the thousand talents of income were all gold they would be 300,000 gold staters, since a silver talent, to translate it into its commonest forms, equalled 1,500 tetradrachms or 300 gold pieces at a ratio of 10: I.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Now though <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</name>, and doubtless his contemporaries, generally believed that a supply of money was wealth, <name type="pname">Philip</name> does not seem to have accumulated much. None
<pb n="36"/>
of the kings who preceded him had been able to coin gold<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> and there was a time when <name type="pname">Philip</name> had little enough.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> It might be thought that, with such a large increase of income, he would find himself with a surplus. But <name type="pname">Philip's</name> ideas were larger than those of his predecessors and his plans more costly. Not content with the old <name type="place">Macedonian</name> army which, so far as it was a citizen body, he might have employed with no expense beyond their maintenance,<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> he hired mercenaries and devised a military force not only larger but also far more resourceful than any previously known.<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> With this force he won his victories in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> and from it he sent an advance contingent of 10,000 to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> under <name type="pname">Parmenio</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_priscus_attalus">Attalus</name> in 337.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Obviously his military expenses must have been considerable. Moreover, <name type="pname">Philip</name> is reported to have said that he had enlarged his kingdom more by gold than by arms<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> and, if we had no other evidence than the charges and counter-charges of the orators, we could judge how freely the king's money was spent in bribery;<ref target="#CH2-n18">13</ref> it may well have amounted to a larger outlay than pay for the troops. And the tradition, whatever its accuracy, represents <name type="pname">Philip</name> as having no talent for economy. A passage from the <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> of Theopompus<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> describing his dissipation is certainly sensational and probably libellous, but it contains an interesting observation which does not seem to be an expression of prejudice, "He was a soldier and could not calculate income and expenditure at leisure." This must be considered in connection with the reports that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was, at the beginning of his reign, short of funds. In the <hi rend="italic">Life of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>
               </hi> (15.1) Plutarch quotes Aristobulus to the effect that on his crossing to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had only 70 talents in the war chest; <name type="pname">Duris</name> says it was only provision for 30 days<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> while Onesicritus adds that he had a debt of 200 talents besides.</p>
            <pb n="37"/>
            <p>Still more lurid accounts of his financial distress are attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> himself when he was haranguing the mutineers at Opis. According to Curtius (X. II) he said that he had inherited from his father 60 talents and a debt of 500, while the sober Arrian gives the most extreme account of all (VII. 9.6): his assets from his father were a few gold and silver cups and less than 60 talents, while <name type="pname">Philip's</name> debt of 500 talents he had increased by borrowing 800 more.<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> The words attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> himself refer to the exchequer at the time of his accession, not at the time of his crossing. We should not count too much on the evidential value of such a speech, but there is nothing to contradict the common testimony that <name type="pname">Philip</name> had used up his money.</p>
            <p>Plutarch takes the circumstances to show the high adventurous spirit of the young king and he adds the famous tale of his distributing all the royal property to his friends, keeping for himself only his hopes, in which <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> gallantly said he would share, refusing all other benefits. But this romantic story is
<pb n="38"/>
quite impossible to believe in the form in which it is given. It would mean that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> embarked on an expensive and perilous enterprise without making any provision at all for the campaign after its very beginning. One serious check would have left him with an army that he could not support, separated from a kingdom whose resources were exhausted with no means of being reestablished. There may well have been a distribution of gifts, perhaps so spectacular as to make it seem that he had left nothing for himself, but the record does not support the legend that he would have given away his soldier's pay and their safety to make an impression on his friends. Much that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> did was adventurous to the point of recklessness. Like other great generals of antiquity he conceived it his obvious duty to lead his troops in the field and he never seems to have provided against the risk by arranging for a second in command, as in the end he died without providing for the succession. If the battle-axe of Spithridates had cut him down at the Granicus it is hard to see how the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> army could have escaped annihilation. Whether there was a quality in the man that made him take risks beyond reason is a question outside the scope of this study. What concerns us is a class of evidence which lies altogether within reason. <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> strategy may have been bold but it was not hap-hazard. His plans may have been fallible at times, but there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> plans, and among them fiscal plans to provide the money without which the expedition would have been impossible.</p>
            <p>The records tell us a great deal about the accomplishments of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> but little or nothing of what lay behind them. There is tactical information about his arrangement of the order of battle, and such an episode as the siege of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> is treated with a detail which includes experiment and failure as well as ultimate success, but operations on a larger scale are treated as though they were an automatic sequence. And yet, of course, a prodigious amount of planning must have been required for the success of the all but incredible progress of his arms and of this <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> must have been the master mind. We get a glimpse of him in his youth questioning the ambassadors of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>n king not only about what was that monarch's position in the line of battle, which might have been prompted by youthful valor and his adventurous spirit, but also about the size of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>n forces and the shortest roads for those going inland from the sea, which was essentially strategic material.<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref> The ambassadors recognized these as subjects in which a king should properly be interested, and called him a <name type="pname">Great King</name> in contrast to their own who was only rich. Slight as the incident is, it suggests that even as a boy he had an idea of the value of military intelligence, which is one element of a long-range military program. It would be
<pb n="39"/>
interesting if we could have even this much light on the preparations for later stages of his campaign. But it was not the kind of thing that antiquity found worthy of recording, and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> is not the only great ruler whose plans are entirely unreported. Once in a while we get an intimation of the day to day work which a king must do. <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> remarks that kingship, which is the most perfect and greatest of offices, has the most cares and burdens and occupations, and he quotes <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> as saying, "If people knew what a labor it is to write and read so many letters, they would not even pick up a crown that had been thrown away." We must imagine, then, what the record fails to show: an <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> busy with many things less than heroic, but essential for all that. One of those things was finance.<hi rend="sup">18a</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was recognized in the 4th century that finance was a special study. <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</name> in the <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi> (I. 4. 8) lays it down that it is well for statesmen to understand money, since states often need money like households, but in greater quantity. Some statesmen, he says, have devoted themselves to that alone, doubtless having in mind the <name type="place">Athenian</name> statesman Eubulus whom <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> cites as having been commended because although he held unparalleled influence he did not deal at all with foreign affairs or the military but concerned himself only with finance and increasing the revenue. There was even some specialized literature: Aeneas whose <hi rend="italic">Tactica</hi> appears to have been written shortly after 360 <hi rend="bold">B.C.</hi> also wrote a treatise on military finance.<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> An interesting, though too brief ancient view of imperial finance is presented in Book 2 of the <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</name>, edited by <name type="place">Van Groningen</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref> In the theoretical introduction which comprises Chapter I we read 'There are four kinds of economy: that of a king; that of a satrap; that of a city state; that of an individual." It is plain that in the opinion of the author, which can hardly have been contradicted by the practice of his day, the coining of money is altogether in the
<pb n="40"/>
hands of the sovereign; the powers of a satrap may be great but they do not include coining. This is a continuation of 5th century doctrine according to which the issue of money was a declaration of sovereignty. Qualification is necessary for the Persian practice of the 4th century, however. The striking of gold was generally regarded as a royal monopoly. When Orontas, Satrap of Mysia presumed to do that it was because he was in revolt against the king and intended to declare himself independent.<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> But with silver the matter is different. The <name type="place">Cilicia</name>n silver bearing the names of the satraps Tiribazus, Pharna-bazus, Datames and Mazaeus is well known.<ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> It is so large and important a constituent of the Persian currency—so much more important than the royal shekels—that it seems mere legalism to insist that these powerful subordinates could strike only by grace of the <name type="pname">Great King</name>. <name type="place">Babelon</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> maintains that no satrap was permitted to strike <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> satrap, the power being always temporary and always in connection with the command of troops. But since on the previous page he has admitted that the client kings coined with considerable freedom and by no means always in connection with the business of their overlord, and since there is no way of relating each satrapal issue to a military event, and no explanation of the fact that this military money was issued in the name of the satrap and not of the king, we may believe that the restriction was perhaps a theoretical but not a practical one, and that the problem of silver coinage was generally left to the satrap's judgment. That is not the case with <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, however. In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> the coining of silver was a government monopoly, and when the name of a subordinate appears on a coin struck for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> there is an exceptional reason for it.<ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> Initials were sometimes permitted to a governor as to a mint official, but in general the empire of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and the realms of his successors observe the rule of the <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our author does not discuss the relations of royal currency with that of a city state lying within the royal dominion, yet that situation was a common one in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> under Persian kings and <name type="place">Macedonian</name> kings as well. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_51784706">Daniel Schlumberger</name> has recently shown<ref target="#CH2-n26">26</ref> that, while the Persian king's gold was a monopoly, his silver was only one of several kinds that circulated in his own land. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> came into no vacuum of currency when he brought his money
<pb n="41"/>
to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>. Schlumberger's statement of his purpose is very good.<ref target="#CH2-n27">27</ref> "What <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> intended to do is clear. He intended to give to an empire that did not have it a silver coinage universally acceptable as money and, in so doing, to extend the use of silver money as such (and not as bullion) to the entire territory of that empire." The intention was never entirely carried out, partly, of course, because of the shortness of his life, but, aside from that, it is not likely that the plan itself was ever so complete as to contemplate the retirement of the great variety of silver that was already in use. Whatever the theory, the fact was that there was a supplementary coinage from the cities<ref target="#CH2-n28">28</ref> which somewhat complicated the <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica's</hi> simple conception of the king as the only supplier of money.</p>
            <p>But the king had to decide, as the text says, what kind of money should be made and when, and whether the coins should be of greater or less value. The author realized that the king would not be fulfilling his proper duty if he merely directed that all bullion should forthwith be converted into coin, leaving the details to the master of the mint. What was the nature of his decision and by what considerations was it affected? <name type="place">Van Groningen</name> argues that it was the king's business to see that the official ratio of gold to silver was maintained.<ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref> He must therefore issue sufficient quantity of each to keep the values from fluctuating. The editor surprisingly argues on the assumption that it is the Persian king who is under consideration, who struck only darics of 8.336 grams or sigloi of 5.56 grams. If his date for the work be accepted (between 325 and 305) there was no Persian king at the time it was written. Moreover his hypothesis, which in any case credits the monarch with an unlikely degree of economic sagacity, is less plausible for the Persian king than for a Hellenistic one. The Persian king could doubtless dictate how much gold should be minted, but he could neither dictate nor foresee how much silver was to go into circulation, for the major part of the silver was provided by the cities.<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> was in far better position to control the money market than any king of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>. Nevertheless,
<pb n="42"/>
whether he was much or little concerned with preserving the ratio between metals, the king must decide how much gold must be coined and how much silver, and in what denominations.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Philip</name> had used the mints of Pella and <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> for gold and silver; perhaps also that of <name type="place">Philippi</name> for bronze.<ref target="#CH2-n31">31</ref>
               <name type="pname">Müller</name> believed that his coins came from a large number of other towns as well. Some of his identifications have been proved wrong; other have to do with the posthumous tetradrachms and staters; it may be that other mints of <name type="pname">Philip</name> will eventually be confirmed, but certainly none to compare with the two great <name type="place">Macedonian</name> cities and, on the basis of our present information, we can only safely assume that at <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> accession he found Pella and <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> in operation for the precious metals. His decision in regard to them will have been very simple. With the exchequer low he undoubtedly required new coin as fast as he could get it. What proportions of the various denominations he needed we cannot say.</p>
            <p>His sources of supply were well placed for his first needs: in the spring of 335 he embarked on the northern expedition, which is described in detail in Arrian I. I. 4-6. 11, which occupied him until the Theban revolt brought him back to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> in the fall of that year. His purpose was to discipline the barbarians on the periphery of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> who showed signs of restlessness at the news of <name type="pname">Philip's</name> death. He marched from <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> to the Ister, crossed it and beat the Getae in battle, then turned westward against the Agriani and Paeones and thence south to Pelium in Illyria where he broke up a serious rebellion. It was there that he heard of the situation at Thebes in consequence of which he returned to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> with all speed. His work in the north seems to have been thoroughly done, in spite of the interruption, for the barbarians gave him no further trouble, even after he had crossed to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>. There is no mention of the acquisition of territory, the founding of cities or the establishment of garrisons. It is very unlikely that the expedition resulted in the opening of new mints, immediately or later. To be sure, <name type="pname">Müller</name> assigns certain issues to a mint of Pelagonia (nos. 205-215) but some of these have been identified as coming from <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>, others from <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, and it is now clear that this territory was supplied with silver by the mint of Damastion which operated until 325 B.C., to be continued by the latest coins of Pelagia and the kings of Paeonia down to the Gallic invasions of 280.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref>
            </p>
            <p>How was the campaign financed? Partly by plunder. On two occasions Arrian speaks of booty;<ref target="#CH2-n33">33</ref> the first after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> victory over the Thracians when he sent it to the cities on the coast in charge of Lysanias and Philotas;
<pb n="43"/>
the second when that from the conquered Getae was taken back (presumably again to the coast cities) by <name type="pname">Meleager and Philip</name>. The only way we have of forming any idea of what it would amount to is to realize that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> would not in each case have detached two officers for escort duty unless the prize were of considerable value.<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref> Cohen indeed ingeniously calculates the amount by supposing that it is the difference between his indebtedness of 200 talents according to Onesicritus and his debt of 1300 talents according to Arrian's

report of his speech to the mutineers.<ref target="#CH2-n35">35</ref> He explains the statement no further, but it does not seem likely that two barbarian tribes could be the source of 1100 talents, when the sack of Thebes produced only 440.<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref> The expedition may have paid for itself. It is probable that if he did borrow an extra 800 talents that would have been in preparation for the crossing to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>.</p>
            <p>At the outset of his great enterprise his source of money, like his father's, was the two <name type="place">Macedonian</name> cities (Map 1). But now there was a difference. Under <name type="pname">Philip</name> Pella had been the premier mint; under <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> it was <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n37">37</ref> The result was a distinction in the functions fulfilled by the two cities, which <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> notices in an interesting comment.<ref target="#CH2-n38">38</ref> "Probably because of the contrast in their respective situations the Pella mint now came to be used more for supplying local demand, the <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> mint for foreign commerce. It is a fact that while the writer has records of the latter's issues being strongly represented in hoards from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>an <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia, and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>, the Pella coins seldom turn up in finds made outside of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> and then only in small numbers. In the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>an hoards, however, they are not uncommon. It is furthermore to be noted that such specimens of the Pella mint as did occur at <name type="place">Demanhur</name> are all beautifully preserved, the majority hardly circulated at all. It is evident that they had not travelled much from hand to hand after leaving their dies. In contrast to this, considerable numbers of the <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> pieces, particularly of the early issues, must by their appearance have circulated a good deal before they were finally consigned to the ground." Here, then, is an example of mints filling—and perhaps already of being intended to fill—particular places in the imperial currency. The tetradrachms of Pella went west and south, those of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> went to the soldiers in Anatolia and had seen long use before they got to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>.</p>
            <pb n="45"/>
            <p>In the spring of 334 the cavalry and most of the infantry went with Par-menio across the straits from Sestus to Abydus.<ref target="#CH2-n39">39</ref> The latter city had probably been in <name type="place">Macedonian</name> hands since <name type="pname">Philip's</name> expeditionary force three years before.<ref target="#CH2-n40">40</ref> Through it <name type="pname">Philip</name> must have introduced his gold, though apparently not his silver.<ref target="#CH2-n41">41</ref> Whether or nor he intended it, the effect was to supplant the Asiatic issue of gold from Lampsacus and electrum from Cyzicus, Phocaea and My-tilene.<ref target="#CH2-n42">42</ref>
               <name type="place">Babelon</name> is of the opinion that the use of electrum was encouraged by the hegemony of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> which also made her owls the standard large silver on the coast of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> in the 5th and 4th centuries.<ref target="#CH2-n43">43</ref> If that is true, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> made no attempt to change the character of the silver in use; the large money will have been <name type="place">Athenian</name> tetradrachms, the small silver being produced by the individual cities. A notable instance is Abydus itself which issued coins weighing 2.55-3.30 grams as well as a few of larger and smaller denomination. Since the names of 28 magistrates are known it must have been a considerable coinage.<ref target="#CH2-n44">44</ref> The common denomination is generally called "Persic tetrobol."</p>
            <pb n="46"/>
            <p>I am not sure that the valiant effort of numismatists to give a name to every standard that they find has contributed as much light as they have evidently intended. The theoretical weight of the Persic tetrobol is given by <name type="pname">Hill</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref> as 3.73-3.74 grams. The difference from the Abydus type is considerable, and the title does not help to explain why the lighter coins were used at Abydus. It certainly cannot have been because the Persian is of the same weight as the "Persic drachm." For one thing, the sigloi were by no means of outstanding importance in the currency of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>; for another, if she had wanted to connect her currency to the sigloi Abydus would have struck "Persic drachms" which she did not. She struck <hi rend="sup">2</hi>/<hi rend="sub">3</hi> drachmas which was surely inventing unnecessary trouble if there was anything "Persic" in her intent. The conspicuous thing about the coins of Abydus is that they are not easily related to any adjacent currency of importance unless that of Mytilene can be considered adjacent. Mytilene also struck "Persic" weights, though with a larger proportion of didrachms and fewer tetrobols. Otherwise Abydus was isolated.<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref> The neighboring town of Lampsacus struck still smaller silver (obols, diobols and tetrobols) on what is generally supposed to be the Rhodian standard, with a theoretical drachma of 3.72-3.88 grams.</p>
            <p>The Rhodian standard had more adherents than the Persic in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, according to the received opinion, but the fact is that we need a great deal more data before any safe conclusion can be reached. And even after the weighing and counting has been carefully done it is not likely that any pattern

will emerge which would be tolerable to modern ideas.<ref target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> The towns issued their own small change for local use with little or no regard to the practice of their neighbors. When different currencies were dealt with it must have been by calculation or by convention.<ref target="#CH2-n48">48</ref> It would seem that here was an excellent occasion for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> to confer the benefit of a standard currency on a district so broken into little monetary districts. If the opportunity occurred to him he was too busy with more immediate duties to act upon it. Between the spring of 334 and the spring of 333 he occupied, either peaceably or by force, a great many small towns and a number of cities of importance: <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardes</name>, <name type="place">Ephesus</name>, <name type="place">Magnesia</name>, Colophon, <name type="place">Miletus</name>, <name type="place">Phaselis</name>, <name type="place">Aspendus</name> and Side. In no case is there any sign of his using their mints to strike his own types (Map 1) <ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> Doubtless he made
<pb n="48"/>
use of what local currency was available; contributions from the cities would have come to him in their own coin or from such stores of gold and electrum as they had accumulated. It is generally assumed that he collected the taxes that had been paid to the Persians from the satrapies; this is specially attested for <name type="place">Hellespont</name>ine Phrygia and the Aeolian and Ionian cities and there is nothing to suggest that the practice was not regularly followed.<ref target="#CH2-n50">50</ref> In the case of Priene which surrendered voluntarily there is explicit evidence of remission of taxes<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> and in the case of Ephesus, where there had been rioting and danger of civil war, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> directed that they should contribute such taxes as they had paid to the Persians to rebuilding the temple of Artemis, which had burned down.<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> Both exceptions show that he was not in desperate need of money. I do not know the basis of Tarn's dictum "till after Issus he was in financial straits and the taxes from the king's land were his only source of revenue."<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> The case of Ephesus is particularly interesting because that was the one mint city which fell into his hands north of the Taurus which seems to have had at the time an output of large silver (in this instance Rhodian tetradrachms) sufficiently great to suggest it as a possible producer of tetradrachms of his own. The other cities which he controlled were striking small denominations or in small amounts.</p>
            <p>But when he reached <name type="place">Tarsus</name> in the spring of 333 he found a place which was altogether suitable for the establishment of a royal mint and this was the first to be added to those which his father had used. The early Alexandrian coinage of <name type="place">Tarsus</name> has been so thoroughly studied by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n54">54</ref> that there is no necessity
<pb n="49"/>
of doing more than recapitulate the essentials. <name type="place">Tarsus</name> under the Persians had become the capital of the district of <name type="place">Cilicia</name> and North <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>. It had been the residence of satraps, the latest of whom was Mazaeus, who ruled for their master but issued large quantities of silver coins which were not the royal sigloi but double shekels with a theoretical weight of 11.2 grams, bearing <name type="place">Cilicia</name>n types and, more remarkable still, the satraps' names (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 1). There was evidently a convenient near-by supply of silver sufficient to take care of the military and administrative expenses. The obverse type was a seated Baal which needed but little modification to become the seated <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> reverse, and the extreme similarity of the two figures produced at <name type="place">Tarsus</name> shows that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coins followed those of his predecessor immediately and employed the same die-sinker (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 2). Of course the size of the flan was increased since the tetradrachms were 6 grams heavier, but <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> was not noticeably larger than Baal had been. The head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> now replaced the lion and bull and city walls of Mazaeus' reverse and thereby eliminated anything to identify the mint, for, like the products of Pella and <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>, these were to be imperial coins showing no special mark of their origin. Indeed the first issues bore not even the sign of a responsible official, or only an inconspicuous pellet between the seat and the cross-bars of the throne. At the same time, or shortly thereafter, a series of gold was initiated. Since the satraps had not struck gold and there seems to have been no easily accessible supply of the metal it may be that the staters appeared only after Issus with the capture of Darius' money which he had left at Damascus. Doubtless much of it was gold which could be melted down and restruck; Curtius says that the coined money amounted to 2600 talents.<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of course it would not be necessary to restrike the Persian money and we cannot prove that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> did. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> at one time was inclined to think that <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>tic currency was the core of what <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had to use. <hi rend="sup">"</hi> At the time of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> invasion of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>," he says,<ref target="#CH2-n56">56</ref> "the currency of the East consisted, in the main, of Persian gold darics and silver sigloi and <name type="place">Athenian</name> tetradrachms. Two of these—the gold darics and the <name type="place">Athenian</name> tetradrachms—had for the last hundred and fifty years enjoyed a world-wide circulation and were well known to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> soldiers. It is probable, therefore, that during his campaigns, from the battle of the Granicus to the invasion of India, for the pay of his troops he relied principally upon the fabulous hoards of wealth which had been stored away by the Persian monarchs and which now fell into his hands." He assumes without discussion and, I think, mistakenly that a large part of the Persian treasure would have been coined money. It is questionable how far
<pb n="50"/>
this point of view is justified at the time with which we are now dealing. There is, as we shall see, evidence that he used Persian money later on, and he was willing to have earlier types continue to circulate under certain conditions; we have just seen that he probably was content to use the local issues of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> at least as supplements to his own. But there was a period of two or three years after his occupation of <name type="place">Tarsus</name> notable for the opening of new mints to produce his money. Between the summer of 333 and 330 fall the first issues of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, Alexandria-by-Issus,<ref target="#CH2-n57">57</ref> the cities of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n58">58</ref> Aradus,<ref target="#CH2-n59">59</ref> Byblus,<ref target="#CH2-n60">60</ref>

               <name type="place">Ake</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n62">62</ref> as well as Sardes,<ref target="#CH2-n63">63</ref> Damascus<ref target="#CH2-n64">64</ref> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n65">65</ref> (Map 2). It seems very unlikely that so remarkable a concentration should not have had as its purpose the wholesale replacement of the Persian royal coinage by the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> imperial.</p>
            <p>Here we come dangerously close to those discussions of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> psychology and intent which fascinate the participants without always convincing the observers. So far as our evidence goes, the decision what coins to strike, when and where was <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> alone, just as the pseudo-Aristotelian <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> says it should be. The anonymous author knows that the king cannot do everything
<pb n="51"/>
single-handed. He understands the functions that should be left to the satraps and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, who retained the Persian organization just as far as he could,<ref target="#CH2-n66">66</ref> had his own satraps—so called even when they were <name type="place">Macedonians</name> —and we hear a good deal about their powers and duties.There were special officers in charge of finance, which was the most conspicuous difference between the old administration and the new. Berve has pointed out that in the early days of the invasion the central royal treasury and the war treasury were one<ref target="#CH2-n67">67</ref> and the finance officers were imperial and not local officials. On the most prominent of them, Harpalus, we have much information from excellent sources, which Berve has fully recorded,<ref target="#CH2-n68">68</ref> but nowhere is there the slightest indication that his powers and responsibilities extended to the mint. It is difficult for us to imagine that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> should direct so detailed an operation, especially when it had to be done from a distance, and obviously someone must have supplied him with the information on which the decisions were based. But the modern system of delegation of duties did not present itself to antiquity as self-evidently the best way of dealing with complicated affairs.<ref target="#CH2-n69">69</ref> Pliny's correspondence with Trajan shows what surprisingly minor details could be properly brought to the attention of the sovereign, and the scraps that are left of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> correspondence suggest that it would have showed the same kind of picture.<ref target="#CH2-n70">70</ref> If, then, we conclude that arrangements for minting were <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own business (as we must do in default of evidence to the contrary) can we discover anything about his motives without getting involved in historical fiction?</p>
            <pb n="52"/>
            <p>Of course there is no need to prove that he had to have money; the central question is why did he have to have money with his own types? <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>, after suggesting that he might have got along with what was already in circulation, adds<ref target="#CH2-n71">71</ref> "Even so, it seems but natural that he would issue coins bearing his own name and types to take the place, as soon as possible, of a coinage belonging to a fast vanishing dynasty and empire." Was this replacement to be effected by having all the new money Alexandrine while the old issues wore out or were melted down or buried by private owners? Or was the old currency called in by the government and melted down to be reissued as the new money? There is evidence of the latter procedure at an earlier period. The satraps Pharnabazus and Datames seem to have melted down the silver of their predecessor Tiribazus to issue their own coins.<ref target="#CH2-n72">72</ref> There is no way of telling certainly whether <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> did the same thing but in any case the new money was to be his. In the cases of <name type="place">Tarsus</name> and Myriandrus, the metropoleis of <name type="place">Cilicia</name> and North <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, this meant putting an end to issues in the name of the Persian satrap Mazaeus and replacing them by the silver of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, supplemented, in the case of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, by gold also. This needs no elaborate explanation. Whether or not the Persian empire was "fast vanishing" its control over this district was at an end.</p>
            <p>But not all the cases were as simple as this. Perhaps the next mint to begin operations for the conqueror was Aradus which was ruled by a king named Gerostratus whose son Straton met <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> on his march south along the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>n coast and surrendered the city to him.<ref target="#CH2-n73">73</ref> Now Aradus had its own coinage whose types were purely local and had nothing to do with the Persians. The fleet of Gerostratus formed a contingent of the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> navy at the siege of Tyre,<ref target="#CH2-n74">74</ref> and there would have been nothing surprising in that service being rewarded by the continuance of the right of coinage. But Aradus at once began to strike tedradrachms with the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> and seated <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name>, like those of <name type="place">Tarsus</name> and Myriandrus with one notable difference: their origin is clearly marked, first by the Aramaic letters used on the autonomous coins, then by an <hi rend="bold">A</hi> and finally by the monogram <hi rend="bold">A.<ref target="#CH2-n75">75</ref>
               </hi> A similar course was taken by <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> whose king, another Straton, surrendered reluctantly and was therefore replaced.<ref target="#CH2-n76">76</ref> Thereupon the double shekels, some of which had been issued by the king, some by the satrap Mazaeus, appeared no more, being replaced by
<pb n="53"/>
               <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> tetradrachms and staters which at first bore the town's Aramaic initial, later Σ or Σl,<ref target="#CH2-n77">77</ref> Slightly different is the case of Byblus, for there Ainel (whom Arrian calls Enylos)<ref target="#CH2-n78">78</ref> having delivered the city and joined <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> fleet, as did the king of Aradus, was rewarded—if it was a reward—by having the first two letters of his name <graphic url="NS11_sym9.jpg"/> used on the tetradrachms instead of the name of the city, and the later issues bear the monogram <graphic url="NS11_sym10.jpg"/> for his successor Adramelek. Now these three cities all had coinages of their own and there was nothing to prevent <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> from allowing them to continue now that they were his allies, as he had apparently done with the coinages north of the Taurus. To be sure, the double shekels of Mazaeus from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> would need to be replaced as had his shekels from <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, but no objection of that sort could be made to the emissions of Aradus and Byblus.</p>
            <p>Similar treatment was accorded to the kings of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>. They had not been as prompt to surrender as the mainlanders, but they joined him with their fleets at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> and he was willing to forgive their previous service to the Persians as presumably enforced.<ref target="#CH2-n79">79</ref> They also joined the producers of Alexandrine tetradrachms and those from Citium are clearly identified by the monogram "K. <name type="place">Salamis</name>, however, used first a bow, then a rudder as symbol on its silver and only the bronze is unmistakably marked ΣΑ. Paphos also, which may have begun a little later prefers her characteristic device of a dove to a literal identification.<ref target="#CH2-n80">80</ref> About these emissions <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> uses what seems to me strange language. On the mainland, he says, "every city which had thrown open its gates without a struggle to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was accorded local autonomy, and, where a mint had previously existed, was allowed to continue coining; with the proviso, however, that the issues should henceforth conform in types, weights, and denominations with the regular coinage of the empire. As a result, such cities as Aradus, Byblus, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> and <name type="place">Ake</name> coined as they never had before, even in their most prosperous days.—It would therefore be strange if, in return for their submission and the invaluable services of their fleets, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> should have deprived the kings of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name> of the immemorial right of coinage, or even have curtailed it in any vital way."<ref target="#CH2-n81">81</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s mind at the moment was on identification and not explanation or he could hardly have written in that way. Can there be any more vital curtailment imagined of the right of coinage of the
<pb n="54"/>
king of Citium than that he should have to discontinue his own currency to produce silver with alien types and the name <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> on which only the monogram of his city suggested that he had anything to do with the affair?<ref target="#CH2-n82">82</ref> Is it not obvious that the Cypriote kings and the <name type="place">Phoenician</name> kings were not "allowed" to continue coining but directed to continue? We are told that "Arados, <name type="place">Byblos</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> and <name type="place">Ake</name> coined as they never had before" and this is certainly true.<ref target="#CH2-n83">83</ref> Where did all the metal come from, not only the greatly increased output of silver but the gold of <name type="place">Tarsus</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> and <name type="place">Ake</name>?</p>
            <p>The necessary explanation seems to me to be that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, knowing that there was a vitally important campaign before him, required much money—his own money—and used every available source of supply. If it be asked why he should now make such efforts to provide his own money when he had opened no new mints in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, there are likely answers at hand. For one thing the mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> was continuing to pour her abundant production across the straits so that her gold was replacing the gold and electrum of the other continent and her tetradrachms were providing a major denomination in that metal. For another, north of the Taurus <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was to some extent among friends. Whatever the realities behind the professed purpose of freeing the Greek cities, he had come there as the leader of a Greek League as well as a king of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</name>; the Greek cities understood his position and in the majority of cases were willing to accept it. He had driven the <name type="place">Persians</name> out of the country and though they still had friends there, there was no prospect of their combining to make head against him. If the Greek coins of the cities circulated as a minor supplement to the Greek coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> it was not likely that any harm would come of it and no harm did. But south of the Taurus he was in alien territory. He had not come there to free anybody but to conquer. The Cilicians, the Syrians and the <name type="place">Phoenicians</name> had no reason for prejudice in his favor; if he was to be as acceptable as the king of the <name type="place">Persians</name> he must make his place.
<pb n="55"/>
               <name type="place">Tarsus</name> and the cities that received him after Issus were acknowledging what they thought to be the greater power. Tyre and Gaza held the contrary view and were destroyed for their mistake. It was vital to him that he be recognized as the master in all parts of his new territory and therefore all the mints were set to work to manufacture one of the most effective kinds of manifesto known to antiquity: his name and types on the coins. This was done quite without regard for the normal financial needs of the district; the much increased activity of the coast mints did not mean a sudden era of prosperity and commercial activity. It was their contribution to the conqueror's needs, and since no new mines were being opened it is only reasonable to assume that the necessary extra bullion came from the melting down of the king's treasure. There was no overstriking involved, the weights of both gold and silver pieces in previous use being different from the weights by which they were supplanted. We shall therefore never have the kind of proof that comes from detecting an earlier type beneath the later ones. None the less, we have sufficient reason for believing that in the period succeeding the battle of Issus <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> did not intend to continue the local coinages of the district but to replace them with his own, and one probable means to take would be to melt down and restrike.<hi rend="sup">83a</hi> We must guard against supposing that too complete a revolution was achieved. In the first place, the pre-Alexandrine coins did not all disappear. In the hoard from Galilee buried about 319/8<ref target="#CH2-n84">84</ref> and one found at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</name> buried about a decade later<ref target="#CH2-n85">85</ref> double shekels of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> accompanied the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> tetradrachms.<ref target="#CH2-n86">86</ref> Later events showed that there was still a place for the earlier series (below, p. 78). Then, <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> production south of the Taurus by no means made the country independent of coins from the north. In the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard there were 1582 pieces from the mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>, 1526 from the mints of <name type="place">Tarsus, Myriandrus</name>, the cities of <name type="place">Cyprus, Aradus, Byblus, Sidon</name> and <name type="place">Ake</name> all combined. And the situation is even more impressive than this appears for a much higher proportion of the coins of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> were struck during <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> lifetime than is the case with the southern mints.<ref target="#CH2-n87">87</ref> Before Gaugamela, then, there would probably have been more <name type="place">Macedonian</name>

to be seen in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> than Syrian and Cilician ones.

                  <name type="place">Demanhur</name>,</hi> however, he dates the first series of silver <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 332-330; that is he believed that the mint was organized soon after the capture of the city by <name type="pname">Parmenio</name> following the victory of Issus. That would mean that <name type="pname">Parmenio's</name> action was not a mere raid to get the king's baggage, but an occupation of a vital point protecting <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> flank and broadening his territory, as did the campaign in Antilebanon during the siege of Tyre. This is likely enough in itself, though no ancient author discusses it. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> was a new step since it had never had a mint;<ref target="#CH2-n89">89</ref> doubtless artisans were brought there from the coast. The complicated marks with pellets, which are hard to reduce to a system, may be evidence of a factory not yet well organized. The mint is clearly marked with the letters ΔΑ, to which later series add the city's device of the forepart of a ram. It is not easy to find a consistent policy in the use or omission of mint marks. Apparently the greatest mints: <name type="pname" corresp="#pleiades_491688">Pella</name>, <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>, <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name> dispense with them, but by no means all the lesser ones invariably use them and <name type="pname">Newell's</name> feeling that the difference was between imperial and local issues is hard to support. Here, as so often in ancient numismatics, one finds a general conformity without absolute uniformity which is distressing to what one likes to think of as the tidier minds of our day.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> would seem an obvious place for the minting of <name type="place">Persian</name> coins and indeed <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> says it "had probably possessed a mint under the <name type="place">Persian</name> kings,"<ref target="#CH2-n90">90</ref> but there is no proof of it. <name type="place">Babelon's</name> great work <hi rend="italic">Les Perses achéménides</hi> does not raise the question at all and <name type="pname">Hill</name>, after discussing the difficulties of chronological arrangement, adds,<ref target="#CH2-n91">91</ref> "Nor does it seem possible to make any attempt to identify the mints at which coins were struck until the very difficult problem of the mints of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage in the East has been more or less cleared up." So we do not know whether this is a case of adaptation, like <name type="place">Tarsus</name> or, of original creation, like <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>. In either case the city which was intended to be the capital of the whole empire began to contribute its share

of the conqueror's money, presumably as soon as possible after its surrender. The coins were long in being recognized precisely because there was no recognizable mint mark. An article of Six in 1884 pointed the way,<ref target="#CH2-n92">92</ref> to be followed by a thorough demonstration by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name> eleven years later.<ref target="#CH2-n93">93</ref> The attribution was indignantly rejected by Sir <name type="pname">Henry Howorth</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n94">94</ref> and many who did not rush into print must have shared his dismay in the shaking of the system of mint identification which <name type="pname">Müller</name> had so conveniently constructed, but the evidence was against <name type="place">Howorth</name> and no one doubts any more. His insistence that a symbol or monogram should have reference to the place of minting was in the old tradition and was mistaken, and yet his dissatisfaction was not without reason, for the matter was more complex than the location of a new place of origin for the gold and silver with <name type="place">Macedonian</name> types. The fact is that the great victory at Gaugamela opened a new epoch whose nature is partly expressed in unprecedented developments of the coinage.</p>
            <p>The first step was not revolutionary and it may, indeed, have preceded the occupation of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. It was the opening of a new mint in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> at Sardes (Map 1).<ref target="#CH2-n95">95</ref> There is doubtful evidence that the city may have coined for the <name type="place">Persians</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n96">96</ref> but it was not issuing any local types. There is no reason why it should not have been used by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> at any moment after its capture in 334 but, as we have seen, there was at that time no attempt to supplement the emission of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> for use in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>. Why the situation should have changed by 331 we cannot say, but there is one important difference between the function of Sardes and that of the earlier <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>tic mints. She was used not so much for tetradrachms, which had been the principal product of the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> and southern cities, as for gold and drachmae. In this she was a pattern for the other towns of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> presently to be put into operation: <name type="place">Magnesia</name> (330), Lampsacus (329), Abydus, Colophon and <name type="place">Miletus</name> (325), <name type="place">Teos</name> (324). A reason for this which comes to mind at once is that the pre-Alexandrine coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> had been to a large extent gold, or electrum, and small silver.
<pb n="58"/>
Presumably, therefore, the country liked and would use small silver. But there would be an advantage in having all the small silver on a single standard, and this may have been a belated provision of uniformity in place of the pre-existing confusion.<ref target="#CH2-n97">97</ref> Presumably the gold was intended to fill the void caused by the disappearance of the gold of Lampsacus and the electrum of <name type="place">Cyzicus</name>, <name type="place">Phocaea and Mytilene</name>, and the metal which used to go into those types was now diverted to the seven towns to be made into <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> staters (above p. 45). There can be no doubt that there was a plan for the special use of these towns, but again we find a very general plan with unexplained eccentricities of the individual mints such as might have resulted from decisions made by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> one at a time but such as could hardly have resulted from any laying out of the plan in detail at the beginning. It is quite out of the question, however, that this pattern can have been achieved by accident through the independent action of the cities themselves, or that they should have acted in concert without reference to the sovereign whose types they proposed to strike. An eighth city, Ephesus, was added to the group later—probably after 294—and a few other places made minor contributions of drachmae in the 3rd century. The omission of Ephesus from the original list was doubtless the result of the confusion at the time of her capture which may have crippled her for some time to come.<ref target="#CH2-n98">98</ref> Not only was the supply of drachmae adequate for <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> lifetime but, the fashion having once been set, the mints of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> continued to be the source of most of the drachmae throughout the empire into the latter half of the 3rd century. What was the proportionate manufacture of gold we do not yet know enough to say.<ref target="#CH2-n99">99</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A second innovation was more radical. It was the opening of a mint at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</name> for tetradrachms, staters, and a surprising number of distaters (Map 1).<ref target="#CH2-n100">100</ref> There is good reason to believe that it began operations in 330/29. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> said "about 330 <hi rend="smallcaps">

The lower limit is provided by the burial date of the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard in which specimens of all the varieties of tetradrachms were found. But the group cannot have lasted so long. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</name> was allied with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> against <name type="pname">Antipater</name> in the Lamian War of 323/2 and cannot at that time have been striking royal <name type="place">Macedonian</name>

types.<ref target="#CH2-n102">102</ref> The last issue may have been coined in 323 before the beginning of the war but that is the latest possible date. Now there is evidence of 8 issues<ref target="#CH2-n103">103</ref> if one makes the usual assumption that each variety of symbol means the product of a single year. That would bring the beginning to 330/29, which would satisfy historical probability very well. For the purpose of the establishment of the mint is clear: it was to assist in the hiring of Peloponnesian mercenaries. In the fall of 334, between the beginning of the siege of <name type="place">Halicarnassus</name> and the campaign in <name type="place">Lycia</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had sent Cleander to the <name type="place">Peloponnesus</name> to collect soldiers.<ref target="#CH2-n104">104</ref> In his mention of the matter Curtius says "Cleandro cum pecunia misso." The nearest <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>an supply of money would be <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> and it was better to send the necessary funds with Cleander. But if there had to be a shipment of coin from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> whenever Greek mercenaries were to be hired the system would be inconvenient. It would be much simpler if there were a mint nearby where money could be issued as it was needed. That should have been apparent as early as Cleander's first trip. But would not the opening of a royal mint in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> be a serious affront to the spirit, if not to the letter, of the agreement with the League of <name type="place">Corinth</name>? We have no information as to
<pb n="60"/>
any provision about coining by members of the League, but there is no evidence that there was any interference with that ancient right of the cities. The large series of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, of <name type="place">Corinth</name> and of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</name> show no sign of intermission at this time, and we have one sure instance of a city initiating an autonomous coinage in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> lifetime: the Amphictionic staters and fractions of Delphi which were struck from about 337 to 334 for the rebuilding of the temple.<ref target="#CH2-n105">105</ref> In time <name type="place">Macedonian</name> coins did find their way into the Greek cities<ref target="#CH2-n106">106</ref> but not because there was any effort, at this early period, of the <name type="place">Macedonians</name> to replace civic issues by royal ones. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> might well have hesitated to set up his own mint in the territory of his Greek allies. But consideration for his Greek allies certainly waned as his phenomenal successes gave him less and less need for relying on their good will. After Gaugamela things might be done that would not have been done in 334. Moreover there was a consideration which was more than sentimental. Anti-<name type="place">Macedonian</name> sentiment was centered in Sparta whose strength was so considerable that Agis took the offensive in 331 and pressed <name type="pname">Antipater</name> hard until, in the fall of that year, the battle of Megalopolis crushed the Spartan power.<ref target="#CH2-n107">107</ref> After that there was no anti-<name type="place">Macedonian</name> force to resist an intrusion of royal power or to make the minting and storing of gold in the Péloponnèse an undesirable risk.</p>
            <p>The extension of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> activities into the territories of the free cities of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name>, if a new departure, was not a surprising one. The really extraordinary developments were connected with <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> itself. The career of the satrap Mazaeus may perhaps deserve a closer scrutiny than it generally gets.<ref target="#CH2-n108">108</ref> He became Satrap of <name type="place">Cilicia</name> about 361 and in this capacity he struck silver at <name type="place">Tarsus</name> with his name but without title.<ref target="#CH2-n109">109</ref> From 351-344 he was one of the commanders against the rebel king of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name>.

Hearing of the king's flight, however, Mazaeus broke off the engagement and led the remnants of his troops to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n117">117</ref> For 30 years he had been an important and—so far as the record shows—a loyal general and official of the Persian king, yet on the approach of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> he surrendered <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> without resistance. <name type="pname">Curtius</name> (V. 1. 17) makes it clear that the act was a very convenient one for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. "Gratus adventus eius regi fuit; quippe magni operis obsidio futura erat tarn munitae urbis." He took the precaution of marching his army in formation but it was unnecessary; the Babylonians made him welcome. Perhaps the town had been indefensible in spite of what <name type="pname">Curtius</name> says, perhaps it was clear to Mazaeus that his king could never make another stand. Yet it is hard to avoid the suspicion that the surrender had been bargained for and that there was a price involved. The suspicion is deepened when we find that Mazaeus was promptly appointed Satrap of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>—the first Persian to be given such a position. To Tarn<ref target="#CH2-n118">118</ref> this is an act of chivalry like the later treatment of Porus: "<name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was honoring a worthy opponent." But it is surely an extravagant gesture to put so great and rich a district into the hands of an enemy simply because he had been "a worthy opponent." To be sure, the compliment was not without safeguards. <name type="pname">Apollo-dorus</name> of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> was made commander of the troops left with Mazaeus and
<pb n="62"/>
Asclepiodorus was made collector of the taxes.<ref target="#CH2-n119">119</ref> There was a further unique aspect of the new satrap's position, however. He at once began to issue silver tetradrachms of the Attic standard (generally spoken of as staters) on one side of which was Baaltars, as the inscription showed, and on the other, a lion with the name of Mazaeus! (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 3).<ref target="#CH2-n120">120</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is this which most deeply shocked <name type="place">Howorth</name>. "Prima facie" he says, "it seems incredible that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> should have permitted one of his satraps, and that a <name type="place">Persian</name>...to issue coins in the satrap's own name." The Cilician Baal would be inappropriate to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, and the Aramaic inscriptions would be unintelligible to the Greeks, the only people who would use the coins.<ref target="#CH2-n121">121</ref>
               <name type="place">Howorth</name> was defending a doomed thesis, but more attention should have been paid to the facts against which he protested. Attempts to explain this unprecedented concession have been far from convincing. Six, who was the first to face the problem, could only urge that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, about to set out for the Far East "ne s'est pas, certainment, occupé des types ou des légends de monnaies destinées aux populations indigènes." But the idea that this was a trifle too slight to engage <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> attention is certainly untenable. At the very time that the lion staters were beginning to appear <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> joined the great cities of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> earlier conquest to produce his own types.<ref target="#CH2-n122">122</ref> He could have attended to one series if he could provide for the other. Some special reason must be found for this striking exception to the regular rule that satraps could not coin in their own names. Most of the historians, if they record the fact at all, do so without comment. Tarn<ref target="#CH2-n123">123</ref> and <name type="pname">Cohen</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n124">124</ref> avoid the central point: "he was the only satrap permitted to coin, doubtless for the convenience of the <name type="place">Babylonian</name> trade;" "pour aider À la renaissance du trafic (<name type="pname">Alexandre</name>) lui laisse le privilège de battre monnaie." Money issued at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> might well assist trade, but why <hi rend="italic">this</hi> money and why the name <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>? In his answer to <name type="place">Howorth</name>

               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name> gave the most thorough-going attempt at an explanation. "<name type="pname">Alexander's</name> efforts to make the utmost allowance for the oriental

point of view is well known. For the silver, the types of the Kilikian satrapal issues of <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>, Baaltars in the guise of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> and the lion were retained.—On the first silver issue struck at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>
               <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> continued not only the coin types of the Kilikian satrapy, but also, in accordance with the usual practice, their inscriptions, which records his own name and that of the god represented, the latter being intended to promulgate the figure of Baaltars still little known in the far east, i.e., the figure of that particular Baal of all the countless Baalim who had to be identified with the Greek <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> of contemporary imperial issues. Before the end of his short term of office (330-328) the satrap <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> appears to have been induced to give up these inscriptions, and from this date on until 306 the satrapal coins remain anepigraphic" (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 4). As to the types, <name type="pname">Hill</name> has an important amendment to offer.<ref target="#CH2-n126">126</ref> "The argument of most weight against the attribution to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> lies in the fact that the coins with the name of Mazeus attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> identify the god on the obverse as Baaltars, who would be unknown and unworshipped at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. The answer to this objection is that, although issued at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, this was a satrapal coinage intended chiefly for the payment of troops, many of whom may have been raised in <name type="place">Cilicia</name> by <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> and brought by him to the East." This does indeed propose a reason for the selection of types. But can it have been necessary to maintain a separate coinage for the convenience of a body of mercenaries? And if they demanded western types, why the lion alone (which was the type of <name type="place">Myriandrus</name>) instead of the familiar lion and bull or lion and deer of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>? And would it not be important to give them the double shekels to which they were accustomed instead of tetradrachms on the Attic standard used by the conqueror? <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> desire to conciliate the Orientals of which <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name> speaks is indeed a most important consideration. But surely it is characteristic of his policy from this point on and not of that which guided him before Gaugamela. Why otherwise the replacement of local issues by his own types? When all is said there is as yet no explanation of the satrap's name on the silver of his new office. But how much is explained by the hypothesis that the price of the bloodless surrender of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> was the confirming to <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> of his title and privileges ! When <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name> speaks of the "usual practice" of inscriptions accompanying the types he means, of course, the practice of the Persian satraps in <name type="place">Cilicia</name>. If <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> was allowed to continue that, then his position as Satrap of <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia under <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> would be equivalent to his position as Satrap of <name type="place">Cilicia</name> under Darius. But, whatever were his rights in the matter of coining in his earlier office, it is not likely that he now arrogated to himself that power of decision which the <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> restricts to the sovereign. The appointment of Asclepiodorus as collector of taxes shows that <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>'
<pb n="64"/>
function was not financial and we may be very sure that the number and kinds of coins to be struck were decided by higher authority than his. The phrase "the Satrap <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> appears to have been induced to give up these inscriptions" calls up an amusing picture of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> persuading and <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> magnanimously consenting.<ref target="#CH2-n127">127</ref> If the special privilege was ended before the satrap's death in 328 it is hardly likely to have been done in so courtly a fashion. The reason for suggesting it is that there are anepigraphic lion staters which seem to come so early in the series that <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name> would assign them to the first satrap. But that is not proven. The staters with <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>' name are very rare but <name type="place">Babelon</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n128">128</ref> publishes four varieties: with no symbol, with a wreath, with a serpent, with K. If they follow the normal Greek practice of a different symbol every year all the years of <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>' satrapy would be accounted for.</p>
            <p>Whatever the intent behind the origin of the lion staters, and their divisions, they did serve an economic function for they continued to be issued from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> into, and perhaps through, the reign of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I and, in lesser numbers, from Susa<ref target="#CH2-n129">129</ref> and Ecbatana<ref target="#CH2-n130">130</ref> in the same reign. This is not easy to account for. They were by then so much under weight for Attic tetradrachms that they must have been at a disadvantage compared with the full weight coins of Alexandrine type being struck at the same time. Yet, if this were intended for the convenience of a population accustomed to the use of sigloi, the fractions would have been made to fit the Persian system, which they do not. (Parenthetically it must be pointed out that we are by no means sure that the inhabitants of <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia did have any preference for sigloi).<ref target="#CH2-n131">131</ref> One is tempted to think of coins only locally valid where a discrepancy between face value and bullion value could be ignored by the sovereign, and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n132">132</ref> has very tentatively suggested a connection between the lion staters and the temple of Bel. He recognizes the difficulty created by the lion issues of Susa and Ecbatana and can only hazard a guess that "if the temple at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> could issue "temple money' so too, presumably, could the hardly less important and famous temples of Artemis-Nanaia at Susa and of Aene at Ecbatana." He cites the interesting

correspondence in fabric between the lion staters and the much later <name type="pname">Jewish</name> shekels of the First Revolt—also temple money. Though I have nothing better to suggest, I cannot believe that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s hypothesis is defensible. It is true that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> made his offerings to Bel-Marduk and directed the reconstruction of his temple<ref target="#CH2-n133">133</ref> but there cannot have been any intended connection between that act and the first lion staters on which the god is specifically named not <name type="pname">Marduk</name> but Baaltars. One must suppose either that the <name type="place">Babylonian</name>s could not read the inscription (which is likely enough) or that the correspondence was not thought of until the appearance of the anepigraphic staters. It is true that Baaltars and <name type="pname">Marduk</name> were of sufficiently similar nature so that the seated god could be taken for either one of them. But that is patently not true of Artemis-Nanaia of Susa or Aene-Anaitis-Nanea of Ecbatana. And if the basis of the lion staters' success had been real religious association it is surprising that it should have disappeared so quickly. Only in <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> can they have possibly lasted beyond the reign of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I and there only until 275 at the latest, when Antiochus moved the inhabitants to Seleucia.<ref target="#CH2-n134">134</ref> The theory of a limited circulation is further complicated by their appearance in the <name type="pname">Oxus Hoard</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n135">135</ref> I cannot solve the enigma but, at the moment, the point of importance is that the length of life of the experimental currency was enough to make it plain that it was acceptable to the community and it is only fair to suppose that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> had reasonable grounds for supposing that it would be acceptable.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> is not the only satrap to turn up on coins in <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia, but the second instance has to do with a very different class of coins: the imitation of <name type="place">Athenian</name> owls. At the end of the 5th century it could be said that the owls of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> were the international currency par excellence, and even down to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time they held their place as one of the principal elements of the currency of the East, though now they were joined by satrapal silver and that of the cities of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>n coast.<ref target="#CH2-n136">136</ref> The appearance of these latter issues begins at the time of the <name type="place">Peloponnesian</name> war when the supply of owls was much reduced and they are accompanied by a growing number of imitations of <name type="place">Athenian</name> coins. Early hoards, such as those of Caboul and Malayer published by Schlumberger, show a surprising number of 5th century owls, about equal to the coins of all the other cities together, but the 4th century owls do not seem to be included. Instead, one gets imitations.<ref target="#CH2-n137">137</ref> Now one kind of imitation,
<pb n="66"/>
said to amount to a "very large group" is the type of owl bearing in Aramaic the name of Mazaces, whose provenance is consistently <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

After Issus Mazaces had been sent as Persian satrap to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> where he kept order until the arrival of the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> army, and where he issued tetradrachms with <name type="place">Athenian</name> types and bronzes with the head of a satrap and a galley, both classes bearing his name in Aramaic.<ref target="#CH2-n139">139</ref> Being too weak to resist, he received <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> in friendly fashion into the country and the cities,<ref target="#CH2-n140">140</ref> handing over 800 talents and the royal furniture.<ref target="#CH2-n141">141</ref> Berve thinks it likely that he found a place at <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> court<ref target="#CH2-n142">142</ref> but the sources have nothing more to say about him. The evidence for his connection with <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia is purely numismatic, as to which <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> says, "Our coins do suggest that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had entrusted to Mazaces the governorship of some important city or district as a reward for his ready surrender of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>." His owls then would be an exact parallel to <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>' lion staters except that we do not know what position Mazaces could have held which would entitle him to this distinction. Nor do we know the location of the mint. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> gives good reasons for not putting it at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, yet he can only suggest Uruk or Opis, neither of which has any special claim to consideration. Yet if there are many things puzzling about these coins their purpose is more evident than that of <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>' issues. They can hardly have been intended primarily for use in <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia, even though they turn up there. The imperial mint was producing <name type="place">Macedonian</name> tetradrachms and lion staters as well, and that surely ought to have satisfied the demand. But if one wanted to mint silver for general circulation in the East imitation owls would be the obvious thing to strike. Of course, this cannot have been a private venture of Mazaces. It must have been part of a plan that had imperial approval and prima facie the plan was to supply familiar types for use in the East.</p>
            <p>But these two classes of silver were not the only innovation connected with the capture of <name type="pname">Babylonia</name>. "Demanding explanation also" says <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>, "is the fact that for many years double and (more rarely) single gold darics of Achae-minid type were coined alongside the Hon staters. These gold coins seem, almost

invariably, to turn up in eastern Iran and Bactria and not in <name type="pname">Babylonia</name>. But as most of the specimens of which we possess any record at all have come from the single great 'Treasure of the Oxus,' this seeming fact may be illusory. That both double darics and Hon staters were mostly coined at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> is certain."<ref target="#CH2-n143">143</ref> The double darics "which everybody admits to be of the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Great"<ref target="#CH2-n144">144</ref> are at once distinguishable from earlier <name type="place">Persian</name> gold by their appearance (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 6). Though the conventional figure of the king in kneeling or running position is preserved, the face, with its straight nose, is a Hellenized version of the Persian monarch. The relief is higher and the incuse on the reverse, instead of being an amorphous depression, is filled with wavy lines or curves that tend to form a pattern (cf. <hi rend="italic">BMC <name type="place">Arabia</name>,</hi> Pl. XX, 1-13). Moreover, most of the specimens have Greek letters or monograms on the obverse. There are no double darics which do not have some or all of these characteristics and none, therefore, which can be assigned to an earlier period. That is, this higher denomination is an invention of the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. What is the unit to which it belongs—the rarer single gold daric? There are few darics with letters or monograms like those of the doubles<ref target="#CH2-n145">145</ref> and none with quite the same wavy patterns on the reverse. There are, however, some which show a similar pattern and which also have high relief and a Hellenized portrait <hi rend="italic">(BMC <name type="place">Arabia</name>,</hi> Pl. XXV, 21-25). As to these, <name type="pname">Hill</name> is cautious. He calls attention to the likeness of the two denominations, but catalogues the darics with the <name type="place">Persian</name> Empire instead of with the Alexandrine Empire of the East. They must, he says "belong to the last <name type="place">Persian</name> king, <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n146">146</ref> and in the catalogue they appear under the caption '<name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</name>' <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>." There are a few sigloi like them. Only one is illustrated (Pl. XXV, 26) but it certainly shows a portrait unlike the earlier sigloi. Hill's arrangement would mean that under <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</name> there was a marked artistic change in the coins issued at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> affecting both darics and sigloi, and that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> used and developed the new style in the same city for the making of a denomination of his own, the double daric, though he did not strike either single darics or sigloi. The sudden appearance of a Greek profile on coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</name> is possible but surprising,
<pb n="68"/>
and the suggestion might be ventured as an alternative that these darics and sigloi are also coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> but from a different mint, which would explain their differences from the double darics.</p>
            <p>That these are indeed from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> is the general persuasion, but it can hardly be called proven. The piece with M in the field <hi rend="italic">(BMC,</hi> p. 176, no. 2) may be compared with the <name type="place">Babylonian</name>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> teradrachm with M <hi rend="italic">(<name type="place">Demanhur</name>,</hi> 3980); the combination M and Φ on the tetradrachms <hi rend="italic">(<name type="place">Demanhur</name>,</hi> 3983-4057) with <graphic url="NS11_sym11.jpg"/> ona double daric <hi rend="italic">(BMC,</hi> p. 177, no. 5). But Φ∧ or Φι are on both the gold which <name type="pname">Hill</name> labels "Usually attributed to the mint of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>" and that of which he says "The following are for the most part of ruder workmanship, and were perhaps made farther East than <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>." The idea that all these strange issues were the product of <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> is tempting<ref target="#CH2-n147">147</ref> but it will need more facts to make it a certainty.</p>
            <p>If there is general agreement on the fact of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> striking the double darics there is very little said about the reason for it. Unlike the lion staters these from beginning to end are on a different standard from the Attic and there must have been a particular reason for the premeditated confusion of two gold coins one of which was not quite twice the weight of the other. It seems inescapable that the invention of the double daric rests on the intention to use the daric, and perhaps the darics which <name type="pname">Hill</name> assigns to Darius III are actually the units of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. But there were others available. Diodorus says that the capture of Susa brought in 40,000 talents of uncoined gold and silver and 9,000 talents of darics; that of Persepolis, 120,000 talents reckoning the gold at its value in silver.<ref target="#CH2-n148">148</ref> We have seen reason to believe that the treasure captured at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>

was melted down and reissued with <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own types, but we do not find the same conditions here. There is no activity in local mints. Indeed, it is a fact of the greatest importance that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no mint for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> coins in the East except <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. The map will show the surprising lack of proportion which multiplies the western mints and leaves nothing but <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> to supply the funds for the long and costly campaign east of the two rivers (Map 3). The army cannot have been without coin. Even though they were going into country where an economy of barter may have prevailed widely, the Greek and <name type="place">Macedonian</name> soldiery cannot have been induced to forego their accustomed pay from the summer of 330 to that of 325. Yet the record, which contains two mutinies, has no suggestion of the kind of difficulty about pay so common with ancient armies. The cancellation of debts which followed the marriages at Susa<ref target="#CH2-n149">149</ref> was, to be sure, a phenomenon of the return to familiar civilization, but how did the army incur debts of 20,000 talents if they had been operating on payments in kind? The reorganization which provided for "ten stater men" between the ordinary soldiers and the "double pay men" is reported<ref target="#CH2-n150">150</ref> without any intimation that pay was being reintroduced. If <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had founded his eastern cities (particularly the military colonies)<ref target="#CH2-n151">151</ref> without money could the Greek historians possibly have avoided comment on it? There is no escape from the fact that the army must have had money in the East and the necessary conclusion seems to be that it was transported from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, the nearest source. But that surely presents an enormous problem of transport. The system of the Seleucids is enlightening. They had mints certainly at Susa, Persepolis, Ecbatana and Bactra, with another which may have been at Hecatompylus or Artacoana, and the contents of the <name type="pname">Oxus Hoard</name> show that the mint of Bactra supplied the needs of that district as it was intended to do.<ref target="#CH2-n152">152</ref> Why should <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> rely on so remote a city as <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> which, moreover, had its own important district to serve (Map 3)?</p>

            <p>But did he? It is instructive to look at what happened to the treasure from <name type="place">Susa</name> and <name type="place">Persepolis</name>. The bulk of it was so great that <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name> says<ref target="#CH2-n153">153</ref> it required 10,000 pairs of mules and 5,000 camels to move it. <name type="pname">Curtius</name> says<ref target="#CH2-n154">154</ref> that the baggage and a large part of the army was left at <name type="place">Persepolis</name> in charge of <name type="pname">Parmenio</name> and Craterus. But it was not to stay there. We know from Arrian<ref target="#CH2-n155">155</ref> that <name type="pname">Parmenio</name> was ordered to take the treasure to the citadel in Ecbatana and deliver it to Harpalus who had a guard of 6,000 <name type="place">Macedonians</name> plus a few auxiliary troops. The mention of Harpalus is puzzling. We do not know how or when he got to Ecbatana or why or when he left to return to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. Moreover, in the next section Arrian tells us that Cleitus, who had been left sick in <name type="place">Susa</name>, was ordered to proceed to <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>, take the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> guard of the treasure and march against the Parthyaeans. Then who was left to guard the treasure? Something has certainly dropped out of the account. Fortunately we know the main fact. At the time of <name type="pname">Parmenio</name>'s execution in the fall of 330 he was Satrap of Media and guardian of the king's treasure whose total Diodorus gives as 180,000 talents;<ref target="#CH2-n156">156</ref>
               <name type="pname">Justin</name> says 190,000.<ref target="#CH2-n157">157</ref> Clearly this was <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> capital for the financing of the campaign in <name type="place">Afghanistan</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>. But it was not taken to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> at all. Now it has been suggested what Harpalus was doing
<pb n="72"/>
in <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>: he was supervising the coining of the Persian treasure.<ref target="#CH2-n158">158</ref> This is on the theory that Harpalus, as treasurer, had control over minting, which there is nothing to support. But there is a more serious difficulty than the theoretical one. If Harpalus put 180,000 talents into coins what are they? In discussing the Seleucid mint of <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> says,<ref target="#CH2-n159">159</ref> 'There need be less surprise that a mint was opened by the Greeks at <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> than that the mint should have commenced to function so late. At least, the earliest coins of Alexandrine types that can be assigned confidently to <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> do not antedate the reign of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name>. There do exist a few earlier pieces which may have been coined there." But "a few pieces" will not solve our dilemma. From this enormous treasure must have come a series at least comparable in size to that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. But there is no such series. There are still small groups whose attribution is doubtful but the product of the great mints is known, and there is nothing left over to assign to <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>. Its output must have disappeared.</p>
            <p>Unless its output was darics. To prove that would need the assembly of much more evidence than is now available. The gold already published as presumably Alexandrine is not enough in bulk to fill the need. But I think no search for darics has ever been undertaken with this in mind. Such a search might prove disappointing, but the possibility ought to be kept open that the double darics "certainly from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>" were supplemented by others of more eastern appearance and by darics and sigloi whose place of origin may have been <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>. To the circumstantial evidence already cited one more item is to be added: the one experiment of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I in coining a double daric was at <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>
               <hi rend="italic">(ESM,</hi> p. 171, no. 460).</p>
            <p>Even this much proven would leave us with baffling questions. The problem of transport would not be solved. <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> is a couple of hundred miles nearer the eastern campaigns but it is still far enough in all conscience. There are several possibilities, none of them very comfortable. There may have been mints still further east which contributed their share to the expenses of the campaign. This would mean reducing still further the number that we could credit to <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>. There may have been other treasures containing coin in the East of which we have no record. Money already in circulation may have been confiscated and used for the army. Eastern cities, perhaps his own foundations, may have been used as advance treasuries for the accumulation of coin. Of course, if the treasure of <name type="place">Susa</name> and <name type="place">Persepolis</name> is involved at all in
<pb n="73"/>
the eastern campaigns the question of transport remains. Either bullion or coin must have been carried to the army and though bullion would have been less bulky it would have been just as heavy. But it would seem that the most inconvenient arrangement would be for the mint to forward its current production at frequent intervals, though presumably that is how the paymasters got their funds when mints were close by. For a big and remote army that would have meant keeping the transport trains on the road constantly with a large body of men of necessity detailed for guard duty. But obviously the conversion into coin of enough metal for a campaign of 5 years' duration could not be done quickly.</p>
            <p>The problem of silver is also very obscure. A natural assumption would be that if <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> minted darics it minted sigloi as well, but here there is a still smaller group <hi rend="italic">(BMC <name type="place">Arabia</name>,</hi> p. 160, nos. 88-91) which there is reason to attribute to the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. We know, on Schlumberger's showing, how slight was the importance of the siglos in the total currency of the <name type="place">Persian</name> empire. Still, in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time it had <hi rend="italic">some</hi> importance or no late ones would have been struck at all. But these few sigloi and the imitations of Mazaces are the only silver we have found so far which has the appearance of being designed for use in the East. Could that and the late darics and double darics have been sufficient for the need?</p>
            <p>This would be the place to give an account of the king's income and expenses if we could only do so with any confidence. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a summary calculation of income and expenses given by Beloch (IV. 1., pp. 41-43) in which the cost of the army is put at 7,000 talents a year. The uncertainty of the figures is illustrated by the eclectic confidence given to the sources. <name type="pname">Justin</name> XIII. 1. 9 gives specific figures for the time of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death: erant enim in thesauris L milia talentum et in annuo vectigali ac tributo tricena milia. The first sum is accepted, the second rejected on the grounds that Herodotus III. 90-95 gives the yearly tribute of <name type="pname">Darius I</name> as 14,560 talents (10,000 "ohne den indischen Tribut und die Naturalleistungen"), which is regarded as an exaggeration, while <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> at the height of his power in 315, when he controlled nearly all the <name type="place">Asiatic</name> satrapies, had an income of only 11,000 talents (Diodorus XIX. 56. 5). Beloch therefore reduces <name type="pname">Justin's</name> 30,000 talents to 15,000. Various extraordinary sums such as that for Hephaestion's funeral, and gifts to the army are accepted, but the total of 12,000 talents "contra decus regium—tumu-lumque" as <name type="pname">Justin</name> puts it, on which <name type="pname">Justin</name> (XII. 12. 12) and Diodorus (XVII. 115. 5) agree, is rejected because even the funeral of a Roman emperor cost no more than 400 talents. If we accept Beloch's figure of 7,000 talents for the yearly cost of the army we must do so with the realization that it is no more than a good guess. The most recent and most thorough study of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>
               <pb n="74"/>
economy is that of <name type="pname">A. M. Andreades</name> 'Ιστορία τ<graphic url="NS11_sym12.jpg"/>ς Ελληνίκης δημοσίας Οίκονομίας Book II, Part 1, 'H δημOσία οίκονομία το<graphic url="NS11_sym14.jpg"/> μ∊γάλου 'Αλ∊ξάνδρου, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, 1930. He thinks that Beloch's 7,000 is too low a figure (p. 21), but his calculations suffer from the same unavoidable weakness of having to substitute probable hypotheses for data. Both authors agree that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> expenses exceeded his income.</p>
            <p>Let us for the moment accept 7,000 talents as a reasonable military budget and, using very much simplified figures (since there is no possibility of exactitude) see what the consequences would be. If Diodorus is right and there were 9,000 talents of darics in <name type="place">Susa</name>, then the first year would be paid for without the need of further mintage—indeed there would be a surplus of 2,000 talents. Suppose we say that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> would be provided for from the death of Darius to the summer of 329. He must then make provision for 2 years' campaigning, from the summer of 329 to that of 327 when he entered <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> and an entirely new set of conditions. He would have needed 14,000 talents for the army, which the treasure at <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> was well able to provide. Let us assume that 10,000 talents is to be in the form of double darics and (to make things as simple as possible) let us assume that the double daric equals the distater and that 150 of them go to the talent.<ref target="#CH2-n160">160</ref> That would mean minting 1,500,000 of them. What would be a reasonable number of specimens now preserved to represent that number originally struck? There is one recent study which has at least some degree of control for its calculation of survival rate: <name type="pname">E. J. P. Raven</name>, 'The Amphictionic Coinage of Delphi."<ref target="#CH2-n161">161</ref> But in spite of the author's sane and careful treatment there is an embarrassing spread in the possibilities according to the denomination investigated and the total amount supposed to have been struck—a spread from 1 in 7,310 to 1 in 240,000 ! Mr. Raven himself is a little discouraged and recalling that "previous estimates of survival rates have usually been in the region of 1 in 5,000" admits that "that figure may not be far from the average of all Greek coins." Let us adopt it with no illusions.<ref target="#CH2-n162">162</ref> It would mean that of the original 1,500,000 double darics, 300
<pb n="75"/>
should have survived. If we assume that 2,000 talents consisted of silver (the other 2,000 being accounted for by the surplus darics) and that the silver was imitation <name type="place">Athenian</name> tetradrachms at 1,500 to the talent, there would have been 3,000,000 struck, of which 600 should have survived. If one follows more closely the proportions of Seleucid coinage the amount of gold will be much decreased and the silver correspondingly increased, but the Seleucids had no great reservoirs of gold to make into money. I will not affront the reader by pointing out what a tissue of uncertainties we have here. Everyone must decide for himself whether such procedure can do any good at all. I may express my own feeling that, no matter how you calculate, there do not seem to be enough coins to meet the requirements. There has been no gathering of either double darics or imitation owls, but I find it hard to believe that a census would approach the necessary figures. It seems to me that there must have been supplements from more <name type="place">Persian</name> coins, from the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> coinage, or from other series. It is unlikely that the country itself offered large amounts of plunder.</p>
            <p>We have some evidence of subsidiary series. There are a number of pieces that have been often attributed to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>: varieties of imitation owls, small coins with <name type="place">Athena</name>'s head and an eagle, drachms and the famous tetradrachms with the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> and an eagle, these last with the name of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>
               <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi> 1,12).</hi>
               <ref target="#CH2-n163">163</ref> The old attribution is disposed of, finally, one hopes, by an admirable article by <name type="pname">R. B, Whitehead</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n164">164</ref> in which he shows clearly that, though specimens are acquired in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>, their place of origin is across the mountains in <name type="place">Afghanistan</name>. These, then, might have helped to fill the need, but their number cannot have been large.</p>
            <p>As to the use of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> regular coinage, we are in strange doubt. <name type="pname">Alexanders</name> do turn up in <name type="place">Afghanistan</name>. I have recently seen a number acquired by an inexpert collector who had no interest in selecting rarities. There were 8 tetradrachms, 6 drachms and a hemidrachm, but the only pieces surely early enough to belong to this period were one stater of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> and one late daric. The silver was all of 324 or later. The <name type="pname">Oxus Hoard</name>, which ought to be
<pb n="76"/>
very enlightening, fails us entirely. Of the 100 odd tetradrachms and 100 odd drachms said to have been included, only one was sufficiently described to be identified, and that turns out to be a coin of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I from <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>, <hi rend="italic">ESM,</hi> p. 166, no. 454. We have no way of knowing the date of the others nor, if we knew, could we tell whether they came into the country with <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> or later. J. Hackin's "Répartition des Monnaies anciennes en <name type="place">Afghanistan</name>"<ref target="#CH2-n165">165</ref> makes no mention of <name type="pname">Alexanders</name> (but neither does he mention Seleucids, though he prints "Séleucides" on his map at Tash Kurgan). So far as our evidence goes, the coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> himself played no part of any importance in his conquest of Bactria.</p>
            <p>There remains the possibility that he had more <name type="place">Persian</name> coins and used them, but I do not see how that can ever be proved.<ref target="#CH2-n166">166</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The record of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> finances in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> is extremely meager. <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n167">167</ref> records the gift to the king of Taxila of 1,000 talents, which he says was in coin, and the great displeasure of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> friends. The same incident occurs in <name type="pname">Curtius</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n168">168</ref> with an interesting addition. Omphis, being confirmed as king of Taxila, presented <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> with sundry gifts and 80 talents signati argenti.<ref target="#CH2-n169">169</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was gratified but returned the offering and instead gave Omphis 1,000 talents ex praeda quam vehebat, gold and silver vessels, <name type="place">Persian</name> robes and 30 horses. This is an odd episode. What did Omphis expect to buy with so small a gift as 80 talents? The exchange of presents would be appropriate ritual between two kings meeting to form an alliance but the 1,000 talents, even if <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name> was not right about its being coin, would be much more credible if it were to insure the cooperation of the forces of Taxila than if it were a mere gesture of vanity, as both the authors seem to take it to be. For what it is worth, the incident shows <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> as actually carrying his treasure in his baggage
<pb n="77"/>
and as having enough so that he could part with a large sum before the conquest of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> had fairly begun.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Curtius</name> says<ref target="#CH2-n170">170</ref> that after the defeat of Porus and the founding of Nicaea and Bucephala <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> gave each of the leaders a crown and 1,000 aurei—a detail so conventional that it is hardly to be taken seriously. Both Arrian<ref target="#CH2-n171">171</ref> and <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n172">172</ref> speak of <name type="place">Indian</name> mercenaries. This is all that is pertinent in the literary tradition. The coins themselves, however, are more helpful. First there is the negative evidence of the extreme rarity of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own money in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n173">173</ref> Second there is the scarcity of <name type="place">Persian</name> gold and the comparative frequency of <name type="place">Persian</name> silver.<ref target="#CH2-n174">174</ref> Third there is the existence of a class of silver coins of double, half and quarter siglos weight<ref target="#CH2-n175">175</ref> which seems to have formed the basic currency of the northwest district to which <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> first came. Macdonald explains the infrequency of <name type="place">Persian</name> gold in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> by the fact that there was so much gold there that the ratio with silver was only 8: 1. This would, of course, be unfavorable to the use of darics coined on the <name type="place">Persian</name> standard of 13. 3: 1 and, to a lesser extent, to the gold coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> struck at 10: 1. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> may, therefore, have planned to use silver only, though in this case he would have had little need to import specie. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> is notoriously rich in metal and, moreover, much given to hoarding,<ref target="#CH2-n176">176</ref> so that here, as in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>, the conqueror will have been able to look forward to the capture of enough bullion to finance his campaign. It certainly was not financed by staters and tetradrachms transported from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>.</p>
            <p>This digression into the perplexities of the East has led us far from the main course of our study, but it could hardly be neglected. No matter how the details are finally settled, the general picture is clear. Before Gaugamela the empire had two monetary zones: <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> (Map 2) where the
<pb n="78"/>
imperial types joined or dominated but did not extinguish the local currencies; <name type="place">Cilicia</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> (Map 3) where the local currencies were replaced by the imperial. To this period belongs the fiscal purpose of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, as defined by Schlumberger, of eventually achieving monetary uniformity for the empire as a whole. But after Gaugamela a third zone is added, of <name type="pname">Mesopotamia</name> and the East (Map 4) in which the preexisting confusion is not merely tolerated but augmented by the emissions of the conqueror. There is concession to the <name type="place">Persian</name> tradition, as proved by the double darics; concession to the satrapal tradition, as proved by the imitation owls. Whether temporarily or permanently the ideal of uniformity is laid aside. In part this was doubtless the result of difficulties greater in the East than in the West: the continuous warfare, the strange and remote terrain, the alien mores of the people. But it also resulted from a changed state of mind, for there are two phenomena in the West, one beginning about 327 during <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> absence in the East, the other in 324 after his return. The first is the institution at <name type="place">Tarsus</name> of a series of silver staters of <name type="place">Persian</name> weight and <name type="place">Cilician</name> type without any reference to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, for the use of Issus, <name type="place">Mallus</name>, Soli and <name type="place">Tarsus</name> itself (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 7, 8).<ref target="#CH2-n177">177</ref> The other is the coining, in the mints of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, of gold staters with the name and type of <name type="pname">Philip</name> II.<ref target="#CH2-n178">178</ref> Neither of these can be explained by any pressure of necessity or change of conditions. Both must have been designed to gratify the sentiment of those who still remembered kindly the money that preceded <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>All this is perfectly appropriate to the historical situation. Until the final defeat of the <name type="place">Persian</name> king <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was an adventurer, with everything to gain, but much to lose. Whenever his resolution was taken that he himself was to be the Great King, it became imperative for him to assert his prestige and
<pb n="79"/>
his power. <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>tics were to be taught that the imperial structure which they had regarded as supreme was in process of being overthrown by a mighty foreigner, supported by foreign gods, who was no mere raider, but had come among them to conquer, to occupy and to organize. <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> and the name of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> were to become as familiar to them as the gods of their own country and the odd little monarch with bow and spear. But when the empire was won, when he was in fact the <name type="pname">Great King</name> himself, what did it matter any longer? Then came the experiments with the amalgamation of races, the <name type="place">Persians</name> in positions of trust, the oriental splendor and extravagance, the figure of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> on the great decadrachm, a <name type="place">Macedonian</name> king on one side charging against Poms, but, on the other, a divine king in <name type="place">Persian</name> dress, wielding the thunderbolt (<hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               </hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">late 1,</hi>
               </hi>13).</p>
            <p>But, if there was confusion in the East and breach of precedent in the West, it must not be thought that the general system was weakened, much less abandoned, after Gaugamela. The old mints continued to strike their conventional coins, the latest organized of the great mints, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name>, beginning to operate about 326.<ref target="#CH2-n179">179</ref> About that time also there was a marked, though unexplained, increase in the output of a number of cities.<ref target="#CH2-n180">180</ref> Neither quantity nor quality showed signs of slackening, and there must have been few west of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> who did not know the types of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>The ultimate test of a currency is its ability to provide what is needed. So judged, <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> international currency had been a great success. It had furnished him with the resources of war and peace over a vast territory whose
<pb n="80"/>
expansion he could not foresee in detail. It had succeeded, at least as far as <name type="pname">Mesopotamia</name>, in introducing an economy of uniform specie to regions accustomed to other currencies or to none. Trade had carried the daric and the owl far and wide, but the army and the civil power carried the gold <name type="place">Athena</name> and the silver <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> farther yet. As an instrument of conquest or commerce and of government, the coinage of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> made a record no less brilliant than his more familiar achievements.</p>
            <p>Could its success have continued? Would it have served the whole established empire which he planned? No question which must assume the continued life and health of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> can have a satisfying answer, but here, as in other cases, one must doubt if he could have maintained what he created. There is no reason to suspect that he was an economist more gifted than his generation. It is the common belief that his expenses outran his income. Doubtless the mines of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> seemed inexhaustible; inexhaustible also the huge <name type="place">Persian</name> treasure. With its capture begin the tales of extravagances which, in the end, were sure to impoverish the royal power. If he could have learned in <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, when there was nothing more to conquer, to match his expenses to his needs as successfully as he seems to have done while he was winning <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, his financial structure might have stood for generations. But who was there to teach him?</p>

It may be pointed out that the fragmentary inscription IG II.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 1. 329, which is cited as proving that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was to pay his allies 1 drachma a day, seems rather to show a payment of I drachma to the hypaspistae with some other, and presumably lesser, amount for the troops in general.

                     <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the Great</hi> II, pp. 148–154). However, we have an interesting detailed proposal by <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">(First <name type="pname">Philip</name>pic,</hi> 28f.) for an expeditionary force against <name type="pname">Philip</name> that was never raised. His calculation allows 2 obols a day for foot soldiers, one drachma for horse, citizen and mercenary alike. This was put forward as an emergency measure and, in view of the fact that the pauper's allowance was 2 obols, it is very unlikely that citizen infantry, let alone mercenaries, could have been induced to serve ordinarily for that wage, which would have been sufficient only if supplemented with plunder. There is evidence that by the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> the ordinary pay of a Greek mercenary was 4 obols a day (Parke, loc. cit.) and perhaps we may assume that the pay of all privates was the same; in that case the pay of a horseman would also be double <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</name>' figure. Now, if we take the later amount, the pay of the foot for 30 days would be 800,000 drachmae (40,000 χ 4 obols χ 30 days ÷ 6), that of the horse 360,000 drachmae (6,000 χ 12 obols χ 30 days ÷ 6). The total would be 193⅓ talents (1,160,000 ÷ 6,000), while even at <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</name>' figures the sum would be 96⅔ talents with no allowance for the pay of higher ranks or any other military expense. Seventy talents would not have lasted 3 weeks even at starvation wages. Probably the reports of the king's finances at the beginning of the campaign were no more than gossip.</p>

               <p>Arrian's words imply that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own borrowing was to finance the expedition. If the 800 were added to <name type="pname">Philip's</name> debt of 500, the total of 1,300 talents would be no excessive burden.

                  <name type="place">Babelon</name>, op. cit., pp. 1329-1332. Here we are faced with the difficulty of accurate dating. Wroth, <hi rend="italic">BMC Troas,Aeolis and Lesbos,</hi> p. xli, says "This series may, on grounds of style, be attributed to <hi rend="italic">circa</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> 320 to 280." Without disputing the calculation based on style, <name type="place">Babelon</name> moves the series back to 340–300. Twenty years is surely not a great difference when one is dating by style in the 4th century, but for our purpose the difference is critical. According to one system Abydus began her large output of silver before <name type="pname">Philip's</name> invasion of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> and continued it through the life of <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> I; according to the other it did not begin until after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death and continued through the life of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I. I follow <name type="place">Babelon</name> because he is the later (and, I think, the better) authority and also because his dates seem to me to accord better with historical probability. Among the phenomena following the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> I find it hard to believe that there was any long continued show of independence by cities in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>. Some such outburst as occasioned the Lamian War in mainland <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> is easy to imagine, but for Abydus to begin an issue of autonomous coins which persisted through the terms of at least 28 officials seems very unlikely. Nevertheless, probability is not proof and the use of Abydus as evidence for the procedure of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> involves a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii.</hi> But neither date avoids the difficulty of simultaneous issue of autonomous coins on one standard and drachms of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> on another. Thompson and Bellinger, p. 9. Bikerman has nothing to say about Abydus in his sweeping denial that the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>tic cities retained the right of coinage. "Alexandre le Grand et les Villes d'Asie," <hi rend="italic">REG</hi> 1934, p. 349.

               <p>A notable instance of the control of local value by convention is the variation in price of gold coins at Delphi between 335 and 328. <hi rend="italic">Sylloge</hi> I, 251, n. 15 and 253, n. 14. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_122375252">J. G. Milne</name> was eminent in his defense of the thesis that, in domestic transactions, the amount of bullion in a coin was of less importance than its face value. (Cf. "The Monetary Reform of Solon," <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 1930, pp. 179–185; <hi rend="italic">The Melos Hoard of 1907</hi> (NNM 62), 1934). The power of the sovereign to set a value to a coin which should not be affected by variation in the price of metal is of course dependent on the degree of control which he had over the metal available, and probably not many would be tempted to apply the principle, as Milne did, to Pheidon and the very beginning of coinage <hi rend="italic">(Greek and Roman Coins,</hi>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, 1939, pp. 81f., n. X. 2). But he had been impressed by the lack of uniformity in Greek coin weights and was inclined to echo the complaint of <name type="pname">Sir George Macdonald</name> that the instrument of metrology "has indeed broken short in our hands" ("Fifty Years of Greek Numismatics," <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the International Numismatic Congress,</hi>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, 1938, pp. 3–16). Macdonald reviews the enthusiastic hopes of the metrologists and the vigorous reaction to them with reference to his studies in the coinage of Crete, where indeed the weights cannot be got to make any sense. But it is going too far to assert, because this situation obtains in one area, that Greek money is all token money except for a few issues such as the Athenian, coined with international trade specifically in view. There is too great a majority of cases in which the standards <hi rend="italic">are</hi> adhered to, though these are often obscured by the fact that we have not enough data to be statistically safe. If value really had no relation to metal content there would be nothing to prevent a drastic and universal reduction in weight of all coins not intended to go abroad. The enigma of Crete would be only half solved, for though we might have an explanation for the light coins, we should have none for the heavy. We may continue to believe that, as a rule, silver coins were worth their weight, with exceptions, some of which we can understand and some of which we cannot. One thing we can understand is that convenience might demand a conventional adjustment of values to save the nuisance of perpetual weighing. If there were large quantities in question the scales were undoubtedly resorted to as they still are in the East, but when a few small pieces of Abydus had to be exchanged for small silver of Lampsacus it was doubtless done by agreement. Still, we should not exaggerate an <name type="place">Asiatic's</name> impatience with weighing or belittle his willingness to spend his leisure for a small profit.</p>

Tarn is perhaps influenced by his desire to believe that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was as generous to the Greeks as possible. With the question of constitutional and juridical relations between them we are not concerned. The theory that the cities were freed by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was challenged by <name type="pname">E. Bickermann</name>, "Alexandre le Grand et les Villes d'Asie," <hi rend="italic">REG</hi> 1934, pp. 346-374. His conclusion is that such liberty as they had rested on the unilateral and revocable act of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. Tarn, op. cit., II, pp. 199-232, protested against this in favor of the earlier theory. In 1938 Victor Ehrenberg published <hi rend="italic">

               <p>Tarn, op. cit., II, pp. 237f. cannot believe that there was an Alexandria earlier than the one in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, and presents an hypothesis that it was founded after Gaugamela by command of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> but not by his act in presence. It does not matter to us at what point the city also known as Myriandrus received the conqueror's name but I do not believe that the argument is a very good one that some ancient writer <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have mentioned the foundation if it had occurred immediately after Issus. The city had been important enough to have its own Persian issues and without any doubt those of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> at once succeeded (<name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">E. T. Newell</name>, <hi rend="italic">Myriandros).</hi> It might be remarked that Tarn has difficulty (pp. 239f.) with another Alexandria: Alexandria Troas. The tradition is (Strabo, XIII. 26) that the city was founded by <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> by the synoecism of the surrounding towns and named after himself; that when <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> acquired it he refounded it and renamed it Alexandria. This Tarn will not credit, "It is impossible to believe" he says, "that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Successor, just <hi rend="italic">once,</hi> used the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>-name.—There is only one explanation. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> must have promised to found a city there—but he did not live to do it." But in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time a city in that place would have made no sense at all. The whole thing is a characteristic Hellenistic performance (<name type="pname">Louis Robert</name>, <hi rend="italic">Études de Numismatique grecque,</hi>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>, 1951, pp. 5-13). If <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had in mind the founding of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Alexandria before the one in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, Myriandrus would have been a reasonable location, a site in the Troad would not.</p>

               <p>Noe's arrangement would provide 8 issues distinguished by their symbols or by style:</p>
               <p>I. Boy with outstretched arms alone (distater no. 1. stater no. 2, tetradrachm no. 3).</p>
               <p>2. Boy and rudder (stater no. 5, tetradrachm no. 4).</p>
               <p>3. Thunderbolt and A (distater nos. 6, 7—supposing A and A to be the same—stater no. 8).</p>
               <p>4. Boy and A (distater no. 9, stater no. 11).</p>
               <p>5. Boy A and ivy leaf (distater no. 10).</p>
               <p>6. Boy alone, different style from 1 (stater no. 12, tetradrachms nos. 13, 14—distinguished only by a die break on the former).</p>
               <p>7. Ear of barley (tetradrachm no. 15).</p>
               <p>8. Goat's head (tetradrachm no. 16).</p>
               <p>Of these, 1, 3 and 6 are large issues. In 1 there are 8 reverse dies used for the tetradrachms, though only one each for distater and stater. In 3 there are 18 reverse dies used for the distaters, I for the stater. In 6 there are 9 reverses used for the tetradrachms. The others are all small, each using only a single reverse die, except that there are 2 for tetradrachm no. 4 and 2 for distater no. 9. There is, however, no reason for combining any of the minor issues, and combining 1 and 6, where the difference is one of style alone, would still leave 7 issues.</p>
               <p>Since the terminal date is 323/2, that would put the beginning not later than 330/29. The latest issue (presumably 8) might have come in 323 before the outbreak of the Lamian war. The earliest could not be before the battle of Megalopolis in the fall of 331, and therefore an issue before 330 would be hardly possible. If we are to provide a year for each of Noe's varieties, therefore, we should put 1 in 330/29 and 8 in 323.</p>

               <p>This is not serious variation. The chief question is, was any of the treasure in the form of coin? I do not believe that <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>'s νομίσματος is of any importance. In view of <name type="pname">Curtius</name>' explicit phrase non signati forma sed nidi pondere, and Diodorus' άσήμου χρυσο<graphic url="NS11_sym14.jpg"/> καì άργνρο<graphic url="NS11_sym14.jpg"/> we must suppose there was bullion, which is likely even without testimony. But Diodorus is so clear in his antithesis between the bullion and the έννακισχίλια τάλαντα χρυσο<graphic url="NS11_sym14.jpg"/> χαρακτ<graphic url="NS11_sym12.jpg"/>ρα δαρεικòν έχοντα as to make it certain that he believed there to have been both bullion and coin. It is less likely that his source invented the darics than that the source of Arrian and <name type="pname">Curtius</name> made up a round number by including them with the uncoined metal.</p>

The difficulty as to transport is a serious one, but not so serious in India where he had the rivers to use as in the mountains of Bactria. And there is nothing to suggest that the arrears in pay were of long standing. They may have been only in connection with the march back from India. <name type="place">Griffith</name> is hardly justified in saying "in fact it is certain that he did not pay μισθός regularly by the month."

On the initial date will depend the solution to the question whether the signed lion staters of <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> were without precedent, as assumed in the present study, or whether <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had already allowed another satrap to put his name on a coin.

I would invite the Orientalists to consider the possibility that the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> of Six' nos. 1 and 2 is a High Priest, like Abd-Hadad of nos. 4 and 5 and that the whole series belongs to a much later time.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The death of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> left his empire without a leader and there was great difficulty in choosing one. Some were for retaining the kingship in the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> royal house and supported <name type="pname">Philip's</name> son Arrhidaeus, <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> half-brother. Others felt that the family of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> himself was the proper source of royal power and hoped for an heir in the child which <name type="pname">Roxane</name> was expecting. The factions were vehement and almost came to blows, yet to the wiser minds it must have been apparent that the true question was not who was to have the name of king but who was to control the armies and the finances of the empire. The generals could not know, any more than we know now whether it was possible that the vast realm which they had conquered could be ruled as a unit, but even those who doubted most had no plan for division except the appeal to arms. But civil war was to the liking of no one and so it was essential that the formal question as to the kingship should be settled promptly. A compromise was reached: Arrhidaeus' name was changed to <name type="pname">Philip</name> and he was declared king with the proviso that if <name type="pname">Roxane</name>'s child should be a son he was to share the royal title. <name type="pname">Roxane</name>'s child, as it turned out, was a son; he was duly named <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and war was for the time averted. <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> and Craterus divided the ill-defined powers and duties of guardian and regent. Many of the necessary arrangements of which we are not told must have been made by them and it may have been they who decided that, as money must continue to be struck, the familiar types should be retained but that some of the coins should bear the name of <name type="pname">Philip</name>, and this plan was put into effect as soon as the problem of the kingship was solved.</p>
            <p>It was not universally done, however. The most conspicuous exception is that the premier mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> never used <name type="pname">Philip's</name> name. It is not easy to see why this should have been so. The <name type="place">Macedonians</name> had been <name type="pname">Philip's</name> supporters in the contest as to the succession and <name type="pname">Antipater</name>, who was regent in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>, was a thorough legitimist. Moreover, he had long been at odds with <name type="place">Olympia</name>s, that fervent partisan of her grandson and foe of his co-ruler, which should have put <name type="pname">Antipater</name> in <name type="pname">Philip's</name> party if partisanship was important in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> in 323. It is a further complication that there is an issue for <name type="pname">Philip</name> from Pella in about 318.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> At that time there is indeed evidence of a
<pb n="82"/>
division in the country. Cassander was making head against the duly appointed guardian Polyperchon; <name type="pname">Eurydice</name>, <name type="pname">Philip's</name> wife and half-sister, had attempted to take charge of affairs and transfer the command from Polyperchon to Cassander; the young <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> was apparently with his grandmother in Epirus. It may be that <name type="pname">Eurydice</name> had enough influence in Pella to have it strike in her husband's name, but not enough to prevent the same magistrate from striking in that of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>.

This does not prevent the unhappy <name type="pname">Philip</name>, burdened with illegitimacy, an over-bearing wife and a weak intellect, from being a person of numismatic importance. Since his brief career began in 323 and ended in 317 his coins, of course, must fall between those limits, and consequently also the coins with the name of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and symbols identical with <name type="pname">Philip's</name> which is a very important aid in the arrangements of the coins after 323.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>

            <p>It is remarkable how few of these governors played parts of any importance during the struggles of the Successors. The boundaries of the satrapies would be maintained as they had been in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time and it may be that the entrusting of important provinces to men not of the first importance was caused less by a mistaken estimate of their abilities than by the mutual jealousies of greater men. The fact that there was obviously no attempt to provide an equal distribution of mints can only mean that the unity of the empire was still so fundamental in the minds of the generals that it was taken for granted that all money was still the kings' money, only now at the disposal of the regent. There are positive indications that this was true. In 321, after the murder of <name type="place">Perdiccas</name>, his brother-in-law <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_priscus_attalus">Attalus</name> sailed to Tyre and there recovered 800 talents from Archelaüs, the captain of the garrison, which <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> had given him for safekeeping.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> This was evidently a transaction entirely independent of Laomedon, the satrap. In 319 <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> committed what was regarded as a clear act of rebellion when he captured and appropriated 600 talents which were being conveyed by ship from <name type="place">Cilicia</name> to the kings in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> And in the next year, when Polyperchon was strengthening the hand of Eumenes against <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> he sent letters in the name of the kings to the generals in <name type="place">Cilicia</name> and the treasurers to pay Eumenes 500 talents and any more that he might require.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name>, indeed, protested to the treasurers against paying any money to Eumenes and promised to protect them if they failed to carry out instructions, but nobody paid any attention to him.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="85"/>
            <p>The assumption of the unity of empire, however, soon began to be challenged. <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> was apparently the first to conceive of making a part of the empire his own domain, though perhaps the idea had come as soon to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>, fighting to organize the still unconquered elements of Thrace. After his recovery of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> from <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> in 312 <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> set himself to make a permanent possession of the East. And in the spring of that same year when Cassander had put <name type="place">Olympias</name> to death, though he was the only one with any title to be considered the guardian of the young <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, he showed his true purpose by having the boy imprisoned with his mother <name type="pname">Roxane</name>. In 310 by having them assassinated he left no basis for any legitimist party.</p>
            <p>Against these separatist forces the regents had fought, <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> with more than a little personal ambition involved, <name type="pname">Antipater</name> with loyal devotion to the royal house, Polyperchon with good intentions, doubtless, but with little practical sense and with diminishing effectiveness. But there was another opponent of the separatists: <name type="pname">Antigonus</name>, and he was moved not by sentiment but by the determination to keep the empire together for himself. This ambition was shared and inherited by his son <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name>, and the greatest episode of the closing of the 4th century and the opening of the 3rd is the account of the adventures of those two warriors.</p>
            <p>The interplay of all these individuals meant constant change in the control of territory and in the condition of the cities. Though the mints may have struck coins originally for the use of all parts of the empire alike—subject always to the element of convenience—there must have come a time when for <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> to capture a mint meant for him to capture additional revenue. The activity of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> mints in 310 and 309 seems to be part of his program,<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> and perhaps some of the constant friction between the Ptolemies and their neighbors was caused by desire to control the mint-cities of the Syrian coast.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to give any general picture of the fortunes of the mints in the period just after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death. That must be worked out a city at a time, a labor which has hardly begun as yet, though many issues have been assigned to their proper cities without historical commentary. <name type="pname">Newell's</name> works on <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name> and the Seleucids have obiter dicta about the preceding <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> coins and so have publications of sundry hoards, but we are still in the dark as to such a matter as the closing of the mint at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>, its date and cause. Much meticulous work with individual series is necessary before we can write the history of the early posthumous <name type="pname">Alexanders</name>.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, there are some things that can be said as to the practice of the different Successors, for there are only a few of them of any numismatic

importance. In the realm of <name type="pname">Antipater</name>, as one would expect, nothing was ever minted except the old types, and that was true of the realm in the hands of Polyperchon. Since they regarded the empire as the kings' estate, it could be financed only by the kings' money. Cassander held to the convention so far as gold and silver were concerned, but he did issue bronze with the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> and a lion with his own name.<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref>
               <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> also used only the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> types; the coins bearing the legend <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> or King <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> belong to his grandson <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> Gonatas or <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> Doson.<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref> Of course his endeavor was to avoid anything that might seem to acknowledge the possibility of partition, and as long as the old man lived his son <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name>, if he is to be regarded as an independent minting authority, followed the father's example. The first breach of tradition was that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> about 320 when he substituted for the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> a head of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> wearing a headdress made of an elephant with jutting tusks and uplifted trunk (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

This is the deified <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>: above his cheek may be seen the ram's horn of his divine father <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> Ammon. A few years later there was a more extreme innovation. The deified head remained but the familiar seated <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> was replaced by an <name type="place">Athena</name> with helmet, aegis, shield and thunderbolt. The earliest coins of this type bore the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΕΙΟΝ,</hi>
               </hi> a further deviation from tradition but a somewhat puzzling one which gave place again to the conventional <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY.</hi>
               </hi> So far there had been no overt show of independence, but a step was taken which actually made for more independence than a change of type could. <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> abandoned the Attic standard of 17.62 grams and began to strike tetradrachms of Rhodian weight (15.50 grams) and so cut <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> off from the international currency of his rivals. Then, after the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> IV in 310 had left no legitimate monarch, <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name>, <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> took the title of king in 306/5 and 305/4, and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> joined them, now introducing his own portrait on the obverse and using as his reverse the eagle which had been on <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name>' hand. This became the standard Ptolemaic type and the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> coinage thus disappears from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> forever.</p>
            <p>The development of types was different in other cases. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> had originally controlled no mint<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> and it was not until 308 that he provided himself
<pb n="87"/>
with a suitable capital by building the city of Lysimacheia near Cardia in Thrace. There he struck <name type="pname">Alexanders</name> on which about 303 he put a distinguishing mark: the forepart of a Hon, which was his own device; and his own name now stood in place of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>. In 296<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> he imitated <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> in replacing the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> head with a portrait of the divinized <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, again with the horns of Ammon but without the elephant skin (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

               </hi> II, 5). It is one of the most spectacular of Hellenistic portraits. The reverse shows a seated <name type="place">Athena</name> holding Nike and leaning on her shield. The title is that of King <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>, and with that he was content; his portrait never appeared on his coins, and since he had no heir his types would have died with him except that, like those of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, they had caught the fancy of the cities and were imitated long after his death.</p>
            <p>When the disaster of Ipsus had ended <name type="pname">Antigonus</name>' plans and ambitions <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name> was left to gather the remnants of his father's great empire and, from the cities still in his control, he issued notice of his continued command of the sea: the magnificent tetradrachms bearing his name and showing Nike with a trumpet on a prow and Poseidon standing with menacing trident. Later there were two series with <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name>' own portrait, one with Poseidon seated, the other with his foot on a rock, leaning on a trident.</p>
            <p>The first change introduced by <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> was the substitution of his own name for that of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> after 306 when he took the title of king. This was at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris about 305.<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> It became common about 300 and was the regular type for gold and silver in the West, though the bronze shows considerable variation. An apparent exception occurs in Pergamum where <name type="pname">Seleucus</name>' name is used on tetradrachms with horse's head/elephant. But those were actually issued by Philetaerus and his governor and were followed by a reversion to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> type and name, and then to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> type with <name type="pname">Seleucus</name>' name.<ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> In the East two other types were used for silver: the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name>/<name type="place">Athena</name> in a biga or quadriga of elephants;<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref> and head of <name type="pname">Seleucus/Nike</name> and trophy.<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref> It is interesting that the king confined the use of his own portrait to his eastern mints, and even there it did not entirely displace the older design as <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name>'s portrait did in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. In <name type="place">Susa</name>, for instance, there is a reversion to the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> type with <name type="pname">Seleucus</name>' name after both of the others had been used<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref> and at <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>

            </p>
            <p>Mention must be made of three interesting uses of the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> type by lesser powers than the dynasts of whom we have spoken. One is the case of a client king, Nicocles of Paphos in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>. A number of tetradrachms of that mint, apparently perfectly ordinary <name type="pname">Alexanders</name>, are found on close inspection, to have the name <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">ΝΙΚΟΚΛΕΟΥΣ</hi>
               </hi> inscribed on the mane of the lion headdress in letters so tiny that they are not visible on a photograph and are frequently only to be seen on the coins themselves under a magnifying glass.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref>
               <name type="pname">J. M. F. May</name> in an admirably complete treatment of them<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref> concludes that they were issued from 323, immediately after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death, to 320, which would allow for their appearance in the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard, buried in 318/7. As he says, the legend has every appearance of being surreptitious and it is tempting to think that the Paphian king was a bit intoxicated by the feeling of liberty caused by the news from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, but not so confident as to let his state of mind be obvious to the regents. We have no way of knowing whether his temerity escaped notice, or was indulged, or was punished. But none of his fellow kings copied his experiment. There are letters on coins of <name type="place">Salamis</name> which may perhaps have stood for the names of the kings Nicocreon and Menelaus<ref target="#CH3-n22">22</ref> but those cases were undoubtedly official and were far less explicit. A similar license had been accorded kings of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</name> in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> lifetime.<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref> But it seems that Nicocles was aiming at something more than that.</p>
            <p>The second case is that of a tetradrachm of eastern appearance which, in addition to the usual inscription, has the name <hi rend="smallcaps">

               </hi> as having been installed as satrap of Susiana by <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> in 316 after the defeat of Eumenes, and there can be no doubt that this is the same man. There was a mint in operation at <name type="place">
                  <name type="place">Susa</name>
               </name> by 317/6<ref target="#CH3-n25">25</ref> striking coins with the names of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and <name type="pname">Philip</name>, and sometime between that date and 312 when <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> recovered the territory this piece must have been struck. Though it is without parallel and without consequence,<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref> it is worthy of attention, for it ventures on a show of independence which the greater Successors were slow to follow. Modesty or caution or both forbade the introduction of a new design. Who was Aspeisas that the East should accept his money? But he was more than the mint official who must be content to be known by a monogram or an ambiguous symbol and he saw to it that he should appear as a man of importance in the realm that had been <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>. One wonders whether he knew of the case of Nicocles and declined to use such a mixture of display and concealment. One wonders also what impression it made on <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> who had appointed him—<name type="pname">Antigonus</name> who was so scrupulous to maintain the old types unchanged.</p>
            <p>The third instance is even more surprising. It is the issuance by Areus king of Sparta, 309-264, of a tetradrachm with <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> types and the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">ΒΑΣΙΛΕΟΣ ΑΡΕΟΣ.<ref target="#CH3-n27">27</ref>

Beloch<ref target="#CH3-n28">28</ref> supposes that the act of striking his own money, unprecedented for a Spartan, was one of the manifestations of eminence and self-confidence which resulted from his victory over Pyrrhus in 272. No Spartan king for a long time had been so powerful, and it is easy to assume that his emulation of royal power of which <name type="place">Athena</name>eus speaks<ref target="#CH3-n29">29</ref> falls in this period. It might be a time suitable for the introduction of the silver with his own portrait,<ref target="#CH3-n30">30</ref> if that is indeed struck by him, but the use of his name on the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> type would be much more appropriate to the years 306-304 when the Successors whom he considered his rivals were taking the title of king. We know nothing of what he was doing from his accession in 309 to his first campaign in 280, and this may have been a kind of announcement that he also was one of the Successors, with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> for his province. But at any juncture it is
<pb n="90"/>
astonishing to have the types of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> vised by a king of the one Greek state which had been <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> consistent and pertinacious foe.<ref target="#CH3-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The economy of these posthumous Alexanders is still unstudied. It is evident that after the change of standard, the silver of Egypt was isolated from the rest of the Hellenistic world,<ref target="#CH3-n32">32</ref> but what about the money of the other Successors? How much of their product remained in their own territory? How much was at the disposition of their rivals? I ventured remarks on this subject a few years ago<ref target="#CH3-n33">33</ref> suggesting that there might be evidence for the development of separate monetary districts. I did not have much material to go on, and how upsetting to reasonable conjecture the facts can be is clearly seen in a hoard from Basra, recently published by <name type="pname">Georges Le Rider</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n34">34</ref> This extraordinary collection, of which he saw 507 pieces, begins with a 5th century Attic owl and ends with a tetradrachm of Attambelus I of Characene struck in 45/4 <hi rend="smallcaps">

Yet though at present we are at a loss, the accumulation of evidence will in time certainly show us something of the movement of currency in the early Hellenistic world. We are not without some indications. We know that the kings were not as rich as <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> had been.<ref target="#CH3-n36">36</ref> We know that they issued much less gold and much more bronze. We know that they modified his geographical arrangement of mints: <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> was served by some which had never struck for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>, and the Seleucids pushed eastward to Bactria itself (Map 4), showing that whatever were the dispositions of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> there

they could not be made permanent. But these were phenomena that lie beyond the limits of this study.</p>
            <p>After the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name> no one had any illusions about the possibility of keeping the empire together, and even before that, at the death of Cassander in 297 or of his sons in 294, the uniform types as a symbol of imperial unity had been abandoned. It would seem that <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> and the seated <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> had come to the end of their career. But in fact they reappear, not in the service of the kings but in that of the cities. Indeed, their use now is a sign of independence of the kings.<ref target="#CH3-n37">37</ref> These issues as related phenomena have had the benefit so far of only one serious study: Henri Seyrig's article "Parion au 3<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Siècle avant nôtre Ère"<ref target="#CH3-n38">38</ref> in which he considers the posthumous Alexanders of northern <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> together with the posthumous imitations of the tetradrachms of Lysimachus coined after 281 on both sides of the Propontis and on the Thracian coasts. There are two distinct periods to which the Alexanders belong, clearly distinguished in appearance. As to the earlier I can do no better than quote Seyrig's summary. ''We have in Seleucid <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> two kinds of money. At Sardes the types are royal, the name of the ruling sovereign is habitual; civic symbols are absent, the issue is continuous, the likeness of the coins to those of the eastern mints reveals the imperial centralization. In the other towns, on the contrary, the pieces have the traditional types of Alexander the Great, the name of the ruling sovereign is absent, the use of civic symbols is habitual, the issues are of limited importance. In other words, the coins of Sardes testify to immediate royal control while those of the other towns show no trace of it. The fact is that Sardes, the ancient capital, was left by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> under its Lydian laws and depended directly on the royal authority, while the other towns were Greek cities. The coins show, therefore, that the administrative capital in the first half of the 3rd century was still subject, while <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> had given the Greek cities a status which respected certain attributes of sovereignty."<ref target="#CH3-n39">39</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of Antiochus I, however, the royal power encroached on this sovereignty, whatever its nature, and royal types reappear in various cities. This was the situation until the death of Antiochus Hierax in 229/8. There followed another period of quasi-independence under the friendly protection of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_priscus_attalus">Attalus</name> I of Pergamum. This was celebrated in many towns by the issuance of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> type tetradrachms with low relief and very large flans. I illustrate

one such from the mint of Myrina, <name type="pname">Müller</name> 934 <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 10). On these, as on the earlier series, the symbols and monograms identify the issuing town, and they must be regarded as civic, not as royal issues. I have endeavored to put both series into their context in the case of Alexandria Troas.<ref target="#CH3-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Seyrig observes, as to the earlier posthumous series, "the issues are of limited importance," and that would seem to be still more true of the later ones. They are, in fact, analogous to the civic types, also struck on large flans, whose explanation, I am convinced, is sentimental rather than economic. I have discussed this matter at length in regard to the tetradrachms of Ilium<ref target="#CH3-n41">41</ref> and I need not repeat the argument here. It is clear how wide a difference there is between these rare pieces and the great <name type="place">Macedonian</name> issues which, more than a century before, financed the campaigns of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>There is no study comparable to Seyrig's for other districts and I will not embark on the complicated problems involved except by way of illustration. Coins are known, for example, certainly attributable to <name type="place">Miletus</name>, <name type="pname">Müller</name> 1043 <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi>

               </hi>.<ref target="#CH3-n42">42</ref> But Head supposes that all the Alexanders of Miletus, <name type="pname">Müller</name> 1033-1057, belong to the same period, whereas <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>

               </hi> and Seyrig<ref target="#CH3-n44">44</ref> thinks that most of the posthumous Alexanders ceased at the battle of Magnesia and that their attribution to the second century is very doubtful.

In publishing the Olympia Hoard <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> called attention to the presence of some of those rare varieties and offered comments on them which were intended as only preliminary observations.<ref target="#CH3-n47">47</ref> Since then the publication of Noe's <hi rend="italic">

            <p>The need for more systematic study of the posthumous Alexanders is really part of a much larger one: the need for more attention to the relation of one Greek mint with another. The study of Greek issues city by city has, of course, been a first necessity and has not yet been completed by any means. Nevertheless, the independence of Greek towns, important as it is, must not obscure the fact that their careers were parallel and that the fiscal fabric of antiquity must be judged by coincidences as well as by consequences. But that subject far transcends the concern of these essays which is only a single aspect of a picture almost infinitely complex. If we pursue the types of the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> king into a period so long succeeding his death we may as well acknowledge that we are moved by sentiment as well as by science, and perhaps the best illustration that can be found of his place in the imagination of later generations is the fact that from 92 to 88 <hi rend="smallcaps">

               <p>The few pertinent facts about <name type="pname">Philip</name> are to be found in Diodorus XVIII, XIX, sometimes confirmed by other sources. They may be summarized as follows:</p>
               <p>323 The infantry supported him for the kingship. He was made king and his name changed from Arrhidaeus to <name type="pname">Philip</name>. (Diodorus XVIII. 2. 2–4).</p>
               <p>322 <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> took him on campaign to Cappodocia (16.1). After the defeat of Ariarathes they campaigned in Pisidia (22.1).</p>
               <p>321 After the death of <name type="place">Perdiccas</name>, Pithon and Arrhidaeus were elected regents and guardians of the kings (36. 7). At the conference of Triparadeisos, because of the interference of Eurydice, the guardians resigned and <name type="pname">Antipater</name> was elected in their place (39.1–4). He took the kings back to their fatherland, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> (39.7).</p>
               <p>319 On his death bed <name type="pname">Antipater</name> appointed Polyperchon regent and guardian (48. 4). Polyperchon invited <name type="place">Olympias</name> to return from Epirus to take charge of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> son until he should be of age (49. 4, 57. 3). Eumenes in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> supported the kings against Anti-gonus (57. 3, 4).</p>
               <p>318 On Eumenes' advice <name type="place">Olympias</name> decided to stay in Epirus (58. 2–4). Polyperchon supported Eumenes by authority of the kings (58. 1, 59. 3, 62. 1, 2). Polyperchon and the kings were in Phocis. When Cassander came to the Piraeus Polyperchon moved into Attica but presently left part of the army with his son <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> while he went to the <name type="place">Peloponnesus</name> (68. 2, 3).</p>
               <p>317 Eurydice assumed the regency (XIX. 11.1) (and transferred the command from Polyperchon to Cassander. <name type="pname">Justin</name> XIV. 5.1–3). Polyperchon, in alliance with Aeacides of Epirus brought <name type="place">Olympias</name> with <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> son back to the kingdom (11. 2). <name type="pname">Eurydice's</name> army deserted her at sight of <name type="place">Olympias</name>; <name type="pname">Philip</name> and <name type="pname">Eurydice</name> were captured and killed (11. 2–7).</p>
               <p>We may suppose that <name type="pname">Eurydice's</name> activity caused the change of affairs between 318 and 317.</p>

               <p>At once after the settlement of the question about the kingship the satrapies were dealt out, and there was a second distribution in 321 at the conference of Triparadeisus. From the point of view of the control of mint cities the result was very strangely proportioned. A full discussion of the satrapies will be found in Bervé's <hi rend="italic">

               <p>In the earlier year both the kings were with Polyperchon in Phocis. He apparently did not take them with him to the <name type="place">Peloponnesus</name>, where his failure to capture Megalopolis injured his reputation and induced most of the Greek states to desert him for his rival Cassander. It will have been at this time that Eurydice (who may have come back to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> in 321 with the kings) achieved her coup d'état which must have been accompanied by the return of <name type="pname">Philip</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> and the flight of <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> to his grandmother in Epirus.

The role of Polyperchon is not quite clear.

            </head>
            <p>The following list is intended to serve a restricted purpose: to give a chronological framework for the years while <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> types were being issued by the Conqueror and his successors, and to mention some of the events which may be of importance for the understanding of those issues. Of course, it is not a history of the period, which would include much material foreign to this inquiry. Such histories are available in Vol. VI of the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Ancient History;</hi> Karl Julius Beloch, <hi rend="italic">Griechische Geschichte,</hi> ed. 2, Vols.

            <p>Under each entry I have set a reference to the ancient source. In the interests of brevity I have generally given one reference only, though the event may be attested in a number of places, since it is the fact and not its interpretation which is important to us; when there are more references than one it is because the second provides some important information which the first does not. The commonest ancient Greek chronological system is the list of eponymous archons of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. I have used the archon years, indicating closer dating only when some evidence is given in the source.</p>
            <p>The only continuous ancient account that we have is that of Diodorus of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</name> whose Greek
               <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Historica,</hi> in 40 books, was written under Caesar and Augustus. Books XVII-XX, which deal with our period, are preserved complete. The work is invaluable but very fallible; the author used good sources and used them assiduously, but his power of organization was not equal to the demands of constructing a world history. He was not unaware of the seriousness of the difficulties, and in XX. 43. 7 he makes apology for history which cannot present simultaneously simultaneous events. But his attempt to combine episodic treatment with a chronological reckoning by Roman consuls (who took office in January) and Attic archons (who took office in July) has led to great confusion which the ingenuity of modern scholarship has not wholly dispelled, and never will. Nevertheless, I have followed their conclusions—
<pb n="95"/>
fortunately fairly harmonious for this period—as best I could, and have not indicated the places where I depart from his chronology. Nor have I called attention to his errors as to consuls and archons. To have argued the justification for these deviations would have occupied a quite unreasonable amount of space, and might not have been convincing in the end.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> The chronology here presented may be called reasonably orthodox at the present time. There is a Loeb Library text and translation of Diodorus XVIII-XX by Russel M Geer: Vol. IX, 1929; Vol. X, 1933.</p>

               </hi> by <name type="pname">Quintus Curtius</name>, a Latin work of uncertain date, while it gives more extended accounts of many episodes, provides no reliable data of importance not given by the two preceding authors, and is not cited here. More useful are two other Greek works: the <hi rend="italic">Parallel Lives</hi> of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>, and the <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> of Strabo. The former is a series of biographies of notable Greeks and <name type="place">Romans</name> written in the 1st and 2nd centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">

            <p>The sparse references to other authors and to inscriptions should not mislead the reader into supposing that the scattered evidence for this period is slight. On the contrary, it is abundant, but very little of it provides otherwise unknown events for such a list as this.</p>
            <p>It will be seen that our main authorities are far later than their subjects and though that has little importance for this study, for general historical purposes it is important to know where they got their information and how they used it. A characteristically brilliant analysis of the sources for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> is to be found in <name type="pname">W. W. Tarn's</name>

pp. 1-133, while Beloch's much briefer "Quellen und Literatur," Vol. IV, Part 2, pp. 1-19, deals also, to some extent, with modern works as well as with ancient. Lionel Pearson's book, <hi rend="italic">The Lost Histories of Alexander the Great, Philological Monographs XX,</hi> American Philological Association, 1960, which appeared too late for me to use extensively, will be found to contain a great deal of valuable criticism.</p>
            <p>The composition of the list—the decision which items to include and which to exclude—has been difficult and has certainly been imperfect. Something of the kind has already been done in the "Zeittafeln" of Beloch, Vol. Ill, Part 2, pp. 450-464 and Vol. IV, Part 2, pp. 623-639, which I have found very helpful, but those were not devised to serve our special need. Since we are concerned with the striking of coins, the basic question is: who was in control of a certain territory at a certain time? Generally the answer bears on the operation of particular mints, but sometimes it is important to know that a ruler controlled such-and-such a place but did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> operate a mint there. When we know the location of a mint—as we do of the most important ones—we can follow its history and fortunes so far as the sources give us information, which is not as complete as one could wish. There are others, to be sure, not yet exactly located, as to which there is perhaps more to be known than we realize, and future scholars may wish that this or that piece of information had been included. But it is not my purpose here to record every mention of every place that has or may have connection with a mint. I am trying to give more general guidance, and since the decision that an item is worth citing must be a subjective one, I cannot hope that the reader's judgment will always coincide with mine. I have omitted, with entire confidence, all reference to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</name>, and to <name type="place">Cyrene</name> after its first surrender to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name>. I have omitted, with less feeling of certainty, affairs in Epirus, Aetolia and the barbarian countries of Asia lying outside the empire. I do not believe that any of these produced Alexander coins during the period treated—but I may turn out to have been mistaken.</p>
            <p>Since others besides <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> struck his types and name it has been necessary to carry the entries down beyond the date of his death. But as posthumous Alexanders appear very much later I have had to set a terminus, and the one selected has been the battle of Ipsus in 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>

Later revivals, by younger rulers, are brief and intermittent phenomena for which a complete chronology is not so necessary. The list might have been continued to the death of Cassander in 297, for Cassander also never issued his own types in the noble metals, but the portion of Diodorus which is complete ends with the 20th book, just before

Ipsus, and thereafter the materials for an outline are even less satisfactory than before. It has seemed wise to deal with later issues separately without trying to work them into an historic scheme.</p>

            </head>
            <p>America's gold coinage provided the subject for the sixth annual Coinage of the Americas Conference sponsored by the American Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing Council as a forum for the dissemination of emerging research in western hemisphere numismatics.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all interested in the topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants to come to know the Society's collections and library better during the days of the conference.</p>

            <p>This volume presents the proceedings of the sixth Coinage of the Americas Conference held at the American Numismatic Society on November 4 and 5, 1989. The paper of <name type="pname">Q. David Bowers</name> on collecting of gold coins in <name type="place">America</name> pinpoints one of the obstacles facing anyone who would contemplate a gathering devoted to American gold: gold coins have never been as widely collected or studied as, say, colonial or early federal coppers, and even today the number of specialists is relatively small.</p>
            <p>The 1989 effort faced other problems. Several individuals whose participation had been hoped for were unavailable, and an unexpected change of staff meant that organization of the gathering had to be assumed in mid-course by a non-specialist. But groundwork already laid, combined with the willingness of old friends to come forward on short notice—and, above all, the momentum generated by five successful conferences—both filled out and lent surprising variety to the program.</p>
            <p>One fixed point in the Coinage of the Americas Conferences has been <name type="pname">John W. McCloskey</name>. For the second time he prepared the booklet and slide set published in connection with it, and here presented the most technical of the studies, on Half Eagles of 1834–1838. His preliminary results should provide both a paradigm and a stimulus for further studies.</p>
            <p>Similarly technical was a paper on the 1861 Paquet Double Eagles, which subsequently became the focus of controversy as reported in the numismatic press. In sum, it was the Society's position that the paper submitted was not that which had been invited; even so, the substantive point of contention was resolved in favor of the authors, and it is regrettable that they nonetheless decided to withdraw their paper from publication here.</p>
            <pb n="x"/>
            <p>Three other papers illustrated the sluggish and haphazard development of minting policy in the <name type="place">United States</name>. The first of these was provided by <name type="pname">Richard G. Doty</name> of the National Numismatic Collection, Smithsonian Institution. His discussion of the vicissitudes of the short-lived <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> mints is a reminder that technology available is not necessarily technology implemented, and of the impact of personalities now all but forgotten on the history of our coinage. <name type="pname">Cory Gillilland</name>, also of the National Numismatic Collection, discussed the antiquity of what many regard as a modern use for coinage. <name type="pname">Walter H. Breen</name> both instructed and amused with his brisk review of the interplay of monetary theory and coinage during the last decades of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">David Bowers</name>'s paper has already been mentioned; it provides not only a glimpse into the development of numismatic connoisseurship in this country, but an illustration of the symbiosis between collecting and research. It was only when gold coins began to be a focus of collector interest that it was possible to move beyond widespread misinformation and toward understanding. The printed version of his paper understates its effectiveness as presented, since many of the coins mentioned were on view in the Society as he spoke.</p>
            <p>Almost from the moment they were created, coins began to be counterfeited. <name type="pname">Charles R. Hoskins</name>'s paper is necessarily anecdotal: though some counterfeiters have been proud enough of their work to boast about it for posterity, it is in the nature of the trade that inside information is hard to come by. It is welcome news—particularly given the dangerous nature of some of the conterfeits—that the phenomenon is in at least a temporary decline.</p>
            <p>The conference was rounded out by two papers that were conceived in relationship to one another, as the speakers represent opposite ends of the road to the creation of coinage. Representative <name type="pname">James A. Hayes</name> of <name type="place">Louisiana</name>, a member of the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs and its Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs and Coinage, traced the intricate legislative path a proposal must follow before a coin can come to be, employing for context the bicentennial of the <name type="place">United States</name> Congress. Cynics will see "politics as usual" in Rep. <name type="pname">Hayes</name>'s account of the creation of the Congressional commemoratives, but that very fact lends value to his documentation of the factors affecting coin production and design.</p>
            <p>The closing paper was delivered by <name type="pname">Elizabeth Jones</name>, Chief Sculptor and Engraver of the <name type="place">United States Mint</name>, who has ultimate responsibility for the appearance of our coins, and has herself designed
<pb n="xi"/>
many of the commemoratives of which Rep. <name type="pname">Hayes</name> spoke. <name type="pname">Miss Jones</name> focused on the marriage between politics and art that produced the most beautiful of modern coins, as well as less successful encounters in the history of U.S. coin design. No other Chief Engraver, active or retired, has commented so substantively on the artistic merits of earlier coins.</p>
            <p>This volume was to have closed with a catalogue of a portion of the <name type="pname">Harry W. Bass, Jr.</name> Reference Collection of <name type="place">United States</name> Federal Gold Coinage, together with reminiscences about <name type="pname">Mr. Bass</name>'s collecting career. Unfortunately that project proved far more complex and time-consuming than originally anticipated. The ANS hopes and expects to be able to publish this unique contribution at some future date. The Coinage of the Americas Conferences have often been remarked as the legacy of <name type="pname">Mr. Bass's</name> Presidency of the American Numismatic Society; the subject matter of the 1989 conference surely came closest to his own principal interest in the coinage of this hemisphere. Those who were present are unlikely to forget the excitement surrounding the display of over 600 pieces from the Bass collection. Specialists had available an array of die varieties so unprecedented that the revelation of the current ownership of the unique 1870-S $3 gold piece seemed almost an anticlimax, and amateurs were dazzled by the sheer mass of his material gathered in so small a compass.</p>
            <p>At the end of two days even those who, like the editor, knew little of America's gold coinage were surprised by its variety and complexity. Virtually all the papers published here reflect the oral presentations almost verbatim, and perhaps this volume will succeed in communicating not only the substance but the spirit of the 1989 Coinage of the Americas Conference.</p>

            <p>Classic gold Half Eagles were struck for only a short period from 1834 to 1838. The series consists of the five <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> dates for this period and the branch mint issues from <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> in 1838. The five <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> dates are all readily available—they are frequently offered for sale at major coin auctions and are available at most major coin shows. A date set would therefore be quite easy to assemble. But this series was struck during a period in our history when the coinage dies were prepared individually. During this time the central devices were prepared from a coinage hub but the features around the periphery of the dies were individually punched into the dies. This manufacturing process makes it possible to identify easily the individual coinage dies that were used in the series.</p>
            <p>Study of the coins in this series has led to the identification of 21 obverse and 17 reverse dies. Total mintage for the seven dates in the series is just over 2.1 million pieces. This gives an average life of just over 100,000 coins for each obverse die and almost 120,000 coins for each reverse die. Identification of the coins in the series by die variety expands the seven coin series into a fascinating collection of 31 varieties with many interesting and unusual features. Some of these varieties are common and go through a long sequence of die states, while others are rare and represent a challenge to obtain for one's collection. A collection by die variety thus becomes a beautiful historical representation of the gold coinage struck in early <name type="place">America</name>.</p>
            <p>These gold coins played an important role in the business ventures of the period and allowed the public to conduct financial transactions more easily. All 31 varieties in the series represent those that I have personally seen and studied over the past few years. The descriptions that are given and the observations that are made in this article were obtained from personal study and comparison of actual coins. While I do not claim that my listing is complete, I feel that my search has been extensive enough to have allowed me to observe all of the common varieties and all but a few of the rare varieties that exist in the series. I have identified the varieties of over 400 pieces at coin shows I have attended, and of over 100 more from photographs that have appeared in auction catalogues. In addition I have studied the 12 specimens from the series that are owned by the American Numismatic Society, the 34 pieces in the National Collection at the Smithsonian Institution in <name type="place">Washington, D.C.</name>, and the 67 pieces in the personal holdings of a <name type="place">New York</name> collector. Furthermore I have been able to acquire a personal collection which contains examples of 28 of the 31 varieties that I have identified.

Of the three varieties that I do not own, examples of two are in the ANS, with the other variety being held by the SI.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The obverse dies for the various dates are really quite easy to identify from a few key features. The central device of Liberty was created from a hub and is nearly identical for all of the obverses. The dates on the various dies were individually punched into the dies and vary considerably in size, style, and location. The date alone is usually sufficient to distinguish the obverse dies from each other, but it is recognized that date positioning might fail to identify some obverses. For positive identification of the obverse, the position of the 13 stars on the obverse periphery was recorded. These 13 stars were individually punched into the dies and their positions vary noticeably among the dies. In particular the position of the outside point of each star relative to the denticles was recorded. Each star is recorded as having its outer point extending out toward the space between two denticles, extending out toward the upper edge or lower edge of a denticle or toward the center of a denticle. These star patterns are sufficiently different that a positive identification can be made when there is any question about whether two obverses are identical. Other characteristics such as the position of the stars relative to the bust or the size of the forehead curl are used when they are distinctive for a particular obverse.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The central device containing the eagle and the shield outline was sunk into the dies as a single unit and is nearly identical from die to die. In contrast the features around the periphery were punched individually into the dies, creating characteristics that clearly distinguish the individual dies. The letters in <name type="place">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</name> vary in relation to each other and in relation to the other devices. The position of the denomination 5D varies with respect to the feathered shaft and the olive stem. The leaves in the olive branch vary in position and size and in their relation to the lettering. Some reverses show a berry in the olive branch and others do not. Some reverses show the eagle with a tongue while others do not. In general, there are enough individual die characteristics to identify positively the reverse dies in the series.</p>

               <p>This study is intended to be a preliminary investigation of the

classic Half Eagle series to obtain a better understanding of the patterns of die usage during this period. I have refrained from numbering the varieties because emission sequences for the varieties have not yet been established and additions to this list of known varieties are bound to occur once the results of this study become available to the numismatic public. Furthermore no complete description of the individual obverse and reverse dies has been included because new distinguishing features continue to be found as the study progresses. It is hoped that the results of this study will be used as a guide for further studies on the series and serve as the foundation for a comprehensive reference work on classic gold coinage.</p>

                  <p>1. 1834 Half Eagle Date Styles.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>There are nine known varieties for this date struck from five obverse and four reverse dies. Reported mintage for this date was 657,460 pieces, the largest mintage for any date in the series.<ref target="CH1-n1">1</ref> Three distinct date styles are known for the five obverses of this date. For the first style the date has a block 8 that resembles two circles resting on top of one another <ref target="#fig-2">(fig. 1a.)</ref>.<ref target="CH1-n2">2</ref> The digit 4 is small with a long crossbar that extends out well beyond the right base of the digit. Two obverses have this date style. One has the digit
<pb n="5"/>
4 nearly touching the curl while the other has a triple-punched 4 that is distant from the curl. The obverse with the triple 4 is very common and has been seen with three different reverses. The triple image of the digit 4 fades through the use of the obverse die but it can be seen clearly on examples of all three varieties. This obverse also has thin letters in the word LIBERTY on the ribbon that runs through the hair.</p>
               <p>The second date style for this year has a script 8 with a thick center that runs at a diagonal downward from left to right. I have called this a "fancy 8" <ref target="#fig-3">(fig. 1b)</ref>. This style has a large 4 with the crossbar extending out no further than the right base of the digit. The digit 1 is distinctive in that the upper serif rises sharply to a narrow peak, while the digit 3 has a long center spike that nearly touches the top curve of the digit. Two obverses have this date style. One of these obverses has a digit 4 that is very close to the curl and positioned so that it extends out beyond the left edge of the curl. The other obverse of this style has a digit 4 that is distant from the curl and positioned completely under it.</p>
               <p>The third date style for this year has a fancy 8 and a large digit 4 with a large crosslet on the right end of the crossbar <ref target="#fig-4">(fig. 1c)</ref>. This obverse was used to strike what has come to be known as the "crosslet 4" variety. This distinctive variety is known to be rare and is one of the few die varieties that has been consistently catalogued and identified in auction catalogues over the years.</p>
               <p>Four reverses are known for the nine varieties for this year. The key feature in identification of these reverses is the position of the denomination 5D relative to the feathered shaft and the branch stem above. For each reverse the percentage of the 5 under the feathered shaft and the percentage of the D under the branch stem has been recorded. These percentages are subjective figures since there are no straight lines on the devices from which to reference the readings, but the positions are distinctive enough to identify the reverses in most cases. Other reverse keys include recording whether there is a berry within the leaves of the olive branch and whether the eagle has a tongue.</p>
               <p>These features are recorded for the four reverses and produce the patterns given in Table 1. The known die pairs for this date are listed at the bottom of the table. Three of the four reverses used in 1834 have also been identified on coins dated 1835. The only reverse not used in later years is the third reverse with the 5 in the denomination completely to the left of the feathered shaft. It is unlikely that this reverse will be found on pieces with later dates, because it was already badly cracked when it appeared with the third marriage of
<pb n="6"/>
1834. This reverse goes through a series of die states with a heavy die crack developing through the base of the letters NITED. This crack later extends to the rim over the U and also extends out to the right of the D. At the present time I consider five of the varieties of this date as common; the four others appear scarce to rare, with the relative rarity among the four scarce varieties still undetermined.</p>

371,534 coins. Three distinct date styles are known for the three obverses of this date. The first date style has a block 8 and a short narrow flag on the digit 5 <ref target="#fig-5">(fig. 2a)</ref>. The digit 3 also has a short center arc and the digit 1 has a shallow upper serif. The one obverse with this date style dominates specimens of this year. Half of the six known varieties, and nearly 75% of all the coins that I have seen of this date, have this obverse.</p>
               <p>The second date style has a block 8 and a long curved flag to the digit 5 <ref target="#fig-6">(fig. 2b)</ref>. The digit 1 has a shallow upper serif, while the digit 3 has a long center spike that nearly touches the upper curve of the digit. This obverse appears with only one reverse and this marriage is a rare variety for the year. While this variety is difficult to locate there is a nice example of it in the collection of the ANS and a magnificent proof specimen in the SI. A photograph of this variety is also presented in <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name>'s encyclopedia.<ref target="CH1-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The third date style for this year has a fancy 8 and a 5 with a long curved flag <ref target="#fig-7">(fig. 2c)</ref>. The digit 1 has an upper serif that rises sharply up to a narrow peak. This obverse has been identified with two different reverses.</p>
               <p>Four of the five reverses of this year were used in other years. They can easily be distinguished by the position of the denomination 5D and by noting the presence or absence of a tongue. The third reverse is the only one that was used only for pieces dated 1835 and it is rare.</p>

               <p>In fact both varieties with this reverse are very difficult to obtain. The reverse is easy to identify because it is the only one used at the <name type="place">Philadelphia Mint</name> on which a leaf comes up very near to the left side of the U in UNITED. All other reverses of this year have both leaves well below the U. A good rarity estimate for this reverse is yet to be determined, but this study indicates that no more than 5% of 1835 Half Eagles would have this reverse.</p>

are difficult to distinguish in this way. Interestingly, three of these five obverses have strong die cracks; their development through the life of the die can easily be seen on many of these pieces. The first obverse has a die crack that runs between the fifth and sixth stars from the lower left and continues through the curls on the head. The second obverse has a heavy die crack that runs through the eighth star, down through the bust and through the digit 6 in the date. The sixth obverse has a crack that runs through the bust and down between the digits 8 and 3 in the date. These cracks identify many pieces of this year, but star positioning in reference to the denticles is often used for positive identification when no cracks are visible.</p>

               <p>The first two reverses for this year were used in previous years, with the last three used only to strike 1836 Half Eagles. Only pieces with the first obverse have proved to be rare, with the other seven varieties all appearing regularly. The fifth reverse for this year has a distinctive feature in that the left edge of the 5 in the denomination is well to the right of the left edge of the feathered shaft.</p>

               <p>The first date style has a block 8 with a tall slender digit 1 <ref target="#fig-10">(fig. 4a)</ref>. The digit 7 has a shallow arc over it, and the digit 3 has a short center spike. The two obverses with this date style can be

distinguished by the position of the digit 7 relative to the curl. On one obverse the 7 is centered under the curl while on the other obverse the 7 is positioned further to the right and partially below the gap between the curls.</p>

               <p>The second date style for this year has a fancy 8, a small 1 with a shallow upper serif and a 7 with a sharply curved upper edge <ref target="#fig-11">(fig. 4b)</ref>. The digit 3 has a long center spike that nearly touches the upper curve of the digit. This variety is known as the small date variety for this year.</p>
               <p>The reverses of this year can be identified by the position of the denomination 5D relative to the feathered shaft and the olive branch. The three reverses were used only in 1837, each with only a single obverse die as far as is currently known. All three varieties are scarce but the third variety with the small date is the most difficult of the three to locate.</p>

               <p>The last <name type="place">Philadelphia Mint</name> issue in the classic series is known in only two varieties struck from two obverse and two reverse dies. Both obverses for this date have fancy 8s in the date but other date characteristics distinguish them. One obverse has a shallow upper serif on the 1 with the second 8 entirely below the curl. The other obverse has a 1 with an upper serif that rises sharply to a narrow peak and a second 8 that is only 80% below the curl and very close to the digit 3 <ref target="#fig-12">(fig. 5a)</ref>.</p>
               <p>The two reverses of this date can be distinguished by the position of the D under the olive branch. This date has a reported mintage of 286,588 coins at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. This issue is considered scarce but I have not found examples hard to obtain. Neither variety can be classified as scarcer than the other, as they have been observed with about the same frequency. So far as is known, each obverse appears with only one reverse. Neither reverse of this year was used to strike pieces of other years.</p>

The date also has two block 8s, while both obverses used in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> have fancy 8s. This distinctive date style would seem to characterize the <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> Half Eagles for this year and distinguish the obverse die from all others of this year.

               <p>The two reverses of this year can be identified by the leaves in relation to the letter U in UNITED. The first reverse has two leaves well below the letter U. The second reverse has one leaf below the U but the other leaf runs up and nearly touches the U along the bottom of the letter. This reverse also develops a strong die break that runs at a diagonal across the reverse from 2 to 8 o'clock. Both varieties are scarce with the first reverse a little more difficult to obtain. The 1838-C must be considered the rarest in the series today, with most examples being well worn. The SI has four beautiful examples of this date, three of these with the second reverse.</p>

               <p>Mintage for this date was reported to be 20,583 coins, the second smallest figure for the classic Half Eagle series. There is only one known variety for this date. The obverse has two fancy 8s in the date with the D mint mark over the left side of the 3 in the date and located about halfway between this digit and the bust. While not usually mentioned in auction descriptions, the date on the obverse has the first three digits doubled at the base with an extra upper serif of the 1 showing along the left side of the upright of the digit. This doubling is clearly visible on high grade specimens but fades with circulation wear and is difficult to see on specimens in grades of VF or lower.</p>
               <p>This date is the second rarest in the series, with examples coming up more often than the 1838-C date. The average grade for specimens 1838-D is also much higher than for the <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> issue of the same year. There are three beautiful examples of the 1838-D in the SI, the best of these being an MS-63. The edge reeding is also wider on the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> specimens than on the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> coins of the same year. The <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> reeding matches that of the <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> Mint, and again provides a distinctive feature for authenticating genuine specimens from this early branch mint.</p>

            <p>Marketing strategies used during recent years have prompted the public to purchase <name type="place">United States</name> government-issued gold bullion coins. The bullion coin concept, however, is not so recent or innovative for the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Treasury. The marketing implication, though, has been that these new gold bullion coins which include an indication of their weight and fineness represent an innovative idea on the part of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Congress and the Treasury Department. That is to say, the idea of issuing a bullion coin was assumed not to have been explored previously by the <name type="place">United States</name> Government.</p>
            <p>In fact, more than 130 years have passed since a similar suggestion was made within the financial circles of the government. In 1852 the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint's seventh Director, <name type="pname">George N. Eckert</name>, stated in a letter to <name type="pname">James B. Longacre</name>, then Chief Engraver of the Mint, that "several mints are authorized to assay, refine and stamp bullion, with the weight and fineness thereof...."<ref target="CH2-n1">1</ref> He then directed that a design be prepared for a bullion disk to be bought and sold by financial traders.</p>
            <p>In his communication dated September 4, 1852, Director <name type="pname">Eckert</name> also referred to a section of the <name type="place">California</name> Branch Mint Bill (Public Law XXV of the Thirty-Second Congress) which had been signed into law on July 3.<ref target="CH2-n2">2</ref> Although both men were based in the Mint in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, <name type="pname">Eckert</name> by formal letter asked that the Chief Engraver begin designs for the obverse and reverse of large disks weighing 50 ounces at .990 of fineness. <name type="pname">Eckert</name> instructed, "the size of such a disk will correspond to the model in wood herewith presented. Other pieces of 100 ozs &amp; 200 ozs will be issued if practicable &amp; desirable."<ref target="CH2-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Mint Director no doubt was aware of the lengthy Congressional debates regarding the then recently passed legislation. Considering them now may help to understand why a bullion coin was considered at the time. After the introduction of the bill in the Senate on December 5, 1851, and the referral to the House of Representatives on December 15, there had ensued heated discussions both in the Capitol chambers and in the press regarding the California Mint bill. On January 7, 1852, the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Daily Times</hi> printed a report of Secretary of the Treasury <name type="pname">Thomas Corwin</name>, wherein he reminded members of the Congress that the distance from San Francisco, by way of the <name type="place">Isthmus of Panama</name> and <name type="place">New York</name> to the mint at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, is 6,250 miles. He referred to the transportation cost of the precious metals found there as a "burdensome tax" levied upon the mining interests in <name type="place">California</name>. Cautioning the legislators, the Secretary stated that the expenses of the Mint and branches had greatly increased since the accession of <name type="place">California</name>, and would be
<pb n="19"/>
augmented further if Congress should decide to establish two additional branches at <name type="place">San Francisco</name> and <name type="place">New York</name>. He continued, "I would therefore suggest...the propriety of authorizing a small seigniorage on the bullion deposited by corporations or individuals for the purpose of covering the actual expenses of coinage, instead of allowing the latter to remain as an exclusive charge upon the Treasury." This, he noted, was the universal practice at all other national mints and the charge was but a mere fraction of a per cent, amounting only to a few cents per ounce.<ref target="CH2-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Congressional debates during the next six months reveal that the Treasury had in mind a charge over and above the cost of assaying the gold. In simple terms they wished to provide for a fee on the actual production of the coinage, a charge for the official government stamp of authority.</p>
            <p>Several of the points raised by the Secretary in this report provoked diverse public comments. First of all, the idea that <name type="place">New York</name> might become the site of the nation's chief mint caused violent reaction in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. On March 4 a resolution of the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Legislature was laid before the U.S. Senate instructing the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Senators "to vote against or use all honorable exertion to prevent the removal of the Mint from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> or the establishment of one in <name type="place">New York</name>."<ref target="CH2-n5">5</ref> Lengthy rebuttals extolling the virtues of having the mother mint in <name type="place">New York</name> then appeared on the front page of several issues of the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Daily Times</hi>.<ref target="CH2-n6">6</ref> Likewise, the Secretary's recommendation for the creation of seigniorage caused concern in the national legislature. On June 15 <name type="place">James Brooks</name>, Representative from <name type="place">New York</name>, declared to his fellow members that he felt no more important subject than that of seigniorage could come before the Congress. He defined the term as a right imposed by the old European feudal barons as sovereigns, called seigneurs <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi>, upon the coinage of their realms. He exclaimed that he could not comprehend why this seigniorage, this relic of feudal times, was to be imposed for the first time upon the American people. He explained that the first bill before the House for consideration would place upon the gold producers a seigniorage charge at the mints. The cost would be determined at the discretion of the Secretary of Treasury but would not exceed one per cent. The second bill which had come from the Senate without one word of discussion there proposed a seigniorage of one half of one per cent upon all gold or silver deposited in the mints, whether coined, or cast into bars or ingots. <name type="place">Mr. Brooks</name> colorfully described his feelings regarding the bills:
<q>To levy a seigniorage, then, on gold and silver now,
<pb n="20"/>
...when we are scarce of silver,...is the very error of the moon. A proposition, under existing circumstances, more preposterous, as it seems to me, never came from erring man. My resistance to it springs, not only from the tax it imposes upon the <name type="place">California</name> miner—for in such a case the miner is the man who pays the seigniorage if his gold is coined at home—but because the mischievous act would reach our commerce, our freighting trade at the <name type="place">Isthmus of Panama</name>, our insurance offices, our bullion dealers at home, and send the gold and silver in one continuous, over-whelming stream to the <name type="place">British</name> Mint.<ref target="CH2-n7">7</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Of course, it was not only the <name type="place">California</name> miner who concerned the Representative from <name type="place">New York</name>. The <name type="place">New York</name> bankers feared that a large portion of the <name type="place">California</name> gold would be driven to <name type="place">European</name> mints and the conversion to American gold coinage would be greatly restricted—and thus their profitable businesses would suffer.<ref target="CH2-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to an inquiry concerning seigniorage from the Chairman of the House Committee on <name type="place">Ways</name> and <name type="place">Means</name>, the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, <name type="pname">William L. Hodge</name>, explained the practice of the <name type="place">British</name> Mint. He reported that individuals in <name type="place">England</name> did not present their bullion to the Mint as the assay of old bullion was done by private individuals designated by the bank or the Mint. The charge for such was born by the individuals who requested the service. The Bank of <name type="place">England</name> then purchased the gold prepared for coinage at an advantage of three cents per ounce, equal to about one fifth of one per cent of the value. The bank then paid the Mint for the expense of the production of the coinage.<ref target="CH2-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Since alloying, assaying, and coining of gold is an actual manufacture of a raw material, the Secretary said that he could see no reason why this should be conducted for the benefit of individuals at the expense of the government. If done, he said, like claims could be made by the agriculturist to have his wheat ground into flour"</p>
            <p>The Secretary then offered a proposal for handling the current, large amounts of gold at the Mint. Depositors requesting coin bars or ingots would pay less in seigniorage or production cost than if the Mint were to return regular coin to them. The seigniorage charge for ingots of $50 or $100 would be less than the equivalent amount in $20 and $10 coins. The expense to the government would be substantially less if the ingots were made in denominations of $500 or $1,000, or even of larger amounts. The Secretary ventured that probably the depositors would require their bullion to be returned to them from the Treasury in ingots of large denominations. With
<pb n="21"/>
the mint stamp the ingots would be as valuable and available as coinage.<ref target="CH2-n10">10</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>Obviously, the stamp of the official <name type="place">United States</name> Mint was considered by the Treasury Department and the public as differing from that of an Assay Office. The $50 issues of the <name type="place">San Francisco</name> Assay Office <ref target="#fig-16">(fig. 1)</ref>
               <ref target="CH2-n11">11</ref> had been mentioned in Congress as "spurious coinage" and in the press as "cumbrous slugs which had excluded the small coin from circulation and had seriously clogged the transaction of business.<ref target="CH2-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Secretary of the Treasury felt that public and private banking institutions would prefer the Mint's large ingots over coins since they could be retained in vaults as specie capital. In cases of foreign demand the ingots would be more convenient to export.<ref target="CH2-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>When passed on June 22, 1852, the <name type="place">California</name> Mint Act specified in Section 8 that individuals might request the Mint or its branches to refine and assay gold lumps or dust and cast it into bars or ingots which would be stamped with value or fineness. Fees for such services were to be determined by the Director of the Mint, under the control of the Secretary of the Treasury.<ref target="CH2-n14">14</ref> No reference to seigniorage was included in the final law.</p>
            <p>Mint Director <name type="pname">Eckert</name>, then only recently confirmed by the Senate, was anxious to carry out this law as he understood it. In his September 4, 1852 directive to <name type="pname">Longacre</name> he stated that he intended "to recommend to the department the issue of large disks or coins, of a uniform weight and fineness, with such devises and inscriptions (in addition to the mere statement of fineness and weight) as shall be sufficiently protective of the pieces against fraudulent imitation." He added, "the only inscriptions indispensable appear to be the words 'Mint of the <name type="place">United States</name>. <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. 1852. Weight ozs. 50. Fineness 990'." It is interesting to note that the Director
<pb n="22"/>
saw no need to include the denomination; he emphasized weight and fineness.<ref target="CH2-n15">15</ref>

He had survived his battles with former Director <name type="pname">Patterson</name> which had jeopardized his tenure at the Mint. Understandably he was hesitant to set an exact time for the execution of the requested designs and dies. He cautiously responded on September 11 that he had not been able to arrive at a satisfactory solution to the problem of preparing a device for the proposed disks which would be "sufficiently protective against fraudulent imitation." He wrote that an easily executed device appeared to be incompatible with the desired security against fraudulent imitation. What is subtracted from a rapidly executed design, he said, necessarily increases the facility of imitation. "Simplicity in the design is not only admissible but desirable, yet this simplicity often makes the largest claim upon the care and skill, and consequently, upon the time of the artist." He then pointed out other difficulties.</p>

            <p>The dies would be much larger in the facial area than those used for the regular coinage of the Mint; yet, "the facilities for working them would not admit of any greater actual relief than that of the smaller legal coins....<ref target="CH2-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Longacre</name> ventured to suggest a three month requirement for the dies to be completed, but continued to place caveats upon the requirements. He said time was dependent upon risks in experimentation, facilities, and much needed assistance. With this long letter he included four drawings now in the National Numismatic Collection, SI. In the letter, also now in the SI, he described his drawings:
<q>The design marked No. 1 <ref target="#fig-19">[fig. 4]</ref> is proposed as the obverse: its purpose is to express a representation of <name type="place">America</name>, by a female figure, in aboriginal costume, seated, contemplating one of the usual emblems of liberty, elevated on a spear, which she holds in her right hand; her left hand resting on a globe, presenting the western hemisphere. The whole surrounded by a circle of thirteen stars. No. 2 <ref target="#fig-20">[fig. 5]</ref> is designed as the reverse to no. 1. The device, the American eagle with his wings [ ] (not legible) and with the Federal escutcheon as usual on his breast: encircled by the requisite inscription for the piece. The device for this is more carefully drawn in No. 4.</q>
               <q>No. 3 <ref target="#fig-21">[fig. 6]</ref> is a sketch for an obverse of but little ornament, besides the inscription; to be used only in case No. 1 should be considered too elaborate: for this, No. 4 <ref target="#fig-22">[fig. 7]</ref> would be the appropriate reverse.</q>
               <q>My own preference would be in favour of the adoption of No. 1 &amp; 2. Yet it is my duty to state that the execution of these will in all probability require considerably more time; than the others.<ref target="CH2-n18">18</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Also in the National Numismatic Collection is an ink drawing <ref target="#fig-23">(fig. 8)</ref> presumably by <name type="pname">Longacre</name>, perhaps inspired by <name type="pname">Eckert</name> though not mentioned in this letter, which provides a sketch for a bullion piece and which is dated 1852. The designs numbered one and two, however, are of greatest interest at this point.</p>
            <p>Director <name type="pname">Eckert</name> responded to <name type="pname">Longacre</name> on September 22. He stated that he felt <name type="pname">Longacre</name> had overrated the dangers of fraudulent imitation and had consequently been led to propose complicated designs difficult to execute. <name type="pname">Eckert</name> believed that bullion coins would not be as susceptible to fraud as ordinary coins. He stated, "they will not be used for circulation, in the ordinary sense of the word, but will merely be bought and sold as merchandise by banks, brokers, and exchange dealers."</p>

            <p>Secondly, "such pieces would not be taken simply on the faith of the impression, but would also be weighed and measured...their genuineness would thereby alone be proved...independent of the Mint stamp." He reiterated, "it appears that a very considerable degree of simplicity is allowable in the devices, and yet these would prove...sufficiently protective against the perpetration of fraud."<ref target="CH2-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>He did not convince the Chief Engraver. Within two days <name type="pname">Longacre</name> responded that he did not agree with the Director's prediction for the use of the proposed issue.<ref target="CH2-n20">20</ref> More than a century later it is interesting to note how closely <name type="pname">Eckert's</name> thoughts about the function of bullion coins correspond to current commercial practices.</p>
            <p>By January 1853, the office of the Secretary of the Treasury in <name type="place">Washington</name> responded to the Mint Director's recommendation. The departmental suggestion relative to the issue of ingots of refined gold was made in a letter dated January 24, 1853. A letter from <name type="pname">Eckert</name> dated December 29 was acknowledged in the Treasury's answer as was the receipt of "the accompanying disk in silver of the proposed issue..." Treasury asked "whether it would not be more convenient for the intended purpose if the ingot was issued of the exact value of one thousand dollars instead of the specific weight of 50 ounces." They added that if the Director objected, he had approval to proceed. The silver pattern was said to be returned to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> with the department's communication.<ref target="CH2-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>On January 27, Director <name type="pname">Eckert</name>, writing to Secretary <name type="pname">Corwin</name>, said he had already considered the suggestion that the issue should be of the value of exactly $1,000, but the difficulties of such appeared insurmountable or, at least, in need of legislation. "The law, in explaining what gold is equivalent to a dollar, prescribes certain proportions, viz. 9 parts gold, one part alloy of which the silver must not exceed one half. But if the gold is in any different proportion we are not, as I think, entitled to say what it is worth." He then speculated that if the .990 fine disk contained the same amount of fine gold as $1,000 in coin, and if it should be returned to the Mint for coinage, it would be necessary to alloy it with copper down to .900 fine. By so doing, the depositor would be charged the expense of the copper used, and therefore, the value would not be worth $1,000. To avoid such difficulties, he argued that the only mint stamp should be fineness and weight. Again prophetic, he wrote, "Indeed, I suppose that value will be fluctuating, dependent on the demands of the market."<ref target="CH2-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By February 1853, the correspondence between <name type="pname">Eckert</name> and <name type="pname">Longacre</name> no longer contained references to gold bullion. Rather, concerns over silver coin designs seemed all consuming.</p>

            <p>The following month <name type="pname">Eckert</name> resigned his post and by June his successor, <name type="pname">Thomas Pettit</name>, had died in office. As if all of this were not enough to make matters at the Mint hectic, the $3 gold coin was authorized by Congress on February 21, 1853.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Longacre</name> was asked to create a design for this new gold $3 coin <ref target="#fig-24">(fig. 9)</ref>. The representation of <name type="place">America</name> in aboriginal costume <ref target="#fig-25">(fig. 10)</ref> to which he had made reference in his September 11 letter of the previous year surfaced again. The portrait proposed for the 1854 $3 coin was conceptually an enlargement of the head detail of the seated Indian Princess with feathered headdress which he had suggested earlier for the bullion gold. <name type="pname">Longacre</name> could not forget his beauty. Later, when verbalizing his feelings, he wrote, "the feathered tiara is a characteristic of the primitiveness of our hemisphere...In regard then this emblem of <name type="place">America</name> is a proper and well defined portion of our national inheritance...."<ref target="CH2-n23">23</ref> Indeed, his Indian head cent of 1859 became just such a symbol.</p>
            <p>The thought that the design for the $3 gold coin had sprung full-blown from <name type="pname">Longacre's</name> original ideas without change or modification is not entirely correct. The concept obviously had been brewing in his mind for a number of years. The change from a full length, seated figure to a portrait was an adjustment of necessity. The artistic philosophy of the $3 coin portrait may be traced to the earlier design for the bullion disk.</p>
            <p>It is not unusual to find that designs develop in the mind of the artist and then reappear in various renderings throughout a career.
<pb n="29"/>
The idea that the concept for the $3 feathered portrait of 1854, or for that matter the Indian head cent of 1859, quickly came into existence, unformed and untested in the mind of the artist, is naive. <name type="pname">Longacre</name> felt a need to present his own personification of <name type="place">America</name> and he revived the idea whenever the occasion warranted. He appreciated its meaning as did others of a later time. Even after his death, the design was again proposed—as the obverse design on patterns of the 1870s <ref target="#fig-26">(fig. 11)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The engraver's designs did not disappear; nor was <name type="pname">Eckert</name>'s vision of a large denomination bullion coin buried forever. There were later attempts made on behalf of the western states to authorize a large denomination gold coin. Legislation for a $50 coin was passed by the U.S. Senate in 1854 but the bill died in the House of Representatives. The idea surfaced again with the 1877 patterns for a gold $50 coin <ref target="#fig-27">(fig. 12)</ref>. Both the coin proposed by the 1854 legislation and the later 1877 patterns included an indication of denomination not weight and fineness. The same indication occurred with the issuance
<pb n="30"/>
of the $50 Panama Pacific commemorative of 1915 <ref target="#fig-28">(fig. 13)</ref>. Experiments with commercial, international, goloid, and metric coinage in the 1870s and 1880s included an indication of weight and fineness; but the theory for each differed from that of <name type="pname">Eckert</name>. The concept involved the metallic content of coinage or the establishment of an international monetary exchange, not of bullion value.</p>

understood. His thoughts that they would not be used for circulation but would be bought and sold as merchandise by banks, brokers, and exchange dealers has been demonstrated.</p>
            <p>The success of the Mint's bullion gold program of 1986 is almost legend. Time will tell if the success continues. In 1852 the bullion coin was only an idea ahead of its time. What is yet to be discovered, however, is the fate of "the silver disk" mentioned in the Treasury Department's January 1853 correspondence.</p>

            <p>These days we are used to being able to pay for a loaf of bread with paper dollars or pocket change—without being charged different prices according to what we pay in; or to take out a loan one day and pay it back in a month or a year without having to worry that for the "greenbacks" we borrowed we might have to repay at face value in gold coins costing far more greenbacks. Few realize how hard-won was this privilege.</p>
            <p>A century ago it did not exist. It did not exist partly because nobody knew how to make it happen, partly because many actively opposed it. Those who sought it (the "international bimetallists" and the "free silver" crusaders) represented themselves as advocates of honest debtors (the working poor), but were actually—even if unknowingly—subserving instead the interests of wealthy western silver mine owners. Those who opposed it (the "gold bugs" or gold standard apologists) represented themselves as advocates of honest creditors and entrepreneurs. Many had even grown wealthy from the shifting exchange rates between paper money and silver dollars and gold of the same denominations, or from owning gold mines. Both sides touted their preferred coinage metal as a panacea for the nation's economic woes.</p>
            <p>But no matter which side was ahead at any given time, they were playing a zero-sum game: their backers' gain was others' loss, and they wanted to keep it that way. Each side's rhetoric was obfuscatory; even generations later, it has not been easy to tell who were the villains, who the misguided idealists, who the heroes if any. And among the byproducts of their political battles are some of the extreme rarities in American gold coinage—rarities because political factors kept issues limited, or contributed to their disappearance. In their own day, the 1879–80 Stellas and 1879 Metric Double Eagles were "VIP" samples of a diplomat's bizarre proposal for an international coinage that would supposedly end the rivalry of gold and silver (whereas the only real way to do that was somehow to stabilize falling silver prices); today, they are among the most coveted of all numismatic souvenirs of official folly.</p>
            <p>This political zero-sum game, this joust between the knights of gold and silver (as <name type="pname">Trumbull White</name> called it), was not the intent of the Founding Fathers.<ref target="CH3-n1">1</ref> When <name type="pname">Alexander Hamilton</name> devised our national decimal monetary system, he preferred a gold standard as more stable than a bimetallic standard. Gold, as <name type="pname">Hamilton</name> believed, was less rapidly and less drastically affected than silver in price or purchasing power by fluctuations in supply: "As long as gold, either from its intrinsic superiority as a metal [i.e. immunity to corrosion], from its rarity, or from the prejudices of mankind, retains so con-

siderable a pre-eminence in value over silver as it has hitherto had, a natural consequence of this seems to be that its condition will be more stationary. The revolutions, therefore, which may take place in the comparative value of gold and silver will be changes in the state of the latter rather than that of the former."<ref target="CH3-n2">2</ref> A century later, <name type="pname">J.L. Laughlin</name> was still convinced: "Increase the production of gold enormously, and it is eagerly absorbed, and so does not undergo much depreciation."<ref target="CH3-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, because in <name type="pname">Hamilton's</name> day gold was in short supply while Latin American silver was increasingly plentiful, he adopted a bimetallic system as most likely to insure enough specie to run the country: the alternative everyone feared was fiat money, un-backed paper currency, "not worth a Continental," false promises to pay in specie, like the <name type="place">Rhode Island Bills</name> of Credit notes of 1710–86 <ref target="#fig-30">(fig. 1)</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <name type="pname">Hamilton's</name> policy could not prevent eventual coin shortages, and the answers included copper tokens and paper. What the states could not legally do, the private sector eventually did, and myriads of types of bank notes passed at discounts if at all, just like their Colonial ancestors. (One wonders if today's advocates of privatizing paper money are even aware of its dismal history.) Many historians, following Sen. <name type="pname">Thomas Hart Benton</name>, blamed both the proliferation of paper and the mass melting of gold until mid-1834 on <name type="pname">Hamilton's</name> miscalculation of the ratio of gold to silver as 15:1, without explaining what that meant or why.</p>
            <p>What it meant was that, following <name type="pname">Hamilton's</name> "Report," the Mint Act of 1792 set weight standards for coinage so that a $10 piece would contain 270 gr of gold 11/12 fine = 247.5 gr pure gold, while $10 in federal silver dollars would contain 15 times that weight of pure silver = 3712.5 gr. Sen. <name type="pname">Benton</name> thought <name type="pname">Hamilton</name> wanted to drive gold out of circulation; evidently <name type="pname">Benton</name> had not done his homework. <name type="pname">Hamilton's</name> figure in fact agreed with <name type="pname">Jefferson's</name> and that in the "Report of the Grand Committee of Continental Congress" (1785), which gave the ratio in <name type="place">France</name> as 15:1, in <name type="place">England</name> 15.2:1, in <name type="place">Spain</name> 16:1. In 1792, the ratio difference was not enough to cause trouble had the Mint become able to make gold coins. What neither <name type="pname">Hamilton</name> had anticipated nor <name type="pname">Benton</name> recalled was the Reign of Terror <ref target="#fig-31">(fig. 2)</ref>.</p>

            <p>In 1793, the French Republic under the Terror raised the weight of the Ecu de 6 Livres from 29.488 gm to 30 gm, its precious metal content from 0.8695 to 0.8836 oz pure silver, while setting the gold 24 livres at 7.6 gm containing 0.2199 oz pure gold. This meant 24 livres in silver would contain 3.5344 oz pure silver, for a ratio of 16.07:1. By July 1795, when the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint began deliver-
<pb n="37"/>
ing Half Eagles, each ounce of gold, legally worth 15 oz of silver in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, would bring 15.5 oz in <name type="place">Paris</name>. Bullion dealers and money brokers (foreign exchange specialists) promptly began buying federal gold coins in quantity at par (probably in <name type="place">Mexican</name> silver, which was legal tender) and shipping them to <name type="place">Paris</name> at a premium.<ref target="CH3-n4">4</ref> Whether from limited mintage or high meltage, early <name type="place">U.S.</name> gold rarities are byproducts of Gresham's Law.</p>
            <p>Forgetting the mint's public relations function as a gesture of national sovereignty (it was then under the State Department, not the Treasury), <name type="pname">Laughlin</name> even called the mint in its earliest days a failure at keeping the country supplied with small change, "a useless expense to the nation, but a source of profit to the money-brokers." Under the mint's original "free coinage" policy (no seignorage charged against gold or silver bullion depositors) "the possessor of either metal has two places where he can dispose of it—the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint, and the bullion market; he can either have it coined and receive in new coins the legal equivalent for it, or sell it as a commodity at a given price per ounce. If he finds that silver in the form of <name type="place">U.S.</name> coins buys more gold than he could purchase with the same amount of silver in the bullion market, he sends his silver to the Mint to be coined rather than to the bullion market...Having now received an ounce of gold in coin for his 15 oz. of silver coin, he can at once sell the gold as bullion (most probably melting it, or selling it to exporters) for 16 oz. of silver bullion. He retains one oz. of silver as profit, and with the remaining 15 oz. goes to the Mint for more silver coins, exchanges these for more gold coins, sells the gold as bullion again for silver, and continues this round until gold coins have disappeared from circulation... The existence of a profit in selling gold coins as bullion, and presenting silver to be coined at the Mint, is due to the divergence of the market from the legal ratio, and no power of the Government can prevent one metal from going out of circulation."<ref target="CH3-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Had the brokers and bullion dealers suspected that they were creating instant rarities, they might have squirreled away a few more for their grandchildren; as it was, some evidently did, which explains why proportionately more survive of some low mintages than of neighboring higher ones. Obvious examples include 1815 Half Eagles and 1798 Eagles.</p>
            <p>In the long run, the brokers' and bullion dealers' efforts were primarily responsible for destroying over 98% of early American gold. When people said that gold vanished by about 1812, they were not exaggerating. Ballpark figures for survivors speak loud and clear:

survives (saved as first of their kind); 1797–1833, mostly 1-2%; 1834 Motto, 0.3% (mostly melted, possibly only a few released to mint officials' friends).</q>

                  <hi rend="italic">Eagles</hi>: 1795, nearly 3% (saved as first of their kind); 1798, about 2% (mostly in high grades, saved as a seldom-seen date); others 1796–1803, about 0.5-2%; 1804, slightly over 1%.</q>
               <q>In all three denominations, uncertainties in survival proportions arise from uncertainties in mintage figures, which in turn arise from unknown quantities of backdated coins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Why the "endless chain" could continue long after Napoleon restored the 15.5:1 ratio in L'An XI (1803) coinage, why U.S. gold continued to vanish, was not anyone's miscalculation; rather the enormous influx of Latin American silver, which had already begun by 1790 to command lower and lower per-ounce prices in terms of gold, raised (the same thing) the price of gold bullion in terms of silver until gold coins became worth over face. Even if <name type="pname">Hamilton</name> had made the ratio match <name type="place">Spain</name>'s 16:1, gold coins would still have become worth over face in silver by 1813, when the ratio reached 16.25:1.<ref target="CH3-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Far from trying to drive gold out of circulation, <name type="pname">Hamilton</name> wanted to keep it there for larger transactions, while reserving silver for smaller ones. As <name type="pname">Laughlin</name> points out,<ref target="CH3-n7">7</ref> the U.S. adopted bimetallism without prejudice, and its failures were not from sabotage but from economic factors nobody could have foreseen.</p>
            <p>Though the Mint Act of June 28, 1834, finally insured that gold would circulate as coin rather than be melted for export, neither this Act nor that of 1837 guaranteed an adequate supply of small change. (Quarter eagles did not qualify as such: each one corresponded to about $50 in purchasing power today.) What circulated instead, then even as decades later, was worn, underweight, mutilated and/or counterfeit foreign silver (primarily Latin American fractions), various kinds of coppers, and, especially after 1837, paper from the private sector: private scrip and bank notes which might be spendable for a discount from face if one was lucky—or be refused
<pb n="39"/>
everywhere if one wasn't. Arguing that the 1834 Act made debts solvable with 6% less gold than had been due, therefore subjecting all creditors to a corresponding loss, the Supreme Court in 1871 went so far as to denounce the Act as a violation of the Fifth Amendment, as seizing private property for public use without just compensation.<ref target="CH3-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Paper money had long been a traditional device for financing wars: nominally promises to pay in gold or silver x years after issue, or after the war was won. No matter that <name type="place">Washington</name>'s troops defeated the redcoats, the <name type="place">United Colonies</name> lost the economic war with <name type="place">Britain</name>, so that "not worth a Continental" became a catch phrase for over a century, and the Constitution explicitly forbade states to issue bills of credit or to make "anything but gold or silver" (i.e. paper) a legal tender. Though the U.S. won the War of 1812, its small Treasury Notes of February 24, 1815, didn't help the coin shortage. Federal gold coins were still going to melting pots overseas, while half dollars mostly stayed in bank vaults. The small Treasury notes were promptly bought up by fat cats who turned them in for bonds paying 7%. Nor did the later larger Treasury notes help. Those that bore the least interest went back to the Treasury in tax payments; the others were redeemed at maturity. Issued yearly during the Hard Times (1837–43) because the Treasury was nearly broke, and in 1846–47 to help finance the <name type="place">Mexican</name> War, and in 1858–60 again because the Treasury was strapped, they were in denominations of $50, $100, $500, $1,000, and up. Even aside from the interest these notes earned, $50 then corresponded to nearly 2-1/2 oz pure gold, with roughly the purchasing power of $1,000 today <ref target="#fig-32">(fig. 3)</ref>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The problem became especially acute in 1861. The Union government's desperate expedients produced long-term effects on gold and silver coinage, unintentionally creating constitutional issues, hardships, and rarities in both metals. <name type="pname">Salmon P. Chase</name>, the lawyer <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> appointed to finance the Civil War, did so by proliferating fiscal paper in unprecedented quantities: bonds, interest-bearing notes, non-interest-bearing notes, legal tender notes (greenbacks). He tried to extract $150 million in gold from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>, and <name type="place">Boston</name> banks for the bonds they bought, but they could not comply, agreeing only to installment payments. His most successful effort was arguably the National Bank Note system: bonds issued under the Act of March 3, 1863, carried a circulation privilege whereby banks could issue NBNs by depositing 90% of face in bonds.</p>
            <p>Where Chase's tactics made long-term trouble was legal tender notes <ref target="#fig-33">(fig. 4)</ref>. Issuing them meant deciding that Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution applied only to individual states, not to the federal government: "No state shall...make anything but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts." As <name type="pname">Henry Kissinger</name> put it, "the illegal we do immediately; the unconstitutional takes a little longer."</p>
            <p>Legal tender means a form of money that a seller or creditor must accept if offered as payment; if paper is made legal tender, the creditor who lent it cannot legally demand repayment in silver (let alone gold) at face value, nor can the seller refuse such paper in payments for his merchandise. (Imagine today borrowing $100 in federal paper money only to learn on the due date that your lender demands $100 face value in silver, plus interest in silver, and will refuse payment in the same kind of federal paper he had lent.)</p>
            <p>After the Civil War, creditors began test cases of the issue: how can fiat paper money be legal tender under the Constitution? The
<pb n="41"/>
Supreme Court waffled forth and back for years. The underlying agenda: wealthy lenders wanted to retain the privilege of lending greenbacks and demanding payments and interest in gold at face value, knowing that the gold would buy more than its face value in paper, when it could be had at all—greenbacks had driven gold out of circulation, creating more rarities. In 1866, for a $10 greenback one received only $6.60 in gold; in 1875, still only $8.70. The creditors feared "cheap money" and "scaling debts": specifically, that dishonest debtors would repay at face value in discounted greenbacks, or after 1876 in silver coins which had cost maybe 60% of face value in greenbacks; they believed that debtors were not honest working people but unwise land speculators. The debtors feared "dear money": specifically, that creditors who had lent them discounted greenbacks (or, later, silver) would demand repayment at face in gold which might cost nearly double face value in greenbacks or silver; they believed that creditors were not honest entrepreneurs but speculators and market manipulators. The term usury became common in street talk and editorials; the issue even contributed to anti-Semitism.<ref target="CH3-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>"Here I hold up to view the fraud of the system; how increase in the value of money robs debtors. It forces every one of them to pay more than he covenanted to pay, not more dollars but more value, the given number of dollars embodying greater value at the date of payment than at date of contract. In these days debtors must struggle hard to be able to pay what they honestly owe. A money system which forces them to pay from 10 to 50% blood money is devilish indeed."<ref target="CH3-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This kind of creditor unfairness was legal so long as the Supreme Court did not rule definitively that <name type="pname">Salmon P. Chase's</name> greenbacks were legal tender no matter what the Constitution said. And the issue made many lenders very wealthy, many more borrowers poorer. One does not have to be a Marxist to recognize that this led to social unrest.</p>
            <p>First the gold vs. greenbacks issue, then (after the 1873–77 depression and the Specie Resumption Act) the gold vs. silver payments issue, produced opposing ideologies—belief systems with much in common with religious cults, intolerant of doubt or deviation, defended with moral arguments, total passion, and total misunderstanding. The gold/silver rivalry dominated presidential campaigns from 1876 to 1900, climaxing in 1892 and 1896, by which time everyone had taken sides. <name type="pname">Richard Hofstadter</name> called it "money mania."<ref target="CH3-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>On the comparison with religions, recall what <name type="pname">Senator Henry</name>
               <pb n="42"/>
Fountain Ashurst, Democrat of <name type="place">Oregon</name>, told Treasury Secretary Morgenthau: "My boy, I was brought up from my mother's knee on silver, and I can't discuss that with you any more than you can discuss your religion with me." Hofstadter comments: "On the moral side, the defenders of the gold standard often seem as dogmatically sealed within their own premisses as the most wild-eyed silver men, and usually less generous in their social sympathies. The right-thinking statesmanship of the era, like its right-thinking economics, was so locked in its own orthodoxy that it was incapable of coming to terms in a constructive way with lasting and pervasive social grievances. The social philosophy of <name type="pname">J. Laurence Laughlin</name> and the statecraft of <name type="pname">Grover Cleveland</name> cannot, in this respect, command our admiration. They accepted as 'natural' a stark, long-range price deflation, identified the interests of creditors with true morality, and looked upon any attempts to remedy the appreciation of debt as unnatural and dishonest, as a simple repudiation of sacred obligations."<ref target="CH3-n13">13</ref>
               <name type="pname">Laughlin</name>, debating with "Coin" Harvey, denounced the silver ideology as "an attempt to transfer from the great mass of the community who have been provident, industrious, and successful, a portion of their savings and gains into the pockets of those who have been idle, extravagant, or unfortunate."<ref target="CH3-n13">13</ref> Even <name type="pname">Allan Nevins</name>, who admired <name type="pname">Cleveland</name>'s defense of the gold standard, said that "our history presents few spectacles more ironic than that of our Eastern creditors taunting [debtor farmers] with dishonesty while insisting on being repaid in a dollar far more valuable than had been lent."<ref target="CH3-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The disease was falling prices, falling real wages, falling purchasing power of the silver in which one was paid. Harder work and savings were not paying off; the working poor were in fact becoming poorer, the rich richer as their gold kept rising in purchasing power.</p>
            <p>The cause of the disease, even as 60 years earlier, was oversupply of silver. Not merely the output of western mines, but U.S. silver coins of 1853–62 returning in 1877 from <name type="place">Latin America</name> where they had circulated during and after the Civil War.<ref target="CH3-n15">15</ref> Compared to gold, the price of silver continued to fall no matter what financiers or governments did, no matter how many tons of silver the Mint Bureau had to buy from western mine owners to make Morgan dollars.</p>
            <p>Among those who did not understand the cause, conspiracy theories abounded, even forming part of the Populist party platform in 1892. Their villains were largely <name type="place">London</name> bankers and any other bondholders and speculators who might gain from damaging the U.S. as a competitor.

            <p>To understand the alignments and the arguments one needs to recall some features of nineteenth century monetary theory, based on the notion that money meant precious metal by weight, and that fiscal paper ultimately represented promises to pay in precious metal.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Laughlin</name> gives three major functions for money, of which only the third is strictly relevant to the 1876–1900 bimetallism issue. Money, for <name type="pname">Laughlin</name>, serves 1) to <hi rend="italic">transfer</hi> value; or 2) to <hi rend="italic">compare</hi> value (as a common denominator more efficient than barter); or 3) "as a standard of deferred payments." Especially in senses 2) and 3), the value of anything (including gold or silver) is a ratio, unstable, changing as either numerator or denominator changes, whether you price silver in terms of gold or vice versa, or dollars in terms of marks or vice versa. Then, nearly everyone believed the ratio had been stable in earlier generations before unwise governments and ungodly financiers tampered with it. Today we know that stability is a Golden Age illusion, that fluctuations have been chaotic all along, and that when an extraordinary increase occurs in silver, gold or another high-demand commodity, the effects are faster and wider fluctuations; and in storm-tossed tides of shifting prices, buyers and sellers alike can drown.<ref target="CH3-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Bimetallism's chief aim was ostensibly "to secure, as its advocates claim, a less changeable standard for paying long [installment] contracts, and to accomplish this, an international league is indispensable to even a shadow of success" (as <name type="pname">Hamilton</name> had recognized a century earlier). Departing for once from the standard gold bug line, <name type="pname">Laughlin</name> said "the highest justice is rendered by the state when it exacts from the debtor at the end of a contract the same <hi rend="italic">purchasing power</hi> which the creditor gave him at the beginning of the contract, no less, no more."<ref target="CH3-n21">21</ref> But note that he ignored shifting interest rates.</p>
            <p>Bimetallism of the more radical or free silver variety (the only kind with which the U.S. ever experimented) was always vulnerable to foreign ratio changes, to bullion speculation, to other market
<pb n="45"/>
manipulation, and to new discoveries of either metal, historically silver being more affected than gold by this last. Unstable gold/silver ratios were always dangerous, though effects were cumulative over years, so that many did not recognize the connection between an 0.25% shift in the ratio and a lowering of real wages in factories a few months or years later; or between the issue of coin notes mandated by the 1890 Sherman Act and the Panic of 1893.</p>
            <p>Free silver was always an oxymoron; its real name was unilateral national bimetallism, meaning reversion to the Mint's 1795–1834 policy but with slightly lighter silver dollars. Free silver actually meant the legal right of any private owner of silver bullion to take it to one of the mints and have it made into coins without paying high seignorage. "Through it alone can Gresham's Law have an immediate effect." It was the law of the land until 1853. Free silver champions, notably Harvey, insisted that the U.S. should return to the old policy no matter what other countries might do: a position near to isolationism. Advocates less rational than Harvey insisted that God created the gold/silver ratio and that humans disturb it only at peril.<ref target="CH3-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Possibly the later developments can be understood most easily by focusing on a few crucial events and on how stupidity on gold and silver sides led to catastrophe in 1873–77 and again in 1893–96. A full treatment of the problems would be book length.</p>
            <p>Though the Comstock Lode and its 1870s near kin were short-term local benefits, they were long-term national disasters. Their eventual effects on silver prices expressed in gold were similar to those of the Latin American mints 80 years before. Their discoverers fared no better than <name type="pname">John Marshall</name> at Sutter's Mill; cheated out of their claims, they died poor. The more silver the Nevada bonanzas produced, the less it was worth per ounce, the more the <name type="place">New York</name> financiers' gold holdings rose in purchasing power, and the more desperate the farmers whose cotton and wheat sold for less and less in purchasing power. More than <name type="pname">Bryan</name> realized, more than <name type="pname">McKinley</name> cared, more than either of them could have understood, nearly any circulated common U.S. gold coin ca. 1879–1900, if it could talk, could tell stories of agony about the ones who had to spend it rather than stash it. The uncirculated ones spent most of their time in financiers' vaults, as silver dollars did in the Treasury.</p>
            <p>Not coincidentally, in 1871, the German Empire adopted the gold standard, using the $1 billion in gold extorted from France after the Franco-Prussian War (equivalent today to $20 billion). Sen. <name type="pname">George Graham Vest</name>, Democrat of <name type="place">Missouri</name>, arguing against the Sherman Act, said the Empire went to gold because Britain had prospered
<pb n="46"/>
from it since 1844.<ref target="CH3-n23">23</ref>
               <name type="place">Germany</name> dumped thousands of tons of silver on the market. Prices of silver began falling in terms of gold; prices of gold began rising. Some silver advocates blamed <name type="place">German</name> silver sales for the depression of 1873–77; though not the whole cause, <name type="place">German</name> policies certainly contributed to it.<ref target="CH3-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By omitting the old-tenor silver dollar, the Mint Act of 1873 automatically defined the coinage unit as gold and made all silver coins subsidiary, their face value enough above bullion value to keep them in circulation rather than melting pots. Contrary to how partisans interpreted the Act's name of "Crime of '73," its real crime was in making trade dollars legal tender.<ref target="CH3-n25">25</ref> Silver crusaders wrongly blamed the Act for the Panic of '73, beginning September 18, when "the leading American banking company, managed by government agent <name type="pname">Jay Cooke</name>, suddenly declared bankruptcy." By September 30, the <name type="place">New York</name> Stock Exchange closed; by December 31, 5,183 businesses (then worth over $200 million) failed. Other causes contributed, notably the Great Epizootic of September 1872, a mosquito-borne virus which that fall and winter killed some 4 million horses in many of the nation's largest cities, stopping deliveries of mail, goods, and funds, public transit, garbage collection, and firefighting—leaving many homeless after the fires.<ref target="CH3-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In July 1876, the value of silver collapsed. Trade dollars, though demonetized by joint resolution of Congress on July 22, came back in immense quantities to <name type="place">California</name>. During 1877–78, over 8.6 million of them circulated in the east. Employers bought them in quantity at bullion value (80-83<hi rend="sup">¢</hi> each) and put them into pay envelopes at $1 each; company stores raised prices accordingly, or else would accept them only at bullion value. Many petitions reached Congress asking for recall of trade dollars; others sought restoration of their legal tender status.<ref target="CH3-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile the Act of February 28, 1878, mandated monthly Mint Bureau purchases of $2-$4 million in domestic silver bullion for coinage only into silver dollars, pleasing nobody but the mine owners. Three of President <name type="pname">Hayes's</name> main reasons for vetoing the bill amounted to this: by making silver dollars receivable for duties, <name type="place">U.S.</name> gold revenues would be cut off, and the Treasury would not be able to fulfill commitments to bondholders, i.e. pay them off in gold as promised.<ref target="CH3-n28">28</ref> Nevertheless, Congress passed it over his veto. <name type="pname">Carothers</name> justly characterized this Act as "a wretched compromise, without a single redeeming feature, carrying with it the dangers of a wrong-ratio bimetallism without establishing the double standard. By it the silver mine owners were bought off with a large market for silver, the bimetallists were deceived with fictitious restoration
<pb n="47"/>
of the double standard, and the gold standard advocates were solaced with a last minute rescue of the gold standard when it appeared to be doomed."<ref target="CH3-n29">29</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1878–79, <name type="pname">Hon. John Adam Kasson</name> (then Minister to <name type="place">Austria-Hungary</name>) proposed that the Mint use one or another version of <name type="pname">Wheeler W. Hubbell's</name> goloid alloys to make coins intended for international circulation; goloid and goloid metric dollars; Stellas; and metric Double Eagles <ref target="#fig-35">(fig. 6)</ref>. Supposedly the goloid (silver with about 4% gold) and metric gold (containing 10% silver) would end the rivalry. How could such coinage proposals ever have had more than symbolic effects? How could anyone ever have imagined they could affect falling silver prices and rising gold prices? Nevertheless the Mint made the sample coins, and a congressional committee reported favorably on the proposal, but no authorizing act followed. The dollars went to collectors; the Stellas to congressmen and other favored parties; the metric Double Eagles to a few VIPs. Today they are expensive curiosities.</p>

            <p>The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 did not help free silver's repute; after it, the common people were hurting worse than ever. Under it, each month the Mint had to buy 187.5 tons of new domestic silver bullion, paying in Coin Notes (Treasury Notes of 1890 <ref target="#fig-36">[fig. 7]</ref>), which the mine owners promptly turned in for gold, some of which went to buy more bullion to resell to the Mint at a profit—another endless chain. The Coin Notes they turned in were reissued, each eventually removing many times its face value in gold from circulation.<ref target="CH3-n30">30</ref> While Treasury vaults bulged with silver dollars which circulated little and bought less than greenbacks, the gold reserves sank below the $100 million required by the Act of July 12, 1882. Many feared that greenbacks would no longer be redeemable in gold, or that the Treasury would default on foreign debts and domestic bonds payable in gold.<ref target="CH3-n31">31</ref>

            <p>By May 1893, Wall Street went into a panic. Some 419 banks
<pb n="48"/>
failed, and with them their depositors: factories, stores, individuals. Millions were suddenly jobless and hungry. President <name type="pname">Cleveland</name> called a special session of Congress to repeal the Sherman Act, over prolonged protests by silver crusaders; repeal finally came November 2, but by then the nation was desperate, and social unrest escalated. That fall, Coxey's Army of unemployed workers (at their eventual height in the spring of 1894, 20,000 strong) marched on <name type="place">Washington</name>, to demand a federal works program—anticipating FDR's New Deal by 40 years. They would be longer remembered than the mounted police who on May 29, 1894, turned back the last 600 from the Capitol grounds and arrested their Populist Theosophist leader, Jacob Sechler Coxey, for walking on the grass.<ref target="CH3-n32">32</ref>

               <ref target="#fig-37">(fig. 8)</ref> wrote <hi rend="italic">Coin's Financial School</hi>, a best-selling pro-silver tract; it appeared in May 1894, while Coxey's Army was approaching the Capitol, and eventually sold over 1 million copies. In it he printed six lectures and question-and-answer sessions between a boy prodigy financier, "Coin" <ref target="#fig-38">(fig. 9)</ref>, and his adult audience at the Chicago Art Institute: fiction, but with many real gold bugs named as interlocutors—and furious at being included. This 25<hi rend="sup">¢</hi> paperback converted <name type="pname">William Jennings Bryan</name> to free silver <ref target="#fig-39">(fig. 10)</ref>. Beyond doubt, "Coin" did more to alert the general public to the gold vs. silver ideological war than other rhetoric or scholarly writings on either side. Gold bugs wrote books refuting Harvey's worst blunders, but they had about as much effect as atheists' books denouncing the Bible. The general public took "Coin" more seriously than his opponents did. Hofstadter called Harvey the Tom Paine of the free silver movement, and <hi rend="italic">Coin's Financial School</hi> its <hi rend="italic">Common Sense</hi>.<ref target="CH3-n33">33</ref>

            </p>
            <p>In the 1896 presidential campaign, free silver was the number one issue; "Silver Dick" Bland <ref target="#fig-40">(fig. 11)</ref> was the Democratic front runner until <name type="pname">Bryan</name> made his "Cross of Gold" speech on July 8 and won the nomination. The Republican gold bugs ran "Boss" Hanna's candidate, <name type="pname">William McKinley</name>, on a platform of a gold standard and high tariffs. The battle was to come November 2.</p>
            <p>Gold bugs won on technicalities, not on convincing the opposition. They spent immense amounts on the campaign; people voted for <name type="pname">McKinley</name> because they feared another Sherman Act and another Panic of '93. The aftermath was anticlimactic; no action by <name type="pname">McKinley</name> ended the nation's fiscal woes. Instead the Klondike gold discoveries (beginning August 12, 1896) and improved extraction methods gradually eased the gold/silver ratios, and the danger of another Panic of '93 seemed less.<ref target="CH3-n35">35</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By 1900 the Populist movement was dying; <name type="pname">Bryan</name> lost again to <name type="pname">McKinley</name>. Meanwhile, <name type="pname">Lyman Frank Baum</name>, observing these events
<pb n="51"/>
both from his editor's desk in rural <name type="place">South Dakota</name> and his writing desk in urban <name type="place">Chicago</name>, wrote <hi rend="italic">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</hi> at least partly as a political allegory: "Greenbacks and Silver and Gold, Oh My!" Side by side with the Scarecrow (the midwestern farmers), the Tin Woodsman (urban industrial workers), and the Cowardly Lion (<name type="pname">Bryan</name>), <name type="pname">Dorothy</name> (the hope of heartland's Common Man, innocent enough to see the humbug of which the emperor's new clothes was woven) wore the silver shoes of the Wicked Witch of the East (ignorant of their magic power) down the Yellow Brick Road (the gold standard) that led nowhere. The Wicked Witch of the East symbolized megacorporations and banks, which had for years kept the Munchkins, the little people, in bondage. Her Western counterpart was the force of diabolic/Darwinian/Spencerian nature; <name type="pname">Dorothy's</name> cold water drowned a midwestern drought or wildfire. Even as <name type="pname">Coxey</name>'s Army headed for <name type="place">Washington</name>, <name type="pname">Dorothy</name> and her friends headed for the Emerald (i.e. Greenback) City of Oz (the abbreviation for ounce) where the Wizard (the President) was unwilling to deal with their problems. Forced to confront them, the Wizard eventually confessed to being "just a common man" ruling by "making believe." But the Scarecrow said instead "you're a humbug." Baum's message, then as now: the desire for symbols of success is crammed with wishful thinking, illusion and deception. By deception the plutocrats manipulate and control the common people; and only ignorance allows them to keep on doing it.<ref target="CH3-n36">36</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The next year the new Wizard was dead from an assassin's bullet. In 1904 Morgan dollar coinage ended; 30 years later gold itself was demonetized, unintentionally creating new rarities—1929 Half Eagles, 1930–33 Eagles, 1929–33 Double Eagles. The gold/silver ratio problem was never solved; it died of obsolescence, when our current paper standard replaced precious metals. But like all fiat money systems, ours may become as unstable as its predecessors; it is certainly more vulnerable than the gold standard or free silver, whatever the disadvantages of either.</p>
            <p>Why bring up this century-old lunacy, this "money mania?" Why not merely forget it again, the way people forgot millenarian cults and Millerites? Because the same kind of thing could happen again, over almost any theme. And once again professors and legislators and cabinet officers would be at swords' points over an issue where facts are continuously obscured by disinformation and ignorant irrelevant partisan rhetoric.</p>
            <p>There are in fact disturbing parallels between the money mania of the last quarter of the nineteenth century and some of the hottest issues of the last quarter of the twentieth: <name type="place">Vietnam</name>, Nicaragua/El
<pb n="52"/>
Salvador, abortion, drugs, pornography. Each issue has its pro-Establishment vs. anti-Establishment ideologies, and on both sides hot passion outshouts cold logic. Impartiality is resented as refusal to take sides; commitment is taken for granted: "Who is not with me is against me" (Matt. 12:30).</p>
            <p>Those who are trying to hedge against inflation, or to survive any possible revolution, by hoarding gold—whether as Eagles, Maple Leafs, or Krugerrands—see gold as the most compact and readily usable method of transporting or exchanging value; many welcome any additional demand for gold in industry or commemorative souvenirs or outright coinage, not because they favor collecting per se, but because it may raise gold prices, insuring that present holders of gold will remain rich even if others go hungry. This may not have been the purpose in relegalizing private ownership of gold, but it may well become a side effect.</p>
            <p>Those who seek to remonetize gold risk resumption of the old abuses as long as gold, silver and paper are not in a stable (preferably legally fixed) relationship—internationally. Or is it too close to conspiracy theories to ask if some of our current gold bugs would welcome the chance to follow in the footsteps of their illustrious ancestors?</p>

            <p>About 15 years ago I received a telephone call from a client in <name type="place">California</name> who had recently shipped to me three boxes of U.S. gold coins for authentication. All of the coins in his shipments, more than 30 pieces, were counterfeits of modern manufacture. In those days we knew that one in every three or four U.S. gold coins submitted for authentication would be a forgery, but I had never before received such a large quantity of counterfeits from a single source.</p>
            <p>We notified the gentleman of our findings as we returned the shipments, one by one. Because we had not found a single genuine piece among his submissions, I feared that my credibility as an authenticator might be questioned. So his telephone call came as no surprise. He had fully anticipated my dilemma. In fact, he said that he had known that most or all of the coins were forgeries.</p>
            <p>A few months earlier he had spent several weeks on a trip to Beirut and to one or more points in <name type="place">South America</name>. Upon his arrival at Beirut International Airport he had checked in at the Intercontinental Hotel, a modern facility not far from the terminal. Later that day, after napping in his room to recover from the lengthy flight, he visited one of the concessions in the hotel lobby where newspapers, magazines, souvenirs, jewelry, and, among other things, a variety of gold coins were sold.</p>
            <p>Our <name type="place">California</name> friend was a relatively seasoned coin collector, so he viewed the glittering display of gold with justifiable suspicion. He introduced himself to the proprietor of the small shop, a Lebanese man named <name type="pname">Ahmed Najib</name>. Presently he asked Ahmed, "Are these real <name type="place">United States</name> gold coins?" <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> smiled and replied in English, "Oh no, sir, we are selling gold bullion in a recognizable form." Recognizable, to be sure, but more specifically counterfeit <ref target="#fig-41">(fig. 1)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The Californian dropped in at <name type="pname">Ahmed Najib</name>'s concession on a daily basis during the next week, and the two men developed a fairly close acquaintanceship. Later in the man's two to three week visit to Beirut he purchased several ornate, delicate platters or trays hand-crafted in silver as gifts for friends. Later he realized that they were too fragile for mailing unless they were protected in custom-made crates. He told <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> of his problem; <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> said that if he would come to the shop just before closing, he would take him to a place where suitable shipping boxes would be made.</p>
            <p>The two men met that evening, and they rode in <name type="pname">Ahmed's</name> sports car, silver trays in hand, to a suburb of <name type="place">Beirut</name>.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> parked his car in front of an American-style house in a development. As they approached the front door, my <name type="place">California</name> friend heard and felt a throbbing under his feet—a heartbeat-like pulsation which emanated from the house. Inside the noise and vibration were much stronger.</p>

               <p>1. Many forgers are proud of their work. One boastful artisan placed his signature, the Greek letter Omega, inside the loop of the "R" in <name type="place">AMERICA</name> in the headdress of this false 1882 $3 gold piece. His Omega signature also appears on many counterfeit <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> type 1907 high relief Double Eagles, on the reverse within the recess in the eagle's talon. Both these forgeries had appeared by 1973.</p>
            </figure>
            <pb n="58"/>
            <p>Clearly massive machinery was operating in the basement.</p>
            <p>The living quarters were unfinished. Two Lebanese carpenters were at work, apparently preparing the living area for occupancy. <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> asked the men to make suitable shipping cases for the trays, and soon the carpenters set about their new task.</p>
            <p>While <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> and the Californian were waiting for the crates to be assembled, <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> turned to the tourist and asked, "Would you like to see where we make the gold coins?" The Californian eagerly accepted. <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> opened a stairway door, and the two men descended into the cellar.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the basement floor, two or three workmen were operating a large Schuler coining press which was striking <name type="place">U.S.</name> 1904 Double Eagles. It was clear that they had the capability of making many other dates and types of coins, because wooden shelves along the walls held many coining dies.</p>
            <p>I was fascinated as the Californian related these events over the telephone; his experience gave us insight into one of the most successful gold counterfeiting organizations in the near east. Our discussion was over in a little more than 20 minutes. I failed to ask my <name type="place">California</name> acquaintance if he had acquired any of the counterfeit gold coins from the people who were running the coining press, or even from <name type="pname">Ahmed Najib</name>'s concession at the Intercontinental Hotel. But he did tell me that <name type="pname">Ahmed</name> also ran a travel agency in <name type="place">Beirut</name>; that once you had met <name type="pname">Ahmed</name>, you could order counterfeit <name type="place">U.S.</name> gold coins from him by mail, and that he would ship your purchases to you in travel brochures from which neat round holes had been cut in a dozen or so of the center pages to protect the coins snugly in transit.</p>
            <p>The manufacture of counterfeit coins for the collector market, as opposed to counterfeiting for circulation, is a comparatively modern practice. It has its roots perhaps in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in <name type="place">Italy</name> and elsewhere in <name type="place">southern Europe</name>, where handsome copies of Roman coins and medals were made to satisfy the thirsts of nobles and wealthy merchants for antiquties. But only in the last 40 years has the problem of numismatic counterfeits posed a serious threat to the numismatic fraternity. In the mid and late 1950s the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Secret Service received reports from coin dealers and collectors that a variety of purportedly counterfeit gold coins were being smuggled into this country from abroad <ref target="#fig-42">(fig. 2)</ref>.</p>
            <p>For decades that agency had devoted more attention to the detection of counterfeit paper money and other government documents than it had to coins, so it was ill-prepared for the influx of mass-produced forgeries of U.S. gold coins.</p>

               <p>2. Counterfeit gold coins produced in the 1960s and earlier exhibit more technical defects than we find on more recently produced forgeries. This common type of counterfeit Liberty head Quarter Eagle first appeared before the author began his career in authentication in 1972. Random small holes in the surface of the reverse die allowed raised lumps of metal to protrude from the field to the left of the eagle's beak on each of the thousands of "coins" these forgers produced.</p>
               <p>The counterfeiters combined this reverse die with a variety of obverse dies bearing dates in the 1890s and early 1900s. The U.S. Mints have not used undated coin dies over multi-year periods since the early 1800s.</p>
            </figure>
            <pb n="60"/>
            <p>In fact, it did not have on the staff of the Counterfeit Division any individual who was capable of detecting these new forgeries with a high level of accuracy. In 1961 the Secret Service turned to the Bureau of the Mint for assistance.</p>
            <p>In response to the Secret Service request for assistance, the recently installed Director of the Mint, Eva Adams, assigned members of the Mint's Division of Technology to the task of finding means to detect the new counterfeits. Four members of the Mint staff spearheaded the effort, including the Mint Assayer, <name type="pname">Howard Johnson</name>, a close personal friend who passed away in the 1970s, and three other men, two of whom retired from the <name type="place">Bureau</name> of the Mint about 20 years ago. Only one member of the original team, <name type="pname">Thomas Jursich</name>, remains on the staff today.</p>
            <p>These four men acquired a variety of scientific equipment and studied and tested both the new forgeries and a quantity of known genuine U.S. gold coins until they could distinguish them with remarkable accuracy <ref target="#fig-43">(fig. 3)</ref>. Their efforts received little attention in the numismatic press, but they made it possible for the Secret Service to seek out and prosecute purveyors of U.S. gold counterfeits with confidence.</p>
            <p>The main difference between the counterfeiters of earlier years and those who appeared on the scene in the 1950s could be found in their technology. Earlier counterfeiters were satisfied to make imitations of genuine coins by the easiest and least expensive means—casting. The new breed of counterfeiter believed that the best way to make counterfeits which would deceive experienced numismatists was to duplicate the coining processes actually used in the mint to produce the original, genuine coins. While the setup costs for these new enterprises were vastly greater than for the older shops where casting rather than striking was the rule, the new organizations could make perhaps 20 to 50 pieces per minute, whereas their predecessors could cast only a handful of forgeries in an hour. Because these new forgeries were being struck from dies, they were far more deceptive than their cast prototypes.</p>
            <p>Although the introduction of modern minting technology into counterfeiting operations resulted in more realistic forgeries, it did little to overcome the most basic of all the counterfeiter's problems—lack of access to the original artist's models, or galvanos, for the coin he wishes to copy. Instead, the counterfeiter must use as his subject the best example of the genuine coin he can locate: almost certainly a less-than-perfect coin at least four generations removed from the original engraver's art.</p>

               <p>3. Some experienced numismatists can detect counterfeits with impressive accuracy without a magnifier, but the stereo microscope is the workhorse of every modern coin authentication laboratory.</p>
               <p>The most common counterfeit of the 1926 Sesquicentennial of American Independence Quarter Eagle differs from the genuine coin primarily in the strength and sharpness of its relief, characteristics which are seldom detected without excellent lighting and magnification.</p>

            <p>As the counterfeiter reproduces the fine details of the relief of a coin on the face of his new die, it is inevitable that he will simultaneously reproduce the nicks and scratches which the coin has sustained since the moment of striking. It follows that every forgery made from the newly-created counterfeit dies will bear identical "bruises" that are not part of the coin design, and certainly would not be present on an official coin die.</p>
            <p>The skilled counterfeiter is aware of this problem. He is faced with a dilemma: he may either make his counterfeits with these identical defects on each coin he produces, or he can attempt to touch up his dies with extreme care to eliminate the defects <ref target="#fig-44">(fig. 4)</ref>.</p>
            <p>If he allows the defects to appear on his forgeries, his fraudulent products will be spotted by astute collectors who see the same pattern of scratches on many identical coins. But if he attempts to eliminate the defects in the die face, the odds are strong that he will introduce new defects as he eradicates the old.</p>
            <p>Judging purely from the flow of coins which cross my desk weekly for authentication, it is clear that the volume of new <name type="place">U.S.</name> gold coin counterfeits produced annually worldwide has been declining for 12 to 15 years, perhaps longer. In the early 1970s thirty percent of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> gold coins we saw were counterfeit. Today the percentage has declined to about five percent. Fifteen years ago we saw on average two to four new types of counterfeits each month; today new counterfeits of <name type="place">U.S.</name> gold are rarely encountered, but new forgeries of silver and minor coinage have become more common.</p>
            <p>When the international gold coin counterfeiters first appeared in the late 1950s, the price of gold hovered close to $35 per ounce, so the cost of the raw material for their production was acceptable. Twenty years later the price was headed for the $800 per ounce level, and even today tends to remain above $400. Thus the counterfeiters' inventory costs have multiplied by a factor of over ten. This has reduced the profitability of all counterfeiting operations.</p>
            <p>In the mid-1960s, the presence of gold counterfeits in the <name type="place">U.S.</name> numismatic marketplace was becoming well known, and soon a few numismatists were learning how to recognize the forgeries. By word of mouth counterfeit detection methods were circulated. The American Numismatic Association Certification Service began authenticating coins in 1972, and in late 1976 the International Numismatic Society joined in the effort. About five years later the IAPN opened its counterfeit bureau in <name type="place">London</name>, and during its short existence it published a voluminous amount of information concerning numismatic forgeries <ref target="#fig-45">(fig. 5)</ref>.</p>

            <p>While technology was making it easier to produce high quality forgeries, more knowledgeable dealers and collectors were making it increasingly difficult and dangerous for peddlers of forgeries to disperse their wares profitably. It is becoming clear that the fortunes of the mass-production counterfeiters are ebbing, and that for the near future the prime danger to collectors comes not from these forgers, but from a new breed which appears to be evolving: those who specialize in making smaller quantities of forgeries of less commonly traded scarce and rare coins, taking pains to make their products virtually undetectable except by professional authenticators.</p>

            <p>Since classical times, governments have occasionally found it necessary to establish "branch" mints—coining facilities dependent on and subordinate to that central organization responsible for the purveying of coinage to a nation and its people. While any number of reasons may go into the decision to set up subordinate mints, there will ordinarily be two main elements in the process leading to that conclusion.</p>
            <p>The first of these is a felt need, either by the government or by persons influential in its counsels, to create more coinage. This is so obvious that it scarcely needs stating; but it must be in place before any additional steps can occur. This felt need may be a reflection of a real crisis in the purveyance of coin, or it may be an artificial creation, based on civic pride.</p>
            <p>The second main element is that of the availability of metal for coinage, which may come about in either of two ways. It may already exist in a monetary form, providing the means for a <hi rend="italic">recoinage</hi>. Or it may exist in a bullion form, the product of a new, and successful, mining economy. In the former case, the setting up of a branch mint will very likely take place in a location which already enjoys economic and/or political significance; in the latter, it will probably occur near the new source of metal, which will almost certainly be a place of little previous economic or political significance. In general, it will be much easier to establish a branch mint in the former situation than in the latter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>By the 1830s, agitation was under way for the establishment of branch mints in the <name type="place">United States</name>. In time, three new mints would be set up, one each at <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, <name type="place">Louisiana</name>, <name type="place">Charlotte</name>, <name type="place">North Carolina</name>, and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, <name type="place">Georgia</name>. These branch creations fit well into the model outlined briefly above. The New Orleans Mint was erected in a center of great economic and political importance, and it was primarily intended for the <hi rend="italic">recoinage</hi> of other peoples' money into new, American, media of exchange. The major raw materials for its products would have been the foreign, especially Mexican, coins entering the Crescent City by way of its flourishing trade with the outside world. National pride and technological possibility both played a role in the establishment of this new mint: by the 1830s. Americans were becoming tired of using other people's silver and gold coins, and they were also acquiring the industrial know-how needed to turn these foreign coins into domestic ones.</p>
               <p>It must be emphasized that the primary consideration behind the establishment of the New Orleans Mint was an incoming flow of
<pb n="69"/>
coins, and not of bullion. There were no significant gold or silver mines within 500 miles of the city, but there was a persistent and growing influx of precious metal all the same, in the form of Mexican Pieces of Eight, of Peruvian <hi rend="italic">doblones</hi>. In this respect, it is interesting to note that one other major American city came under consideration as the possible site of a mint during the branch mint debate of the 1830s. This was New York, whose economic and mining situations were closely comparable with conditions in New Orleans.</p>
               <p>So New Orleans would get a mint. It would be erected with no particular difficulties, and it would be a success from the outset, coining and recoining down to the opening years of the twentieth century.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The story of the other two branch mints established during the 1830s would be very different. <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> were always intended for coinage from raw materials, and not for recoinage. They were set up as a way of elaborating the products of the gold workings of the Southern Piedmont into coinage near their sources. From the beginning, then, they were the creation of a mining economy and dependent upon it. This dependence was to be the single most important factor throughout their story.</p>
               <p>It was also to inject a peculiar degree of difficulty into their establishment in the first place. To the extent that coining is an industrial process, the building of a mint requires a modicum of industrial experience in the area about to receive it. This was particularly true in the case of the new branch mints in that they were the first "modern" facilities in American history, relying on state-of-the-art methods and machinery to produce their coins. Unfortunately, the sites selected for the two new mints were too backward to easily receive and abet the new technology. While not precisely frontier areas, neither site enjoyed a large population and the variety of skills required to build and maintain a modern coining facility. The results might have been predicted: provided for by legislation in March 1835, construction proceeded so slowly and so poorly that the "Mother Mint" (as the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> facility was known in those days) was forced to send down a special emissary to prod her lazy offspring into action. This was Franklin Peale, of whom more later.</p>
               <p>The two gold branch mints have enjoyed a modest popularity with scholars over the past two decades, and a number of book length treatments have resulted. Anthony Stautzenburger's work on the Charlotte Mint appeared in 1976.<ref target="CH5-n1">1</ref> It contains exhaustive coverage
<pb n="70"/>
of the events leading up to the opening of that facility, but nothing on its later activities. A new book on the mint by Claire Birdsall goes far toward supplying this need, and it should be used in conjunction with Stautzenburger.<ref target="CH5-n2">2</ref> Earlier, in 1984, Birdsall had contributed a volume on the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> facility<ref target="CH5-n3">3</ref> which was shortly joined by a second study by Sylvia Head and Elizabeth Etheridge.<ref target="CH5-n4">4</ref> Among these four sources, the interested scholar will find firm points of departure for further study. Of course, the major source for these books (as well as for this paper) is Record Group 104, National Archives, Washington, D.C.</p>
               <p>Mints at <name type="place">Charlotte</name>, <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, and <name type="place">New Orleans</name> were provided for under the Act of March 3, 1835. This legislation allocated sums to purchase sites for mint buildings, to equip them with the latest machinery, and to pay the salaries of the chief coiners, assayers, melters, refiners, clerks, and subordinate workmen needed to operate the facilities. Sites were selected, contractors engaged, and the work begun. Things proceeded well enough at New Orleans. But the same could not be said of <name type="place">Charlotte</name> or <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>; there, a combination of mismanagement and lack of expertise rendered progress slow and extraordinary measures necessary.</p>
               <p>At first glance, <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> was the more problem-ridden of the two mints. The local contractor, Benjamin Towns, was excessively slow in performing his duties. Ignatius Few, who had been selected as Commissioner to oversee the construction of the mint, described Towns's problems in fulfilling his agreement: the builder was nowhere near completing his labors after more than a year's worth of effort.<ref target="CH5-n5">5</ref> Moreover, much of what Towns had done was done poorly. The Superintendent of the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> mint reported that the building's walls had been so shoddily constructed that one of them actually buckled from the lateral thrust of one of the masonry arches, essential to the original building plan.<ref target="CH5-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The letter containing this intelligence made mention of other difficulties at the Georgia mint site. There was a signal lack of adequate housing in this backwoods area, leading the Superintendent to suggest that the Government either supply its employees with suitable dwellings or raise their salaries by way of compensation. The Superintendent was also feeling very much alone in attempting to deal with the many problems he was encountering: none of his coining colleagues had yet come to <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, and the one person whose input would have been most important, Commissioner Few, was similarly absent.<ref target="CH5-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Two observations suggest themselves at this point, the first of which applied, to a greater of lesser degree, to all early American
<pb n="71"/>
branch mints. That is, the parent facility could not depend on finding any experienced personnel in the places where it was setting up its branches; along with a lack of industry in places like <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, there was also a lack of industrial <hi rend="italic">expertise</hi>, of technological know-how. Anybody with the specialized skills needed to create coinage in the nineteenth-century fashion would have to come from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. This situation is strongly reminiscent of the earlier fortunes of the Birmingham coiners, Boulton, Watt &amp; Company, in Mexico, Russia, and several of the other places which received modern coining facilities from the firm: along with the mints, the people to operate them had to be sent from the advanced area to the backward one.</p>
               <p>The other observation was, mercifully, confined to <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>. This was the problem of Col. Ignatius Few, a lawyer and Methodist preacher, sometime Commissioner of the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> mint. Col. Few had many sterling qualities, including a purity of heart and a greatness of mind. But he also suffered from a notable lack of ability to carry projects through to conclusion, and he seems to have taken a distinct dislike to the idea of spending time in <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> overseeing the affairs of his fledgling mint. The Commissioner would be a persistent problem for those other persons entrusted with the erection of the facility.<ref target="CH5-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <p>While the constructing and equipping of the Charlotte mint met with no personnel problems of the magnitude of Col. Few, another set of obstacles was impeding progress there as well, especially the difficulty of getting mint machinery and parts from their points of manufacture to their place of use. One is constantly reminded of the technological isolation of the Charlotte mint, a situation rendered more difficult by a severe drought along the water route which the machinery and castings would have to take between <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> and <name type="place">Charlotte</name>. The resulting low water had made shipment of the main machinery consignment problematical in the spring of 1837; Franklin Peale would still be complaining of its effects six months later.</p>
               <p>Personnel problems are also evident at the Charlotte mint; and, while Peale's version of the ineptness of that building's construction is perhaps overstated, there do seem to have been difficulties with the raising of the edifice there as well, even if they were not comparable with what was going on at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>. In the latter case, the faults of construction appear to have led to a decision momentous for the story of both branch mints: the Mother Mint would send down one of its own, a crack troubleshooter who would oversee the final labors of construction and preparation for coinage, ensur-
<pb n="72"/>
ing that the lengthy building process would at last bear fruit. It would send Franklin Peale on his mission South.</p>
               <p>This decision was reached during the month of August 1837. <name type="pname">John Singleton</name>'s letter of the sixth of that month to Mint Director <name type="pname">Robert M. Patterson</name>, containing the news of the collapse of construction at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, would have been received at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> within a week to ten days. By August 18, <name type="pname">Patterson</name> was reporting the facts to his superior, Treasury Secretary <name type="place">Woodbury</name>, adding that he was hardly surprised at the bad news, already having heard rumors about the contractor's incompetence—and Commissioner <name type="pname">Few</name>'s lackadaisical attitude about it. Patterson then made a suggestion:
<q>It seems to me...that it will be proper to send, to <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Gold mints, a confidential &amp; skillful person, who may present us a true account of the execution of the work, and give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been committed, and completing the work that remains,—such as the erection of the furnaces, &amp;c. I know of no one competent to this task, except our Melter &amp; Refiner, Mr. <name type="pname">Peale.</name>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Patterson</name> suggested that <name type="pname">Peale</name>'s duties at the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint could be assumed for the time being by the person who was soon to be sent to New <name type="place">Orleans</name> in a similar capacity, and, by way of persuasion, added that <name type="pname">Peale</name> could perform this laudable task at no expense to the Government beyond carfare.<ref target="CH5-n9">9</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Woodbury</name> assented to <name type="pname">Patterson</name>'s suggestion three days later, stressing that, while events at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> were of primary importance, it would be best to send "a person to make an examination of <hi rend="italic">both</hi> buildings...you are authorized to send Mr. <name type="pname">Peak</name> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].<ref target="CH5-n10">10</ref>

                  <name type="pname">Benjamin Franklin</name>
                  <name type="pname">Peale</name> deserves a brief introduction. He was 42 years old at the time of his visit to <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>. His early career was spent as manager of the <name type="place">Philadelphia Museum</name>. In mid-1833, he was sent to <name type="place">Europe</name> on a fact-finding expedition on behalf of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint. His major responsibility was to bring back improved methods of metal refining, but he also took this opportunity to learn about advanced methods of coining. A visit to the <name type="place">Karlsruhe Mint</name>, which had recently been outfitted with toggle-action presses of the <name type="pname">Uhlhorn</name> type, made a deep impression on him. <name type="pname">Peale</name> saw similar presses by <name type="pname">Thonnelier</name> in <name type="place">Paris</name>, and, upon his return to <name type="place">America</name> in mid-1835, he would pour all that he had learned about
<pb n="73"/>
coining into a series of new machines for the Mint. His coining press was to borrow heavily from his European experiences, but it would be adapted and perfected, operating more smoothly than the Continental machines which had inspired it. It would first go into action at the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint in March 1836, and copies of it would soon be sent down to the three new branch mints. Peale also developed an improved edge-milling machine, which appears to have been entirely of his own design, owing nothing to European antecedents. His career at the Mint rose commensurately with the success of his inventions and adaptations: by March 1836, he was Melter-Refiner at the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint, and he became Chief Coiner upon the retirement of Adam Eckfeldt in 1839.<ref target="CH5-n11">11</ref>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Peale</name>, then, would be just the person to set things right at <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>. Accompanied by his daughter Anna, he set out for the first stop on his itinerary, arriving at <name type="place">Charlotte</name> on September 23, 1837. He immediately encountered difficulties: a shipment of castings, copper vessels for the North Carolina mint's melting furnace, sent from <name type="pname">Charleston</name> by water eight days previously, had not yet been received at <name type="place">Charlotte</name>, due either to accident or to the drought conditions mentioned earlier. Peale was, as he put it, "<hi rend="italic">in a trap</hi>": the brickwork for the melting furnace could not be started until the castings arrived. Moreover, there was nothing for him to do as yet at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, which was in an even less ad-
<pb n="74"/>
vanced state of completion than was Charlotte. At the same time, he could not simply return to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, because that would render his entire journey meaningless. For the first and last time, the inventor appears to have lost his nerve. He quickly regained it, however, and he soon had a rough plan of action in place, which involved Col. Wheeler, Superintendent of the North Carolina facility, making a personal visit along the path to have been taken by the missing parts. But Peale's anxiety over the success of the branch mint enterprise, inspired by the technological backwardness of the regions in which the new facilities were to operate, forms a constant theme in his letters to Mint Director Patterson.</p>
               <p>At times, this uncertainty, and the conditions which inspired it, get beyond Peale's control, and he sounds rather like a snob from the big city, denigrating his country cousins. While admitting that the Charlotte mint had a pleasing exterior, the Pennsylvania inventor felt constrained to add that, while the bricks from which the building was constructed "are good North Carolina Bricks, ([they] would be called d—— [damned] bad in Philad.[elphia])."<ref target="CH5-n12">12</ref> His views of Charlotte hardly mellowed with time; in a later letter to Patterson, he referred to the town as "this fag end of creation," an area "where the only active beings are the hogs."<ref target="CH5-n13">13</ref> In Peale's defense, it can only be said that he was encountering terrible difficulties attempting to breathe life into that mint. The crucial castings had still not arrived. An importunate Superintendent Wheeler was constantly besieging him about funds to pay the hands employed upon the fixtures of the mint, about which Peale could only claim ignorance.<ref target="CH5-n14">14</ref> The contractor himself was demanding additional money for the work, which, to Peale's mind, had been poorly conceived in the first place. Due to careless wording of the contract, windows were so ineptly constructed that it took two people to open each window, "no small matter I assure you in this hot weather."<ref target="CH5-n15">15</ref>
               </p>
               <p>By October 11, the castings for the furnace had still not been received, and Peale was becoming desperate: "Not even a <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> can be ventured as to the probable time of their arrival." He had done all in his power to expedite matters, and he was now engaging the bricklayers in other activities. But he was actively considering giving up on Charlotte for the time being, and sending his people on to <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> where they could be more gainfully employed. In the meantime, he would use his enforced leisure as wisely as he could, visiting the nearby mines which had inspired the gold branch mints and his mission to rescue them.<ref target="CH5-n16">16</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Peale's visit to the mines helped restore his resolve to see his
<pb n="75"/>
"onerous &amp; delicate task" to completion. So did a supportive letter from Patterson, which he received upon his return to Charlotte. He now assessed matters there with a greater realism; while the matter of the copper castings was a serious one, they would, after all, eventually make their way to the mint and, once they had, "the erection of the furnaces will be but a small matter, and every thing else is in a forward state." So difficulties were perhaps not as burdensome as he had originally assumed.</p>
               <p>All the same, Peale now saw his mission as going on through the rest of 1837. He had become convinced that the primary difficulty with the new mints was one of personnel: "Our superintendents have very crude ideas, and our officers are all young in their professions, of course in constant need of avice [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and mediation." That being the case, Peale would do well to visit the facility at New Orleans once he had done with those at <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>. What did Patterson think?<ref target="CH5-n17">17</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As it happened, Patterson thought it was a bad idea, and he told Peale so:
<q>As to your movements, I must...exercise my <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> upon your proposed long delay, and, above all, upon your scheme of going to N Orleans before you return to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the Mint Director saw it, once Peale had gotten things under control at Charlotte, he should go to <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> for a quick inspection, returning to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> as soon as practicable. But a visit to <name type="place">New Orleans</name> was out of the question: "Your presence cannot be dispensed with" at the Mother Mint.<ref target="CH5-n18">18</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Meanwhile, matters were finally improving at Charlotte. On October 23, Peale reported that, at long last, the castings for the melting furnace had been found at Columbia, South Carolina; he had sent two wagons there to bring them to the Charlotte mint. This was welcome news indeed, and it partially offset a worsening health condition among the workmen from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, many of whom were suffering from fevers brought on by Charlotte's warmer climate. The enforced inactivity had also gotten on everyone's nerves, and Peale was finding himself obliged to act as peacemaker between the peppery Assayer, <name type="pname">Dr. John H. Gibbon</name>, and those below and above him.<ref target="CH5-n19">19</ref> Peale must have been looking forward to leaving Charlotte by now, even if only to exchange one set of problems for another.</p>
               <p>And his stay in North Carolina was drawing to a close. On October 27, most of the missing materials made their appearance at Charlotte, and Peale's natural optimism at once asserted itself. The back of the problem had been broken, and, no matter how much
<pb n="76"/>
effort it took, he and his men would set the facility to rights as quickly as possible.<ref target="CH5-n20">20</ref>
               </p>
               <p>By the first day of the new month, the remaining mint stores, including the castings for the melting furnace, had reached Charlotte. By that time, so had the Mint Director's letter of October 24, denying Peale's proposal for an extended stay in the south. Peale assured Patterson that he was no more anxious to extend his mission than was the Mint Director, especially as his role of peacemaker between disaffected mint employees was proving particularly irksome. But work was now going on at a reasonable pace, and his people were now building the melting furnace. With luck, Peale expected to set out for <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> in about ten days' time.</p>
               <p>But he was pessimistic about the overall prospects for the new branch mints. The people chosen to oversee the establishments lacked experience in the work (the problem of technological expertise runs like a thread through the Peale correspondence), and, while the mints would eventually be set to work, "as to the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> or <hi rend="italic">how</hi> that is for futurity to shew."<ref target="CH5-n21">21</ref>
               </p>

               <p>Regardless of reservations, the second half of Peale's southern mission now appeared as feasible as it was ever likely to be, and he set out to fulfill it. He would, he hoped, need to spend far less time at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> than he had at <name type="place">Charlotte</name>; this part of the trip would be a visit of inspection, "a general survey on the spot which will occupy me a few days," after which Peale could "finally turn my face homewards at the expiration of a week at longest at the said place." This was not to say that all of Charlotte's problems had been solved. Peale still had doubts and complaints about the quality of workmanship which had gone into the building, and he had recently discovered the reason for it. One of the contractors "told me himself that he secured the contract by a low offer in the expectation of making his profits on the extra work" which would have to be done to render the building suitable for use.<ref target="CH5-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless, it was time to leave. Franklin Peale and his daughter departed <name type="place">Charlotte</name> on the evening of Saturday, November 10, and they arrived at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> the following Wednesday afternoon. The trip had been arduous, "the latter part of the distance being through rough mountain roads." The ill fortune which had dogged Peale's activities in <name type="place">Charlotte</name> followed him to <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>: neither Mint Superintendent Singleton nor any other official was there to receive him, and Peale was left to his own devices.</p>
               <p>All the same, the mint building was, at first glance, in better shape
<pb n="77"/>
than he had been led to believe. The concept of the arches (one of whose collapse had inspired his mission) had been abandoned in favor of simpler, but sturdy, construction, and Peale was of the opinion that the building would serve its purpose well enough.<ref target="CH5-n23">23</ref>
               </p>

               </figure>
               <p>Within two days, he had revised his judgment downward. Closer examination had revealed a crudity of construction, poor brickwork, and mortar inadequate to hold the bricks together, the products of "ignorance on the part of the contractor and the drunken and bad habits of the workmen" employed in the construction. But the artisans sent down from Charlotte to assist in the final phases of the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> construction were now present, and Peale was currently making rapid strides toward reforming the work, pulling down the remaining arches and overseeing the construction of the melting furnaces. He expected to finish his mission at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> in five or six days, "after which I will return home without delay...say the second week in December." He expressed guarded optimism about the mint's reason for being—the nearby gold fields: "every hill is filled with auriferous quartz and every valley and gorge with the debris." The problem was that the workings were extremely inefficient, so that "the mining operations are at this moment languishing." Still, there was a great opportunity for improved technology, "that must some future day yield certain &amp; great returns."<ref target="CH5-n24">24</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Eight days later, Peale was still in <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>: the state of the mint was even worse than previously believed, and a quick return to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> (upon which the Mint Director was becoming increa-
<pb n="78"/>
singly insistent) was out of the question.</p>
               <p>The main problem centered on the mint edifice; here, Peale's prose becomes somewhat breathless, but it is probably best to let him tell the story in his own fashion:
<q>The workmanship of the Mint edifice is abominable, a letter might be three times filled with the details of errors and intentional mal [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] constructions, the first and greatest of which may fairly be traced to Philad<hi rend="underline">a</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">ordering</hi> a brick building in a country where there is no <hi rend="italic">clay</hi>, the material employed for the brick making being the <hi rend="italic">red soil</hi> of the Gold region, <hi rend="italic">a decomposed granite</hi>...put into Brick by men who certainly deserve diplomas for <hi rend="italic">Botching</hi>...</q>
               </p>
               <p>—All this in an area full of granite, which would have been an ideal building material for the mint.</p>
               <p>The theoretical overseer of the building activity was Col. Few, who had rarely visited the construction site; Peale was certain that the Colonel was responsible for many of the mint's difficulties. The inventor had spent the past several days working furiously to shore up current problems and anticipate future ones, and he could do no more. Despite all of its defects, no alternative existed to accepting the edifice as it was, "or there will be no Branch at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, a large amount of the appropriation having been spent;" Congress was hardly likely to be generous enough—or foolish enough—to grant a second appropriation for a second attempt. On that realistic note, Peale prepared to close out his mission and come home.<ref target="CH5-n25">25</ref>
               </p>
               <p>He and Anna left <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> at the end of the month, making a circuitous and eventful journey back to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. Peale's ill luck pursued him north, just as it had followed him south. While traveling through Virginia, the train on which he and his daughter were passengers met with</p>
               <q>the perils of the most horrible accident...that has occurred for years. A fine new engine...was thrown off the track by an iron plate rail which was raised up at one end. The engine was brought up against the side of the ditch, where a fearful crash took place.</q>
               <p>Miraculously, no one was killed, although nearly 20 people were injured, some of them severely. Peale escaped unhurt, although his daughter received a minor back injury. He credited their deliverance to the fact that they had been traveling in the middle passenger car, which, instead of being crushed by the force of the accident, had simply been raised off the tracks and thrown to one side.<ref target="CH5-n26">26</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="79"/>
               <p>Shaken but unhurt, the little party continued its journey to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. <name type="pname">Peale</name> was in <name type="place">Washington</name> by December 15, and he expected to make the final leg of the journey home by steamboat on the following Sunday.<ref target="CH5-n27">27</ref> By the twenty-third, he was back at his desk at last, composing an outline of his travels and findings for the Mint Director.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In his report to <name type="pname">Patterson</name>, <name type="pname">Peale</name> gave the <name type="place">Charlotte</name> facility passing marks. The Commissioner, Major <name type="pname">Samuel McComb</name>, had made the best of a difficult situation, carefully watching over the interests of the Government as he did so. The materials employed for the mint's construction had been the best available in the district, and the workmanship "all that could be expected with the necessary allowances for the resources and habits of the neighbourhood." The machinery, of course, had been well executed, and it had been put up at <name type="place">Charlotte</name> in a satisfactory manner. <name type="pname">Peale</name> had personally directed work on the furnaces and fixtures, "with the approbation of the officers." In brief, the <name type="place">Charlotte</name> facility was ready for business and had in fact already begun receiving bullion for coining.</p>
               <p>The same rosy picture could not be painted for <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>. <name type="pname">Peale</name> listed several major construction defects, including the substitution of lath and plaster in the cornices, a roof which leaked, the necessary abandonment of the first-floor arches, and the poor quality of the bricks used throughout the building, placing blame for these problems squarely on the shoulders of the elusive Col. Few. Faced with these difficulties, Peale had labored manfully to render the building suitable for the purpose for which it had been conceived. He thought it would now serve, and he advised its acceptance as part of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint. But he also thought it would be a good idea to set aside monies for the structural repairs which would certainly come due.<ref target="CH5-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>With that, <name type="pname">Franklin</name>
                  <name type="pname">Peale</name>'s direct connection with the <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> mints came to an end. They began coining operations in 1838, remaining active until the outbreak of the Civil War. <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, and Col. <name type="pname">Few</name>, remained problems long after <name type="pname">Peale</name> had returned to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. Early in 1838, <name type="pname">Patterson</name> wrote Treasury Secretary Woodbury that he had just received a communication from <name type="pname">Joseph Singleton</name>, Superintendent of the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> mint: the contractor, <name type="pname">Benjamin Towns</name>, had <hi rend="italic">still</hi> not completed his work on the mint building. <name type="place">Singleton</name> had finally lost patience, telling Towns that the mint would commence operations on the first of February, finished or not. Moreover, <name type="place">Singleton</name> would sack Towns's workmen,
<pb n="80"/>
replacing them with other people who would actually do the job.</p>
               <p>Patterson liked Singleton's approach to the problem: here, at last, was someone ready to actually take charge, to give the Georgia mint the direction it so badly needed. Why not dispense with the services of Col. Few, replacing him with Dr. Singleton?<ref target="CH5-n29">29</ref>
               </p>
               <p>This was easier said than done. Few proved as difficult to remove from his position as he had been reluctant to fill it. While Woodbury acted on Patterson's advice almost immediately, informing the Colonel that he no longer worked for the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> mint, requesting him to turn his papers and the unspent balance of his funds over to Dr. Singleton,<ref target="CH5-n30">30</ref> it became infernally difficult to get the erstwhile Commissioner to surrender his office—or those public monies which he still retained, and which had now come due to contractor Towns for his work at the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> mint.</p>
               <p>Woodbury demanded immediate action on February 17.<ref target="CH5-n31">31</ref> Few refused to comply on March 6, adding the sin of breathtaking gall to his earlier offense of disobedience, as he demanded a retroactive pay raise in recognition of the difficulties which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had encountered in the establishment of the mint! This demand was summarily rejected, the Treasury Secretary reiterating his own ultimatum that Few turn over his official papers and funds to his designated successor;<ref target="CH5-n32">32</ref> but matters were still not completely cleared up, and the contractor still not completely recompensed, as late as the middle of 1840.<ref target="CH5-n33">33</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Not that this had impeded the actual operations of the <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> mint. It and its North Carolina sister began coining in the spring of 1838, and, except for a hiatus at Charlotte caused by a fire in the summer of 1844, the two daughters of the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint led uneventful lives until being overwhelmed by the larger events of secession, war, and Reconstruction.</p>
               <p>The man who had shepherded them into existence, Franklin Peale, went on to bigger and better things. He attained the coveted post of Chief Coiner in 1839, partly, one must assume, as a reward for his devoted labors on behalf of <name type="place">Charlotte</name> and <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>. He remained in this post until 1854, and was thus in a position to help shape our Mint's responses to an even greater gold rush, with an even greater effect on American coinage, than the one which had sent him on his mission south so many years before.</p>

            <p>Gold coins have always been fascinating to me. In preparing this paper, I have had the opportunity to reflect upon having handled many important rarities in the series, including the incomparable collection formed by <name type="pname">Louis Eliasberg</name>, which I catalogued for auction in 1982, and which contained the unique 1870-S $3, the only 1822 $5 outside of the Smithsonian Institution, and numerous other classic issues. It wasn't always so, however; reflecting upon the past it seems like only yesterday when in the early 1950s I owned my first gold coin. As chance would have it, it was a $20 gold piece dated 1855, with a <name type="place">San Francisco</name> mint mark on the reverse, in a grade which today would probably be described as Extremely Fine. From a numismatic viewpoint it was of no great consequence: close to a million 1855-S double eagles were produced, and many examples were and still are available. However to me, a high school student who had recently begun dealing in coins, the 1855-S represented a ticket to a dream world, to visions of the <name type="place">California</name> gold rush (for surely the piece was minted from precious yellow metal taken from the <name type="place">Mother Lode</name>), to stories of nineteenth-century banking and financiers (<name type="pname">Jay Gould</name> and his machinations in the gold market came to mind), or any one of several other fantasies. Even today a $20 piece, whether it be common or rare, is impressive to me, and I hope that this fascination will never end.</p>
            <p>I came to know the subject of gold coins more closely when I did the research for my book, <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">United States</name> Gold Coins: an Illustrated History</hi>, for the <name type="pname">Eliasberg</name> family, in connection with the sale of the gold coins from the <name type="pname">Eliasberg</name> collection. It is pleasing to me that today the book is still useful to the numismatic fraternity. A few years ago the Secretary of the Treasury of the <name type="place">United States</name>, <name type="pname">James Baker</name>, quoted from my book in the introduction to an important address he gave, and scarcely a month goes by without my receiving an inquiry from a government agency, a student researching a particular facet of gold coins, or some other individual or entity seeking to learn more about the golden treasures of yesteryear. Parenthetically let me state that it is a pleasure to live in the same state that <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name> selected for his home and studio. Today in <name type="place">Cornish</name>, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>'s property is a National Historical Site administered by the National Parks System. A visit there is at once educational and inspiring, for these are the paths that the artist trod and the rooms that he occupied while designing what many consider to be the ultimate in American coinage types made for regular circulation: the MCMVII High Relief Double Eagle.</p>

               <p>Today gold coins are a vital part of the numismatic scene. Indeed, the planners for the present Coinage of the Americas Conference undoubtedly selected the field because of its wide interest. The appeal of gold to mankind dates back to prehistory, but not so with collecting gold coins, at least not on the American scene. The Mint Act of April 2, 1792, set standards for coins subsequently produced by the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint, and provided for gold coins of the Quarter Eagle ($2.50), Half Eagle ($5), and Eagle ($10) denominations, the Eagle set at 270 grains standard weight, of which 247.5 grains were to be pure gold.<ref target="CH6-n1">1</ref> The lesser denominations were of equivalent fractional amounts. Although pattern coinage commenced in 1792 at the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> facility, and copper coins were produced for circulation in 1793, it was not until 1795 that the first gold issues became a reality. During the early years the law required that the Chief <name type="pname">Coiner</name> and <name type="pname">Assayer</name> each post surety bonds in the amount of $10,000 before striking coins in precious metals (silver and gold), and <name type="pname">Albion Cox</name> and <name type="pname">Henry Voigt</name>, who occupied these positions, were unable to fulfill this obligation. On March 30, 1794, Congress reduced the bond of the <name type="pname">Assayer</name> to $1,000 and that of the Chief <name type="pname">Coiner</name> to $5,000, after which <name type="pname">Cox</name> and <name type="pname">Voigt</name> had their surety bonds posted by others, and the coinage of precious metals was allowed to begin. Around May 1795, <name type="pname">David Rittenhouse</name>, Director of the Mint, assigned Engraver <name type="pname">Robert Scot</name> to produce Half Eagles. <name type="pname">Rittenhouse</name> left the Mint at the end of June and was replaced by <name type="pname">Henry William DeSaussure</name>, who ordered that gold coin production should begin. On July 31, 1795, the first quantity of Half Eagles, amounting to 744 pieces, was delivered, followed by subsequent deliveries through September 16 totaling 8,707 pieces for the year.</p>
               <p>While it is possible that someone at the Mint may have set aside a specimen or two of the initial coinage to serve as an example of the <name type="pname">coiner</name>'s art, it is not likely that this happened, for at the time little attention was given at the Mint to anything except the daily routine of manufacturing coins for the channels of commerce. In 1846, <name type="pname">William E. DuBois</name> (who served as <name type="pname">assayer</name> at the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint 1835–81) wrote: "The [Mint Collection] commenced in June 1838. Long before that date, however, <name type="pname">Mr. Adam Eckfeldt</name>, formerly chief coiner, led as well by his own taste as by the expectation that a conservatory would some day be established, took pains to preserve master coins of the different annual issues."<ref target="CH6-n2">2</ref>
               </p>
               <p>At the time the term "master coins" referred to specimen striking prepared with extreme care, including those with mirrorlike surfaces referred to as Proof in later years. In America the Proof
<pb n="86"/>
nomenclature seems to have been introduced by <name type="pname">James Ross Snowden</name> in the 1850s.</p>
               <p>To state that the Mint had its own reference collection of gold coins from the earliest years onward would be to strain credulity, for specimens of many issues currently on display there, examples which have been a part of the holdings since the nineteenth century, show evidence of circulation and do not seem to fit the "master coin" category.</p>
               <p>On March 3, 1839, Congress appropriated the sum of $1,000 for the acquisition of coins and mineral ores for the Mint Collection. In later years a continuing annual appropriation of $300 was made for the same purpose. From the inception of the collection in June 1838 through the end of the nineteenth century, various officials in charge of the Mint Collection (referred to as the Mint Collection, the National Collection, and by other appellations over the years) endeavored to set aside one of each date of coin produced at the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint. No effort was made to preserve mint-marked issues, such as those produced at <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, or <name type="place">Charlotte</name> beginning in the late 1830s. More often than not, the pieces saved were those made with a special Proof finish. In the absence of any claims to the contrary, the Mint Collection can be said to have the earliest foundation of any systematic holding formed of U.S. gold coins.</p>
               <p>From the inception of the Mint Collection in 1838 until the late 1850s, when <name type="pname">Montroville W. Dickeson</name> published his <hi rend="italic">American Numismatic Manual</hi>, coin collecting in <name type="place">America</name> was in its growth stage. <name type="pname">Joseph J. Mickley</name>, who began his interest in numismatics around the year 1816 when he was intrigued by the apparent unavailability of a cent bearing his birth date, 1799, incorporated Proof U.S. gold issues into his cabinet, but he does not seem to have made a particular specialty of them. <name type="pname">Mickley</name>'s contemporaries were not gold specialists, either.</p>

               <p>Although <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name>, <name type="pname">DuBois</name>, <name type="pname">Hickcox</name>, and others had written on American numismatics earlier,<ref target="CH6-n3">3</ref> it fell to <name type="pname">Montroville Wilson Dickeson, M.D.</name>, to write the first generally popular guide to coin collecting in <name type="place">America</name>.<ref target="CH6-n4">4</ref> His <hi rend="italic">Manual</hi> appeared in 1859 and was an immediate success, to be published in a second edition the following year, with the title slightly revised to <hi rend="italic">The American Numismatic Manual</hi>.

schools; where certainly no harm could arise from proper information being imparted relative to the origin and progress of our metallic currency—occupying as it has and now does, a paramount relation to everything that has made us a successful agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial people, and without which we would not yet have emerged from our infancy as a nation."<ref target="CH6-n5">5</ref> Assisting <name type="pname">Dickeson</name> in the preparation of his work were <name type="pname">Joseph J. Mickley</name>, perhaps the best-known numismatist of his era, and the following associated with the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint: <name type="pname">Jacob R. Eckfeldt</name>, <name type="pname">William E. DuBois</name>, and the <name type="pname">Hon. James Ross Snowden</name>.</p>
               <p>U.S. gold coins were the specific subject of 20 pages of <name type="pname">Dickeson</name>'s 256-page work. The writer introduced the subject as follows: "The data relevant to our gold coinage, owing to the want of proper mint records, and the great scarcity of the earlier emissions, is so limited as to render impracticable a particular detail of the types and varieties. We must, therefore, content ourselves with giving the different types and such varieties as have come under our observation. The early gold coinage of our government has become very scarce, and hence is exceedingly rare, being found more frequently in the southern than in the northern part of our Union. The first coinage of gold occurred in June 1795 in the form of eagles and half eagles....<ref target="CH6-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Dickeson</name> went on to describe the physical characteristics of various denominations and types. For example, the 1796 Half Eagle was said to comprise one type and two varieties. "One of the varieties bears the effigy of a well-formed and very pretty face, which has been denominated the Martha <name type="place">Washington</name>. It has been stated that she sat to the artist for this portrait. Whether true or not, the declaration has been sufficient to impress its credibility upon the imagination of someone, for the piece—based upon this idea—has been lately sold for the sum of $10. If there is any foundation for this statement, we must conclude that the artist's admiration of the lady's beauty overcame all scruples relative to the propriety of the act; and if he had but chronicled the fact, he might himself have been included in the charmed circle of the immortalized."<ref target="CH6-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Martha <name type="place">Washington</name> legend slipped into obscurity and is not recognized today. <name type="pname">Dickeson</name> overlooked the fact that the 1796 Half Eagle portrait did not differ from that used in 1795 or, for that matter, on other issues through 1807.</p>
               <p>As <name type="pname">Dickeson</name> was a pioneer it is not fair to make light of any aspect of his work, for the corpus as viewed today is indeed impressive, especially as it did not draw upon any earlier source for its foundation. Still, we cannot resist quoting his description of the 1841-C
<pb n="88"/>
Quarter Eagle, which he stated was of the same design as the previous issue, "...with the exception of the letter C on the reverse, which addition, as we are informed, referred to <name type="place">California</name>, this emission being a private enterprise designed for that country""<ref target="CH6-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Dickeson</name> delineated various gold coins from 1795 through 1857, but did not treat mint mark varieties. Indeed, as was the practice at the time, attention was given to the date only. An adjectival rarity rating was devised, and such terms as "plenty", "quite scarce", "scarce", "not scarce", "rare", "quite rare", and "extremely rare" were used. Among those considered to be in the extremely rare category were the 1796 $10, 1797 $2-1/2, and the 1798 $2-1/2. The 1822 $5, which was to emerge as one of <name type="place">America</name>'s most famous rarities after the coin was studied by a later generation of numismatists, was rated in 1859 as being only "rare", a lower designation than the "very rare" assigned to an 1826 $2-1/2 of the same era, a coin which was later found to be dozens of times more plentiful than the 1822 $5.</p>
               <p>An appendix to <name type="pname">Dickeson's</name> work was devoted to mintages of various denominations from 1793 to 1857, including gold coins from 1795 to the latter date.<ref target="CH6-n9">9</ref> Mint marks were not discussed; quantities minted were grouped together under date headings alone. Curiously only the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> figures were given. For example, for the year 1855 the reader was informed that Double Eagle coinage amounted to 364,666 pieces, which was only part of the story. Not mentioned were the 8,000 coins struck at the <name type="place">New Orleans</name> Mint that year and the impressive quantity, far larger than the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> emission, of 879,675 struck at <name type="place">San Francisco</name>. The figure for 1856 $20 pieces was similarly misleading and was given at 329,878, the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> production, with no mention made of the 2,250 struck at <name type="place">New Orleans</name> or the immense quantity of 1,189,750 produced in <name type="place">San Francisco</name>. The reader was given to understand that no Quarter Eagles were produced in 1841, per the mintage figures, although we know that <name type="pname">Dickeson</name> knew of an 1841-C (for "California"!).<ref target="CH6-n10">10</ref> Ignored also was the production of 10,211 1841-C (<name type="place">Charlotte</name> Mint) pieces, and 4,164 1841-D (<name type="place">Dahlonega</name>) examples.</p>
               <p>Production quantities for the <name type="place">Charlotte</name>, <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, and <name type="place">San Francisco</name> mints were readily available. <name type="pname">Hickcox</name> used certain of the branch mint figures in computing gold coin production totals for the years 1850, 1856, and 1857. In 1845, <name type="pname">J. L. Riddell, M.D.</name> prepared a pamphlet on the <name type="place">New Orleans</name> Mint, which included mintages by denomination for gold coins struck from 1835 to 1845.<ref target="CH6-n11">11</ref>

Specialties covered a broad spectrum and ranged from ancient issues to modern pieces, from foreign coins to those produced within the U.S. Although no figures exist, it is presumed that two dozen or fewer numismatists aspired to collect the larger denominations of gold coins, the $5, $10 and $20 pieces, by date sequence, and as will be seen not a single individual collected these by mint mark varieties.</p>
               <p>At the time it was considered that Proof represented the ultimate condition of a coin, a condition or grade better than Uncirculated. Today the situation is viewed differently: Proof, a method of manufacture, rather than a grade, is viewed as being "different from" rather than "better than" Uncirculated. A numismatist living in the year 1890, and endeavoring to fill his cabinet with date sequences of gold denominations, would order Proofs from the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint each year. Mint records indicate that during the 1870s there were numerous instances in which as few as 20 Proofs were made of a given gold issue, the 1874, 1875, 1877, and 1878 $10 being examples. Of the 1875 Proof gold coinage, just 20 were made of each denomination from the $1 through the $20. When these were produced, they were put on the shelf for potential sale. In actuality, sales of the higher denominations in 1875 tended to be sluggish, and it is not certain that all 20 of the $10 or $20 pieces were distributed, although the full quota of 20 $1 pieces may have been. As late as 1889, just 41 Proof $20 pieces were made, a figure hardly suggestive of wide demand.</p>
               <p>The only appreciable Proof coinage of the nineteenth century occurred in the dollar series from 1884 through 1889, when over 1,000 Proofs were made of each date, not because there was a great surge
<pb n="90"/>
in numismatic interest, but because gold dollars had become a popular speculation, and numerous citizens ordered them through banks or directly from the Mint.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Charles I. Bushnell</name>, <name type="pname">Joseph J. Mickley</name>, <name type="pname">Matthew A. Stickney</name>, <name type="pname">Harlan P. Smith</name>, <name type="pname">Lorin G. Parmelee</name>, <name type="pname">T. Harrison Garrett</name>, <name type="pname">J. C. Lighthouse</name>, <name type="pname">H. O. Granberg</name>, and <name type="pname">George F. Seavey</name>, to name some of the most prominent numismatists of the last century, did not acquire high denomination gold coins by date and mint mark sequence.<ref target="CH6-n13">13</ref> Rather the emphasis was on the date alone, although from time to time a stray mint-marked variety was acquired for one reason or another.</p>
               <p>Who were the early collectors of gold coins? It is known that <name type="pname">George Clapp</name> ordered certain gold coins directly from the issuing mints in the 1890s. <name type="pname">David S. Wilson</name> collected Half Eagles dated up to the 1860s, as well as Quarter Eagles and gold dollars, but not Double Eagles or Eagles. <name type="pname">Louis C. Gehring</name>, who died in 1921, collected by mint mark varieties, but we do not know when he began. <name type="pname">William H. Woodin</name> developed an early interest in mint mark issues, particularly those of denominations from the $1 through the $5, probably beginning no earlier than the 1890s. At one time Woodin owned the unique 1870-S $3.</p>
               <p>Beginning in the 1880s collectors formed a heightened interest in the $1 and $3 denominations, because the face value was low enough that a collection did not require a substantial outlay, because each series was relatively short, and, most importantly, because it was felt that the pieces would become scarce and valuable (as indeed they did). So far as can be learned, the typical numismatist of the 1880s or early 1890s, forming a cabinet of $1 and $3 pieces, did not expend any great effort to acquire a rare 1855-D, 1856-D, 1860-D, 1861-D, 1870-S, or other branch mint gold dollar, or an 1854-D $3 rarity. Emphasis was on date sequence alone.</p>

                  <name type="pname">Augustus G. Heaton</name>, author, poet, early member and President of the American Numismatic Association, and frequent contributor to <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi>, was the first to popularize the collecting of <name type="place">U.S.</name> coins by mint mark sequence. In 1893 his 54-page monograph on branch mints was published and widely advertised for sale at $1.00 per copy.<ref target="CH6-n14">14</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As curious as it may seem to readers now, when <name type="pname">Heaton</name> began his interest in the series—in the 1880s—few collectors cared whether a given dime, quarter, half dollar, gold dollar, or other coin bore a distinguishing mint letter. As noted already, <name type="pname">Dickeson</name>, certainly one of the foremost numismatists of his era, apparently did not know
<pb n="91"/>
what letters were used for which branch mints, and could have cared less. No accurate list giving known varieties had ever been published, and no one knew what was rare and what was common. "The need of distinct estimates was evident," wrote <name type="pname">Heaton</name> in 1893. "Preliminary searching proved that the rarity and consequent value of pieces of the same date from different mints were scarcely ever equal, and that some dates necessary to complete Branch Mint sequences never came to view."<ref target="CH6-n15">15</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Heaton</name>, far-seeing for the time, and combining the appeals of numismatics, economics, and social history, not only sought to disseminate information concerning mint mark coins, but he was an "evangelist" as well, devoting part of his monograph to so-called "Causes of Attractiveness," which called readers' attention to 17 distinct advantages of acquiring coins by mint mark varieties.</p>
               <p>"Mint Marks in their progressive issue at <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, <name type="place">Charlotte</name>, <name type="place">San Francisco</name>, and <name type="place">Carson City</name> show the direction of our country's growth and its development of mineral wealth," <name type="pname">Heaton</name> listed as the first "cause."<ref target="CH6-n16">16</ref> Today, as we near the centennial of <name type="pname">Heaton</name>'s work, this advantage is often overlooked. How many numismatists pause to consider the history and romance behind gold coins struck at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> and <name type="place">Charlotte</name> using planchet stock refined from locally obtained metal?</p>
               <p>Although <name type="pname">Heaton</name> did not specifically state this, of the six mints which had been or still were in operation by 1893, three of them—<name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, <name type="place">Charlotte</name>, and <name type="place">San Francisco</name>—were opened specifically to coin gold from local and regional metal, while a fourth, <name type="pname">Carson City</name>, coined much local gold in addition to silver from the <name type="pname">Comstock Lode</name>, and a fifth, <name type="pname">New Orleans</name>, coined substantially more gold issues than silver (in terms of total face value of pieces produced), but not from metal found in the area. Only the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint, the mother mint established in 1792, can be said not to have been directly tied to local gold production, although beginning in 1794 gold coin production became an important part of operations there. When the Denver Mint began production of coins in 1906, the primary value of its output was comprised of gold coins struck from metal from the Cripple Creek District and other regional sources. The most recent U.S. mint, the West Point Bullion Depository, owes its status to gold, and is the source for modern commemorative pieces bearing the distinctive mint letter W.</p>
               <p>Among <name type="pname">Heaton</name>'s other Causes of Attractiveness was his fifth item: "A knowledge of the coinage of the different Branch Mints gives the many usually considered common dates great rarity if certain Mint Marks are upon them."<ref target="CH6-n17">17</ref> This comes as no surprise to modern
<pb n="92"/>
numismatists, but, as noted, in 1893 it made little difference to the average collector whether a given coin bore an S, CC, or other mint mark. Collecting by date was the norm. In a conversation with the present author in the 1950s, <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl</name> related that as late as 1904–5 there was very little interest in collecting coins by mint mark varieties, although <name type="pname">Heaton</name>'s book had been on the market for over a decade. Indeed it was not until 1909, when the presence of an S mint mark on a VDB <name type="pname">Lincoln</name> cent gave it considerable extra value, that mint mark collecting became widespread, and even then it did not extend to gold coins.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Heaton</name>'s sixth cause noted: "Mint-Mark study gives nicety of taste and makes a mixed set of pieces unendurable." In other words, the collecting method adopted by just about everyone interested in the American series was completely unacceptable to him.<ref target="CH6-n18">18</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Cause no. 13 appealed to the profit motive of the reader: "As Mint Marks have not heretofore been sought, or studied as they deserve, many varieties yet await in circulation the good fortune of collectors who cannot buy freely of coins more in demand, and who, in having access to large sums of money, may draw therefrom prizes impossible to seekers after older dates."<ref target="CH6-n19">19</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A special section of <name type="pname">Heaton</name>'s work was devoted to mint marks on U.S. gold coins.<ref target="CH6-n20">20</ref> By 1893 <name type="pname">Heaton</name>, who was widely connected in numismatic circles, knew of no other collector of mint mark gold coins, except for an individual who specialized in gold dollars. The author himself collected $1 and $3 pieces. Apparently no one aspired to save Quarter Eagles, Half Eagles, Eagles, or Double Eagles by date and mint mark sequence. Although <name type="pname">Heaton</name> studied such high denomination pieces, he did not collect them. His reasons for not acquiring the other series were not stated, but the high face value may have been a consideration. His comments concerning rarity were derived by observing mint marks included in date sets.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Heaton</name> noted that in the period since the suspension of gold dollar coinage in 1889, pieces of the denomination had risen in value on the market so as to command "nearly fifty cents premium. It has attracted great attention from many collectors who have sought no other gold series, and its Mint Marks have become generally very rare." Among <name type="place">New Orleans</name> gold dollars, "the 1850 only is rare," while all <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> pieces were considered to be "precious," the 1860-D to be "exceedingly rare," the 1855-D and 1856-D "excessively rare." The 1861-D was described as "not in the Mint Report, but two pieces are known, one being in our possession."<ref target="CH6-n21">21</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Nine varieties of <name type="place">Charlotte</name> gold dollars were discussed, including the 1854-C, which was "not to be considered obtainable as, accor-
<pb n="93"/>
ding to the Report, but four pieces were coined and these are now unknown."<ref target="CH6-n22">22</ref> Decades later <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> would discover that the mention in a Mint Report of the coinage of four 1854-C gold dollars was an error, and that none was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Heaton</name> commented on other gold dollars: "The 'S' or <name type="place">San Francisco</name> issues are seven: 1854, '56, '57, '58, '59, '60 and '70, all being obtainable but the latter, which is excessively rare and the only one of the gold Dollar Mint Marks that we do not possess."<ref target="CH6-n23">23</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the $3 series <name type="pname">Heaton</name> described the 1854-D and 1854-O, the only <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> and <name type="place">New Orleans</name> varieties of this denomination, and the <name type="place">San Francisco</name> issues of 1855, 1856, 1857, and 1860. "All are very rare except the 1856, which, however, is interesting from having two varieties, a large and a small S."<ref target="CH6-n24">24</ref> Apparently he did not have knowledge of the 1870-S $3.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Heaton</name> described his own collection and told of the lack of interest in higher denominations: "With these [the $3 pieces] our direct knowledge of Mint Mark <hi rend="italic">varieties</hi> in the precious metal ceases, as we have found no gold collectors who noticed them, and as our collection in [the] bank has no other gold than the One Dollar and Three Dollar series (these being complete in all Mints, except one piece). We can, however, give the Branch Mint dates and rarities of the '<hi rend="italic">Eagle Denominations</hi>' [a reference to the Quarter Eagle, Half Eagle, Eagle and Double Eagle], until their varieties come to light."<ref target="CH6-n25">25</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Heaton</name> wrote that 75 varieties of mint mark quarter eagles had been produced from 1839 to 1893, representing $187.50 in face value. Concerning <name type="place">San Francisco</name> issues, <name type="pname">Heaton</name> noted that varieties were produced at that western mint from 1854 through 1879, except for 1855, 1864, and 1874. "The great prize of the series is 1858. 1876 is scarce, but no other date should be so from the amount coined."<ref target="CH6-n26">26</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Heaton</name> did not recognize that the 1854-S, of which only 246 were minted, was far and away the rarest <name type="place">San Francisco</name> Quarter Eagle, and that no 1858-S specimens were minted. How he determined that the latter non-existent piece was "the great prize of the series" is unknown.</p>
               <p>In his discussion of Half Eagles, <name type="pname">Heaton</name> noted that the 1861-D was very rare, that the 1854-S is "exceedingly rare and should command a high price," that 1864-S and 1876-S were rare, and 1875-S and 1862-S are scarce. "The rest should be readily found in the far western banks." Apparently he knew little about <name type="place">Carson City</name> issues, as reflected in this statement: "<name type="place">Carson City</name> issued Half Eagles from 1870 to '84 continuously. No date is of small issue and all may be hopefully sought where western gold circulates."<ref target="CH6-n27">27</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="94"/>
               <p>Among Eagles or $10 pieces, the 1883-O was considered to be a "high prize," the 1864-S was very scarce, and the 1879-CC rare. "No eagles were coined at <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> or <name type="place">Charlotte</name>—a great saving of time and money to the collector." This statement is in seeming contradiction to his Causes of Attractiveness, for collectors would thus be deprived of the pleasure of owning such items.<ref target="CH6-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Double Eagles formed the focus for several paragraphs. "Neither at <name type="place">Charlotte</name> or <name type="place">Dahlonega</name> was the Double Eagle coined, a fact which aspiring gold collectors will be relieved to know," apparently for no other reason than that the face value of a $20 piece was apt to represent two or three weeks' wages to the average working person of the era. Among <name type="place">New Orleans</name> Double Eagles, the 1854-O, 1856-O and 1879-O "are very scarce dates," but "the others should be freely found." All <name type="place">San Francisco</name> pieces were considered to be common. The information concerning <name type="place">Carson City</name> Double Eagles was contradictory, as it was stated that pieces had been struck from 1870 through 1885 except for 1881 and 1882 (actually pieces were struck in 1882) and from 1889 to 1893. Then <name type="pname">Heaton</name> went on to say that the 1881-CC was "rather scarce." In actuality, no 1881-CC coins were minted. It is not surprising that <name type="pname">Heaton</name>'s treatise contained a few errors, for he was breaking new ground. What is surprising is that there were not more errors.<ref target="CH6-n29">29</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Heaton</name> gave this advice: "Collectors should, at all events, if living near any one of the Branch Mints, seek to gather a series of one or more of its gold denominations. They should without fail, save the rarest dates of any series if chancing upon them, for with the decline of Mint Mark coinage, such pieces will attain very great value."<ref target="CH6-n30">30</ref>
               </p>
               <p>He continued his advice:
<q>From the very limited use of gold in the greater part of the <name type="place">United States</name>, these pieces are not to be found by simply waiting for them to appear in circulation as in the case of silver coin, nor will they form any part of the collections that revert to dealers for sale. It becomes therefore of the utmost importance that dealers and collectors should use all influence to examine the gold reserve of the banks in their vicinity, or that paying tellers, and those persons who count the cash in Government vaults, Sub-Treasuries, Branch Mints and private financial institutions, should be somewhat informed numismatically, both for their own profit and the enriching of private and public collections by their discoveries. But it would cause less delay here also if some
<pb n="95"/>
experienced collector were authorized to be present when the counting of coin was in progress, both to see the contents of sacks and to mark upon them as far as possible the period of the coinage they contained.</q>
                  <q>Furnished with a number of pieces of the denominations undergoing count, his trained eye could quickly detect rarities which he could at once secure and replace.<ref target="CH6-n31">31</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Picture in your mind's eye the collecting scene in 1893: the numismatist aspiring to collect the larger mint mark denominations, especially $5, $10, and $20, would find no such coins in dealers' stocks, save by the merest chance, as cabinets did not contain these pieces, except as stray fillers for dates in which <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> coins were not readily available. Thus gold coins had to be acquired from circulation or through banks and other commercial channels.</p>
               <p>Thus it is demonstrated that as late as 1893, no concerted effort had been made to collect mint mark varieties of higher denominations, and only a few numismatists aspired to collect mint marks of the $1 and $3 values. Apparently no attempt whatever had been made to secure <name type="place">Charlotte</name>, <name type="place">Dahlonega</name>, <name type="place">San Francisco</name>, <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, or <name type="place">Carson City</name> coins at their time of issue, or to preserve quantities of mint mark coins for investment or other purposes. Because of this, numerous gold coins which had been minted in large quantities were found by a later generation of numismatists to be extremely rare in Uncirculated state. Consider for example the 1876-S $5, of which 4,000 were minted, and which is always found in worn grades. In Gem Uncirculated grade, equal today to MS-65 or better, apparently just one exists—the Garrett Collection coin which sold for $34,000,<ref target="CH6-n32">32</ref> despite a catalogue value of just $275 (1969, the last year for which a catalogue value was listed).</p>
               <p>Although <name type="pname">Heaton</name> laid the foundations for mint mark collecting in 1893, and although generous space was devoted to gold coins by mint mark varieties, his efforts did not precipitate a groundswell or, for that matter, even a serious ripple. Even by 1933, 40 years later, few numismatists were interested in mint mark sequences of the larger gold denominations. By that time, however, the collecting of $1 and $3 pieces by varieties had become firmly established.</p>

               <p>As noted, numismatists of the late nineteenth century did not aspire to collect mint marks. <name type="pname">T. Harrison Garrett</name>, who collected from the mid-1860s until his untimely death in a yachting accident in June 1888, developed an interest in gold coins, acquiring numerous
<pb n="96"/>
rarities from <name type="pname">W. Foster Ely</name>, <name type="pname">Harold P. Newlin</name>, the Chapman brothers, and other specialists of the era; but the emphasis was always on dates, not mint marks. Two decades later his son, <name type="pname">John Work Garrett</name>, continued the family collection and added to it through the 1930s. Following <name type="pname">John Work Garrett's</name> death his collection, and the magnificent mansion housing it, were bequeathed to <name type="place">Johns Hopkins University</name>. Similarly, <name type="pname">Lorin G. Parmelee</name> sought to form a comprehensive collection of U.S. gold coins, and by 1890 had built the most extensive cabinet ever gathered, but again he did not pay attention to mint marks. By June 1, 1889, the date of the first entry in his coin journal, <name type="pname">Virgil M. Brand</name>, a wealthy <name type="place">Chicago</name> brewer, had begun to collect coins, eventually gathering a vast holding which by the time of his death in 1926 comprised some 350,000 pieces estimated to be worth several million dollars. While Brand had numerous gold Proofs and rare dates (including an 1822 Half Eagle and an 1861 <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint Paquet $20), and although he had common date Double Eagles by the hundreds or possibly by the thousands (these were disposed of at face value after his death), there is no evidence that he seriously sought rare mint marks. <name type="pname">William Forrester Dunham</name>, whose collecting interest dated from the turn of the century and continued through the 1930s (his collection was sold by <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl</name> in 1941), also sought gold coins, particularly rarities, and at one time had an 1822 $5, but mint marks were not his forte. Such other numismatists as <name type="pname">John Story Jenks</name>, <name type="pname">James Ten Eyck</name>, and <name type="pname">Waldo C. Newcomer</name> had impressive collections of gold coins (<name type="pname">Newcomer</name> once owned the unique 1870-S $3), but mint mark varieties of larger denominations were ignored.<ref target="CH6-n33">33</ref>
               </p>
               <p>During the early twentieth century, gold coins were readily available at banks, although except for certain parts of the west they were rarely seen in everyday circulation. From all indications, <name type="pname">Heaton</name>'s advice given in 1893, that rare mint marks could be obtained at face value from banks and other sources, was still appropriate in 1920. Emphasis continued to be on dates and dates alone, although a few numismatists, the aforementioned <name type="pname">George Clapp</name> among them, were beginning to set aside mint marks.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> coinage of 1907, which is extensively detailed in many other places including my <hi rend="italic">United States Gold Coins: An Illustrated History</hi>, will not be discussed at length here, except to state that upon the release of the MCMVII High Relief Double Eagles at the end of 1907, a popular speculation arose, and soon the coins had a market value of $25 to $30. This may have spurred additional interest in collecting gold coins, but if it did, the effects were not lasting, for Matte Proof and related Proof gold coins pro-
<pb n="97"/>
duced from 1908 through 1915 attracted few buyers. By 1920 the market for Proof <name type="pname">Double Eagles</name> dating from the late 1880s onward was so sluggish that <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl</name>, for one, stated (in a conversation with the present writer) that it was easier to turn such pieces in to the bank for face value, than to offer them for sale and have them bring $21 or $22.</p>
               <p>In April 1933, it was announced that no more gold coins would be manufactured by the U.S. government, and, moreover, all earlier issues were to be surrendered to the U.S. Treasury, with the exception of certain pieces which were considered to be of numismatic value, including Quarter Eagles of all dates. By this time the collecting of gold coins, especially of larger denominations and by mint mark varieties, was not of interest to many collectors, and few cared that millions of mint mark pieces were headed to the melting pot. As a result, by 1935 countless rarities had been destroyed.</p>
               <p>Relatively new on the coin collecting scene was <name type="pname">Louis Eliasberg</name>, a <name type="place">Baltimore</name> gentleman who was to become a prominent banker during the 1930s, and who was first attracted to the hobby when he realized that gold coins would be withdrawn from circulation. Seeking to form a collection, he set aside pieces at face value; later he obtained numismatic reference books and decided to become a full-fledged numismatist. In 1942 he purchased en bloc the <name type="pname">George Clapp</name> collection through Stack's, paying an unheard-of $100,000 for it—a sum greater than realized by the entire <name type="pname">William Forrester Dunham</name> collection sold by <name type="pname">Mehl</name> in 1941. By the late 1940s, <name type="pname">Eliasberg</name> was within striking distance of doing something no person had done before or has done since: acquiring one of each date and mint mark issue of U.S. coinage from 1793 onward. By 1950 his quest had ended, and he was the proud possessor of the 1870-S $3, one of three known 1822 $5 gold pieces, and numerous other legendary rarities. In the meantime, several collections containing mint mark coins had been formed and dispersed, notable among them being the <name type="pname">Jake Bell</name> and <name type="pname">Col. James W. Flanagan</name> holdings sold by <name type="pname">Stack'</name>s in 1944.<ref target="CH6-n34">34</ref> Both <name type="pname">Flanagan</name> and <name type="pname">Bell</name> aspired to collect mint mark varieties.</p>
               <p>By the late 1940s, as <name type="pname">Louis Eliasberg</name> drew close to his goal, several dozen numismatists competed to put together sets of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> $20 pieces, 1907–32 by mint mark variety. Especially in demand were the branch mint issues from the late 1920s. The <name type="pname">William Cutler Atwater</name> Collection sold by <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl</name> in 1946 contained numerous mint mark gold coins. The $10 pieces were described as "virtually complete in all mints," while the $20 denomination was offered as "from 1850 to 1920 complete in all mints."</p>

auction in 1950 by <name type="pname">Numismatic Gallery</name> (<name type="pname">Abe Kosoff</name> and <name type="pname">Abner Kreisberg</name>) and included many mint mark issues. The vast numismatic holdings of <name type="pname">King Farouk</name> of <name type="place">Egypt</name>, sold at auction in February 1954, contained many gold rarities, primarily in the Proof and pattern series.</p>
               <p>To detail the collections of coins sold at auction or still intact from the early 1950s to date would involve many pages. Suffice it to say that in modern times collecting gold coins by date and mint mark sequence has emerged as a popular discipline, and many authors, <name type="pname">Walter H. Breen</name> and <name type="pname">David W. Akers</name> prominent among them, have studied the subject intensely and have published fine reference books. The firm of Stack's, Numismatic Gallery (originally <name type="pname">Kosoff</name> and <name type="pname">Kreisberg</name>, later <name type="pname">Abner Kreisberg</name> joined with <name type="pname">Jerry Cohen</name>), Paramount International Coin Corporation, <name type="place">New Netherlands</name> Coin Company, Superior Galleries, Rare Coin Company of <name type="place">America</name> and others, including Auctions by Bowers and Merena, Inc., of which the author is co-owner, have produced many fine auction catalogues and have sold collections bearing such names as <name type="pname">Davis-Graves</name>, <name type="pname">Garrett</name>, <name type="pname">Melish</name>, <name type="pname">Judd</name>, <name type="pname">Wolfson</name>, <name type="pname">Peake</name>, <name type="pname">Gilhousen</name>, <name type="pname">Carter</name>, <name type="pname">Kaufman</name>, <name type="pname">Brand</name>, and <name type="pname">Norweb</name>, among a list of many others.</p>
               <p>Deserving special mention is the collection of the pharmaceutical executive <name type="pname">Josiah K. Lilly</name>, formed over a period of years through the offices of <name type="pname">Stack's</name>. Following <name type="pname">Lilly's</name> death on May 5, 1966, executors of his estate consummated an arrangement with the U.S. government whereby in exchange for tax credit to the estate in the amount of $5,532,208, his collection of gold coins would be donated to the Smithsonian Institution. Assisting with the appraisal were <name type="pname">Abe Kosoff</name> and <name type="pname">Hans M. F. Schulman</name>. Today the <name type="pname">Lilly</name> Collection is a proud part of the Numismatic Department of the Smithsonian and is a prime attraction for all those who visit there.</p>
               <p>While these and other names have made the front pages of auction catalogues, a number of important collections have been formed behind the scenes. <name type="pname">Harry W. Bass, Jr.</name>, former President of the ANS, assisted by <name type="pname">Mike Brownlee</name>, began in the 1960s the formation of what was to become a major coin collection. Harry developed his interest to the finest extent, and soon was conversant not only with history, mintages, and other technical details, but had discovered new die varieties and had aided the fund of numismatic knowledge.</p>
               <p>While gold coin collecting of our own era is well documented in auction catalogues and books of our own generation, less well documented are the activities of our numismatic forebears. It is hoped that the present discussion will illuminate in particular the collecting scene as it existed for gold coins during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>

Clearly even in 1895 there were very few collectors who included Double Eagles in their collections, and probably fewer still included them in any systematic fashion.</p>

            <p>This is not the first time I have been to the American Numismatic Society. As a senior in high school I came into this building to see the Confederate half dollar. While it is no longer on display, the Society continues to exhibit some extraordinary things. It is certainly fortunate for all of us that the Society exists.</p>
            <p>I have chosen to speak on the politics of coinage because I think it is a topic that is discussed more than you might imagine in numismatic literature but not identified as such. When I was a child in Lafayette I turned to the pages of one of the only sources of information available, Yeoman's <hi rend="italic">Guide Book</hi>.<ref target="CH6-n1">1</ref> The illustrations were of course the first thing that attracted me, as they attract anyone at any age. The empathy you feel toward certain designs is probably the irrepressible motive that brings most people to collect not only coinage but anything else. But the dates, the beginnings and ends of the periods of time in which designs were used, are also direct political records. It is no accident that our first coinage was struck in 1792; it falls at the end of the First Congress of the <name type="place">United States</name> in authorization, at the onset of the Second Congress of the <name type="place">United States</name> in implementation.</p>
            <p>Throughout the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book</hi>, in the section headings, are to be found references to "Acts of Congress." If you scan the pages, you will see arrows appear in leaves, rays introduced to the reverse: all of these things correspondingly depend on acts of Congress. When people say it "takes an act of Congress to do it," the fact of the matter is that it does, because in September 1787, in Section 8 of the first article of the Constitution, we placed the legislative power to make coins in the hands of the Congress of the <name type="place">United States</name>. It has rested there for two centuries; each and every change, no matter how minute, has in some manner a political source and a political consequence.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">HR 3251</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Let us take the case of a recent commemorative coinage proposal and see what it illustrates—let us turn to HR 3251. One of the first things you learn as a Member of Congress is that in order to get an HR you have to write a bill; you put the text into a hopper which is right where you see it on television, to the right of the viewer as he looks at the speaker. There is no fanfare; a leaflet is quietly dropped in on a noisy afternoon and it is given a number. In this instance, on September 10, 1987, <name type="pname">Dante Fascell</name> of <name type="place">Florida</name> dropped in an unpretentious bill requiring simply that we have a Bicentennial of the <name type="place">United States</name> Congress Commemorative Coin Act. It specified the denominations that ultimately resulted—a half dollar,
<pb n="103"/>
dollar and five dollar gold coin. The concept was similar to previous programs of recent years commemorating such events as the Olympic games.</p>
               <p>So on September 10, we initiated and five days later, on September 15, referred the bill to the appropriate subcommittee, Consumer Affairs and Coinage, a subcommittee of the Committee on Banking. It is important to recognize this committee process as it has developed in Congress. Sometimes when we move beyond the Beltway in <name type="place">Washington</name>, we have the feeling that every legislator handles everything. The letters that I receive in my office daily are on every imaginable subject, and each one of these will move toward its niche in a legislative effort.</p>
               <p>The Committee on Banking moves everything related to coinage. The Subcommittee on Coinage was combined with Consumer Affairs in order to hold down the number of subcommittees. We already have enough with 17 full standing committees, and their subcommittees which now total over 100.</p>
               <p>Remarkably, hearings were held on HR 3251 on September 15, the same day it was referred. Markup was held on September 15 and on September 29 the bill was moved up on the House calendar under a suspension of the rules.</p>
               <p>What that means is that there is a quiet day on the floor and non-controversial measures are usually listed automatically by voice vote; in the rare case when someone calls for a vote, it usually refers to a previous motion and allows it to be voted on the following day. For example on Monday, when I get back to <name type="place">Washington D.C.</name>, there will be eight or nine bills stacked up. These will not be voted until late in the afternoon no matter when they were debated, if there are votes at all. They are all under suspension, all allegedly non-controversial as was HR 3251. It was passed by voice vote on September 29, the same day it was brought up. The following day it went to the Senate Banking Committee. So far, so good.</p>
               <p>In May of 1988, the Senate Banking Committee finally took up HR 3251. In June it was reported to the Senate with a few amendments, and placed on the calendar June 10. June 15 there was a motion to proceed to consideration; June 15 it was laid before the Senate and passed, with a few amendments, 96-0. On June 23 the House agreed to most of the amendments but disagreed with some, so on July 12 the measure was laid before the Senate by unanimous consent. The Senate concurred with most amendments, not all. The House agreed to the Senate amendments on July 13 and cleared the bill for the White House. On July 27 it was presented to the President, on August 1 it was signed by <name type="pname">Mr. Reagan</name> and became Law
<pb n="104"/>
100-378. Great story, right?</p>
               <p>It has absolutely nothing to do with commemorative coinage. That bill died 24 hours later. The amendments that I glossed over were amendments put in during the late days of July. As I said earlier, it was the Banking Committees—the act extended for one year, until August 10, 1989, the moratorium on voluntary termination of Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation insured status. All other provisions were repealed. The Senate used this vehicle to accomplish an emergency need in banking and therefore sacrificed the commemorative bill in order to get the FDIC and FSLIC issues before the President of the <name type="place">United States</name> by the end of the year. The bill began, it ended.</p>
               <p>There is an educational film used in schools to show how a bill is passed. The film shows how a bill starts with filing and then moves to subcommittee. Hearings are held, then it goes before the full committee, then before the House. The same thing occurs in the Senate; the two houses get together in conferences, and finally there is a conference report. That is voted on. If passed it goes to the President who either signs it, vetos it or does nothing. It becomes law. That is perhaps true in the sixth grade, but in <name type="place">Washington D.C.</name> things are more bizarre.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">HR 5280</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Let us jump to the next year. Now we're dealing with a different House bill—HR 5280. Undaunted by what happened the previous year, Dante Fascell, on September 13, files a slightly different bill. This one contains the same provisions he originally had for all the proceeds to be applied toward retirement of the national debt. The bill has the same title and this time he doesn't even have a hearing. He's able to move it more quickly because of the hearing the previous year.</p>
               <p>On October 1 the new bill is referred to the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, on October 3 called up by the House, on October 3 considered by the House as unfinished business. On October 4 it is passed on a vote of 411-8—very controversial. October 5 it is received in the Senate and read twice. Apparently that took two days. On October 7 the measure is laid before the Senate by unamimous consent, October 7 it is passed by the Senate with a mild amendment by voice vote. October 20 the House concurs in the Senate amendments. On October 20 the Senate agrees to the House amendment by voice vote and it is cleared for the White House. On November 10 it is presented to the President, and signed by him November 17 to become Public Law 100-673.</p>
               <pb n="105"/>
               <p>This time it went through quietly and without political controversy, didn't it? Not quite.</p>
               <p>The original bill, under Section 8, had a provided that "...all surcharges received by the Secretary from the sale of coins minted under this Act shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury and shall be used for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt." The bill the President signed contains a slightly revised form of Section 8, resulting from a compromise. In summary, it provides that the first half of the first $40 million in surcharges shall be deposited in the Capitol Preservation Fund and available to the <name type="place">United States</name> Capitol Preservation Commission. That's good—except there was no Capitol Preservation Commission. But a few days later there was one. The bill creating it came out of the Senate, was concurred in by the House, and the President decided to sign these bills in <hi rend="italic">reverse order</hi> of their passage. Therefore the Capitol Preservation Act was signed after the Commemorative Coin Act and the Preservation bill contained language that funnels <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of the funds and the surcharges to the Capitol Preservation Fund and the Capitol Preservation Society. Therefore by reversing the order between passage and signing what we now have is a lot of money going to the Capitol Preservation Fund.</p>
               <p>This is an illustration of politics in coinage. It was certainly not the original intention to use this commemorative coinage vehicle to create the Capitol Preservation Fund or to finance it. But in the political arena, particularly toward the end of the year, when people are scrambling to complete legislation, vehicles are sought in both the House and the Senate to accomplish these ends. This has been true for years. Some of you may remember the 1960s when Senator <name type="pname">Everett Dirksen</name> passed the School Prayer Bill as an amendment to National Little League Baseball Day, a commemorative bill which was then in the Senate. We are not dealing with something new but we are dealing with something that is very, very real. The Capitol Preservation bill was one of the projects of Senator <name type="pname">Robert Byrd</name> of <name type="place">West Virginia</name>, then the Majority Leader in the Senate. From that position and with a pretty good staff he found a vehicle which was very attractive, which was very popular on both sides of Congress and he was able to utilize it in order to accomplish his goal. I don't criticize him for that, I commend him for it.</p>
               <p>Passage of the bill also brought about a second floor fight. Section 4 of the original bill, dealing with design of the coinage, provided for "consultation" between the Commission of Fine Arts and the Secretary of the Treasury. In the subsequent bill that became law, Section 4 states that the "design for each coin authorized shall
<pb n="106"/>
be selected by the Secretary after consultation with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tem of the Senate, and the Commission of Fine Arts." In the interim, Senator <name type="pname">Byrd</name> had become President pro tem of the Senate. I suspect that is not a coincidence. In the intervening legislation we also moved from the Commission of Fine Arts to the Capitol Preservation Society which was going to make recommendations (though it didn't exist) and we then moved to the particular individual interested in, and the driving force behind it, Senator <name type="pname">Byrd</name>.</p>
               <p>How then did the Speaker of the House get involved? Speaker <name type="pname">Jim Wright</name> was not particularly desirous of getting involved with anything during these times in 1988. But even before the Speaker was elected a member of Congress, he was a close friend of <name type="pname">Mrs. Corinne C. Boggs</name>, the dean of the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> delegation who also happens to be the Chairman of the Bicentennial of Congress Commission. <name type="pname">Mrs. Boggs</name> asked the Speaker to become involved, so that the input of the Architect of the Capitol as well as those who had appeared before the Commission could be equally felt. So you end up with a political compromise that has the Speaker of the House, President pro tem of the Senate, the Fine Arts Commission, but ultimately poor <name type="pname">Mr. Brady</name> having to make each one of these groups happy and having to distill these various inputs into his final decision.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Politics of Implementation</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I now move from point one—the politics of legislation to point two—the politics of implementation. As you can imagine the competition among artists to become part of the unique numismatic history of America is very keen. Those who were interested in this particular opportunity submitted a multitude of different designs. The political consequences of those submissions are something that numismatic scholars sometimes overlook. This is not the first or the last time it will happen.</p>
               <p>Three designs were represented in the press kit circulated by the U.S. Mint. These designs reflect the political sensitivities of a House leader, a Senate leader and the Secretary of the Treasury, endeavoring to make everybody happy.</p>
               <p>The reverse design of the dollar is the mace which resides in the House of Representatives; it never leaves there. It belongs to the Office of the Sergeant-at-Arms or it's on the House floor. The mace is placed on a pedestal when we go into the Committee of the Whole.</p>
               <p>The reverse of the five dollar coin is the magnificent eagle you
<pb n="107"/>
will see if you watch a rerun of <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="pname">Mr. Smith Goes</name> to <name type="place">Washington</name>
                  </hi>, right behind <name type="pname">Jimmy Stewart</name> as he makes an impassioned plea for the young men who want to save their property from being dammed up and flooded. The eagle has never left the <name type="place">United States</name> Senate.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-48">

                  <p>1. U.S. Congressional Coins, 1989.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>Finally, the reverse of the half dollar is the Capitol with both the House and Senate grounds showing. So we have an emblem of the House, an emblem of the Senate and an emblem of the full Congress.</p>
               <p>The obverse designs are the complete Capitol Dome which is dead center between the Senate and House Chambers; the magnificent bronze statue of Freedom which stands atop the dome dead center; and a closeup design on a half dollar of that same figure dead center. We have compromised perfectly then the interests of the Senate and the interests of the House, and we have laid down the geographic boundary that's the midpoint of both chambers in order to design the coinage commemorating this Capitol.</p>
               <p>This is political implementation, based on the give and take of those present, each one wanting to assure a portion of the body that he represents as well as those things that are emblematic for all people. The point that I wish to emphasize here is that political considerations have always been a part of coinage and will probably
<pb n="108"/>
always be. This has been true from the time that we argued in the Second Congress of the <name type="place">United States</name> over the compensation that would be paid to the Chief <name type="pname">Coiner</name>, to the time that the Secretary of the Treasury had vehement arguments with President <name type="pname">Theodore Roosevelt</name> over redesign of coinage, to a few months ago when we had acceptance by committee of the final designs for what I think is a beautiful series of commemorative coins.</p>
               <p>In the future, I would propose that numismatic scholars record the legislative histories of coinage bills as they are proposed; document the hearings and comments when made; conduct interviews with key members; and solicit the private papers of those who make the decisions in order to preserve the information in research institutions such as the ANS. Then posterity can look back to previous occasions, as I would love to look back now and learn precisely what went into the work of <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name>, <name type="pname">Hermon McNeil</name>, or <name type="pname">James Earle Frazer</name>. The political part of the process usually passes solely into volumes of paper, the personality aspects disappear and archaeological work is needed to connect what happened with those people who were the driving forces behind the legislation. Once lost, this information is virtually impossible to reconstruct.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A final note on political consequence is in order here because to me it is quite personal. I no longer collect coins. I do however retain vivid memories of the time that I did, the people that I knew and the people that I still know, the friendships made. The politics of that are very simple.</p>
               <p>The Capitol Commemorative issues, like so many others before, will be found attractive and purchased based upon the criteria of design and subject matter. Almost every commemorative coin issue based on popular subject matter, beautifully executed, has sold very well. Those that have had some criticism of the design or were not a particularly popular idea, although considered worthy of commemoration, have not done well.</p>
               <p>In the current case, during the first five weeks surcharges amounting to $10 million have been collected through this commemoration of the bicentennial of the Congress of the <name type="place">United States</name>. I don't know what the final figures will be. I suspect the mintage will be fairly low, for we are going through a period of time when public criticism of the Congress is very, very high. So, despite what I think is often excellent design work, the subject matter itself may not be remarkably appealing. That is wrong and unfortunate.</p>
               <p>The Statue of Freedom (which some people confuse with the
<pb n="109"/>
Statue of Liberty) that sits atop the Capitol Dome has been there since <name type="pname">Abraham Lincoln</name> was President. Beneath this Dome, the remarkable panoramic painting of major American events from <name type="place">Columbus</name>'s landing to the Civil War, was completed after his death in 1865. Directly below that chamber is the crypt that would have been prepared for <name type="place">George Washington</name> who refused to be buried on the Capitol grounds, insisting instead on being buried in his native <name type="place">Virginia</name>. Beneath it is Statuary Hall where each State is represented by those personalities deemed by the State Legislatures to represent some of the best and the brightest. To the east and the west are the lawns where presidents have been inaugurated: to the east is where <name type="pname">John Kennedy</name> stood and delivered the famous address that school children now recite; to the west is where <name type="pname">Ronald Reagan</name> broke tradition and was inaugarated as president, followed recently by <name type="pname">George Bush</name>. The gardens that <name type="pname">President Bush</name> looked down upon were designed by <name type="pname">Olmsted</name> who also did the work at Central Park in <name type="place">New York City</name> and who also happens to have done the magnificent design at the <name type="pname">Audubon Zoo</name> in my home in <name type="place">New Orleans</name>.</p>
               <p>The art work contained in the House of Representatives and the Senate is virtually unparalleled. The brass and marble work is unlike anything elsewhere. Unfortunately much of this grandeur is lost through improper or deficient lighting. There are magnificent oils that you cannot even see as you go up the chamber steps to turn in to vote. I think the 4 million Americans who tour the Capitol every summer should have an opportunity to see it better and in a finer state of repair.</p>
               <p>So I salute <name type="pname">Senator Byrd</name> who used 50 years of legislative experience and his intimate knowledge of parliamentary procedure to get the money to allow millions of people to see an impressive national treasure. I would like to see this commemorative issue much more readily accepted by the American people. What is wrong with Congress, always in the public view, is also what is right with Congress. The deficiencies of the people who serve in the Senate or the House are nothing more than a reflection of the fact that for 200 years people have directly participated in Government. The House of Representatives is in fact a microcosm of the American people. It is what <name type="pname">James Madison</name>, <name type="pname">John Jay</name>, and <name type="pname">Alexander Hamilton</name> intended it to be 200 years ago when they set its boundaries geographically in the Constitution and when they set its boundaries politically in that same document. In the Ladies Caucus Room is a bench where <name type="pname">John Quincy Adams</name>, the only President of the <name type="place">United States</name> ever to return to Congress as a member of the House of Representatives, stood in 1848 to make an impassioned speech regarding the
<pb n="110"/>
despicable practice of slavery in <name type="place">America</name>. Suffering a heart attack, he collapsed; he was carried on that bench into the open room, where he died, by three lawyers who served in that Congress of 1848. One of them made the plaque still displayed there—his name was <name type="pname">Daniel Webster</name>. Another helped carry the crypt—his name was <name type="pname">Henry Clay</name>. The third was a Congressman from <name type="place">Illinois</name> named <name type="pname">Abraham Lincoln</name>.</p>
               <p>This is the heritage that goes into the issuance of these coins and the symbols that are placed upon them; but unlike any other museum in the world, its collecting history continues each and every day. It is an evolving and continually growing museum; a political thought process that is unparalleled on the face of the earth. There in small gold letters as you enter to vote in the House of Representatives is a single phrase reading: "We have built a Capitol not a Palace, we consult no oracle but the Constitution." With all its frailties and all its faults, it is still the most extraordinary political institution in the history of the thoughts of man. I deem it worth a few dollars on a coin.</p>

            <p>All reflections on life and history result in a mixture of happiness and sadness, and so it is with the subject of this paper. The first decades of this century were the last to see circulating gold coinage, when people still had the pleasure, even the tactile pleasure, of using gold coins on an everyday basis. How dreary by comparison are our present clad or "sandwich" coins, their original intrinsic qualities cheapened by mass production and recurrent inflation.<ref target="CH7-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Even a silver coin offers great aesthetic rewards. The older it becomes the more beautiful the patina; the more hands it passes through, the more brilliant the highlights of the relief. For these reasons I often regret that the <name type="pname">George Washington</name> silver half dollar I designed in 1982 was only a commemorative issue, designed for a plastic-encased existence.</p>
            <p>Gold coins had practical advantages as well. In those days before World War I they gave everyone with a few gold coins in his pocket monetary freedom of movement, since gold was the universal currency. We did regain that freedom of unencumbered travel half a century later thanks to a different and not very aesthetically pleasing form of money—the plastic card. Will there come a time when the American Numismatic Society maintains here a collection of credit cards, or even plastic legal tender cards?</p>
            <p>It is no coincidence, in my opinion, that the last good circulating coins were produced in what appears also to have been the last truly civilized period of our century. These coins came into being in that period before World War I through an extraordinarily fortuitous circumstance: a president's almost obsessive intention to give his compatriots a magnificent new coinage, and the personal relationship of that president, <name type="pname">Theodore Roosevelt</name>, with one of the greatest sculptors of the period, <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name>.</p>
            <p>Whatever one might say or think of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>' coins, to appreciate fully the magnitude of his achievement one must look back, however briefly, to the gold coins of the late nineteenth century. Among the coins which continued to be struck until 1907 and which remained in circulation along with the new Double Eagles and Eagles by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> (figs. <ref target="#fig-49">1</ref>-<ref target="#fig-50">2</ref>) until 1933 is the <name type="pname">James B. Longacre</name> Double Eagle <ref target="#fig-51">(fig. 3)</ref>, first issued in 1849; its design was based on the 1839 Eagle by <name type="pname">Christian Gobrecht</name>. He in turn had based his design on the Half Eagle of <name type="pname">William Kneass</name>, who had redesigned <name type="pname">John Reich's</name> Liberty head of 1807. In short, despite a number of minor alterations, the basic composition had not changed for a hundred years, and it is no wonder that a president like <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> wanted to change the nation's coinage.</p>

proach had been: the break with tradition is drastic, as if to form part of the artistic revolution that erupted in <name type="place">Europe</name> after the turn of the century. A common thread is the searching mentality and the desire to stretch established conventions—where possible, to discard them entirely. Yet in this case the goal had to be and was achieved by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> within the one inescapable limitation—that of the circular format.</p>

            <p>Even devotees of nineteenth-century coins admit that the <name type="pname">Longacre</name> coin is static in style; the <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> design is full of movement and vigor, radiating the hope of a new age. The most obvious contrast is the surface, almost entirely filled, in which the symbolic elements appear in a narrative context rather than in the isolation of nineteenth-century coins. A closer look at the model that <name type="pname">Longacre</name> used, the Eagle by <name type="pname">Christian Gobrecht</name> issued from 1839 through 1907 <ref target="#fig-52">(fig 4)</ref>, shows how slight are the differences in
<pb n="114"/>
proportions of the head, the treatment of the hair with the added beads, or the size of the date. Such trifling changes could do little to improve <name type="pname">Gobrecht</name>'s uninspired attempt to perpetuate at the Mint the imported Empire style of the Napoleonic era.</p>

            <p>One might also allude to English neoclassicist traditions, even in such mundane manifestations as postage stamps with portraits of the then-young <name type="pname">Queen Victoria</name>
               <ref target="#fig-53">(fig. 5)</ref>. Our coins of 1839 and 1840, which follow closely upon her coronation in 1837, seem to appropriate her young idealized profile, turned leftward, with upswept hair. It is as if our young republic was now embarrassed by the earlier rendition of Liberty in Phrygian cap and drapery, looking, in the words of <name type="pname">Cornelius Vermeule</name>, like "a milkmaid on her way to the fair."<ref target="CH7-n2">2</ref> The replacement was an altogether more regal image, which included a diadem or coronet enhancing the head as well as ever more elaborate hair styles. This coronet type remained essentially unchanged and was minted from 1839 to 1907; as <name type="pname">David Bowers</name> has observed, this was the longest lifespan of an unrevised design of any coin in American history.<ref target="CH7-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>What is true of the obverses is also true of the reverses. Thus the Eagle and the Half Eagle share the same design, based on the 1807 reverse by <name type="pname">John Reich</name>, adapted through the decades to various obverses (figs. <ref target="#fig-54">6</ref>-<ref target="#fig-55">7</ref>). The only noticeable difference between the Eagle and the Half Eagle appears to be the size and thickness of the lettering. One wonders whether this conservatism was the result of a young republic's desire to establish its own traditions (including the laudable one of prohibiting the likenesses of living individuals) or just the indifference of a commerce-oriented society for which coinage had only a utilitarian significance.</p>
            <p>Victoria's long reign ended with her death in 1901, a date of symbolic significance since it was also the year in which <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name>—the youngest president ever at 42 years—entered upon his first term with an explosion of vitality and optimism appropriate to the new century. <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name>'s extraordinary energy permitted him not only
<pb n="115"/>
to attend to political issues of the day, but to focus on the redesign of a coinage representative of another era.</p>
            <p>In the eyes of the public the change must have appeared dramatic when at last the new coins were issued in 1907. The continuation of the older issues in circulation meant that both designs were constantly before the public eye. The contrast between the reverses was just as striking as that between the obverses. <name type="pname">Longacre's</name> heraldic eagle, which had been in existence since 1849, is very decorative, but in such a balanced way that it is actually quite elegant <ref target="#fig-56">(fig. 8)</ref>. The first version of the <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> reverse with its flying eagle does not yet carry the legend In God We Trust, which appears in subsequent issues after it was imposed by law in 1908 as a permanent fixture on all <name type="place">U.S.</name> coins.</p>

            <p>The creation of the new coinage of 1907 not only involved two illustrious protagonists but thanks to their correspondence it also remains one of the most vividly documented episodes in our numismatic history. The letters reveal <name type="pname">Roosevelt's</name> and <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens'</name> mutual understanding and growing friendship, as well as a rare case of collaboration between artist and statesman.<ref target="CH7-n4">4</ref> In the spring of 1901 the sculptor was asked to join the Commission for the Improvement of the <name type="place">District of Columbia</name>, and thereafter frequently saw the ten-year-younger <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name>. The Vice President was also familiar with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens'</name> work. After having seen his sculptures on view at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in May 1901, he had lunch with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> on the train trip back, an experience he described as "great fun."</p>
            <p>After <name type="pname">McKinley's</name> assassination in September, <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> became President, and by Executive Order made <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, together with Frederick Law Olmsted and the architects <name type="pname">Daniel Burnham</name> and <name type="pname">Charles McKim</name>, consultants to the Board of Public Buildings. <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> referred to this select group as his "art cabinet," and as such it represents a direct antecedent to today's Fine Arts Commission. After the election of 1904, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was asked by the Citizens' Inaugural Committee to design the President-elect's portrait medal <ref target="#fig-57">(fig. 9)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The modeling was entrusted to one of his principal assistants, <name type="pname">Adolph Weinman</name>, who would later win the 1916 competition for new dime and half dollar designs. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens'</name> work on <name type="pname">Roosevelt's</name> portrait must have deepened their relationship and helped to direct the President's thoughts toward the renewal of the country's coinage.</p>
            <p>Two days after Christmas 1904, the President made his first, slightly conspiratorial move, writing to Secretary of the <name type="pname">Treasury Leslie M. Shaw</name>:
<q>I think our coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to give us a coinage that would have some beauty?<ref target="CH7-n5">5</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Within three weeks <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> had advanced the matter enough to tell Shaw:
<q>Of course he is to be given an absolutely free hand...it is of the utmost importance that the artist should be left absolutely unhampered in working out the design and execution of the coin or medal. I do not wish there to be the slightest interference with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> in connection with the coinage from its artistic side.<ref target="CH7-n6">6</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This statement—surprisingly sensitive to the dichotomy inherent in mass-producing works of art—must have been music to the artist's ears. It certainly is so to the few in the service of today's government, which has lost the capacity to understand creative processes and to take such a truly humanistic attitude towards art. What a contrast to the inevitable mass production schedules of today's mint, and their often nearly impossible deadlines, which have to be met just to get models to the marketing agents, literally before the plaster is dry. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens'</name> son Homer remembered: "To accomplish this result [the obverse and the reverse of the Double Eagle] my father altered and realtered the coins for a year and a half." Specifically about the reverse he writes, "in all, he created 70 models of this bird, and often stood twenty-five of them in a row for visitors to number according to preference."<ref target="CH7-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever time and effort it took, the result is indeed our most majestic coin, if not the most sculptural in all modern coinage. On display in one of the mint's hallways is a twelve-inch bronze cast of the Double Eagle's obverse. Every so often I run my fingers over the high relief of the standing Liberty, and indeed the relief is so pronounced, so sensuously sculptural, that the loss of this quality
<pb n="118"/>
in the course of the coin's execution will always be regrettable. But the problems that such relief presents in coining are hard to solve except by reducing its height. They remained after <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens'</name> death a source of frustration for <name type="pname">Henry Hering</name>, the assistant who made the revised plaster casts.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> described his ideas regarding the emerging design in a letter to <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> in November 1905:
<q>...on the other side I would place a (possibly winged) figure of liberty [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] striding energetically forward as if on a mountain top holding aloft on one arm a shield bearing the Stars and Stripes with the words Liberty marked across the field, in the other hand perhaps a flaming torch. The drapery would be blowing in the breeze. My idea is to make it a living thing and typical of progress.<ref target="CH7-n8">8</ref>

go back to antiquity. This was also in accord with <name type="pname">Roosevelt's</name> virtual dictate that the <name type="place">United States</name> was to get a coinage that would rival that of ancient Greece. It is worth taking a closer look at the now-familiar image of the obverse to get the full measure of the prototype's transformation and the resulting innovation.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> broke with the neo-classicist tradition of the eighteenth century by abandoning the abstract plane of the empty background. Moreover, he ignored the antique convention of presenting relief figures in side views. In response to <name type="pname">Roosevelt's</name> request for coins with the highest possible relief, his Liberty appears in a frontal posture that clearly implies three-dimensionality. At the same time this posture also imparts spatial depth to the background: Liberty is to be perceived as having ascended the summit. This effect becomes even more obvious in comparison with her famous antecedent, the Victory of Samothrace <ref target="#fig-58">(fig. 10)</ref>, which was meant to have descended from the sky onto the prow of a ship. Her torso still convincingly displays the violence of the arrested movement.</p>
            <p>There can be little doubt that this hellenistic sculpture had made a profound impression on <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>—probably the more so as he had first seen it at the age of 19 in 1867, only four years after it had entered the Louvre. When <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> himself took up the subject of a walking Victory as part of the Sherman monument for <name type="place">New York</name>, he was again in <name type="place">Paris</name>, living and working there from 1897 to 1900.</p>
            <p>Yet the Liberty of the Double Eagle is not just a variation on a hellenistic theme, but a complex and involved composition. The posture, for example, still conforms to the classic canon of the fourth century B.C. as to which leg should carry the weight or which arm should be outstretched. In her motion the Liberty occupies an intermediate stage. The hellenistic figure is all movement, the body's forceful motion appears independent and directed against the equally forceful counter-motion of the many-folded garment. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> has his Liberty make steady moves upward, maintaining her poise from step to step. Her hair and dress—a Greek chiton—are billowing in what is obviously a calmer breeze. With her right arm she holds up the torch—more precisely, she presents the flame of freedom to the people for them to guard eternally, if they are to enjoy the prize of peace. She promises that peace with the olive branch held in her laterally extended left arm.</p>
            <p>Among sources of inspiration for <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> is the famous <hi rend="italic">Liberty Leading the People</hi> of 1830 by Eugène Delacroix <ref target="#fig-59">(fig. 11)</ref>. The importance of this painting, which in our day has acquired the status of an icon, will not have escaped <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>. In particular the ascending movement of the young woman to the top of the taken barricade may have played a role in his own composition.</p>

            <pb n="121"/>
            <p>Delacroix's Liberty also represents one of those iconographically interesting transitions from the Nike/Victory goddess of antiquity to the modern, more mortal personifications of Liberty. As one would expect, she loses some of her divine qualities. In <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>' design process, she quite literally loses her wings <ref target="#fig-60">(fig. 12)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Even <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>' contemporaries observed that "none of his predecessors had recognized the possibilities of low relief; he revealed them."<ref target="CH7-n9">9</ref> His approach—to fill the field of a coin with elements of sufficient substance to render it a miniature bas-relief—is equally evident on the reverse of the Double Eagle. Although its relatively larger elements make the composition of this side less a tour-deforce of scale, "the eagle in flight against the sun...achieves complete domination of motion and expanding vista over the confines of a tiny tondo."<ref target="CH7-n10">10</ref> There was, incidentally, the precedent of a realistically rendered flying eagle, which <name type="pname">Gobrecht</name> had designed for a silver dollar in 1839 and which, in its later <name type="pname">Longacre</name> reincarnation of 1857, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> is said to have much admired.</p>
            <p>Before his death in 1907, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> had only been able to fulfill <name type="pname">Roosevelt's</name> second request for a new Eagle coin, which some consider even a greater achievement. Before discussing the coin itself, however, I should like to relate my personal encounter with one if its manifestations. On assuming my position as Chief Engraver in 1981, I was given the usual tour of the mint premises and shown the vault, which is the Chief Sculptor and Engraver's exclusive responsibility. This vault contains not only current work, but also fascinating pieces of history: dies and hubs going back to the turn of the century, including many made for various foreign governments. The hidden treasures I discovered afterward were a couple of shoe boxes filled with copper patterns of the last century, and nearby, to my pleasure, bronze castings of the obverse and reverse of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens'</name> Eagle. I also want to mention another pair of castings, not just because they were of one of my favorite coins, the Buffalo nickel, but because its designer, <name type="pname">James Earle Fraser</name>, had been a principal assistant of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>.</p>
            <p>All these relics I had properly mounted and hung on the then-bare walls of my office. While this collection serves its invaluable study purpose and, I might add, acts as a constant reminder of the artistic standards every Chief Sculptor and Engraver should endeavor to reach, I have also wondered whether it should not be made accessible to a larger public and placed in proper curatorial care, such as only a museum can provide.</p>
            <pb n="122"/>
            <p>Whether as a consequence of familiarity or of its perfection, one always has to take a second look to be reminded how unusual the image on the Eagle obverse is in its combination of idealized Greek beauty and native American symbol. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens'</name> model had originally been designed as a Victory head, intended for alternative versions of other pieces in the series. <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name>, however, had a different idea: he wanted an Indian feather headdress applied to the female profile on the obverse of the Eagle.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Roosevelt's</name> enthusiasm for the proposed design matched his delight in the Double Eagle piece. In a complimentary letter to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> he remarks, "of course, all the designs are conventional, when embodied in a woman's head, and I don't see why we should not have a conventional headdress of purely American type for the Liberty figure." And in a subsequent letter he reiterates his argument:
<q>Really, the feather head-dress can be treated as being the conventional cap of Liberty quite as much as if it was the Phrygian cap; and, after all, it is <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Liberty not what the ancient Greeks and Romans miscalled by that title—and we are entitled to a typically American head-dress for the lady.<ref target="CH7-n11">11</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The bronze cast that I have hanging on my wall is a rather rough casting of the Eagle's final version, that is with the date 1907 instead of the word Liberty inscribed at the base. In studying the cast I am always surprised by the contrast between the modeling of the head, the stars and numerals, and on the other hand the rendering of the feathers and the word Liberty. The former elements are quite clearly defined—the edge of the profile more than the surface modulation of the face itself, while the feathers are treated with such subtlety that they seem to fade into the background, except for a few more detailed ones interspersed here and there.</p>
            <p>What <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> achieved was to create volume without mass, to use a sweeping shape, which in the most elegant way follows the contour of the coin, to fill entirely one quarter section of the circle. It is obvious that the nineteenth-century formulas have been abandoned for good, not so much in the overall asymmetry of the design as in the less visible tension with the symmetrical parts of the composition. The row of stars is regular, the date is positioned axially under the beveled truncation of the neck, which functions almost as a pedestal supporting a beautiful sculpture. In its profile the head shows a most striking resemblance with the face of Delacroix's Liberty; the lower half from the nostrils and the short upper lip down to the curve of the chin is almost identical.</p>
            <p>The so-called standing or perched eagle of the reverse is con-

sidered one of the most powerful incarnations of the heraldic animal on a coin. It had evolved from previous designs by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, most directly from the eagle on the reverse of his inaugural medal for <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name>. Similar eagles appear as three- dimensional sculptures as early as 1893, on either side of the Shaw memorial where they clearly allude to their ancestry from those proudly perching eagles of <name type="place">Ptolemaic Egypt</name>. Looking at the enlarged obverse and reverse next to each other on the wall of my office I am always surprised by the difference in the modeling of the two sides. The relief is much higher on the reverse, the eagle's musculature solidly present beneath the extremely detailed feathers.</p>
            <p>Already in 1791 <name type="pname">Alexander Hamilton</name> addressed the emblematic aspects of coinage in a report to the House of Representatives.<ref target="CH7-n12">12</ref> Although he considered the Eagle a not very expressive or apt appellation for the largest gold pieces, he concluded that there was nothing better. He had the acumen to observe, "the fewer sharp points and angles there are, the less will be the loss by wearing." Thus, to quote <name type="pname">Vermeule</name>, "from the beginning of the full national coinage, technical problems were deemed on a par with, or superior to, aesthetic considerations."<ref target="CH7-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>I agree with <name type="pname">Vermeule</name>'s assessment of the historical record, but I do not accept the implied principle that technical problems ought to be given superior consideration. The obverse of my Statue of Liberty five dollar gold piece is a case where the design intentions met the technical requirements by anticipating rather than yielding to their limitations. I knew full well that the relief of the original model and the final reduction hub had to be kept to an extremely low tolerance (measured in ten thousandths of an inch down from the highest elevation, the tip of Liberty's nose), and I took these constraints into account in the conceptual as well as the development stages of my design. During the actual modeling I could rely on a plaster basin, supplied by the Department of Technology, which had such a high-precision curvature that the measurements I took over and over again were bound to be absolutely precise (figs. <ref target="#fig-61">13</ref>-<ref target="#fig-62">14</ref>). Thus I was able, throughout the design process, to avoid compromising my artistic standards by accommodating the technical demands of today's mass production.</p>
            <p>Obviously in an ideal world the Department of Technology would provide whatever means an artist's innovative design might require for its execution. But what ought to be possible even under present conditions is the sort of collaboration that occurred in this case and which brought recognition to the participants: the Statue of Liberty five dollar gold coin was given the rare MS-70 status for its

            <p>I had one advantage over <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> or his assistants <name type="pname">Pratt</name>, <name type="pname">Fraser</name>, and <name type="pname">Weinman</name> (all of whom created outstanding coin designs): I was not forced to work as an outsider in the process of adapting my coin designs for production. I was able to learn inside the mint what limitations are involved in the manufacture of coins. Still the history of coinage in this country would be much less impressive, or at least less varied, were it not for the work of outsiders, such as the famous (or, immediately after issue, infamous) Half Eagle by <name type="pname">Bela Lyon Pratt</name>
               <ref target="#fig-54">(fig. 16)</ref>.</p>
            <p>At <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>' death the new series of coins envisioned by the President remained incomplete. The two additional pieces are known as the Bigelow-Pratt coins, because <name type="pname">Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow</name>, a friend of <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name>, had not only suggested Pratt for the execution, but also advocated use of the incuse technique. <name type="pname">Bela Lyon Pratt</name>, who had been a principal assistant of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> and gained a reputation of his own, decided nevertheless to retain the same images and compositions as the Eagle coin. While he probably did this in tribute to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, he deviated from the precedent in two important respects: one was the technique of incuse carving, reminiscent of Egyptian mural reliefs; the other was the exceptional realism of the obverse.</p>
            <p>The Indian head looks indeed as if a photograph had been transferred mechanically to the surface of the coin. Not surprisingly it was much criticized as lacking in beauty: the Indian looked emaciated, and was not at all the noble savage of the <name type="pname">James Fenimore Cooper</name>
               <pb n="125"/>
tradition. But to me it is a very strong and convincing portrait; in view of contemporary tendencies toward beautification, one can only admire <name type="pname">Pratt's</name> courage in producing such an unorthodox image. This gold piece in fact marks the transition from the idealized Indian head of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to the rugged characterization on the Buffalo nickel of 1912 by <name type="pname">James Earle Fraser</name>.</p>
            <p>With <name type="pname">Pratt's</name> homage to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> ends the great period of circulating gold coinage. No new designs were added before the banking crisis of 1933 forced the other President <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> to take the <name type="place">U.S.</name> off the gold standard and prohibit the ownership and use of gold. In fact most of the 70 million <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Double Eagles were melted down, over 22 million at the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> mint alone in 1934.</p>
            <p>A world war and three decades had to pass before, in 1975, once again the precious metal was allowed to circulate in all forms (except, of course, regular coinage). The Krüggerrand had been introduced to <name type="place">Europe</name> in 1967 and now became ubiquitous in the <name type="place">U.S.</name>, a coveted market that prompted an increasing number of nations to produce bullion coins. Finally, in 1980 the U.S. took tentative steps to issue her own gold bullion variety in the form of a series of half-ounce and one-ounce medals. Called the American Arts Commemorative Medallion, this attempt was unsuccessful, because the bullion buyers preferred legal tender coins. Thus the newly-established Gold Commission met twice in 1981 to consider the state of affairs, and after its second meeting in September there was talk about the production of gold bullion coins.</p>

            <p>I mention these developments because their chronology obviously had an influence on the design of our first bullion coin <ref target="#fig-65">(fig. 17)</ref>. After my staff and I were notified that the Double Eagle obverse by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was to be used again for the obverse of the planned
<pb n="126"/>
bullion issue, we were somewhat startled to learn that the design of a sculptor from <name type="place">Texas</name>, <name type="place">Miley Busiek</name>, had been chosen for the reverse. I had heard about her "Family of Eagles" concept personally, for she had telephoned me at the office shortly after my appointment as Chief Sculptor and Engraver in the autumn of 1981.</p>
            <p>We came to know each other quite well over the years, since she had continued her interest in coins and medals. But it was only recently, in connection with this presentation, that I asked her how she had the idea to submit a design for the reverse of the future bullion coin. She responded, rather bemusedly, "I was on an airplane and saw an article in the <hi rend="italic">Wall Street Journal</hi> about the Gold Commission and their deliberations. So I wrote them and asked for the reports on those meetings, and that was the beginning of it all." Her success involved not only the execution of her design, but an extensive and persistent lobbying effort probably never undertaken by any earlier artist. At the end of our conversation she said, "You see, one person really can make a difference."</p>
            <p>The Chief Sculptor and Engraver was not consulted concerning the obverse, nor do I wish to comment now on the decision to reuse the <name type="place">Saint-Gaudens</name> design. But it was obvious from the beginning that the original had to be adapted to current mass production requirements, as well as to the specific demands of proof coins and fractional denominations. In my mind the technical and artistic aspects were once again in conflict. In particular, the proof polishing would necessarily eviscerate the sculptural qualities of <name type="place">Saint-Gaudens'</name> coin, as its execution requires extreme precision of design. The stars not only had to be increased in number, but made exactly alike; the sun's rays not only had to be strengthened, but made geometrically precise. Other details had to be adjusted, such as the foot of Liberty on the rock, which even in <name type="place">Saint-Gaudens'</name> Double Eagle had been the most difficult part of the die to fill.</p>
            <p>The most damaging and least essential interference with <name type="place">Saint-Gaudens'</name> original, in my eyes and those of others including members of the Fine Arts Commission, was the slimming-down of Liberty. My staff and I first took this for a joke until we realized that it was, indeed, an order from above. Perhaps I am simply too sensitive about the inviolabilty of a great artist's work, or perhaps I am just too great an admirer of <name type="place">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name>, for my objections are not shared by everyone.</p>
            <p>The new bullion coins fell short of their promise, but unpredictability of demand has always determined the fate of commemorative coins. This is a subject that I can touch on only briefly here.</p>

            <p>The first commemorative gold coins of this century were the gold dollars struck in 1902 and 1903 in connection with the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase Exposition in <name type="pname">St. Louis</name>
               <ref target="#fig-66">(fig. 18)</ref>. Offered at a premium of $3, the coins were not popular and many were melted down. The same happened to the gold dollars authorized by Congress to commemorate the <name type="pname">Lewis</name> and <name type="pname">Clark</name> Exposition in 1904 <ref target="#fig-67">(fig. 19)</ref>. It is not difficult to see why these coins failed to sell: as souvenirs they were too expensive, and as collectors's items they had little aesthetic appeal.</p>

            <p>In celebration of the 1915 <name type="place">Panama-Pacific</name> Exposition, three gold coins were issued, and the $50 coin <ref target="#fig-68">(fig. 20)</ref>, designed by <name type="pname">Robert Aitken</name>, is a good example of <name type="place">Saint-Gaudens'</name> impact on the design of commemorative coins. They are not only more artistically conceived, they are stylistically in step with the period, most notably
<pb n="128"/>
in the graphic reinterpretation of Greek motifs such as the helmeted Athena with her attendant owl of wisdom. In the octagonal version the added spaces at the edge were filled with dolphins, a direct reference to the coins of ancient Syracuse. In spite of their considerable aesthetic merits and their relatively small edition, even these coins were not a success.</p>
            <p>As a result of the 1933 legislation the U.S. did not see another commemorative coin until 1982, when the Bicentennial of <name type="pname">George Washington's</name> birth prompted the issue of a silver half dollar. Its instant popularity opened the door for subsequent commemorative series. The Olympic Eagle of 1984, minted at <name type="place">West Point</name>, was the first <name type="place">U.S.</name> gold piece issued in over 50 years. In size, weight and fineness it is identical with the last <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Eagles coined in 1933. No competitions were yet being held, and only the Mint's engraving staff submitted drawings for final selection by the Secretary of the Treasury. I did not submit a proposal, as I had already designed the Olympic Silver Dollar of the previous year. The design chosen for the Eagle obverse had been conceived by <name type="pname">James Peed</name>, head of the Exhibits and Art Department at the Mint head-quarters, and adapted for production by <name type="pname">John Mercanti</name>, an engraver at the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint, whose own submission provided the heraldic eagle for the reverse <ref target="#fig-69">(fig. 21)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Collectors and critics alike considered the Olympic coins of mediocre artistic quality, and a congressional hearing was held to look into the selection and approval process. This was followed by ever more frequent public demands—especially from the country's community of medallic artists but also from members of the Fine Arts Commission—for the reinstatement of the competitions that had been customary as recently as the 1930s. The generally excellent results of those years owed much to the procedures that <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> had helped to introduce. As a member of various commis-
<pb n="129"/>
sions in <name type="place">Washington</name> he was also "a frequent juror and gave advice in connection with a number of commissions for monumental sculpture for the government. Through these efforts he was able to help establish <hi rend="italic">the principle that such competitions be judged by a jury of peers—other artists and sculptors</hi>—and assured that the participants would be given monetary awards for the time and effort spent to enter such competitions [italics mine].<ref target="CH7-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Bicentennial of the Constitution in 1987, which was to be celebrated by the striking of a silver dollar and a Half Eagle, offered the first occasion for an invited competition in which outside artists as well as the Mint's staff participated. The Half Eagle was won by the renowned medalist and sculptor <name type="pname">Marcel Jovine</name>
               <ref target="#fig-70">(fig. 22)</ref>. That there is a quill on both faces was not his original intention, but in the final selection the design he had submitted for the silver dollar reverse, which showed a quill in the center, was combined with the obverse of his Eagle design. As a result the coin shows not only a redundancy of symbols but an ambiguity as to which side is obverse or reverse. Still, <name type="pname">Jovine</name> produced an original design by marrying abstraction and naturalism in the treatment of the eagle.</p>

            <p>While mismatching the designs for obverse and reverse against the artist's intentions is questionable enough, what is worse is the "mix and match" that combines obverse and reverse designs of different artists, especially two artists so distinctive as <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> and <name type="pname">Charles Barber</name>. <name type="pname">Don Taxay</name> gives the following account of that regrettable episode:
<q>
                  <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> first contact with the Mint developed during 1891, when he served on a committee to judge coin designs submitted through public competition. Subsequently, he was asked to design the 1892 Columbian Exposition medal. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> accepted the commission with misgivings, which, as it turned out, were fully justified: for after considerable delay, the artist was informed that his obverse had been combined with a reverse supplied by the Mint's own engraver, <name type="pname">Charles Barber</name>. Thereafter, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> avoided the Mint.<ref target="CH7-n15">15</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <pb n="130"/>
            <p>The commemorative coins issued to support the American athletes participating in the 1988 Olympic games held in Seoul were also the outcome of an invited competition among 12 outside artists and the engravers of the Mint. I found the subject matter rather awkward, so I decided to enter a head of the Greek goddess Nike, or Victory, which was not only appropriate to the occasion but was a welcome excuse for an excursion into antiquity. I was required to place the word Liberty on the obverse, and I decided to make it large enough that it would assert itself as a design element. In any case I felt the games ought to stand for the freedom of all nations to participate. Not wanting to diminish the prominence of this element I incised in minute lettering the other required legend, In God We Trust, on the victor's ribbon emerging from her hair <ref target="#fig-71">(fig. 23)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The reverse was designed by <name type="pname">Marcel Jovine</name>, with a stylized rendition of the Olympic flame as its central motif <ref target="#fig-72">(fig. 24)</ref>. His original drawing had the five Olympic rings following the coin's edge; our Olympic officials insisted that the rings appear in their standard logo form, i.e. interlocking in two parallel rows. More unfortunate was the international Olympic committee's ruling that the letters <name type="place">USA</name> had to be placed inside the rings. Although the mint pressed the point that the inscription <name type="place">United States of America</name> already appeared along the lower edge, the Committee could not be persuaded to abandon its legalistic position.</p>
            <p>The letters within the graphic symbol together with all the other inscriptions mandated by law contributed only clutter to the artist's basic idea. There is in fact one option to unclutter coins (though it is considered unaffordable nowadays): transferring one of the four mandatory inscriptions from the surface to the edge of the coin. Edge lettering is still practiced abroad, and was so here until 1933, as the <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Double Eagle carried the inscription E Pluribus Unum around the edge. In the adaptation of his design for the gold bullion coin the inscription was moved from the edge to the already letter- saturated reverse.</p>
            <p>With bicentennial celebrations following on one another's heels,
<pb n="131"/>
the 1989 Bicentennial of the <name type="place">United States</name> Congress was the most recent occasion for a commemorative issue. The genesis of this issue, in all its fascinating political details, is the subject of an article by Representative <name type="pname">James A. Hayes</name> appearing elsewhere in this publication.</p>
            <p>One point I hope to have made here is not only that we owe to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> two of our artistically most outstanding coins. Through his influence, both direct and indirect, all subsequent <name type="place">U.S.</name> coins gained a level of artistic quality unprecedented in our history and rarely reached by any other country in this century and ultimately not even diminished by the debased materials used for today's coinage.</p>
            <p>No single factor accounted for the deep and lasting influence of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, but its origin may be traced to one cause: the historic encounter and personal relationship of two great men with vision. Will there—can there ever be again a moment when the president has a dialogue with an artist on the subject of coinage?</p>
