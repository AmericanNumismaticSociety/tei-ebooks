            <p>America's gold coinage provided the subject for the sixth annual Coinage of the Americas Conference sponsored by the American Numismatic Society.
               Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing Council as a forum for the dissemination of
               emerging research in western hemisphere numismatics.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present
               papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all interested in the
               topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants to come to know the Society's collections and library
               better during the days of the conference.</p>

            </head>
            <p>This volume presents the proceedings of the sixth Coinage of the Americas Conference held at the American Numismatic Society on November 4 and 5,
               1989. The paper of <persName>Q. David Bowers</persName> on collecting of gold coins in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> pinpoints one of the obstacles facing anyone who would contemplate a gathering devoted to American gold: gold coins have never
               been as widely collected or studied as, say, colonial or early federal coppers, and even today the number of specialists is relatively small.</p>
            <p>The 1989 effort faced other problems. Several individuals whose participation had been hoped for were unavailable, and an unexpected change of
               staff meant that organization of the gathering had to be assumed in mid-course by a non-specialist. But groundwork already laid, combined with
               the willingness of old friends to come forward on short notice‚Äîand, above all, the momentum generated by five successful conferences‚Äîboth filled
               out and lent surprising variety to the program.</p>
            <p>One fixed point in the Coinage of the Americas Conferences has been <persName>John W. McCloskey</persName>. For the second time he prepared
               the booklet and slide set published in connection with it, and here presented the most technical of the studies, on Half Eagles of 1834‚Äì1838. His
               preliminary results should provide both a paradigm and a stimulus for further studies.</p>
            <p>Similarly technical was a paper on the 1861 Paquet Double Eagles, which subsequently became the focus of controversy as reported in the
               numismatic press. In sum, it was the Society's position that the paper submitted was not that which had been invited; even so, the substantive
               point of contention was resolved in favor of the authors, and it is regrettable that they nonetheless decided to withdraw their paper from
               publication here.</p>
            <pb n="x"/>
            <p>Three other papers illustrated the sluggish and haphazard development of minting policy in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. The first
               of these was provided by <persName>Richard G. Doty</persName> of the National Numismatic Collection, Smithsonian Institution. His discussion
               of the vicissitudes of the short-lived <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>
               mints is a reminder that technology available is not necessarily technology implemented, and of the impact of personalities now all but forgotten
               on the history of our coinage. <persName>Cory Gillilland</persName>, also of the National Numismatic Collection, discussed the antiquity of
               what many regard as a modern use for coinage. <persName corresp="#viaf_244611490">Walter H. Breen</persName> both instructed and amused with
               his brisk review of the interplay of monetary theory and coinage during the last decades of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>David Bowers</persName>'s paper has already been mentioned; it provides not only a glimpse into the development of numismatic
               connoisseurship in this country, but an illustration of the symbiosis between collecting and research. It was only when gold coins began to be a
               focus of collector interest that it was possible to move beyond widespread misinformation and toward understanding. The printed version of his
               paper understates its effectiveness as presented, since many of the coins mentioned were on view in the Society as he spoke.</p>
            <p>Almost from the moment they were created, coins began to be counterfeited. <persName>Charles R. Hoskins</persName>'s paper is necessarily
               anecdotal: though some counterfeiters have been proud enough of their work to boast about it for posterity, it is in the nature of the trade that
               inside information is hard to come by. It is welcome news‚Äîparticularly given the dangerous nature of some of the conterfeits‚Äîthat the phenomenon
               is in at least a temporary decline.</p>
            <p>The conference was rounded out by two papers that were conceived in relationship to one another, as the speakers represent opposite ends of the
               road to the creation of coinage. Representative <persName>James A. Hayes</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName>, a member of the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs and its Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs and
               Coinage, traced the intricate legislative path a proposal must follow before a coin can come to be, employing for context the bicentennial of the
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> Congress. Cynics will see "politics as usual" in Rep. <persName>Hayes</persName>'s account of the
               creation of the Congressional commemoratives, but that very fact lends value to his documentation of the factors affecting coin production and
               design.</p>
            <p>The closing paper was delivered by <persName>Elizabeth Jones</persName>, Chief Sculptor and Engraver of the <placeName>United States
                  Mint</placeName>, who has ultimate responsibility for the appearance of our coins, and has herself designed <pb n="xi"/> many of the commemoratives
               of which Rep. <persName>Hayes</persName> spoke. <persName>Miss Jones</persName> focused on the marriage between politics and art that
               produced the most beautiful of modern coins, as well as less successful encounters in the history of U.S. coin design. No other Chief Engraver,
               active or retired, has commented so substantively on the artistic merits of earlier coins.</p>
            <p>This volume was to have closed with a catalogue of a portion of the <persName>Harry W. Bass, Jr.</persName> Reference Collection of <placeName>United States</placeName> Federal Gold Coinage, together with reminiscences about <persName>Mr. Bass</persName>'s collecting
               career. Unfortunately that project proved far more complex and time-consuming than originally anticipated. The ANS hopes and expects to be able
               to publish this unique contribution at some future date. The Coinage of the Americas Conferences have often been remarked as the legacy of <persName>Mr. Bass's</persName> Presidency of the American Numismatic Society; the subject matter of the 1989 conference surely came closest to
               his own principal interest in the coinage of this hemisphere. Those who were present are unlikely to forget the excitement surrounding the
               display of over 600 pieces from the Bass collection. Specialists had available an array of die varieties so unprecedented that the revelation of
               the current ownership of the unique 1870-S $3 gold piece seemed almost an anticlimax, and amateurs were dazzled by the sheer mass of his material
               gathered in so small a compass.</p>
            <p>At the end of two days even those who, like the editor, knew little of America's gold coinage were surprised by its variety and complexity.
               Virtually all the papers published here reflect the oral presentations almost verbatim, and perhaps this volume will succeed in communicating not
               only the substance but the spirit of the 1989 Coinage of the Americas Conference.</p>

            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Classic gold Half Eagles were struck for only a short period from 1834 to 1838. The series consists of the five <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> dates for this period and the branch mint issues from <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> in 1838. The five <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> dates are all readily available‚Äîthey are frequently offered for sale at major
               coin auctions and are available at most major coin shows. A date set would therefore be quite easy to assemble. But this series was struck during
               a period in our history when the coinage dies were prepared individually. During this time the central devices were prepared from a coinage hub
               but the features around the periphery of the dies were individually punched into the dies. This manufacturing process makes it possible to
               identify easily the individual coinage dies that were used in the series.</p>
            <p>Study of the coins in this series has led to the identification of 21 obverse and 17 reverse dies. Total mintage for the seven dates in the
               series is just over 2.1 million pieces. This gives an average life of just over 100,000 coins for each obverse die and almost 120,000 coins for
               each reverse die. Identification of the coins in the series by die variety expands the seven coin series into a fascinating collection of 31
               varieties with many interesting and unusual features. Some of these varieties are common and go through a long sequence of die states, while
               others are rare and represent a challenge to obtain for one's collection. A collection by die variety thus becomes a beautiful historical
               representation of the gold coinage struck in early <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>These gold coins played an important role in the business ventures of the period and allowed the public to conduct financial transactions more
               easily. All 31 varieties in the series represent those that I have personally seen and studied over the past few years. The descriptions that are
               given and the observations that are made in this article were obtained from personal study and comparison of actual coins. While I do not claim
               that my listing is complete, I feel that my search has been extensive enough to have allowed me to observe all of the common varieties and all
               but a few of the rare varieties that exist in the series. I have identified the varieties of over 400 pieces at coin shows I have attended, and
               of over 100 more from photographs that have appeared in auction catalogues. In addition I have studied the 12 specimens from the series that are
               owned by the American Numismatic Society, the 34 pieces in the National Collection at the Smithsonian Institution in <placeName>Washington, D.C.</placeName>, and the 67 pieces in the personal holdings of a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName> collector. Furthermore I have been able to acquire a personal collection which contains examples of 28 of the 31 varieties that I
               have identified. <pb n="3"/> Of the three varieties that I do not own, examples of two are in the ANS, with the other variety being held by the
               SI.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The obverse dies for the various dates are really quite easy to identify from a few key features. The central device of Liberty was created
                  from a hub and is nearly identical for all of the obverses. The dates on the various dies were individually punched into the dies and vary
                  considerably in size, style, and location. The date alone is usually sufficient to distinguish the obverse dies from each other, but it is
                  recognized that date positioning might fail to identify some obverses. For positive identification of the obverse, the position of the 13
                  stars on the obverse periphery was recorded. These 13 stars were individually punched into the dies and their positions vary noticeably among
                  the dies. In particular the position of the outside point of each star relative to the denticles was recorded. Each star is recorded as having
                  its outer point extending out toward the space between two denticles, extending out toward the upper edge or lower edge of a denticle or
                  toward the center of a denticle. These star patterns are sufficiently different that a positive identification can be made when there is any
                  question about whether two obverses are identical. Other characteristics such as the position of the stars relative to the bust or the size of
                  the forehead curl are used when they are distinctive for a particular obverse.</p>

               <p>The central device containing the eagle and the shield outline was sunk into the dies as a single unit and is nearly identical from die to
                  die. In contrast the features around the periphery were punched individually into the dies, creating characteristics that clearly distinguish
                  the individual dies. The letters in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States of America</placeName> vary in relation to each
                  other and in relation to the other devices. The position of the denomination 5D varies with respect to the feathered shaft and the olive stem.
                  The leaves in the olive branch vary in position and size and in their relation to the lettering. Some reverses show a berry in the olive
                  branch and others do not. Some reverses show the eagle with a tongue while others do not. In general, there are enough individual die
                  characteristics to identify positively the reverse dies in the series.</p>

               </head>
               <p>This study is intended to be a preliminary investigation of the <pb n="4"/> classic Half Eagle series to obtain a better understanding of the
                  patterns of die usage during this period. I have refrained from numbering the varieties because emission sequences for the varieties have not
                  yet been established and additions to this list of known varieties are bound to occur once the results of this study become available to the
                  numismatic public. Furthermore no complete description of the individual obverse and reverse dies has been included because new distinguishing
                  features continue to be found as the study progresses. It is hoped that the results of this study will be used as a guide for further studies
                  on the series and serve as the foundation for a comprehensive reference work on classic gold coinage.</p>

                  <p>1. 1834 Half Eagle Date Styles.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>There are nine known varieties for this date struck from five obverse and four reverse dies. Reported mintage for this date was 657,460
                  pieces, the largest mintage for any date in the series.<ref target="CH1-n1">1</ref> Three distinct date styles are known for the five obverses
                  of this date. For the first style the date has a block 8 that resembles two circles resting on top of one another <ref target="#fig-2">(fig.
                     1a.)</ref>.<ref target="CH1-n2">2</ref> The digit 4 is small with a long crossbar that extends out well beyond the right base of the digit.
                  Two obverses have this date style. One has the digit <pb n="5"/> 4 nearly touching the curl while the other has a triple-punched 4 that is
                  distant from the curl. The obverse with the triple 4 is very common and has been seen with three different reverses. The triple image of the
                  digit 4 fades through the use of the obverse die but it can be seen clearly on examples of all three varieties. This obverse also has thin
                  letters in the word LIBERTY on the ribbon that runs through the hair.</p>
               <p>The second date style for this year has a script 8 with a thick center that runs at a diagonal downward from left to right. I have called this
                  a "fancy 8" <ref target="#fig-3">(fig. 1b)</ref>. This style has a large 4 with the crossbar extending out no further than the right base of
                  the digit. The digit 1 is distinctive in that the upper serif rises sharply to a narrow peak, while the digit 3 has a long center spike that
                  nearly touches the top curve of the digit. Two obverses have this date style. One of these obverses has a digit 4 that is very close to the
                  curl and positioned so that it extends out beyond the left edge of the curl. The other obverse of this style has a digit 4 that is distant
                  from the curl and positioned completely under it.</p>
               <p>The third date style for this year has a fancy 8 and a large digit 4 with a large crosslet on the right end of the crossbar <ref target="#fig-4">(fig. 1c)</ref>. This obverse was used to strike what has come to be known as the "crosslet 4" variety. This distinctive
                  variety is known to be rare and is one of the few die varieties that has been consistently catalogued and identified in auction catalogues
                  over the years.</p>
               <p>Four reverses are known for the nine varieties for this year. The key feature in identification of these reverses is the position of the
                  denomination 5D relative to the feathered shaft and the branch stem above. For each reverse the percentage of the 5 under the feathered shaft
                  and the percentage of the D under the branch stem has been recorded. These percentages are subjective figures since there are no straight
                  lines on the devices from which to reference the readings, but the positions are distinctive enough to identify the reverses in most cases.
                  Other reverse keys include recording whether there is a berry within the leaves of the olive branch and whether the eagle has a tongue.</p>
               <p>These features are recorded for the four reverses and produce the patterns given in Table 1. The known die pairs for this date are listed at
                  the bottom of the table. Three of the four reverses used in 1834 have also been identified on coins dated 1835. The only reverse not used in
                  later years is the third reverse with the 5 in the denomination completely to the left of the feathered shaft. It is unlikely that this
                  reverse will be found on pieces with later dates, because it was already badly cracked when it appeared with the third marriage of <pb n="6"/>
                  1834. This reverse goes through a series of die states with a heavy die crack developing through the base of the letters NITED. This crack
                  later extends to the rim over the U and also extends out to the right of the D. At the present time I consider five of the varieties of this
                  date as common; the four others appear scarce to rare, with the relative rarity among the four scarce varieties still undetermined.</p>

               <p>There are six known varieties for this date struck from three obverse and five reverse dies. Reported mintage for this date was <pb n="7"/>
                  371,534 coins. Three distinct date styles are known for the three obverses of this date. The first date style has a block 8 and a short narrow
                  flag on the digit 5 <ref target="#fig-5">(fig. 2a)</ref>. The digit 3 also has a short center arc and the digit 1 has a shallow upper serif.
                  The one obverse with this date style dominates specimens of this year. Half of the six known varieties, and nearly 75% of all the coins that I
                  have seen of this date, have this obverse.</p>
               <p>The second date style has a block 8 and a long curved flag to the digit 5 <ref target="#fig-6">(fig. 2b)</ref>. The digit 1 has a shallow
                  upper serif, while the digit 3 has a long center spike that nearly touches the upper curve of the digit. This obverse appears with only one
                  reverse and this marriage is a rare variety for the year. While this variety is difficult to locate there is a nice example of it in the
                  collection of the ANS and a magnificent proof specimen in the SI. A photograph of this variety is also presented in <persName>Walter
                     Breen</persName>'s encyclopedia.<ref target="CH1-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The third date style for this year has a fancy 8 and a 5 with a long curved flag <ref target="#fig-7">(fig. 2c)</ref>. The digit 1 has an
                  upper serif that rises sharply up to a narrow peak. This obverse has been identified with two different reverses.</p>
               <p>Four of the five reverses of this year were used in other years. They can easily be distinguished by the position of the denomination 5D and
                  by noting the presence or absence of a tongue. The third reverse is the only one that was used only for pieces dated 1835 and it is rare.</p>

               </figure>
               <pb n="8"/>
               <p>In fact both varieties with this reverse are very difficult to obtain. The reverse is easy to identify because it is the only one used at the
                     <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> on which a leaf comes up very near to the left side of the U in UNITED. All other reverses of
                  this year have both leaves well below the U. A good rarity estimate for this reverse is yet to be determined, but this study indicates that no
                  more than 5% of 1835 Half Eagles would have this reverse.</p>

               <p>The second date style also has a block 8 but it has a tall 1 that rises well above the top of the other digits in the date <ref target="#fig-9">(fig. 3b)</ref>. There is a difference in date positioning for these five obverses, but they <pb n="10"/> are difficult to
                  distinguish in this way. Interestingly, three of these five obverses have strong die cracks; their development through the life of the die can
                  easily be seen on many of these pieces. The first obverse has a die crack that runs between the fifth and sixth stars from the lower left and
                  continues through the curls on the head. The second obverse has a heavy die crack that runs through the eighth star, down through the bust and
                  through the digit 6 in the date. The sixth obverse has a crack that runs through the bust and down between the digits 8 and 3 in the date.
                  These cracks identify many pieces of this year, but star positioning in reference to the denticles is often used for positive identification
                  when no cracks are visible.</p>

               <p>The first two reverses for this year were used in previous years, with the last three used only to strike 1836 Half Eagles. Only pieces with
                  the first obverse have proved to be rare, with the other seven varieties all appearing regularly. The fifth reverse for this year has a
                  distinctive feature in that the left edge of the 5 in the denomination is well to the right of the left edge of the feathered shaft.</p>

                  difficult to obtain than the mintage figure would indicate.</p>
               <p>The first date style has a block 8 with a tall slender digit 1 <ref target="#fig-10">(fig. 4a)</ref>. The digit 7 has a shallow arc over it,
                  and the digit 3 has a short center spike. The two obverses with this date style can be <pb n="11"/> distinguished by the position of the digit
                  7 relative to the curl. On one obverse the 7 is centered under the curl while on the other obverse the 7 is positioned further to the right
                  and partially below the gap between the curls.</p>

                  shallow upper serif on the 1 with the second 8 entirely below the curl. The other obverse has a 1 with an upper serif that rises sharply to a
                  narrow peak and a second 8 that is only 80% below the curl and very close to the digit 3 <ref target="#fig-12">(fig. 5a)</ref>.</p>
               <p>The two reverses of this date can be distinguished by the position of the D under the olive branch. This date has a reported mintage of
                  286,588 coins at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>. This issue is considered scarce but I
                  have not found examples hard to obtain. Neither variety can be classified as scarcer than the other, as they have been observed with about the
                  same frequency. So far as is known, each obverse appears with only one reverse. Neither reverse of this year was used to strike pieces of
                  other years.</p>

               <p>Coinage of Half Eagles began at the <persName>Charlotte</persName> branch mint in 1838 and the 1838-C issue is the only classic Half
                  Eagle from this new mint. Mintage for this date is reported to be 17,179 coins, the smallest mintage of any of the classic Half Eagles.</p>
               <p>There are two varieties known, both with the same obverse. The one obverse of this date has a different date style from the two <pb n="13"/>
                  known obverses used at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> during this year. This obverse has a tall slender 1 that rises up above
                  the top of the other three digits in the date <ref target="#fig-13">(fig. 5b)</ref>. The date also has two block 8s, while both obverses used
                  in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> have fancy 8s. This distinctive date style would seem
                  to characterize the <persName>Charlotte</persName> Half Eagles for this year and distinguish the obverse die from all others of this
                  year. The C mint mark appears over the left side of the digit 3 in the date about halfway between the digit and the bust.</p>

               <p>The two reverses of this year can be identified by the leaves in relation to the letter U in UNITED. The first reverse has two leaves well
                  below the letter U. The second reverse has one leaf below the U but the other leaf runs up and nearly touches the U along the bottom of the
                  letter. This reverse also develops a strong die break that runs at a diagonal across the reverse from 2 to 8 o'clock. Both varieties are
                  scarce with the first reverse a little more difficult to obtain. The 1838-C must be considered the rarest in the series today, with most
                  examples being well worn. The SI has four beautiful examples of this date, three of these with the second reverse.</p>

               <p>One interesting feature of the <persName>Charlotte</persName> Half Eagles is the distinctive edge reeding. Examples of the 1838-C Half
                  Eagle have a considerably wider gauge reeding than that used at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> during the same year <ref target="#fig-15">(fig. 6).</ref> There are four reeds along the edge of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> specimens for every three reeds on a <persName>Charlotte</persName> coin. The difference is easily observed and
                  adds another distinctive feature when studying genuine <persName>Charlotte</persName> specimens.</p>

               <p>Mintage for this date was reported to be 20,583 coins, the second smallest figure for the classic Half Eagle series. There is only one known
                  variety for this date. The obverse has two fancy 8s in the date with the D mint mark over the left side of the 3 in the date and located about
                  halfway between this digit and the bust. While not usually mentioned in auction descriptions, the date on the obverse has the first three
                  digits doubled at the base with an extra upper serif of the 1 showing along the left side of the upright of the digit. This doubling is
                  clearly visible on high grade specimens but fades with circulation wear and is difficult to see on specimens in grades of VF or lower.</p>
               <p>This date is the second rarest in the series, with examples coming up more often than the 1838-C date. The average grade for specimens 1838-D
                  is also much higher than for the <persName>Charlotte</persName> issue of the same year. There are three beautiful examples of the 1838-D
                  in the SI, the best of these being an MS-63. The edge reeding is also wider on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> specimens than on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> coins of the
                  same year. The <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> reeding matches that of the <persName>Charlotte</persName>
                  Mint, and again provides a distinctive feature for authenticating genuine specimens from this early branch mint.</p>

            <p>Marketing strategies used during recent years have prompted the public to purchase <placeName>United States</placeName> government-issued gold
               bullion coins. The bullion coin concept, however, is not so recent or innovative for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Treasury. The marketing implication, though, has been that these new gold bullion coins which include an indication of their
               weight and fineness represent an innovative idea on the part of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Congress and the
               Treasury Department. That is to say, the idea of issuing a bullion coin was assumed not to have been explored previously by the <placeName>United States</placeName> Government.</p>
            <p>In fact, more than 130 years have passed since a similar suggestion was made within the financial circles of the government. In 1852 the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint's seventh Director, <persName>George N. Eckert</persName>, stated in a letter to <persName>James B. Longacre</persName>, then Chief Engraver of the Mint, that "several mints are authorized to assay, refine and stamp bullion,
               with the weight and fineness thereof...."<ref target="CH2-n1">1</ref> He then directed that a design be prepared for a bullion disk to be bought
               and sold by financial traders.</p>
            <p>In his communication dated September 4, 1852, Director <persName>Eckert</persName> also referred to a section of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> Branch Mint Bill (Public Law XXV of the Thirty-Second Congress) which had been signed into law
               on July 3.<ref target="CH2-n2">2</ref> Although both men were based in the Mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, <persName>Eckert</persName> by formal letter asked that the Chief
               Engraver begin designs for the obverse and reverse of large disks weighing 50 ounces at .990 of fineness. <persName>Eckert</persName>
               instructed, "the size of such a disk will correspond to the model in wood herewith presented. Other pieces of 100 ozs &amp; 200 ozs will be
               issued if practicable &amp; desirable."<ref target="CH2-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Mint Director no doubt was aware of the lengthy Congressional debates regarding the then recently passed legislation. Considering them now
               may help to understand why a bullion coin was considered at the time. After the introduction of the bill in the Senate on December 5, 1851, and
               the referral to the House of Representatives on December 15, there had ensued heated discussions both in the Capitol chambers and in the press
               regarding the California Mint bill. On January 7, 1852, the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Daily Times</hi> printed a report of Secretary of the Treasury <persName>Thomas Corwin</persName>, wherein he reminded members of the Congress that the distance from San Francisco, by way of the <placeName>Isthmus of Panama</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> to the mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, is 6,250 miles. He referred to the transportation cost of the
               precious metals found there as a "burdensome tax" levied upon the mining interests in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName>. Cautioning the legislators, the Secretary stated that the expenses of the Mint and branches had greatly increased since
               the accession of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName>, and would be <pb n="19"/> augmented further if Congress should
               decide to establish two additional branches at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. He continued, "I would therefore suggest...the propriety of authorizing a small
               seigniorage on the bullion deposited by corporations or individuals for the purpose of covering the actual expenses of coinage, instead of
               allowing the latter to remain as an exclusive charge upon the Treasury." This, he noted, was the universal practice at all other national mints
               and the charge was but a mere fraction of a per cent, amounting only to a few cents per ounce.<ref target="CH2-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Congressional debates during the next six months reveal that the Treasury had in mind a charge over and above the cost of assaying the gold. In
               simple terms they wished to provide for a fee on the actual production of the coinage, a charge for the official government stamp of
               authority.</p>
            <p>Several of the points raised by the Secretary in this report provoked diverse public comments. First of all, the idea that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> might become the site of the nation's chief mint caused violent reaction in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>. On March 4 a resolution of the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Legislature was laid before the U.S. Senate instructing the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Senators "to vote
               against or use all honorable exertion to prevent the removal of the Mint from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> or the establishment of one in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>."<ref target="CH2-n5">5</ref> Lengthy rebuttals extolling the virtues of having the mother mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> then appeared on the front page of several issues of the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Daily Times</hi>.<ref target="CH2-n6">6</ref> Likewise, the
               Secretary's recommendation for the creation of seigniorage caused concern in the national legislature. On June 15 <placeName>James
                  Brooks</placeName>, Representative from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, declared to his fellow members
               that he felt no more important subject than that of seigniorage could come before the Congress. He defined the term as a right imposed by the old
               European feudal barons as sovereigns, called seigneurs <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi>, upon the coinage of their realms. He exclaimed that he could
               not comprehend why this seigniorage, this relic of feudal times, was to be imposed for the first time upon the American people. He explained that
               the first bill before the House for consideration would place upon the gold producers a seigniorage charge at the mints. The cost would be
               determined at the discretion of the Secretary of Treasury but would not exceed one per cent. The second bill which had come from the Senate
               without one word of discussion there proposed a seigniorage of one half of one per cent upon all gold or silver deposited in the mints, whether
               coined, or cast into bars or ingots. <placeName>Mr. Brooks</placeName> colorfully described his feelings regarding the bills: <q>To levy a
                  seigniorage, then, on gold and silver now, <pb n="20"/> ...when we are scarce of silver,...is the very error of the moon. A proposition, under
                  existing circumstances, more preposterous, as it seems to me, never came from erring man. My resistance to it springs, not only from the tax
                  it imposes upon the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> miner‚Äîfor in such a case the miner is the man who pays
                  the seigniorage if his gold is coined at home‚Äîbut because the mischievous act would reach our commerce, our freighting trade at the <placeName>Isthmus of Panama</placeName>, our insurance offices, our bullion dealers at home, and send the gold and silver in one continuous,
                  over-whelming stream to the <placeName>British</placeName> Mint.<ref target="CH2-n7">7</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Of course, it was not only the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> miner who concerned the Representative from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName> bankers feared that a large portion of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> gold would be driven
               to <placeName>European</placeName> mints and the conversion to American gold coinage would be greatly restricted‚Äîand thus their profitable
               businesses would suffer.<ref target="CH2-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In answer to an inquiry concerning seigniorage from the Chairman of the House Committee on <placeName>Ways</placeName> and <placeName>Means</placeName>, the Acting Secretary of the Treasury, <persName>William L. Hodge</persName>, explained the practice of the <placeName>British</placeName> Mint. He reported that individuals in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> did not
               present their bullion to the Mint as the assay of old bullion was done by private individuals designated by the bank or the Mint. The charge for
               such was born by the individuals who requested the service. The Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> then
               purchased the gold prepared for coinage at an advantage of three cents per ounce, equal to about one fifth of one per cent of the value. The bank
               then paid the Mint for the expense of the production of the coinage.<ref target="CH2-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Since alloying, assaying, and coining of gold is an actual manufacture of a raw material, the Secretary said that he could see no reason why this
               should be conducted for the benefit of individuals at the expense of the government. If done, he said, like claims could be made by the
               agriculturist to have his wheat ground into flour"</p>
            <p>The Secretary then offered a proposal for handling the current, large amounts of gold at the Mint. Depositors requesting coin bars or ingots
               would pay less in seigniorage or production cost than if the Mint were to return regular coin to them. The seigniorage charge for ingots of $50
               or $100 would be less than the equivalent amount in $20 and $10 coins. The expense to the government would be substantially less if the ingots
               were made in denominations of $500 or $1,000, or even of larger amounts. The Secretary ventured that probably the depositors would require their
               bullion to be returned to them from the Treasury in ingots of large denominations. With <pb n="21"/> the mint stamp the ingots would be as
               valuable and available as coinage.<ref target="CH2-n10">10</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>Obviously, the stamp of the official <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint was considered by the Treasury Department and the public as
               differing from that of an Assay Office. The $50 issues of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> Assay
               Office <ref target="#fig-16">(fig. 1)</ref>
               <ref target="CH2-n11">11</ref> had been mentioned in Congress as "spurious coinage" and in the press as "cumbrous slugs which had excluded the
               small coin from circulation and had seriously clogged the transaction of business.<ref target="CH2-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Secretary of the Treasury felt that public and private banking institutions would prefer the Mint's large ingots over coins since they could
               be retained in vaults as specie capital. In cases of foreign demand the ingots would be more convenient to export.<ref target="CH2-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>When passed on June 22, 1852, the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> Mint Act specified in Section 8 that
               individuals might request the Mint or its branches to refine and assay gold lumps or dust and cast it into bars or ingots which would be stamped
               with value or fineness. Fees for such services were to be determined by the Director of the Mint, under the control of the Secretary of the
                  Treasury.<ref target="CH2-n14">14</ref> No reference to seigniorage was included in the final law.</p>
            <p>Mint Director <persName>Eckert</persName>, then only recently confirmed by the Senate, was anxious to carry out this law as he understood
               it. In his September 4, 1852 directive to <persName>Longacre</persName> he stated that he intended "to recommend to the department the issue
               of large disks or coins, of a uniform weight and fineness, with such devises and inscriptions (in addition to the mere statement of fineness and
               weight) as shall be sufficiently protective of the pieces against fraudulent imitation." He added, "the only inscriptions indispensable appear to
               be the words 'Mint of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>. 1852. Weight ozs. 50. Fineness 990'." It is interesting to note that the Director <pb n="22"/> saw no need to include
               the denomination; he emphasized weight and fineness.<ref target="CH2-n15">15</ref>

               <persName>Eckert</persName> obviously wished to guard against unnecessary postponements. He advised <persName>Longacre</persName>, "(as
               it is desirable to avoid <pb n="23"/> delay in the issue)...you will also oblige me by stating within what time such a design could be executed

               <persName>Longacre</persName> had just been through the ordeal of the 1849 gold dollar <ref target="#fig-17">(fig. 2)</ref> and the double
               eagle <ref target="#fig-18">(fig. 3)</ref> dies. He had survived his battles with former Director <persName>Patterson</persName> which had
               jeopardized his tenure at the Mint. Understandably he was hesitant to set an exact time for the execution of the requested designs and dies. He
               cautiously responded on September 11 that he had not been able to arrive at a satisfactory solution to the problem of preparing a device for the
               proposed disks which would be "sufficiently protective against fraudulent imitation." He wrote that an easily executed device appeared to be
               incompatible with the desired security against fraudulent imitation. What is subtracted from a rapidly executed design, he said, necessarily
               increases the facility of imitation. "Simplicity in the design is not only admissible but desirable, yet this simplicity often makes the largest
               claim upon the care and skill, and consequently, upon the time of the artist." He then pointed out other difficulties.</p>

            <pb n="24"/>
            <p>The dies would be much larger in the facial area than those used for the regular coinage of the Mint; yet, "the facilities for working them would
               not admit of any greater actual relief than that of the smaller legal coins....<ref target="CH2-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Longacre</persName> ventured to suggest a three month requirement for the dies to be completed, but continued to place caveats
               upon the requirements. He said time was dependent upon risks in experimentation, facilities, and much needed assistance. With this long letter he
               included four drawings now in the National Numismatic Collection, SI. In the letter, also now in the SI, he described his drawings: <q>The design
                  marked No. 1 <ref target="#fig-19">[fig. 4]</ref> is proposed as the obverse: its purpose is to express a representation of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, by a female figure, in aboriginal costume, seated, contemplating one of the usual emblems of
                  liberty, elevated on a spear, which she holds in her right hand; her left hand resting on a globe, presenting the western hemisphere. The
                  whole surrounded by a circle of thirteen stars. No. 2 <ref target="#fig-20">[fig. 5]</ref> is designed as the reverse to no. 1. The device,

            <p>Also in the National Numismatic Collection is an ink drawing <ref target="#fig-23">(fig. 8)</ref> presumably by <persName>Longacre</persName>, perhaps inspired by <persName>Eckert</persName> though not mentioned in this letter, which provides a sketch for a
               bullion piece and which is dated 1852. The designs numbered one and two, however, are of greatest interest at this point.</p>
            <p>Director <persName>Eckert</persName> responded to <persName>Longacre</persName> on September 22. He stated that he felt <persName>Longacre</persName> had overrated the dangers of fraudulent imitation and had consequently been led to propose complicated designs
               difficult to execute. <persName>Eckert</persName> believed that bullion coins would not be as susceptible to fraud as ordinary coins. He
               stated, "they will not be used for circulation, in the ordinary sense of the word, but will merely be bought and sold as merchandise by banks,
               brokers, and exchange dealers."</p>

            <p>Secondly, "such pieces would not be taken simply on the faith of the impression, but would also be weighed and measured...their genuineness would
               thereby alone be proved...independent of the Mint stamp." He reiterated, "it appears that a very considerable degree of simplicity is allowable
               in the devices, and yet these would prove...sufficiently protective against the perpetration of fraud."<ref target="CH2-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>He did not convince the Chief Engraver. Within two days <persName>Longacre</persName> responded that he did not agree with the Director's
               prediction for the use of the proposed issue.<ref target="CH2-n20">20</ref> More than a century later it is interesting to note how closely <persName>Eckert's</persName> thoughts about the function of bullion coins correspond to current commercial practices.</p>
            <p>By January 1853, the office of the Secretary of the Treasury in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> responded to the
               Mint Director's recommendation. The departmental suggestion relative to the issue of ingots of refined gold was made in a letter dated January
               24, 1853. A letter from <persName>Eckert</persName> dated December 29 was acknowledged in the Treasury's answer as was the receipt of "the
               accompanying disk in silver of the proposed issue..." Treasury asked "whether it would not be more convenient for the intended purpose if the
               ingot was issued of the exact value of one thousand dollars instead of the specific weight of 50 ounces." They added that if the Director
               objected, he had approval to proceed. The silver pattern was said to be returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> with the department's communication.<ref target="CH2-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>On January 27, Director <persName>Eckert</persName>, writing to Secretary <persName>Corwin</persName>, said he had already considered
               the suggestion that the issue should be of the value of exactly $1,000, but the difficulties of such appeared insurmountable or, at least, in
               need of legislation. "The law, in explaining what gold is equivalent to a dollar, prescribes certain proportions, viz. 9 parts gold, one part
               alloy of which the silver must not exceed one half. But if the gold is in any different proportion we are not, as I think, entitled to say what
               it is worth." He then speculated that if the .990 fine disk contained the same amount of fine gold as $1,000 in coin, and if it should be
               returned to the Mint for coinage, it would be necessary to alloy it with copper down to .900 fine. By so doing, the depositor would be charged
               the expense of the copper used, and therefore, the value would not be worth $1,000. To avoid such difficulties, he argued that the only mint
               stamp should be fineness and weight. Again prophetic, he wrote, "Indeed, I suppose that value will be fluctuating, dependent on the demands of
               the market."<ref target="CH2-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By February 1853, the correspondence between <persName>Eckert</persName> and <persName>Longacre</persName> no longer contained
               references to gold bullion. Rather, concerns over silver coin designs seemed all consuming.</p>

            <p>The following month <persName>Eckert</persName> resigned his post and by June his successor, <persName>Thomas Pettit</persName>, had
               died in office. As if all of this were not enough to make matters at the Mint hectic, the $3 gold coin was authorized by Congress on February 21,
               1853.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Longacre</persName> was asked to create a design for this new gold $3 coin <ref target="#fig-24">(fig. 9)</ref>. The
               representation of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in aboriginal costume <ref target="#fig-25">(fig. 10)</ref> to
               which he had made reference in his September 11 letter of the previous year surfaced again. The portrait proposed for the 1854 $3 coin was
               conceptually an enlargement of the head detail of the seated Indian Princess with feathered headdress which he had suggested earlier for the
               bullion gold. <persName>Longacre</persName> could not forget his beauty. Later, when verbalizing his feelings, he wrote, "the feathered
               tiara is a characteristic of the primitiveness of our hemisphere...In regard then this emblem of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> is a proper and well defined portion of our national inheritance...."<ref target="CH2-n23">23</ref> Indeed, his Indian head
               cent of 1859 became just such a symbol.</p>
            <p>The thought that the design for the $3 gold coin had sprung full-blown from <persName>Longacre's</persName> original ideas without change or
               modification is not entirely correct. The concept obviously had been brewing in his mind for a number of years. The change from a full length,
               seated figure to a portrait was an adjustment of necessity. The artistic philosophy of the $3 coin portrait may be traced to the earlier design
               for the bullion disk.</p>
            <p>It is not unusual to find that designs develop in the mind of the artist and then reappear in various renderings throughout a career. <pb n="29"/> The idea that the concept for the $3 feathered portrait of 1854, or for that matter the Indian head cent of 1859, quickly came into existence,
               unformed and untested in the mind of the artist, is naive. <persName>Longacre</persName> felt a need to present his own personification of
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> and he revived the idea whenever the occasion warranted. He appreciated its
               meaning as did others of a later time. Even after his death, the design was again proposed‚Äîas the obverse design on patterns of the 1870s <ref target="#fig-26">(fig. 11)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The engraver's designs did not disappear; nor was <persName>Eckert</persName>'s vision of a large denomination bullion coin buried forever.
               There were later attempts made on behalf of the western states to authorize a large denomination gold coin. Legislation for a $50 coin was passed
               by the U.S. Senate in 1854 but the bill died in the House of Representatives. The idea surfaced again with the 1877 patterns for a gold $50 coin
                  <ref target="#fig-27">(fig. 12)</ref>. Both the coin proposed by the 1854 legislation and the later 1877 patterns included an indication of
               denomination not weight and fineness. The same indication occurred with the issuance <pb n="30"/> of the $50 Panama Pacific commemorative of 1915
                  <ref target="#fig-28">(fig. 13)</ref>. Experiments with commercial, international, goloid, and metric coinage in the 1870s and 1880s included
               an indication of weight and fineness; but the theory for each differed from that of <persName>Eckert</persName>. The concept involved the
               metallic content of coinage or the establishment of an international monetary exchange, not of bullion value.</p>

            <p>In the 1980s the bullion coin idea surfaced again in the Congress and the Treasury Department <ref target="#fig-29">(fig. 14)</ref>. Political
               circumstances permitted a reevaluation of the differences inherent in bullion and regular coinage. <persName>Eckert</persName>'s prediction
               that origin, weight, and fineness were indispensable indications on bullion coins may now be fully <pb n="31"/> understood. His thoughts that
               they would not be used for circulation but would be bought and sold as merchandise by banks, brokers, and exchange dealers has been
               demonstrated.</p>
            <p>The success of the Mint's bullion gold program of 1986 is almost legend. Time will tell if the success continues. In 1852 the bullion coin was
               only an idea ahead of its time. What is yet to be discovered, however, is the fate of "the silver disk" mentioned in the Treasury Department's
               January 1853 correspondence.</p>

            <p>These days we are used to being able to pay for a loaf of bread with paper dollars or pocket change‚Äîwithout being charged different prices
               according to what we pay in; or to take out a loan one day and pay it back in a month or a year without having to worry that for the "greenbacks"
               we borrowed we might have to repay at face value in gold coins costing far more greenbacks. Few realize how hard-won was this privilege.</p>
            <p>A century ago it did not exist. It did not exist partly because nobody knew how to make it happen, partly because many actively opposed it. Those
               who sought it (the "international bimetallists" and the "free silver" crusaders) represented themselves as advocates of honest debtors (the
               working poor), but were actually‚Äîeven if unknowingly‚Äîsubserving instead the interests of wealthy western silver mine owners. Those who opposed it
               (the "gold bugs" or gold standard apologists) represented themselves as advocates of honest creditors and entrepreneurs. Many had even grown
               wealthy from the shifting exchange rates between paper money and silver dollars and gold of the same denominations, or from owning gold mines.
               Both sides touted their preferred coinage metal as a panacea for the nation's economic woes.</p>
            <p>But no matter which side was ahead at any given time, they were playing a zero-sum game: their backers' gain was others' loss, and they wanted to
               keep it that way. Each side's rhetoric was obfuscatory; even generations later, it has not been easy to tell who were the villains, who the
               misguided idealists, who the heroes if any. And among the byproducts of their political battles are some of the extreme rarities in American gold
               coinage‚Äîrarities because political factors kept issues limited, or contributed to their disappearance. In their own day, the 1879‚Äì80 Stellas and
               1879 Metric Double Eagles were "VIP" samples of a diplomat's bizarre proposal for an international coinage that would supposedly end the rivalry
               of gold and silver (whereas the only real way to do that was somehow to stabilize falling silver prices); today, they are among the most coveted
               of all numismatic souvenirs of official folly.</p>
            <p>This political zero-sum game, this joust between the knights of gold and silver (as <persName>Trumbull White</persName> called it), was not
               the intent of the Founding Fathers.<ref target="CH3-n1">1</ref> When <persName corresp="#viaf_66496514">Alexander Hamilton</persName>
               devised our national decimal monetary system, he preferred a gold standard as more stable than a bimetallic standard. Gold, as <persName>Hamilton</persName> believed, was less rapidly and less drastically affected than silver in price or purchasing power by fluctuations in supply:
               "As long as gold, either from its intrinsic superiority as a metal [i.e. immunity to corrosion], from its rarity, or from the prejudices of
               mankind, retains so con- <pb n="35"/> siderable a pre-eminence in value over silver as it has hitherto had, a natural consequence of this seems
               to be that its condition will be more stationary. The revolutions, therefore, which may take place in the comparative value of gold and silver
               will be changes in the state of the latter rather than that of the former."<ref target="CH3-n2">2</ref> A century later, <persName>J.L.
                  Laughlin</persName> was still convinced: "Increase the production of gold enormously, and it is eagerly absorbed, and so does not undergo much
                  depreciation."<ref target="CH3-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, because in <persName>Hamilton's</persName> day gold was in short supply while Latin American silver was increasingly
               plentiful, he adopted a bimetallic system as most likely to insure enough specie to run the country: the alternative everyone feared was fiat
               money, un-backed paper currency, "not worth a Continental," false promises to pay in specie, like the <placeName>Rhode Island
                  Bills</placeName> of Credit notes of 1710‚Äì86 <ref target="#fig-30">(fig. 1)</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <persName>Hamilton's</persName> policy could not prevent eventual coin shortages, and the answers included copper tokens and paper. What the
               states could not legally do, the private sector eventually did, and myriads of types of bank notes passed at discounts if at all, just like their
               Colonial ancestors. (One wonders if today's advocates of privatizing paper money are even aware of its dismal history.) Many historians,
               following Sen. <persName>Thomas Hart Benton</persName>, blamed both the proliferation of paper and the mass melting of gold until mid-1834
               on <persName>Hamilton's</persName> miscalculation of the ratio of gold to silver as 15:1, without explaining what that meant or why.</p>
            <p>What it meant was that, following <persName>Hamilton's</persName> "Report," the Mint Act of 1792 set weight standards for coinage so that a
               $10 piece would contain 270 gr of gold 11/12 fine = 247.5 gr pure gold, while $10 in federal silver dollars would contain 15 times that weight of
               pure silver = 3712.5 gr. Sen. <persName>Benton</persName> thought <persName>Hamilton</persName> wanted to drive gold out of
               circulation; evidently <persName>Benton</persName> had not done his homework. <persName>Hamilton's</persName> figure in fact agreed
               with <persName>Jefferson's</persName> and that in the "Report of the Grand Committee of Continental Congress" (1785), which gave the ratio
               in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> as 15:1, in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> 15.2:1,
               in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> 16:1. In 1792, the ratio difference was not enough to cause trouble had the Mint
               become able to make gold coins. What neither <persName>Hamilton</persName> had anticipated nor <persName>Benton</persName> recalled was
               the Reign of Terror <ref target="#fig-31">(fig. 2)</ref>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>In 1793, the French Republic under the Terror raised the weight of the Ecu de 6 Livres from 29.488 gm to 30 gm, its precious metal content from
               0.8695 to 0.8836 oz pure silver, while setting the gold 24 livres at 7.6 gm containing 0.2199 oz pure gold. This meant 24 livres in silver would
               contain 3.5344 oz pure silver, for a ratio of 16.07:1. By July 1795, when the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint began deliver- <pb n="37"/> ing Half Eagles, each ounce of gold, legally worth 15 oz of silver in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, would bring 15.5 oz in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>. Bullion dealers and money brokers (foreign exchange specialists) promptly began buying federal gold coins in quantity at par
               (probably in <placeName>Mexican</placeName> silver, which was legal tender) and shipping them to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> at a premium.<ref target="CH3-n4">4</ref> Whether from limited mintage or high meltage, early <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold rarities are byproducts of Gresham's Law.</p>
            <p>Forgetting the mint's public relations function as a gesture of national sovereignty (it was then under the State Department, not the Treasury),
                  <persName>Laughlin</persName> even called the mint in its earliest days a failure at keeping the country supplied with small change, "a
               useless expense to the nation, but a source of profit to the money-brokers." Under the mint's original "free coinage" policy (no seignorage
               charged against gold or silver bullion depositors) "the possessor of either metal has two places where he can dispose of it‚Äîthe <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint, and the bullion market; he can either have it coined and receive in new coins the legal equivalent for
               it, or sell it as a commodity at a given price per ounce. If he finds that silver in the form of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> coins buys more gold than he could purchase with the same amount of silver in the bullion market, he sends his silver to the Mint
               to be coined rather than to the bullion market...Having now received an ounce of gold in coin for his 15 oz. of silver coin, he can at once sell
               the gold as bullion (most probably melting it, or selling it to exporters) for 16 oz. of silver bullion. He retains one oz. of silver as profit,
               and with the remaining 15 oz. goes to the Mint for more silver coins, exchanges these for more gold coins, sells the gold as bullion again for
               silver, and continues this round until gold coins have disappeared from circulation... The existence of a profit in selling gold coins as
               bullion, and presenting silver to be coined at the Mint, is due to the divergence of the market from the legal ratio, and no power of the
               Government can prevent one metal from going out of circulation."<ref target="CH3-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Had the brokers and bullion dealers suspected that they were creating instant rarities, they might have squirreled away a few more for their
               grandchildren; as it was, some evidently did, which explains why proportionately more survive of some low mintages than of neighboring higher
               ones. Obvious examples include 1815 Half Eagles and 1798 Eagles.</p>
            <p>In the long run, the brokers' and bullion dealers' efforts were primarily responsible for destroying over 98% of early American gold. When people
               said that gold vanished by about 1812, they were not exaggerating. Ballpark figures for survivors speak loud and clear: <q>
                  <hi rend="italic">Quarter Eagles</hi>: 1796, over 4% of the original mintage <pb n="38"/> survives (saved as first of their kind); 1797‚Äì1833,
                  mostly 1-2%; 1834 Motto, 0.3% (mostly melted, possibly only a few released to mint officials' friends).</q>
               <q>
                  <hi rend="italic">Half Eagles</hi>: 1795, over 3% (saved as first of their kind); 1796‚Äì1813, about 0.5-2%; 1814, possibly 0.2% (more if some
                  coins issued that year were dated 1813); 1815, 2% (mostly uncirculated, saved as a seldom-seen date); 1818‚Äì33, mostly below 0.1%, some dates
                  as low as 0.02%; 1834 Motto, slightly over 0.1% (saved as last of their kind).</q>
               <q>
                  <hi rend="italic">Eagles</hi>: 1795, nearly 3% (saved as first of their kind); 1798, about 2% (mostly in high grades, saved as a seldom-seen
                  date); others 1796‚Äì1803, about 0.5-2%; 1804, slightly over 1%.</q>
               <q>In all three denominations, uncertainties in survival proportions arise from uncertainties in mintage figures, which in turn arise from
                  unknown quantities of backdated coins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Why the "endless chain" could continue long after Napoleon restored the 15.5:1 ratio in L'An XI (1803) coinage, why U.S. gold continued to
               vanish, was not anyone's miscalculation; rather the enormous influx of Latin American silver, which had already begun by 1790 to command lower
               and lower per-ounce prices in terms of gold, raised (the same thing) the price of gold bullion in terms of silver until gold coins became worth
               over face. Even if <persName>Hamilton</persName> had made the ratio match <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>'s
               16:1, gold coins would still have become worth over face in silver by 1813, when the ratio reached 16.25:1.<ref target="CH3-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Far from trying to drive gold out of circulation, <persName>Hamilton</persName> wanted to keep it there for larger transactions, while
               reserving silver for smaller ones. As <persName>Laughlin</persName> points out,<ref target="CH3-n7">7</ref> the U.S. adopted bimetallism
               without prejudice, and its failures were not from sabotage but from economic factors nobody could have foreseen.</p>
            <p>Though the Mint Act of June 28, 1834, finally insured that gold would circulate as coin rather than be melted for export, neither this Act nor
               that of 1837 guaranteed an adequate supply of small change. (Quarter eagles did not qualify as such: each one corresponded to about $50 in
               purchasing power today.) What circulated instead, then even as decades later, was worn, underweight, mutilated and/or counterfeit foreign silver
               (primarily Latin American fractions), various kinds of coppers, and, especially after 1837, paper from the private sector: private scrip and bank
               notes which might be spendable for a discount from face if one was lucky‚Äîor be refused <pb n="39"/> everywhere if one wasn't. Arguing that the
               1834 Act made debts solvable with 6% less gold than had been due, therefore subjecting all creditors to a corresponding loss, the Supreme Court
               in 1871 went so far as to denounce the Act as a violation of the Fifth Amendment, as seizing private property for public use without just
                  compensation.<ref target="CH3-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Paper money had long been a traditional device for financing wars: nominally promises to pay in gold or silver x years after issue, or after the
               war was won. No matter that <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>'s troops defeated the redcoats, the <placeName>United Colonies</placeName> lost the economic war with <placeName>Britain</placeName>, so that "not worth a Continental" became a
               catch phrase for over a century, and the Constitution explicitly forbade states to issue bills of credit or to make "anything but gold or silver"
               (i.e. paper) a legal tender. Though the U.S. won the War of 1812, its small Treasury Notes of February 24, 1815, didn't help the coin shortage.
               Federal gold coins were still going to melting pots overseas, while half dollars mostly stayed in bank vaults. The small Treasury notes were
               promptly bought up by fat cats who turned them in for bonds paying 7%. Nor did the later larger Treasury notes help. Those that bore the least
               interest went back to the Treasury in tax payments; the others were redeemed at maturity. Issued yearly during the Hard Times (1837‚Äì43) because
               the Treasury was nearly broke, and in 1846‚Äì47 to help finance the <placeName>Mexican</placeName> War, and in 1858‚Äì60 again because the
               Treasury was strapped, they were in denominations of $50, $100, $500, $1,000, and up. Even aside from the interest these notes earned, $50 then
               corresponded to nearly 2-1/2 oz pure gold, with roughly the purchasing power of $1,000 today <ref target="#fig-32">(fig. 3)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The problem became especially acute in 1861. The Union government's desperate expedients produced long-term effects on gold and silver coinage,
               unintentionally creating constitutional issues, hardships, and rarities in both metals. <persName>Salmon P. Chase</persName>, the lawyer
                  <persName>Lincoln</persName> appointed to finance the Civil War, did so by proliferating fiscal paper in unprecedented quantities: bonds,
               interest-bearing notes, non-interest-bearing notes, legal tender notes (greenbacks). He tried to extract $150 million in gold from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> banks for the bonds they bought, but they could not comply,
               agreeing only to installment payments. His most successful effort was arguably the National Bank Note system: bonds issued under the Act of March
               3, 1863, carried a circulation privilege whereby banks could issue NBNs by depositing 90% of face in bonds.</p>
            <p>Where Chase's tactics made long-term trouble was legal tender notes <ref target="#fig-33">(fig. 4)</ref>. Issuing them meant deciding that
               Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution applied only to individual states, not to the federal government: "No state shall...make anything but
               gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts." As <persName>Henry Kissinger</persName> put it, "the illegal we do immediately; the
               unconstitutional takes a little longer."</p>
            <p>Legal tender means a form of money that a seller or creditor must accept if offered as payment; if paper is made legal tender, the creditor who
               lent it cannot legally demand repayment in silver (let alone gold) at face value, nor can the seller refuse such paper in payments for his
               merchandise. (Imagine today borrowing $100 in federal paper money only to learn on the due date that your lender demands $100 face value in
               silver, plus interest in silver, and will refuse payment in the same kind of federal paper he had lent.)</p>
            <p>After the Civil War, creditors began test cases of the issue: how can fiat paper money be legal tender under the Constitution? The <pb n="41"/>
               Supreme Court waffled forth and back for years. The underlying agenda: wealthy lenders wanted to retain the privilege of lending greenbacks and
               demanding payments and interest in gold at face value, knowing that the gold would buy more than its face value in paper, when it could be had at
               all‚Äîgreenbacks had driven gold out of circulation, creating more rarities. In 1866, for a $10 greenback one received only $6.60 in gold; in 1875,
               still only $8.70. The creditors feared "cheap money" and "scaling debts": specifically, that dishonest debtors would repay at face value in
               discounted greenbacks, or after 1876 in silver coins which had cost maybe 60% of face value in greenbacks; they believed that debtors were not
               honest working people but unwise land speculators. The debtors feared "dear money": specifically, that creditors who had lent them discounted
               greenbacks (or, later, silver) would demand repayment at face in gold which might cost nearly double face value in greenbacks or silver; they
               believed that creditors were not honest entrepreneurs but speculators and market manipulators. The term usury became common in street talk and
               editorials; the issue even contributed to anti-Semitism.<ref target="CH3-n9">9</ref>

            <p>"Here I hold up to view the fraud of the system; how increase in the value of money robs debtors. It forces every one of them to pay more than he
               covenanted to pay, not more dollars but more value, the given number of dollars embodying greater value at the date of payment than at date of
               contract. In these days debtors must struggle hard to be able to pay what they honestly owe. A money system which forces them to pay from 10 to
               50% blood money is devilish indeed."<ref target="CH3-n10">10</ref>

            <p>This kind of creditor unfairness was legal so long as the Supreme Court did not rule definitively that <persName>Salmon P.
                  Chase's</persName> greenbacks were legal tender no matter what the Constitution said. And the issue made many lenders very wealthy, many more
               borrowers poorer. One does not have to be a Marxist to recognize that this led to social unrest.</p>
            <p>First the gold vs. greenbacks issue, then (after the 1873‚Äì77 depression and the Specie Resumption Act) the gold vs. silver payments issue,
               produced opposing ideologies‚Äîbelief systems with much in common with religious cults, intolerant of doubt or deviation, defended with moral
               arguments, total passion, and total misunderstanding. The gold/silver rivalry dominated presidential campaigns from 1876 to 1900, climaxing in
               1892 and 1896, by which time everyone had taken sides. <persName>Richard Hofstadter</persName> called it "money mania."<ref target="CH3-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>On the comparison with religions, recall what <persName>Senator Henry</persName>
               <pb n="42"/> Fountain Ashurst, Democrat of <placeName>Oregon</placeName>, told Treasury Secretary Morgenthau: "My boy, I was brought up from
               my mother's knee on silver, and I can't discuss that with you any more than you can discuss your religion with me." Hofstadter comments: "On the
               moral side, the defenders of the gold standard often seem as dogmatically sealed within their own premisses as the most wild-eyed silver men, and
               usually less generous in their social sympathies. The right-thinking statesmanship of the era, like its right-thinking economics, was so locked
               in its own orthodoxy that it was incapable of coming to terms in a constructive way with lasting and pervasive social grievances. The social
               philosophy of <persName>J. Laurence Laughlin</persName> and the statecraft of <persName corresp="#viaf_30330745">Grover
                  Cleveland</persName> cannot, in this respect, command our admiration. They accepted as 'natural' a stark, long-range price deflation, identified
               the interests of creditors with true morality, and looked upon any attempts to remedy the appreciation of debt as unnatural and dishonest, as a
               simple repudiation of sacred obligations."<ref target="CH3-n13">13</ref>
               <persName>Laughlin</persName>, debating with "Coin" Harvey, denounced the silver ideology as "an attempt to transfer from the great mass of
               the community who have been provident, industrious, and successful, a portion of their savings and gains into the pockets of those who have been
               idle, extravagant, or unfortunate."<ref target="CH3-n13">13</ref> Even <persName>Allan Nevins</persName>, who admired <persName>Cleveland</persName>'s defense of the gold standard, said that "our history presents few spectacles more ironic than that of our Eastern
               creditors taunting [debtor farmers] with dishonesty while insisting on being repaid in a dollar far more valuable than had been lent."<ref target="CH3-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The disease was falling prices, falling real wages, falling purchasing power of the silver in which one was paid. Harder work and savings were
               not paying off; the working poor were in fact becoming poorer, the rich richer as their gold kept rising in purchasing power.</p>
            <p>The cause of the disease, even as 60 years earlier, was oversupply of silver. Not merely the output of western mines, but U.S. silver coins of
               1853‚Äì62 returning in 1877 from <placeName corresp="#geonames_7730009">Latin America</placeName> where they had circulated during and after the

               matter how many tons of silver the Mint Bureau had to buy from western mine owners to make Morgan dollars.</p>
            <p>Among those who did not understand the cause, conspiracy theories abounded, even forming part of the Populist party platform in 1892. Their
               villains were largely <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> bankers and any other bondholders and speculators who might gain
               from damaging the U.S. as a competitor. This fit only too well the agenda of nativist <pb n="43"/> and isolationist ideologues, for whom

               <ref target="#fig-34">(fig. 5)</ref>, who tried to corner the gold market and almost succeeded. Two years earlier, they had escaped to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> with $6 million cash from printing and selling counterfeit Erie Railroad stocks.
                  <persName>Gould</persName> bribed the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> legislature to legalize
               the fake stocks, and with his $23 million profit he bought the <placeName>Union Pacific Railroad</placeName>, the <placeName>New York
                  Elevated Railroad</placeName>, and <placeName>Western Union</placeName>. <persName>Gould</persName> and <persName>Fisk</persName> then
               tried to buy up the entire $15 million of gold coins then in circulation, after which they could raise gold prices as high as they chose. They
               almost made it, but <persName>President Grant</persName> ordered the Treasury to start selling federal gold in bullion markets. Some of
                  <persName>Gould</persName>'s Administration spies (including Grant's brother-in-law) leaked news of this decision. By the time Grant's
               action ("Black Friday," September 24) lowered gold prices, <persName>Gould</persName> had cleared $11 million profit, with chaotic effects
               on world markets.<ref target="CH3-n17">17</ref>

            <p>Doubtless this real-life example was in the mind of such free silver paladins as <persName>William Hope Harvey</persName>, when they kept

            <pb n="44"/>
            <p>Something had to be done. Those who spoke for all sides thought the answer was pressuring Congress to enact laws to cure the symptoms, the cure
               differing along party lines. On the left, radical Populist free silver (with 40% of the votes in the Congressional election of 1894); in the
               center, liberal Democratic international bimetallists; on the right, conservative Republican gold bugs. These alignments set the rich older
               generation against the struggling young; east coast financiers against western farmers; capital and management against labor; and creditors
               against debtors.<ref target="CH3-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>To understand the alignments and the arguments one needs to recall some features of nineteenth century monetary theory, based on the notion that
               money meant precious metal by weight, and that fiscal paper ultimately represented promises to pay in precious metal.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Laughlin</persName> gives three major functions for money, of which only the third is strictly relevant to the 1876‚Äì1900
               bimetallism issue. Money, for <persName>Laughlin</persName>, serves 1) to <hi rend="italic">transfer</hi> value; or 2) to <hi rend="italic">compare</hi> value (as a common denominator more efficient than barter); or 3) "as a standard of deferred payments." Especially in senses 2)
               and 3), the value of anything (including gold or silver) is a ratio, unstable, changing as either numerator or denominator changes, whether you
               price silver in terms of gold or vice versa, or dollars in terms of marks or vice versa. Then, nearly everyone believed the ratio had been stable
               in earlier generations before unwise governments and ungodly financiers tampered with it. Today we know that stability is a Golden Age illusion,
               that fluctuations have been chaotic all along, and that when an extraordinary increase occurs in silver, gold or another high-demand commodity,
               the effects are faster and wider fluctuations; and in storm-tossed tides of shifting prices, buyers and sellers alike can drown.<ref target="CH3-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Bimetallism's chief aim was ostensibly "to secure, as its advocates claim, a less changeable standard for paying long [installment] contracts,
               and to accomplish this, an international league is indispensable to even a shadow of success" (as <persName>Hamilton</persName> had
               recognized a century earlier). Departing for once from the standard gold bug line, <persName>Laughlin</persName> said "the highest justice
               is rendered by the state when it exacts from the debtor at the end of a contract the same <hi rend="italic">purchasing power</hi> which the
               creditor gave him at the beginning of the contract, no less, no more."<ref target="CH3-n21">21</ref> But note that he ignored shifting interest
               rates.</p>
            <p>Bimetallism of the more radical or free silver variety (the only kind with which the U.S. ever experimented) was always vulnerable to foreign
               ratio changes, to bullion speculation, to other market <pb n="45"/> manipulation, and to new discoveries of either metal, historically silver
               being more affected than gold by this last. Unstable gold/silver ratios were always dangerous, though effects were cumulative over years, so that
               many did not recognize the connection between an 0.25% shift in the ratio and a lowering of real wages in factories a few months or years later;
               or between the issue of coin notes mandated by the 1890 Sherman Act and the Panic of 1893.</p>
            <p>Free silver was always an oxymoron; its real name was unilateral national bimetallism, meaning reversion to the Mint's 1795‚Äì1834 policy but with
               slightly lighter silver dollars. Free silver actually meant the legal right of any private owner of silver bullion to take it to one of the mints
               and have it made into coins without paying high seignorage. "Through it alone can Gresham's Law have an immediate effect." It was the law of the
               land until 1853. Free silver champions, notably Harvey, insisted that the U.S. should return to the old policy no matter what other countries
               might do: a position near to isolationism. Advocates less rational than Harvey insisted that God created the gold/silver ratio and that humans
               disturb it only at peril.<ref target="CH3-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Possibly the later developments can be understood most easily by focusing on a few crucial events and on how stupidity on gold and silver sides
               led to catastrophe in 1873‚Äì77 and again in 1893‚Äì96. A full treatment of the problems would be book length.</p>
            <p>Though the Comstock Lode and its 1870s near kin were short-term local benefits, they were long-term national disasters. Their eventual effects on
               silver prices expressed in gold were similar to those of the Latin American mints 80 years before. Their discoverers fared no better than <persName>John Marshall</persName> at Sutter's Mill; cheated out of their claims, they died poor. The more silver the Nevada bonanzas produced,
               the less it was worth per ounce, the more the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> financiers' gold holdings
               rose in purchasing power, and the more desperate the farmers whose cotton and wheat sold for less and less in purchasing power. More than <persName>Bryan</persName> realized, more than <persName>McKinley</persName> cared, more than either of them could have understood, nearly
               any circulated common U.S. gold coin ca. 1879‚Äì1900, if it could talk, could tell stories of agony about the ones who had to spend it rather than
               stash it. The uncirculated ones spent most of their time in financiers' vaults, as silver dollars did in the Treasury.</p>
            <p>Not coincidentally, in 1871, the German Empire adopted the gold standard, using the $1 billion in gold extorted from France after the
               Franco-Prussian War (equivalent today to $20 billion). Sen. <persName>George Graham Vest</persName>, Democrat of <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, arguing against the Sherman Act, said the Empire went to gold because Britain had prospered <pb n="46"/> from it since
                  1844.<ref target="CH3-n23">23</ref>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName> dumped thousands of tons of silver on the market. Prices of silver began falling in
               terms of gold; prices of gold began rising. Some silver advocates blamed <placeName>German</placeName> silver sales for the depression of
               1873‚Äì77; though not the whole cause, <placeName>German</placeName> policies certainly contributed to it.<ref target="CH3-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By omitting the old-tenor silver dollar, the Mint Act of 1873 automatically defined the coinage unit as gold and made all silver coins
               subsidiary, their face value enough above bullion value to keep them in circulation rather than melting pots. Contrary to how partisans
               interpreted the Act's name of "Crime of '73," its real crime was in making trade dollars legal tender.<ref target="CH3-n25">25</ref> Silver
               crusaders wrongly blamed the Act for the Panic of '73, beginning September 18, when "the leading American banking company, managed by government
               agent <persName>Jay Cooke</persName>, suddenly declared bankruptcy." By September 30, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Stock Exchange closed; by December 31, 5,183 businesses (then worth over $200 million)
               failed. Other causes contributed, notably the Great Epizootic of September 1872, a mosquito-borne virus which that fall and winter killed some 4
               million horses in many of the nation's largest cities, stopping deliveries of mail, goods, and funds, public transit, garbage collection, and
               firefighting‚Äîleaving many homeless after the fires.<ref target="CH3-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In July 1876, the value of silver collapsed. Trade dollars, though demonetized by joint resolution of Congress on July 22, came back in immense
               quantities to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName>. During 1877‚Äì78, over 8.6 million of them circulated in the east.
               Employers bought them in quantity at bullion value (80-83<hi rend="sup">¬¢</hi> each) and put them into pay envelopes at $1 each; company stores
               raised prices accordingly, or else would accept them only at bullion value. Many petitions reached Congress asking for recall of trade dollars;
               others sought restoration of their legal tender status.<ref target="CH3-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile the Act of February 28, 1878, mandated monthly Mint Bureau purchases of $2-$4 million in domestic silver bullion for coinage only into
               silver dollars, pleasing nobody but the mine owners. Three of President <persName>Hayes's</persName> main reasons for vetoing the bill
               amounted to this: by making silver dollars receivable for duties, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold revenues would
               be cut off, and the Treasury would not be able to fulfill commitments to bondholders, i.e. pay them off in gold as promised.<ref target="CH3-n28">28</ref> Nevertheless, Congress passed it over his veto. <persName>Carothers</persName> justly characterized this Act as "a wretched
               compromise, without a single redeeming feature, carrying with it the dangers of a wrong-ratio bimetallism without establishing the double
               standard. By it the silver mine owners were bought off with a large market for silver, the bimetallists were deceived with fictitious restoration
                  <pb n="47"/> of the double standard, and the gold standard advocates were solaced with a last minute rescue of the gold standard when it
               appeared to be doomed."<ref target="CH3-n29">29</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1878‚Äì79, <persName>Hon. John Adam Kasson</persName> (then Minister to <placeName>Austria-Hungary</placeName>) proposed that the Mint
               use one or another version of <persName>Wheeler W. Hubbell's</persName> goloid alloys to make coins intended for international circulation;
               goloid and goloid metric dollars; Stellas; and metric Double Eagles <ref target="#fig-35">(fig. 6)</ref>. Supposedly the goloid (silver with
               about 4% gold) and metric gold (containing 10% silver) would end the rivalry. How could such coinage proposals ever have had more than symbolic
               effects? How could anyone ever have imagined they could affect falling silver prices and rising gold prices? Nevertheless the Mint made the
               sample coins, and a congressional committee reported favorably on the proposal, but no authorizing act followed. The dollars went to collectors;
               the Stellas to congressmen and other favored parties; the metric Double Eagles to a few VIPs. Today they are expensive curiosities.</p>

            <p>The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 did not help free silver's repute; after it, the common people were hurting worse than ever. Under it,
               each month the Mint had to buy 187.5 tons of new domestic silver bullion, paying in Coin Notes (Treasury Notes of 1890 <ref target="#fig-36">[fig. 7]</ref>), which the mine owners promptly turned in for gold, some of which went to buy more bullion to resell to the Mint at a
               profit‚Äîanother endless chain. The Coin Notes they turned in were reissued, each eventually removing many times its face value in gold from
                  circulation.<ref target="CH3-n30">30</ref> While Treasury vaults bulged with silver dollars which circulated little and bought less than
               greenbacks, the gold reserves sank below the $100 million required by the Act of July 12, 1882. Many feared that greenbacks would no longer be
               redeemable in gold, or that the Treasury would default on foreign debts and domestic bonds payable in gold.<ref target="CH3-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By May 1893, Wall Street went into a panic. Some 419 banks <pb n="48"/> failed, and with them their depositors: factories, stores, individuals.
               Millions were suddenly jobless and hungry. President <persName>Cleveland</persName> called a special session of Congress to repeal the
               Sherman Act, over prolonged protests by silver crusaders; repeal finally came November 2, but by then the nation was desperate, and social unrest
               escalated. That fall, Coxey's Army of unemployed workers (at their eventual height in the spring of 1894, 20,000 strong) marched on <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>, to demand a federal works program‚Äîanticipating FDR's New Deal by 40 years. They
               would be longer remembered than the mounted police who on May 29, 1894, turned back the last 600 from the Capitol grounds and arrested their
               Populist Theosophist leader, Jacob Sechler Coxey, for walking on the grass.<ref target="CH3-n32">32</ref>

               question-and-answer sessions between a boy prodigy financier, "Coin" <ref target="#fig-38">(fig. 9)</ref>, and his adult audience at the Chicago

               refuting Harvey's worst blunders, but they had about as much effect as atheists' books denouncing the Bible. The general public took "Coin" more

               <persName>Laughlin</persName>, outraged at being fictionally defeated by "Coin", attacked Harvey in print, and on May 17, 1895, debated with
               him at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4896861">Illinois</placeName> Club in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>.
               The <persName>Harvey-Laughlin</persName> debate proved only that both sides had weaknesses, but neither would budge from his ideological
               base. It converted no partisans of either side to the other.<ref target="CH3-n34">34</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the 1896 presidential campaign, free silver was the number one issue; "Silver Dick" Bland <ref target="#fig-40">(fig. 11)</ref> was the
               Democratic front runner until <persName>Bryan</persName> made his "Cross of Gold" speech on July 8 and won the nomination. The Republican
               gold bugs ran "Boss" Hanna's candidate, <persName>William McKinley</persName>, on a platform of a gold standard and high tariffs. The battle
               was to come November 2.</p>
            <p>Gold bugs won on technicalities, not on convincing the opposition. They spent immense amounts on the campaign; people voted for <persName>McKinley</persName> because they feared another Sherman Act and another Panic of '93. The aftermath was anticlimactic; no action by
                  <persName>McKinley</persName> ended the nation's fiscal woes. Instead the Klondike gold discoveries (beginning August 12, 1896) and
               improved extraction methods gradually eased the gold/silver ratios, and the danger of another Panic of '93 seemed less.<ref target="CH3-n35">35</ref>
            </p>
            <p>By 1900 the Populist movement was dying; <persName>Bryan</persName> lost again to <persName>McKinley</persName>. Meanwhile, <persName>Lyman Frank Baum</persName>, observing these events <pb n="51"/> both from his editor's desk in rural <placeName>South
                  Dakota</placeName> and his writing desk in urban <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>, wrote <hi rend="italic">The
                  Wonderful Wizard of Oz</hi> at least partly as a political allegory: "Greenbacks and Silver and Gold, Oh My!" Side by side with the Scarecrow
               (the midwestern farmers), the Tin Woodsman (urban industrial workers), and the Cowardly Lion (<persName>Bryan</persName>), <persName>Dorothy</persName> (the hope of heartland's Common Man, innocent enough to see the humbug of which the emperor's new clothes was
               woven) wore the silver shoes of the Wicked Witch of the East (ignorant of their magic power) down the Yellow Brick Road (the gold standard) that
               led nowhere. The Wicked Witch of the East symbolized megacorporations and banks, which had for years kept the Munchkins, the little people, in
               bondage. Her Western counterpart was the force of diabolic/Darwinian/Spencerian nature; <persName>Dorothy's</persName> cold water drowned a
               midwestern drought or wildfire. Even as <persName>Coxey</persName>'s Army headed for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>, <persName>Dorothy</persName> and her friends headed for the Emerald (i.e. Greenback) City of Oz (the abbreviation for
               ounce) where the Wizard (the President) was unwilling to deal with their problems. Forced to confront them, the Wizard eventually confessed to
               being "just a common man" ruling by "making believe." But the Scarecrow said instead "you're a humbug." Baum's message, then as now: the desire
               for symbols of success is crammed with wishful thinking, illusion and deception. By deception the plutocrats manipulate and control the common
               people; and only ignorance allows them to keep on doing it.<ref target="CH3-n36">36</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The next year the new Wizard was dead from an assassin's bullet. In 1904 Morgan dollar coinage ended; 30 years later gold itself was demonetized,
               unintentionally creating new rarities‚Äî1929 Half Eagles, 1930‚Äì33 Eagles, 1929‚Äì33 Double Eagles. The gold/silver ratio problem was never solved; it
               died of obsolescence, when our current paper standard replaced precious metals. But like all fiat money systems, ours may become as unstable as
               its predecessors; it is certainly more vulnerable than the gold standard or free silver, whatever the disadvantages of either.</p>
            <p>Why bring up this century-old lunacy, this "money mania?" Why not merely forget it again, the way people forgot millenarian cults and Millerites?
               Because the same kind of thing could happen again, over almost any theme. And once again professors and legislators and cabinet officers would be
               at swords' points over an issue where facts are continuously obscured by disinformation and ignorant irrelevant partisan rhetoric.</p>
            <p>There are in fact disturbing parallels between the money mania of the last quarter of the nineteenth century and some of the hottest issues of
               the last quarter of the twentieth: <placeName>Vietnam</placeName>, Nicaragua/El <pb n="52"/> Salvador, abortion, drugs, pornography. Each
               issue has its pro-Establishment vs. anti-Establishment ideologies, and on both sides hot passion outshouts cold logic. Impartiality is resented
               as refusal to take sides; commitment is taken for granted: "Who is not with me is against me" (Matt. 12:30).</p>
            <p>Those who are trying to hedge against inflation, or to survive any possible revolution, by hoarding gold‚Äîwhether as Eagles, Maple Leafs, or
               Krugerrands‚Äîsee gold as the most compact and readily usable method of transporting or exchanging value; many welcome any additional demand for
               gold in industry or commemorative souvenirs or outright coinage, not because they favor collecting per se, but because it may raise gold prices,
               insuring that present holders of gold will remain rich even if others go hungry. This may not have been the purpose in relegalizing private
               ownership of gold, but it may well become a side effect.</p>
            <p>Those who seek to remonetize gold risk resumption of the old abuses as long as gold, silver and paper are not in a stable (preferably legally
               fixed) relationship‚Äîinternationally. Or is it too close to conspiracy theories to ask if some of our current gold bugs would welcome the chance
               to follow in the footsteps of their illustrious ancestors?</p>

            <p>About 15 years ago I received a telephone call from a client in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> who had recently
               shipped to me three boxes of U.S. gold coins for authentication. All of the coins in his shipments, more than 30 pieces, were counterfeits of
               modern manufacture. In those days we knew that one in every three or four U.S. gold coins submitted for authentication would be a forgery, but I
               had never before received such a large quantity of counterfeits from a single source.</p>
            <p>We notified the gentleman of our findings as we returned the shipments, one by one. Because we had not found a single genuine piece among his
               submissions, I feared that my credibility as an authenticator might be questioned. So his telephone call came as no surprise. He had fully
               anticipated my dilemma. In fact, he said that he had known that most or all of the coins were forgeries.</p>
            <p>A few months earlier he had spent several weeks on a trip to Beirut and to one or more points in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255150">South America</placeName>. Upon his arrival at Beirut International Airport he had checked in at the Intercontinental Hotel, a modern facility not
               far from the terminal. Later that day, after napping in his room to recover from the lengthy flight, he visited one of the concessions in the
               hotel lobby where newspapers, magazines, souvenirs, jewelry, and, among other things, a variety of gold coins were sold.</p>
            <p>Our <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> friend was a relatively seasoned coin collector, so he viewed the glittering
               display of gold with justifiable suspicion. He introduced himself to the proprietor of the small shop, a Lebanese man named <persName>Ahmed Najib</persName>. Presently he asked Ahmed, "Are these real <placeName>United States</placeName> gold coins?" <persName>Ahmed</persName> smiled and replied in English, "Oh no, sir, we are selling gold bullion in a recognizable form." Recognizable, to be sure, but
               more specifically counterfeit <ref target="#fig-41">(fig. 1)</ref>.</p>
            <p>The Californian dropped in at <persName>Ahmed Najib</persName>'s concession on a daily basis during the next week, and the two men developed
               a fairly close acquaintanceship. Later in the man's two to three week visit to Beirut he purchased several ornate, delicate platters or trays
               hand-crafted in silver as gifts for friends. Later he realized that they were too fragile for mailing unless they were protected in custom-made
               crates. He told <persName>Ahmed</persName> of his problem; <persName>Ahmed</persName> said that if he would come to the shop just
               before closing, he would take him to a place where suitable shipping boxes would be made.</p>
            <p>The two men met that evening, and they rode in <persName>Ahmed's</persName> sports car, silver trays in hand, to a suburb of <placeName corresp="#geonames_276781">Beirut</placeName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Ahmed</persName> parked his car in front of an American-style house in a development. As they approached the front door, my <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> friend heard and felt a throbbing under his feet‚Äîa heartbeat-like pulsation which
               emanated from the house. Inside the noise and vibration were much stronger.</p>

               <p>1. Many forgers are proud of their work. One boastful artisan placed his signature, the Greek letter Omega, inside the loop of the "R" in
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in the headdress of this false 1882 $3 gold piece. His Omega signature also
                  appears on many counterfeit <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> type 1907 high relief Double Eagles, on the reverse within the recess in
                  the eagle's talon. Both these forgeries had appeared by 1973.</p>
            </figure>
            <pb n="58"/>
            <p>Clearly massive machinery was operating in the basement.</p>
            <p>The living quarters were unfinished. Two Lebanese carpenters were at work, apparently preparing the living area for occupancy. <persName>Ahmed</persName> asked the men to make suitable shipping cases for the trays, and soon the carpenters set about their new task.</p>
            <p>While <persName>Ahmed</persName> and the Californian were waiting for the crates to be assembled, <persName>Ahmed</persName> turned to
               the tourist and asked, "Would you like to see where we make the gold coins?" The Californian eagerly accepted. <persName>Ahmed</persName>
               opened a stairway door, and the two men descended into the cellar.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the basement floor, two or three workmen were operating a large Schuler coining press which was striking <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> 1904 Double Eagles. It was clear that they had the capability of making many other dates and types of
               coins, because wooden shelves along the walls held many coining dies.</p>
            <p>I was fascinated as the Californian related these events over the telephone; his experience gave us insight into one of the most successful gold
               counterfeiting organizations in the near east. Our discussion was over in a little more than 20 minutes. I failed to ask my <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> acquaintance if he had acquired any of the counterfeit gold coins from the people who were
               running the coining press, or even from <persName>Ahmed Najib</persName>'s concession at the Intercontinental Hotel. But he did tell me that
                  <persName>Ahmed</persName> also ran a travel agency in <placeName corresp="#geonames_276781">Beirut</placeName>; that once you had met
                  <persName>Ahmed</persName>, you could order counterfeit <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold coins from him by
               mail, and that he would ship your purchases to you in travel brochures from which neat round holes had been cut in a dozen or so of the center
               pages to protect the coins snugly in transit.</p>
            <p>The manufacture of counterfeit coins for the collector market, as opposed to counterfeiting for circulation, is a comparatively modern practice.
               It has its roots perhaps in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> and elsewhere in
                  <placeName>southern Europe</placeName>, where handsome copies of Roman coins and medals were made to satisfy the thirsts of nobles and
               wealthy merchants for antiquties. But only in the last 40 years has the problem of numismatic counterfeits posed a serious threat to the
               numismatic fraternity. In the mid and late 1950s the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Secret Service received reports
               from coin dealers and collectors that a variety of purportedly counterfeit gold coins were being smuggled into this country from abroad <ref target="#fig-42">(fig. 2)</ref>.</p>
            <p>For decades that agency had devoted more attention to the detection of counterfeit paper money and other government documents than it had to
               coins, so it was ill-prepared for the influx of mass-produced forgeries of U.S. gold coins.</p>
            <pb n="59"/>

               <p>2. Counterfeit gold coins produced in the 1960s and earlier exhibit more technical defects than we find on more recently produced forgeries.
                  This common type of counterfeit Liberty head Quarter Eagle first appeared before the author began his career in authentication in 1972. Random
                  small holes in the surface of the reverse die allowed raised lumps of metal to protrude from the field to the left of the eagle's beak on each
                  of the thousands of "coins" these forgers produced.</p>
               <p>The counterfeiters combined this reverse die with a variety of obverse dies bearing dates in the 1890s and early 1900s. The U.S. Mints have
                  not used undated coin dies over multi-year periods since the early 1800s.</p>
            </figure>
            <pb n="60"/>
            <p>In fact, it did not have on the staff of the Counterfeit Division any individual who was capable of detecting these new forgeries with a high
               level of accuracy. In 1961 the Secret Service turned to the Bureau of the Mint for assistance.</p>
            <p>In response to the Secret Service request for assistance, the recently installed Director of the Mint, Eva Adams, assigned members of the Mint's
               Division of Technology to the task of finding means to detect the new counterfeits. Four members of the Mint staff spearheaded the effort,
               including the Mint Assayer, <persName>Howard Johnson</persName>, a close personal friend who passed away in the 1970s, and three other men,
               two of whom retired from the <placeName>Bureau</placeName> of the Mint about 20 years ago. Only one member of the original team, <persName>Thomas Jursich</persName>, remains on the staff today.</p>
            <p>These four men acquired a variety of scientific equipment and studied and tested both the new forgeries and a quantity of known genuine U.S. gold
               coins until they could distinguish them with remarkable accuracy <ref target="#fig-43">(fig. 3)</ref>. Their efforts received little attention in
               the numismatic press, but they made it possible for the Secret Service to seek out and prosecute purveyors of U.S. gold counterfeits with
               confidence.</p>
            <p>The main difference between the counterfeiters of earlier years and those who appeared on the scene in the 1950s could be found in their
               technology. Earlier counterfeiters were satisfied to make imitations of genuine coins by the easiest and least expensive means‚Äîcasting. The new
               breed of counterfeiter believed that the best way to make counterfeits which would deceive experienced numismatists was to duplicate the coining
               processes actually used in the mint to produce the original, genuine coins. While the setup costs for these new enterprises were vastly greater
               than for the older shops where casting rather than striking was the rule, the new organizations could make perhaps 20 to 50 pieces per minute,
               whereas their predecessors could cast only a handful of forgeries in an hour. Because these new forgeries were being struck from dies, they were
               far more deceptive than their cast prototypes.</p>
            <p>Although the introduction of modern minting technology into counterfeiting operations resulted in more realistic forgeries, it did little to
               overcome the most basic of all the counterfeiter's problems‚Äîlack of access to the original artist's models, or galvanos, for the coin he wishes
               to copy. Instead, the counterfeiter must use as his subject the best example of the genuine coin he can locate: almost certainly a
               less-than-perfect coin at least four generations removed from the original engraver's art.</p>
            <pb n="61"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-43">

               <p>3. Some experienced numismatists can detect counterfeits with impressive accuracy without a magnifier, but the stereo microscope is the
                  workhorse of every modern coin authentication laboratory.</p>
               <p>The most common counterfeit of the 1926 Sesquicentennial of American Independence Quarter Eagle differs from the genuine coin primarily in the
                  strength and sharpness of its relief, characteristics which are seldom detected without excellent lighting and magnification.</p>
            </figure>
            <pb n="62"/>
            <p>As the counterfeiter reproduces the fine details of the relief of a coin on the face of his new die, it is inevitable that he will simultaneously
               reproduce the nicks and scratches which the coin has sustained since the moment of striking. It follows that every forgery made from the
               newly-created counterfeit dies will bear identical "bruises" that are not part of the coin design, and certainly would not be present on an
               official coin die.</p>
            <p>The skilled counterfeiter is aware of this problem. He is faced with a dilemma: he may either make his counterfeits with these identical defects
               on each coin he produces, or he can attempt to touch up his dies with extreme care to eliminate the defects <ref target="#fig-44">(fig.
               4)</ref>.</p>
            <p>If he allows the defects to appear on his forgeries, his fraudulent products will be spotted by astute collectors who see the same pattern of
               scratches on many identical coins. But if he attempts to eliminate the defects in the die face, the odds are strong that he will introduce new
               defects as he eradicates the old.</p>
            <p>Judging purely from the flow of coins which cross my desk weekly for authentication, it is clear that the volume of new <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold coin counterfeits produced annually worldwide has been declining for 12 to 15 years, perhaps
               longer. In the early 1970s thirty percent of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold coins we saw were counterfeit.
               Today the percentage has declined to about five percent. Fifteen years ago we saw on average two to four new types of counterfeits each month;
               today new counterfeits of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold are rarely encountered, but new forgeries of silver and
               minor coinage have become more common.</p>
            <p>When the international gold coin counterfeiters first appeared in the late 1950s, the price of gold hovered close to $35 per ounce, so the cost
               of the raw material for their production was acceptable. Twenty years later the price was headed for the $800 per ounce level, and even today
               tends to remain above $400. Thus the counterfeiters' inventory costs have multiplied by a factor of over ten. This has reduced the profitability
               of all counterfeiting operations.</p>
            <p>In the mid-1960s, the presence of gold counterfeits in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> numismatic marketplace was
               becoming well known, and soon a few numismatists were learning how to recognize the forgeries. By word of mouth counterfeit detection methods
               were circulated. The American Numismatic Association Certification Service began authenticating coins in 1972, and in late 1976 the International
               Numismatic Society joined in the effort. About five years later the IAPN opened its counterfeit bureau in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, and during its short existence it published a voluminous amount of information concerning numismatic
               forgeries <ref target="#fig-45">(fig. 5)</ref>.</p>

               <p>4. Technological advances in this century bring the possibility of undetectable counterfeits uncomfortably close to reality, but with few
                  exceptions the design of an original genuine coin has greater crispness and strength of detail than does the counterfeit. The genuine <persName>McKinley</persName> gold $1 of 1917 is virtually free of mint defects; the counterfeit has fine, raised circumferential tooling
                  lines between "ERI" of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> and the coin's rim.</p>

            <p>While technology was making it easier to produce high quality forgeries, more knowledgeable dealers and collectors were making it increasingly
               difficult and dangerous for peddlers of forgeries to disperse their wares profitably. It is becoming clear that the fortunes of the
               mass-production counterfeiters are ebbing, and that for the near future the prime danger to collectors comes not from these forgers, but from a
               new breed which appears to be evolving: those who specialize in making smaller quantities of forgeries of less commonly traded scarce and rare
               coins, taking pains to make their products virtually undetectable except by professional authenticators.</p>

            <p>Since classical times, governments have occasionally found it necessary to establish "branch" mints‚Äîcoining facilities dependent on and
               subordinate to that central organization responsible for the purveying of coinage to a nation and its people. While any number of reasons may go
               into the decision to set up subordinate mints, there will ordinarily be two main elements in the process leading to that conclusion.</p>
            <p>The first of these is a felt need, either by the government or by persons influential in its counsels, to create more coinage. This is so obvious
               that it scarcely needs stating; but it must be in place before any additional steps can occur. This felt need may be a reflection of a real
               crisis in the purveyance of coin, or it may be an artificial creation, based on civic pride.</p>
            <p>The second main element is that of the availability of metal for coinage, which may come about in either of two ways. It may already exist in a
               monetary form, providing the means for a <hi rend="italic">recoinage</hi>. Or it may exist in a bullion form, the product of a new, and
               successful, mining economy. In the former case, the setting up of a branch mint will very likely take place in a location which already enjoys
               economic and/or political significance; in the latter, it will probably occur near the new source of metal, which will almost certainly be a
               place of little previous economic or political significance. In general, it will be much easier to establish a branch mint in the former
               situation than in the latter.</p>

               <p>By the 1830s, agitation was under way for the establishment of branch mints in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. In time, three new
                  mints would be set up, one each at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName>Charlotte</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4482348">North
                     Carolina</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_614540">Georgia</placeName>. These branch creations fit well into the model outlined briefly above. The New Orleans Mint was erected in a center of
                  great economic and political importance, and it was primarily intended for the <hi rend="italic">recoinage</hi> of other peoples' money into
                  new, American, media of exchange. The major raw materials for its products would have been the foreign, especially Mexican, coins entering the
                  Crescent City by way of its flourishing trade with the outside world. National pride and technological possibility both played a role in the
                  establishment of this new mint: by the 1830s. Americans were becoming tired of using other people's silver and gold coins, and they were also
                  acquiring the industrial know-how needed to turn these foreign coins into domestic ones.</p>
               <p>It must be emphasized that the primary consideration behind the establishment of the New Orleans Mint was an incoming flow of <pb n="69"/>
                  coins, and not of bullion. There were no significant gold or silver mines within 500 miles of the city, but there was a persistent and growing
                  influx of precious metal all the same, in the form of Mexican Pieces of Eight, of Peruvian <hi rend="italic">doblones</hi>. In this respect,
                  it is interesting to note that one other major American city came under consideration as the possible site of a mint during the branch mint
                  debate of the 1830s. This was New York, whose economic and mining situations were closely comparable with conditions in New Orleans.</p>
               <p>So New Orleans would get a mint. It would be erected with no particular difficulties, and it would be a success from the outset, coining and
                  recoining down to the opening years of the twentieth century.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> Mints</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The story of the other two branch mints established during the 1830s would be very different. <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> were always intended for coinage from raw materials, and not for recoinage. They
                  were set up as a way of elaborating the products of the gold workings of the Southern Piedmont into coinage near their sources. From the
                  beginning, then, they were the creation of a mining economy and dependent upon it. This dependence was to be the single most important factor
                  throughout their story.</p>
               <p>It was also to inject a peculiar degree of difficulty into their establishment in the first place. To the extent that coining is an industrial
                  process, the building of a mint requires a modicum of industrial experience in the area about to receive it. This was particularly true in the
                  case of the new branch mints in that they were the first "modern" facilities in American history, relying on state-of-the-art methods and
                  machinery to produce their coins. Unfortunately, the sites selected for the two new mints were too backward to easily receive and abet the new
                  technology. While not precisely frontier areas, neither site enjoyed a large population and the variety of skills required to build and
                  maintain a modern coining facility. The results might have been predicted: provided for by legislation in March 1835, construction proceeded
                  so slowly and so poorly that the "Mother Mint" (as the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>
                  facility was known in those days) was forced to send down a special emissary to prod her lazy offspring into action. This was Franklin Peale,
                  of whom more later.</p>
               <p>The two gold branch mints have enjoyed a modest popularity with scholars over the past two decades, and a number of book length treatments
                  have resulted. Anthony Stautzenburger's work on the Charlotte Mint appeared in 1976.<ref target="CH5-n1">1</ref> It contains exhaustive
                  coverage <pb n="70"/> of the events leading up to the opening of that facility, but nothing on its later activities. A new book on the mint by
                  Claire Birdsall goes far toward supplying this need, and it should be used in conjunction with Stautzenburger.<ref target="CH5-n2">2</ref>
                  Earlier, in 1984, Birdsall had contributed a volume on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> facility<ref target="CH5-n3">3</ref> which was shortly joined by a second study by Sylvia Head and Elizabeth Etheridge.<ref target="CH5-n4">4</ref>
                  Among these four sources, the interested scholar will find firm points of departure for further study. Of course, the major source for these
                  books (as well as for this paper) is Record Group 104, National Archives, Washington, D.C.</p>
               <p>Mints at <placeName>Charlotte</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> were provided for under the Act of March 3, 1835. This legislation allocated sums to
                  purchase sites for mint buildings, to equip them with the latest machinery, and to pay the salaries of the chief coiners, assayers, melters,
                  refiners, clerks, and subordinate workmen needed to operate the facilities. Sites were selected, contractors engaged, and the work begun.
                  Things proceeded well enough at New Orleans. But the same could not be said of <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>; there, a combination of mismanagement and lack of expertise rendered progress slow and
                  extraordinary measures necessary.</p>
               <p>At first glance, <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> was the more problem-ridden of the two mints. The local
                  contractor, Benjamin Towns, was excessively slow in performing his duties. Ignatius Few, who had been selected as Commissioner to oversee the
                  construction of the mint, described Towns's problems in fulfilling his agreement: the builder was nowhere near completing his labors after
                  more than a year's worth of effort.<ref target="CH5-n5">5</ref> Moreover, much of what Towns had done was done poorly. The Superintendent of
                  the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> mint reported that the building's walls had been so shoddily constructed
                  that one of them actually buckled from the lateral thrust of one of the masonry arches, essential to the original building plan.<ref target="CH5-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The letter containing this intelligence made mention of other difficulties at the Georgia mint site. There was a signal lack of adequate
                  housing in this backwoods area, leading the Superintendent to suggest that the Government either supply its employees with suitable dwellings
                  or raise their salaries by way of compensation. The Superintendent was also feeling very much alone in attempting to deal with the many
                  problems he was encountering: none of his coining colleagues had yet come to <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>,
                  and the one person whose input would have been most important, Commissioner Few, was similarly absent.<ref target="CH5-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Two observations suggest themselves at this point, the first of which applied, to a greater of lesser degree, to all early American <pb n="71"/> branch mints. That is, the parent facility could not depend on finding any experienced personnel in the places where it was setting up its
                  branches; along with a lack of industry in places like <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, there was also a lack of industrial <hi rend="italic">expertise</hi>, of technological know-how. Anybody with the
                  specialized skills needed to create coinage in the nineteenth-century fashion would have to come from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>. This situation is strongly reminiscent of the earlier fortunes of the
                  Birmingham coiners, Boulton, Watt &amp; Company, in Mexico, Russia, and several of the other places which received modern coining facilities
                  from the firm: along with the mints, the people to operate them had to be sent from the advanced area to the backward one.</p>
               <p>The other observation was, mercifully, confined to <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>. This was the problem of
                  Col. Ignatius Few, a lawyer and Methodist preacher, sometime Commissioner of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> mint. Col. Few had many sterling qualities, including a purity of heart and a greatness of mind. But he also suffered
                  from a notable lack of ability to carry projects through to conclusion, and he seems to have taken a distinct dislike to the idea of spending
                  time in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> overseeing the affairs of his fledgling mint. The Commissioner would
                  be a persistent problem for those other persons entrusted with the erection of the facility.<ref target="CH5-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <p>While the constructing and equipping of the Charlotte mint met with no personnel problems of the magnitude of Col. Few, another set of
                  obstacles was impeding progress there as well, especially the difficulty of getting mint machinery and parts from their points of manufacture
                  to their place of use. One is constantly reminded of the technological isolation of the Charlotte mint, a situation rendered more difficult by
                  a severe drought along the water route which the machinery and castings would have to take between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> and <placeName>Charlotte</placeName>. The resulting low water had made
                  shipment of the main machinery consignment problematical in the spring of 1837; Franklin Peale would still be complaining of its effects six
                  months later.</p>
               <p>Personnel problems are also evident at the Charlotte mint; and, while Peale's version of the ineptness of that building's construction is
                  perhaps overstated, there do seem to have been difficulties with the raising of the edifice there as well, even if they were not comparable
                  with what was going on at <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>. In the latter case, the faults of construction
                  appear to have led to a decision momentous for the story of both branch mints: the Mother Mint would send down one of its own, a crack
                  troubleshooter who would oversee the final labors of construction and preparation for coinage, ensur- <pb n="72"/> ing that the lengthy
                  building process would at last bear fruit. It would send Franklin Peale on his mission South.</p>
               <p>This decision was reached during the month of August 1837. <persName>John Singleton</persName>'s letter of the sixth of that month to
                  Mint Director <persName>Robert M. Patterson</persName>, containing the news of the collapse of construction at <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, would have been received at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> within a week to ten days. By August 18, <persName>Patterson</persName> was reporting the facts to his superior,
                  Treasury Secretary <placeName>Woodbury</placeName>, adding that he was hardly surprised at the bad news, already having heard rumors about
                  the contractor's incompetence‚Äîand Commissioner <persName>Few</persName>'s lackadaisical attitude about it. Patterson then made a
                  suggestion: <q>It seems to me...that it will be proper to send, to <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the Gold mints, a confidential &amp; skillful
                     person, who may present us a true account of the execution of the work, and give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been
                     committed, and completing the work that remains,‚Äîsuch as the erection of the furnaces, &amp;c. I know of no one competent to this task,
                     except our Melter &amp; Refiner, Mr. <persName>Peale.</persName>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Patterson</persName> suggested that <persName>Peale</persName>'s duties at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint could be assumed for the time being by the person who was soon to be
                  sent to New <placeName>Orleans</placeName> in a similar capacity, and, by way of persuasion, added that <persName>Peale</persName>
                  could perform this laudable task at no expense to the Government beyond carfare.<ref target="CH5-n9">9</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Woodbury</placeName> assented to <persName>Patterson</persName>'s suggestion three days later, stressing that, while events
                  at <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> were of primary importance, it would be best to send "a person to make an
                  examination of <hi rend="italic">both</hi> buildings...you are authorized to send Mr. <persName>Peak</persName> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].<ref target="CH5-n10">10</ref>

                  <persName>Peale</persName> deserves a brief introduction. He was 42 years old at the time of his visit to <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>. His early career was spent as manager of the <placeName>Philadelphia Museum</placeName>. In mid-1833, he was sent to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> on a
                  fact-finding expedition on behalf of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint. His major responsibility was to
                  bring back improved methods of metal refining, but he also took this opportunity to learn about advanced methods of coining. A visit to the
                     <placeName>Karlsruhe Mint</placeName>, which had recently been outfitted with toggle-action presses of the <persName>Uhlhorn</persName> type, made a deep impression on him. <persName>Peale</persName> saw similar presses by <persName>Thonnelier</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, and, upon his return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in mid-1835, he would pour all that he had learned about <pb n="73"/> coining into a series of
                  new machines for the Mint. His coining press was to borrow heavily from his European experiences, but it would be adapted and perfected,
                  operating more smoothly than the Continental machines which had inspired it. It would first go into action at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint in March 1836, and copies of it would soon be sent down to the three
                  new branch mints. Peale also developed an improved edge-milling machine, which appears to have been entirely of his own design, owing nothing
                  to European antecedents. His career at the Mint rose commensurately with the success of his inventions and adaptations: by March 1836, he was
                  Melter-Refiner at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint, and he became Chief Coiner
                  upon the retirement of Adam Eckfeldt in 1839.<ref target="CH5-n11">11</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>Peale</persName>, then, would be just the person to set things right at <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>. Accompanied by his daughter Anna, he set out for the first stop on his
                  itinerary, arriving at <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> on September 23, 1837. He immediately encountered difficulties: a shipment of
                  castings, copper vessels for the North Carolina mint's melting furnace, sent from <persName>Charleston</persName> by water eight days
                  previously, had not yet been received at <placeName>Charlotte</placeName>, due either to accident or to the drought conditions mentioned
                  earlier. Peale was, as he put it, "<hi rend="italic">in a trap</hi>": the brickwork for the melting furnace could not be started until the
                  castings arrived. Moreover, there was nothing for him to do as yet at <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, which
                  was in an even less ad- <pb n="74"/> vanced state of completion than was Charlotte. At the same time, he could not simply return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, because that would render his entire journey meaningless.
                  For the first and last time, the inventor appears to have lost his nerve. He quickly regained it, however, and he soon had a rough plan of
                  action in place, which involved Col. Wheeler, Superintendent of the North Carolina facility, making a personal visit along the path to have
                  been taken by the missing parts. But Peale's anxiety over the success of the branch mint enterprise, inspired by the technological
                  backwardness of the regions in which the new facilities were to operate, forms a constant theme in his letters to Mint Director Patterson.</p>
               <p>At times, this uncertainty, and the conditions which inspired it, get beyond Peale's control, and he sounds rather like a snob from the big
                  city, denigrating his country cousins. While admitting that the Charlotte mint had a pleasing exterior, the Pennsylvania inventor felt
                  constrained to add that, while the bricks from which the building was constructed "are good North Carolina Bricks, ([they] would be called d‚Äî‚Äî
                  [damned] bad in Philad.[elphia])."<ref target="CH5-n12">12</ref> His views of Charlotte hardly mellowed with time; in a later letter to
                  Patterson, he referred to the town as "this fag end of creation," an area "where the only active beings are the hogs."<ref target="CH5-n13">13</ref> In Peale's defense, it can only be said that he was encountering terrible difficulties attempting to breathe life into that mint.
                  The crucial castings had still not arrived. An importunate Superintendent Wheeler was constantly besieging him about funds to pay the hands
                  employed upon the fixtures of the mint, about which Peale could only claim ignorance.<ref target="CH5-n14">14</ref> The contractor himself was
                  demanding additional money for the work, which, to Peale's mind, had been poorly conceived in the first place. Due to careless wording of the
                  contract, windows were so ineptly constructed that it took two people to open each window, "no small matter I assure you in this hot
                     weather."<ref target="CH5-n15">15</ref>
               </p>
               <p>By October 11, the castings for the furnace had still not been received, and Peale was becoming desperate: "Not even a <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> can be ventured as to the probable time of their arrival." He had done all in his power to expedite matters, and he was now
                  engaging the bricklayers in other activities. But he was actively considering giving up on Charlotte for the time being, and sending his
                  people on to <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> where they could be more gainfully employed. In the meantime, he
                  would use his enforced leisure as wisely as he could, visiting the nearby mines which had inspired the gold branch mints and his mission to
                  rescue them.<ref target="CH5-n16">16</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Peale's visit to the mines helped restore his resolve to see his <pb n="75"/> "onerous &amp; delicate task" to completion. So did a supportive
                  letter from Patterson, which he received upon his return to Charlotte. He now assessed matters there with a greater realism; while the matter
                  of the copper castings was a serious one, they would, after all, eventually make their way to the mint and, once they had, "the erection of
                  the furnaces will be but a small matter, and every thing else is in a forward state." So difficulties were perhaps not as burdensome as he had
                  originally assumed.</p>
               <p>All the same, Peale now saw his mission as going on through the rest of 1837. He had become convinced that the primary difficulty with the new
                  mints was one of personnel: "Our superintendents have very crude ideas, and our officers are all young in their professions, of course in
                  constant need of avice [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and mediation." That being the case, Peale would do well to visit the facility at New
                  Orleans once he had done with those at <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>. What did Patterson think?<ref target="CH5-n17">17</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As it happened, Patterson thought it was a bad idea, and he told Peale so: <q>As to your movements, I must...exercise my <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> upon your proposed long delay, and, above all, upon your scheme of going to N Orleans before you return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the Mint Director saw it, once Peale had gotten things under control at Charlotte, he should go to <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> for a quick inspection, returning to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> as soon as practicable. But a visit to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> was out of the question: "Your presence cannot be dispensed with" at the Mother Mint.<ref target="CH5-n18">18</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Meanwhile, matters were finally improving at Charlotte. On October 23, Peale reported that, at long last, the castings for the melting furnace
                  had been found at Columbia, South Carolina; he had sent two wagons there to bring them to the Charlotte mint. This was welcome news indeed,
                  and it partially offset a worsening health condition among the workmen from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, many of whom were suffering from fevers brought on by Charlotte's warmer climate. The enforced inactivity had also
                  gotten on everyone's nerves, and Peale was finding himself obliged to act as peacemaker between the peppery Assayer, <persName>Dr.
                     John H. Gibbon</persName>, and those below and above him.<ref target="CH5-n19">19</ref> Peale must have been looking forward to leaving
                  Charlotte by now, even if only to exchange one set of problems for another.</p>
               <p>And his stay in North Carolina was drawing to a close. On October 27, most of the missing materials made their appearance at Charlotte, and
                  Peale's natural optimism at once asserted itself. The back of the problem had been broken, and, no matter how much <pb n="76"/> effort it
                  took, he and his men would set the facility to rights as quickly as possible.<ref target="CH5-n20">20</ref>
               </p>
               <p>By the first day of the new month, the remaining mint stores, including the castings for the melting furnace, had reached Charlotte. By that
                  time, so had the Mint Director's letter of October 24, denying Peale's proposal for an extended stay in the south. Peale assured Patterson
                  that he was no more anxious to extend his mission than was the Mint Director, especially as his role of peacemaker between disaffected mint
                  employees was proving particularly irksome. But work was now going on at a reasonable pace, and his people were now building the melting
                  furnace. With luck, Peale expected to set out for <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> in about ten days' time.</p>
               <p>But he was pessimistic about the overall prospects for the new branch mints. The people chosen to oversee the establishments lacked experience
                  in the work (the problem of technological expertise runs like a thread through the Peale correspondence), and, while the mints would
                  eventually be set to work, "as to the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> or <hi rend="italic">how</hi> that is for futurity to shew."<ref target="CH5-n21">21</ref>

               <p>Regardless of reservations, the second half of Peale's southern mission now appeared as feasible as it was ever likely to be, and he set out
                  to fulfill it. He would, he hoped, need to spend far less time at <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> than he had
                  at <placeName>Charlotte</placeName>; this part of the trip would be a visit of inspection, "a general survey on the spot which will occupy
                  me a few days," after which Peale could "finally turn my face homewards at the expiration of a week at longest at the said place." This was
                  not to say that all of Charlotte's problems had been solved. Peale still had doubts and complaints about the quality of workmanship which had
                  gone into the building, and he had recently discovered the reason for it. One of the contractors "told me himself that he secured the contract
                  by a low offer in the expectation of making his profits on the extra work" which would have to be done to render the building suitable for
                     use.<ref target="CH5-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless, it was time to leave. Franklin Peale and his daughter departed <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> on the evening of Saturday,
                  November 10, and they arrived at <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> the following Wednesday afternoon. The trip
                  had been arduous, "the latter part of the distance being through rough mountain roads." The ill fortune which had dogged Peale's activities in
                     <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> followed him to <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>: neither Mint
                  Superintendent Singleton nor any other official was there to receive him, and Peale was left to his own devices.</p>
               <p>All the same, the mint building was, at first glance, in better shape <pb n="77"/> than he had been led to believe. The concept of the arches
                  (one of whose collapse had inspired his mission) had been abandoned in favor of simpler, but sturdy, construction, and Peale was of the
                  opinion that the building would serve its purpose well enough.<ref target="CH5-n23">23</ref>
               </p>

               </figure>
               <p>Within two days, he had revised his judgment downward. Closer examination had revealed a crudity of construction, poor brickwork, and mortar
                  inadequate to hold the bricks together, the products of "ignorance on the part of the contractor and the drunken and bad habits of the
                  workmen" employed in the construction. But the artisans sent down from Charlotte to assist in the final phases of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> construction were now present, and Peale was currently making rapid strides toward reforming
                  the work, pulling down the remaining arches and overseeing the construction of the melting furnaces. He expected to finish his mission at
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> in five or six days, "after which I will return home without delay...say
                  the second week in December." He expressed guarded optimism about the mint's reason for being‚Äîthe nearby gold fields: "every hill is filled
                  with auriferous quartz and every valley and gorge with the debris." The problem was that the workings were extremely inefficient, so that "the
                  mining operations are at this moment languishing." Still, there was a great opportunity for improved technology, "that must some future day
                  yield certain &amp; great returns."<ref target="CH5-n24">24</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Eight days later, Peale was still in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>: the state of the mint was even worse
                  than previously believed, and a quick return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> (upon
                  which the Mint Director was becoming increa- <pb n="78"/> singly insistent) was out of the question.</p>
               <p>The main problem centered on the mint edifice; here, Peale's prose becomes somewhat breathless, but it is probably best to let him tell the
                  story in his own fashion: <q>The workmanship of the Mint edifice is abominable, a letter might be three times filled with the details of
                     errors and intentional mal [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] constructions, the first and greatest of which may fairly be traced to Philad<hi rend="underline">a</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">ordering</hi> a brick building in a country where there is no <hi rend="italic">clay</hi>,
                     the material employed for the brick making being the <hi rend="italic">red soil</hi> of the Gold region, <hi rend="italic">a decomposed
                        granite</hi>...put into Brick by men who certainly deserve diplomas for <hi rend="italic">Botching</hi>...</q>
               </p>
               <p>‚ÄîAll this in an area full of granite, which would have been an ideal building material for the mint.</p>
               <p>The theoretical overseer of the building activity was Col. Few, who had rarely visited the construction site; Peale was certain that the
                  Colonel was responsible for many of the mint's difficulties. The inventor had spent the past several days working furiously to shore up
                  current problems and anticipate future ones, and he could do no more. Despite all of its defects, no alternative existed to accepting the
                  edifice as it was, "or there will be no Branch at <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, a large amount of the
                  appropriation having been spent;" Congress was hardly likely to be generous enough‚Äîor foolish enough‚Äîto grant a second appropriation for a
                  second attempt. On that realistic note, Peale prepared to close out his mission and come home.<ref target="CH5-n25">25</ref>
               </p>
               <p>He and Anna left <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> at the end of the month, making a circuitous and eventful
                  journey back to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>. Peale's ill luck pursued him north, just
                  as it had followed him south. While traveling through Virginia, the train on which he and his daughter were passengers met with</p>
               <q>the perils of the most horrible accident...that has occurred for years. A fine new engine...was thrown off the track by an iron plate rail
                  which was raised up at one end. The engine was brought up against the side of the ditch, where a fearful crash took place.</q>
               <p>Miraculously, no one was killed, although nearly 20 people were injured, some of them severely. Peale escaped unhurt, although his daughter
                  received a minor back injury. He credited their deliverance to the fact that they had been traveling in the middle passenger car, which,
                  instead of being crushed by the force of the accident, had simply been raised off the tracks and thrown to one side.<ref target="CH5-n26">26</ref>

               <p>Shaken but unhurt, the little party continued its journey to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>. <persName>Peale</persName> was in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> by December
                  15, and he expected to make the final leg of the journey home by steamboat on the following Sunday.<ref target="CH5-n27">27</ref> By the

               </head>
               <p>In his report to <persName>Patterson</persName>, <persName>Peale</persName> gave the <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> facility
                  passing marks. The Commissioner, Major <persName>Samuel McComb</persName>, had made the best of a difficult situation, carefully watching
                  over the interests of the Government as he did so. The materials employed for the mint's construction had been the best available in the
                  district, and the workmanship "all that could be expected with the necessary allowances for the resources and habits of the neighbourhood."
                  The machinery, of course, had been well executed, and it had been put up at <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> in a satisfactory manner.
                     <persName>Peale</persName> had personally directed work on the furnaces and fixtures, "with the approbation of the officers." In
                  brief, the <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> facility was ready for business and had in fact already begun receiving bullion for
                  coining.</p>
               <p>The same rosy picture could not be painted for <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>. <persName>Peale</persName> listed several major construction defects, including the substitution of lath and plaster in the cornices, a roof which
                  leaked, the necessary abandonment of the first-floor arches, and the poor quality of the bricks used throughout the building, placing blame
                  for these problems squarely on the shoulders of the elusive Col. Few. Faced with these difficulties, Peale had labored manfully to render the
                  building suitable for the purpose for which it had been conceived. He thought it would now serve, and he advised its acceptance as part of the
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint. But he also thought it would be a good idea to set aside monies for the
                  structural repairs which would certainly come due.<ref target="CH5-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>With that, <persName>Franklin</persName>
                  <persName>Peale</persName>'s direct connection with the <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> mints came to an end. They began coining operations in 1838, remaining active until the
                  outbreak of the Civil War. <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, and Col. <persName>Few</persName>, remained
                  problems long after <persName>Peale</persName> had returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>. Early in 1838, <persName>Patterson</persName> wrote Treasury Secretary Woodbury that he had just received a
                  communication from <persName>Joseph Singleton</persName>, Superintendent of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> mint: the contractor, <persName>Benjamin Towns</persName>, had <hi rend="italic">still</hi> not completed his work
                  on the mint building. <placeName>Singleton</placeName> had finally lost patience, telling Towns that the mint would commence operations on
                  the first of February, finished or not. Moreover, <placeName>Singleton</placeName> would sack Towns's workmen, <pb n="80"/> replacing them
                  with other people who would actually do the job.</p>
               <p>Patterson liked Singleton's approach to the problem: here, at last, was someone ready to actually take charge, to give the Georgia mint the
                  direction it so badly needed. Why not dispense with the services of Col. Few, replacing him with Dr. Singleton?<ref target="CH5-n29">29</ref>
               </p>
               <p>This was easier said than done. Few proved as difficult to remove from his position as he had been reluctant to fill it. While Woodbury acted
                  on Patterson's advice almost immediately, informing the Colonel that he no longer worked for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> mint, requesting him to turn his papers and the unspent balance of his funds over to Dr.
                     Singleton,<ref target="CH5-n30">30</ref> it became infernally difficult to get the erstwhile Commissioner to surrender his office‚Äîor those
                  public monies which he still retained, and which had now come due to contractor Towns for his work at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> mint.</p>
               <p>Woodbury demanded immediate action on February 17.<ref target="CH5-n31">31</ref> Few refused to comply on March 6, adding the sin of
                  breathtaking gall to his earlier offense of disobedience, as he demanded a retroactive pay raise in recognition of the difficulties which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had encountered in the establishment of the mint! This demand was summarily rejected, the Treasury Secretary
                  reiterating his own ultimatum that Few turn over his official papers and funds to his designated successor;<ref target="CH5-n32">32</ref> but
                  matters were still not completely cleared up, and the contractor still not completely recompensed, as late as the middle of 1840.<ref target="CH5-n33">33</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Not that this had impeded the actual operations of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> mint. It and its North
                  Carolina sister began coining in the spring of 1838, and, except for a hiatus at Charlotte caused by a fire in the summer of 1844, the two
                  daughters of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint led uneventful lives until being
                  overwhelmed by the larger events of secession, war, and Reconstruction.</p>
               <p>The man who had shepherded them into existence, Franklin Peale, went on to bigger and better things. He attained the coveted post of Chief
                  Coiner in 1839, partly, one must assume, as a reward for his devoted labors on behalf of <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>. He remained in this post until 1854, and was thus in a position to help shape
                  our Mint's responses to an even greater gold rush, with an even greater effect on American coinage, than the one which had sent him on his
                  mission south so many years before.</p>

            <p>Gold coins have always been fascinating to me. In preparing this paper, I have had the opportunity to reflect upon having handled many important
               rarities in the series, including the incomparable collection formed by <persName>Louis Eliasberg</persName>, which I catalogued for auction
               in 1982, and which contained the unique 1870-S $3, the only 1822 $5 outside of the Smithsonian Institution, and numerous other classic issues. It
               wasn't always so, however; reflecting upon the past it seems like only yesterday when in the early 1950s I owned my first gold coin. As chance
               would have it, it was a $20 gold piece dated 1855, with a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> mint mark on
               the reverse, in a grade which today would probably be described as Extremely Fine. From a numismatic viewpoint it was of no great consequence:
               close to a million 1855-S double eagles were produced, and many examples were and still are available. However to me, a high school student who
               had recently begun dealing in coins, the 1855-S represented a ticket to a dream world, to visions of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> gold rush (for surely the piece was minted from precious yellow metal taken from the <placeName>Mother Lode</placeName>), to stories of nineteenth-century banking and financiers (<persName>Jay Gould</persName> and his
               machinations in the gold market came to mind), or any one of several other fantasies. Even today a $20 piece, whether it be common or rare, is
               impressive to me, and I hope that this fascination will never end.</p>
            <p>I came to know the subject of gold coins more closely when I did the research for my book, <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName>United States</placeName> Gold Coins: an Illustrated History</hi>, for the <persName>Eliasberg</persName> family, in
               connection with the sale of the gold coins from the <persName>Eliasberg</persName> collection. It is pleasing to me that today the book is
               still useful to the numismatic fraternity. A few years ago the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, <persName>James Baker</persName>, quoted from my book in the introduction to an important address he gave, and scarcely a month goes by without
               my receiving an inquiry from a government agency, a student researching a particular facet of gold coins, or some other individual or entity
               seeking to learn more about the golden treasures of yesteryear. Parenthetically let me state that it is a pleasure to live in the same state that
                  <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> selected for his home and studio. Today in <placeName>Cornish</placeName>, <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>'s property is a National Historical Site administered by the
               National Parks System. A visit there is at once educational and inspiring, for these are the paths that the artist trod and the rooms that he
               occupied while designing what many consider to be the ultimate in American coinage types made for regular circulation: the MCMVII High Relief
               Double Eagle.</p>

               <p>Today gold coins are a vital part of the numismatic scene. Indeed, the planners for the present Coinage of the Americas Conference undoubtedly
                  selected the field because of its wide interest. The appeal of gold to mankind dates back to prehistory, but not so with collecting gold
                  coins, at least not on the American scene. The Mint Act of April 2, 1792, set standards for coins subsequently produced by the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint, and provided for gold coins of the Quarter Eagle
                  ($2.50), Half Eagle ($5), and Eagle ($10) denominations, the Eagle set at 270 grains standard weight, of which 247.5 grains were to be pure
                     gold.<ref target="CH6-n1">1</ref> The lesser denominations were of equivalent fractional amounts. Although pattern coinage commenced in
                  1792 at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> facility, and copper coins were produced for
                  circulation in 1793, it was not until 1795 that the first gold issues became a reality. During the early years the law required that the Chief
                     <persName>Coiner</persName> and <persName>Assayer</persName> each post surety bonds in the amount of $10,000 before striking
                  coins in precious metals (silver and gold), and <persName>Albion Cox</persName> and <persName>Henry Voigt</persName>, who occupied
                  these positions, were unable to fulfill this obligation. On March 30, 1794, Congress reduced the bond of the <persName>Assayer</persName>
                  to $1,000 and that of the Chief <persName>Coiner</persName> to $5,000, after which <persName>Cox</persName> and <persName>Voigt</persName> had their surety bonds posted by others, and the coinage of precious metals was allowed to begin. Around May 1795, <persName>David Rittenhouse</persName>, Director of the Mint, assigned Engraver <persName>Robert Scot</persName> to produce Half
                  Eagles. <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> left the Mint at the end of June and was replaced by <persName>Henry William
                     DeSaussure</persName>, who ordered that gold coin production should begin. On July 31, 1795, the first quantity of Half Eagles, amounting to
                  744 pieces, was delivered, followed by subsequent deliveries through September 16 totaling 8,707 pieces for the year.</p>
               <p>While it is possible that someone at the Mint may have set aside a specimen or two of the initial coinage to serve as an example of the <persName>coiner</persName>'s art, it is not likely that this happened, for at the time little attention was given at the Mint to anything
                  except the daily routine of manufacturing coins for the channels of commerce. In 1846, <persName>William E. DuBois</persName> (who served
                  as <persName>assayer</persName> at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint 1835‚Äì81)
                  wrote: "The [Mint Collection] commenced in June 1838. Long before that date, however, <persName>Mr. Adam Eckfeldt</persName>, formerly
                  chief coiner, led as well by his own taste as by the expectation that a conservatory would some day be established, took pains to preserve
                  master coins of the different annual issues."<ref target="CH6-n2">2</ref>

               <p>At the time the term "master coins" referred to specimen striking prepared with extreme care, including those with mirrorlike surfaces
                  referred to as Proof in later years. In America the Proof <pb n="86"/> nomenclature seems to have been introduced by <persName>James
                     Ross Snowden</persName> in the 1850s.</p>
               <p>To state that the Mint had its own reference collection of gold coins from the earliest years onward would be to strain credulity, for
                  specimens of many issues currently on display there, examples which have been a part of the holdings since the nineteenth century, show
                  evidence of circulation and do not seem to fit the "master coin" category.</p>
               <p>On March 3, 1839, Congress appropriated the sum of $1,000 for the acquisition of coins and mineral ores for the Mint Collection. In later
                  years a continuing annual appropriation of $300 was made for the same purpose. From the inception of the collection in June 1838 through the
                  end of the nineteenth century, various officials in charge of the Mint Collection (referred to as the Mint Collection, the National
                  Collection, and by other appellations over the years) endeavored to set aside one of each date of coin produced at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint. No effort was made to preserve mint-marked issues, such as those
                  produced at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, or <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> beginning in the late 1830s. More often than not, the pieces saved were those
                  made with a special Proof finish. In the absence of any claims to the contrary, the Mint Collection can be said to have the earliest
                  foundation of any systematic holding formed of U.S. gold coins.</p>
               <p>From the inception of the Mint Collection in 1838 until the late 1850s, when <persName>Montroville W. Dickeson</persName> published his
                     <hi rend="italic">American Numismatic Manual</hi>, coin collecting in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> was in
                  its growth stage. <persName>Joseph J. Mickley</persName>, who began his interest in numismatics around the year 1816 when he was
                  intrigued by the apparent unavailability of a cent bearing his birth date, 1799, incorporated Proof U.S. gold issues into his cabinet, but he
                  does not seem to have made a particular specialty of them. <persName>Mickley</persName>'s contemporaries were not gold specialists,
                  either.</p>

                     Mickley</persName>, perhaps the best-known numismatist of his era, and the following associated with the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint: <persName>Jacob R.

               <p>U.S. gold coins were the specific subject of 20 pages of <persName>Dickeson</persName>'s 256-page work. The writer introduced the subject
                  as follows: "The data relevant to our gold coinage, owing to the want of proper mint records, and the great scarcity of the earlier emissions,
                  is so limited as to render impracticable a particular detail of the types and varieties. We must, therefore, content ourselves with giving the
                  different types and such varieties as have come under our observation. The early gold coinage of our government has become very scarce, and
                  hence is exceedingly rare, being found more frequently in the southern than in the northern part of our Union. The first coinage of gold
                  occurred in June 1795 in the form of eagles and half eagles....<ref target="CH6-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Dickeson</persName> went on to describe the physical characteristics of various denominations and types. For example, the 1796
                  Half Eagle was said to comprise one type and two varieties. "One of the varieties bears the effigy of a well-formed and very pretty face,
                  which has been denominated the Martha <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>. It has been stated that she sat to the
                  artist for this portrait. Whether true or not, the declaration has been sufficient to impress its credibility upon the imagination of someone,
                  for the piece‚Äîbased upon this idea‚Äîhas been lately sold for the sum of $10. If there is any foundation for this statement, we must conclude
                  that the artist's admiration of the lady's beauty overcame all scruples relative to the propriety of the act; and if he had but chronicled the
                  fact, he might himself have been included in the charmed circle of the immortalized."<ref target="CH6-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Martha <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> legend slipped into obscurity and is not recognized today. <persName>Dickeson</persName> overlooked the fact that the 1796 Half Eagle portrait did not differ from that used in 1795 or, for that
                  matter, on other issues through 1807.</p>
               <p>As <persName>Dickeson</persName> was a pioneer it is not fair to make light of any aspect of his work, for the corpus as viewed today is
                  indeed impressive, especially as it did not draw upon any earlier source for its foundation. Still, we cannot resist quoting his description
                  of the 1841-C <pb n="88"/> Quarter Eagle, which he stated was of the same design as the previous issue, "...with the exception of the letter C
                  on the reverse, which addition, as we are informed, referred to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName>, this
                  emission being a private enterprise designed for that country""<ref target="CH6-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Dickeson</persName> delineated various gold coins from 1795 through 1857, but did not treat mint mark varieties. Indeed, as was
                  the practice at the time, attention was given to the date only. An adjectival rarity rating was devised, and such terms as "plenty", "quite
                  scarce", "scarce", "not scarce", "rare", "quite rare", and "extremely rare" were used. Among those considered to be in the extremely rare
                  category were the 1796 $10, 1797 $2-1/2, and the 1798 $2-1/2. The 1822 $5, which was to emerge as one of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>'s most famous rarities after the coin was studied by a later generation of numismatists, was
                  rated in 1859 as being only "rare", a lower designation than the "very rare" assigned to an 1826 $2-1/2 of the same era, a coin which was
                  later found to be dozens of times more plentiful than the 1822 $5.</p>
               <p>An appendix to <persName>Dickeson's</persName> work was devoted to mintages of various denominations from 1793 to 1857, including gold
                  coins from 1795 to the latter date.<ref target="CH6-n9">9</ref> Mint marks were not discussed; quantities minted were grouped together under
                  date headings alone. Curiously only the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> figures were
                  given. For example, for the year 1855 the reader was informed that Double Eagle coinage amounted to 364,666 pieces, which was only part of the
                  story. Not mentioned were the 8,000 coins struck at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint that year
                  and the impressive quantity, far larger than the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> emission,
                  of 879,675 struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>. The figure for 1856 $20 pieces was similarly
                  misleading and was given at 329,878, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> production, with
                  no mention made of the 2,250 struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> or the immense quantity of
                  1,189,750 produced in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>. The reader was given to understand that no
                  Quarter Eagles were produced in 1841, per the mintage figures, although we know that <persName>Dickeson</persName> knew of an 1841-C (for
                     "California"!).<ref target="CH6-n10">10</ref> Ignored also was the production of 10,211 1841-C (<placeName>Charlotte</placeName> Mint)
                  pieces, and 4,164 1841-D (<placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>) examples.</p>

                     Francisco</placeName> mints were readily available. <persName>Hickcox</persName> used certain of the branch mint figures in computing gold
                  coin production totals for the years 1850, 1856, and 1857. In 1845, <persName>J. L. Riddell, M.D.</persName> prepared a pamphlet on the
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint, which included mintages by denomination for gold coins struck
                  from 1835 to 1845.<ref target="CH6-n11">11</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Dickeson</persName> could not have been completely unaware of other <pb n="89"/> branch mints, for another table in his
                  appendix gave the total number of pieces and face values, stated cumulatively, of "... the Mint of the <placeName>United States</placeName>
                  (and the Branches, from the commencement of their operation in 1838 ...)."<ref target="CH6-n12">12</ref> But no specific mention was made of

               <p>Coin collecting flourished in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> during the latter half of the nineteenth century,
                  particularly after about 1860, and by 1890 several thousand devotees enjoyed the pastime. <hi rend="italic">The American Journal of
                     Numismatics</hi>, published by the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society, catered to the advanced collector; <hi rend="italic">The
                     Numismatist</hi>, published by <persName>Dr. George F. Heath</persName> in <placeName>Monroe</placeName>, <placeName>Michigan</placeName>, appealed to neophytes as well as veterans; various house organs were published and sent to dealers' lists, and numerous
                  hobby magazines devoted columns to numismatics. Specialties covered a broad spectrum and ranged from ancient issues to modern pieces, from
                  foreign coins to those produced within the U.S. Although no figures exist, it is presumed that two dozen or fewer numismatists aspired to
                  collect the larger denominations of gold coins, the $5, $10 and $20 pieces, by date sequence, and as will be seen not a single individual
                  collected these by mint mark varieties.</p>
               <p>At the time it was considered that Proof represented the ultimate condition of a coin, a condition or grade better than Uncirculated. Today
                  the situation is viewed differently: Proof, a method of manufacture, rather than a grade, is viewed as being "different from" rather than
                  "better than" Uncirculated. A numismatist living in the year 1890, and endeavoring to fill his cabinet with date sequences of gold
                  denominations, would order Proofs from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint each year.
                  Mint records indicate that during the 1870s there were numerous instances in which as few as 20 Proofs were made of a given gold issue, the
                  1874, 1875, 1877, and 1878 $10 being examples. Of the 1875 Proof gold coinage, just 20 were made of each denomination from the $1 through the
                  $20. When these were produced, they were put on the shelf for potential sale. In actuality, sales of the higher denominations in 1875 tended
                  to be sluggish, and it is not certain that all 20 of the $10 or $20 pieces were distributed, although the full quota of 20 $1 pieces may have
                  been. As late as 1889, just 41 Proof $20 pieces were made, a figure hardly suggestive of wide demand.</p>
               <p>The only appreciable Proof coinage of the nineteenth century occurred in the dollar series from 1884 through 1889, when over 1,000 Proofs were
                  made of each date, not because there was a great surge <pb n="90"/> in numismatic interest, but because gold dollars had become a popular
                  speculation, and numerous citizens ordered them through banks or directly from the Mint.</p>

                  name some of the most prominent numismatists of the last century, did not acquire high denomination gold coins by date and mint mark
                     sequence.<ref target="CH6-n13">13</ref> Rather the emphasis was on the date alone, although from time to time a stray mint-marked variety
                  was acquired for one reason or another.</p>
               <p>Who were the early collectors of gold coins? It is known that <persName>George Clapp</persName> ordered certain gold coins directly from
                  the issuing mints in the 1890s. <persName>David S. Wilson</persName> collected Half Eagles dated up to the 1860s, as well as Quarter
                  Eagles and gold dollars, but not Double Eagles or Eagles. <persName>Louis C. Gehring</persName>, who died in 1921, collected by mint mark
                  varieties, but we do not know when he began. <persName corresp="#viaf_6372710">William H. Woodin</persName> developed an early interest
                  in mint mark issues, particularly those of denominations from the $1 through the $5, probably beginning no earlier than the 1890s. At one time
                  Woodin owned the unique 1870-S $3.</p>
               <p>Beginning in the 1880s collectors formed a heightened interest in the $1 and $3 denominations, because the face value was low enough that a
                  collection did not require a substantial outlay, because each series was relatively short, and, most importantly, because it was felt that the
                  pieces would become scarce and valuable (as indeed they did). So far as can be learned, the typical numismatist of the 1880s or early 1890s,
                  forming a cabinet of $1 and $3 pieces, did not expend any great effort to acquire a rare 1855-D, 1856-D, 1860-D, 1861-D, 1870-S, or other
                  branch mint gold dollar, or an 1854-D $3 rarity. Emphasis was on date sequence alone.</p>

                  advertised for sale at $1.00 per copy.<ref target="CH6-n14">14</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As curious as it may seem to readers now, when <persName>Heaton</persName> began his interest in the series‚Äîin the 1880s‚Äîfew collectors
                  cared whether a given dime, quarter, half dollar, gold dollar, or other coin bore a distinguishing mint letter. As noted already, <persName>Dickeson</persName>, certainly one of the foremost numismatists of his era, apparently did not know <pb n="91"/> what letters were
                  used for which branch mints, and could have cared less. No accurate list giving known varieties had ever been published, and no one knew what
                  was rare and what was common. "The need of distinct estimates was evident," wrote <persName>Heaton</persName> in 1893. "Preliminary
                  searching proved that the rarity and consequent value of pieces of the same date from different mints were scarcely ever equal, and that some
                  dates necessary to complete Branch Mint sequences never came to view."<ref target="CH6-n15">15</ref>

                  <persName>Heaton</persName>, far-seeing for the time, and combining the appeals of numismatics, economics, and social history, not only
                  sought to disseminate information concerning mint mark coins, but he was an "evangelist" as well, devoting part of his monograph to so-called
                  "Causes of Attractiveness," which called readers' attention to 17 distinct advantages of acquiring coins by mint mark varieties.</p>

               <p>Although <persName>Heaton</persName> did not specifically state this, of the six mints which had been or still were in operation by 1893,

                  fifth, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>, coined substantially more gold issues than silver (in terms of
                  total face value of pieces produced), but not from metal found in the area. Only the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint, the mother mint established in 1792, can be said not to have been
                  directly tied to local gold production, although beginning in 1794 gold coin production became an important part of operations there. When the
                  Denver Mint began production of coins in 1906, the primary value of its output was comprised of gold coins struck from metal from the Cripple
                  Creek District and other regional sources. The most recent U.S. mint, the West Point Bullion Depository, owes its status to gold, and is the
                  source for modern commemorative pieces bearing the distinctive mint letter W.</p>
               <p>Among <persName>Heaton</persName>'s other Causes of Attractiveness was his fifth item: "A knowledge of the coinage of the different
                  Branch Mints gives the many usually considered common dates great rarity if certain Mint Marks are upon them."<ref target="CH6-n17">17</ref>
                  This comes as no surprise to modern <pb n="92"/> numismatists, but, as noted, in 1893 it made little difference to the average collector
                  whether a given coin bore an S, CC, or other mint mark. Collecting by date was the norm. In a conversation with the present author in the
                  1950s, <persName>B. Max Mehl</persName> related that as late as 1904‚Äì5 there was very little interest in collecting coins by mint mark
                  varieties, although <persName>Heaton</persName>'s book had been on the market for over a decade. Indeed it was not until 1909, when the
                  presence of an S mint mark on a VDB <persName>Lincoln</persName> cent gave it considerable extra value, that mint mark collecting became
                  widespread, and even then it did not extend to gold coins.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Heaton</persName>'s sixth cause noted: "Mint-Mark study gives nicety of taste and makes a mixed set of pieces unendurable." In
                  other words, the collecting method adopted by just about everyone interested in the American series was completely unacceptable to him.<ref target="CH6-n18">18</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Cause no. 13 appealed to the profit motive of the reader: "As Mint Marks have not heretofore been sought, or studied as they deserve, many
                  varieties yet await in circulation the good fortune of collectors who cannot buy freely of coins more in demand, and who, in having access to
                  large sums of money, may draw therefrom prizes impossible to seekers after older dates."<ref target="CH6-n19">19</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A special section of <persName>Heaton</persName>'s work was devoted to mint marks on U.S. gold coins.<ref target="CH6-n20">20</ref> By
                  1893 <persName>Heaton</persName>, who was widely connected in numismatic circles, knew of no other collector of mint mark gold coins,
                  except for an individual who specialized in gold dollars. The author himself collected $1 and $3 pieces. Apparently no one aspired to save
                  Quarter Eagles, Half Eagles, Eagles, or Double Eagles by date and mint mark sequence. Although <persName>Heaton</persName> studied such
                  high denomination pieces, he did not collect them. His reasons for not acquiring the other series were not stated, but the high face value may
                  have been a consideration. His comments concerning rarity were derived by observing mint marks included in date sets.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Heaton</persName> noted that in the period since the suspension of gold dollar coinage in 1889, pieces of the denomination had
                  risen in value on the market so as to command "nearly fifty cents premium. It has attracted great attention from many collectors who have
                  sought no other gold series, and its Mint Marks have become generally very rare." Among <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New
                     Orleans</placeName> gold dollars, "the 1850 only is rare," while all <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> pieces were
                  considered to be "precious," the 1860-D to be "exceedingly rare," the 1855-D and 1856-D "excessively rare." The 1861-D was described as "not
                  in the Mint Report, but two pieces are known, one being in our possession."<ref target="CH6-n21">21</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Nine varieties of <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> gold dollars were discussed, including the 1854-C, which was "not to be considered
                  obtainable as, accor- <pb n="93"/> ding to the Report, but four pieces were coined and these are now unknown."<ref target="CH6-n22">22</ref>
                  Decades later <persName>Walter Breen</persName> would discover that the mention in a Mint Report of the coinage of four 1854-C gold
                  dollars was an error, and that none was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Heaton</persName> commented on other gold dollars: "The 'S' or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San
                     Francisco</placeName> issues are seven: 1854, '56, '57, '58, '59, '60 and '70, all being obtainable but the latter, which is excessively rare
                  and the only one of the gold Dollar Mint Marks that we do not possess."<ref target="CH6-n23">23</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the $3 series <persName>Heaton</persName> described the 1854-D and 1854-O, the only <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> varieties of this denomination, and the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> issues of 1855, 1856, 1857, and 1860. "All are very rare except the
                  1856, which, however, is interesting from having two varieties, a large and a small S."<ref target="CH6-n24">24</ref> Apparently he did not
                  have knowledge of the 1870-S $3.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Heaton</persName> described his own collection and told of the lack of interest in higher denominations: "With these [the $3
                  pieces] our direct knowledge of Mint Mark <hi rend="italic">varieties</hi> in the precious metal ceases, as we have found no gold collectors
                  who noticed them, and as our collection in [the] bank has no other gold than the One Dollar and Three Dollar series (these being complete in
                  all Mints, except one piece). We can, however, give the Branch Mint dates and rarities of the '<hi rend="italic">Eagle Denominations</hi>' [a
                  reference to the Quarter Eagle, Half Eagle, Eagle and Double Eagle], until their varieties come to light."<ref target="CH6-n25">25</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Heaton</persName> wrote that 75 varieties of mint mark quarter eagles had been produced from 1839 to 1893, representing $187.50
                  in face value. Concerning <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> issues, <persName>Heaton</persName>
                  noted that varieties were produced at that western mint from 1854 through 1879, except for 1855, 1864, and 1874. "The great prize of the
                  series is 1858. 1876 is scarce, but no other date should be so from the amount coined."<ref target="CH6-n26">26</ref>
                  <persName>Heaton</persName> did not recognize that the 1854-S, of which only 246 were minted, was far and away the rarest <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> Quarter Eagle, and that no 1858-S specimens were minted. How he
                  determined that the latter non-existent piece was "the great prize of the series" is unknown.</p>
               <p>In his discussion of Half Eagles, <persName>Heaton</persName> noted that the 1861-D was very rare, that the 1854-S is "exceedingly rare
                  and should command a high price," that 1864-S and 1876-S were rare, and 1875-S and 1862-S are scarce. "The rest should be readily found in the
                  far western banks." Apparently he knew little about <placeName>Carson City</placeName> issues, as reflected in this statement: "<placeName>Carson City</placeName> issued Half Eagles from 1870 to '84 continuously. No date is of small issue and all may be hopefully sought
                  where western gold circulates."<ref target="CH6-n27">27</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="94"/>
               <p>Among Eagles or $10 pieces, the 1883-O was considered to be a "high prize," the 1864-S was very scarce, and the 1879-CC rare. "No eagles were
                  coined at <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> or <placeName>Charlotte</placeName>‚Äîa great saving of time and
                  money to the collector." This statement is in seeming contradiction to his Causes of Attractiveness, for collectors would thus be deprived of
                  the pleasure of owning such items.<ref target="CH6-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Double Eagles formed the focus for several paragraphs. "Neither at <placeName>Charlotte</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName> was the Double Eagle coined, a fact which aspiring gold collectors will be relieved to know,"
                  apparently for no other reason than that the face value of a $20 piece was apt to represent two or three weeks' wages to the average working
                  person of the era. Among <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Double Eagles, the 1854-O, 1856-O and 1879-O
                  "are very scarce dates," but "the others should be freely found." All <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>
                  pieces were considered to be common. The information concerning <placeName>Carson City</placeName> Double Eagles was contradictory, as it
                  was stated that pieces had been struck from 1870 through 1885 except for 1881 and 1882 (actually pieces were struck in 1882) and from 1889 to
                  1893. Then <persName>Heaton</persName> went on to say that the 1881-CC was "rather scarce." In actuality, no 1881-CC coins were minted.
                  It is not surprising that <persName>Heaton</persName>'s treatise contained a few errors, for he was breaking new ground. What is
                  surprising is that there were not more errors.<ref target="CH6-n29">29</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Heaton</persName> gave this advice: "Collectors should, at all events, if living near any one of the Branch Mints, seek to
                  gather a series of one or more of its gold denominations. They should without fail, save the rarest dates of any series if chancing upon them,
                  for with the decline of Mint Mark coinage, such pieces will attain very great value."<ref target="CH6-n30">30</ref>
               </p>
               <p>He continued his advice: <q>From the very limited use of gold in the greater part of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, these pieces
                     are not to be found by simply waiting for them to appear in circulation as in the case of silver coin, nor will they form any part of the
                     collections that revert to dealers for sale. It becomes therefore of the utmost importance that dealers and collectors should use all
                     influence to examine the gold reserve of the banks in their vicinity, or that paying tellers, and those persons who count the cash in
                     Government vaults, Sub-Treasuries, Branch Mints and private financial institutions, should be somewhat informed numismatically, both for
                     their own profit and the enriching of private and public collections by their discoveries. But it would cause less delay here also if some
                        <pb n="95"/> experienced collector were authorized to be present when the counting of coin was in progress, both to see the contents of
                     sacks and to mark upon them as far as possible the period of the coinage they contained.</q>
                  <q>Furnished with a number of pieces of the denominations undergoing count, his trained eye could quickly detect rarities which he could at
                     once secure and replace.<ref target="CH6-n31">31</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Picture in your mind's eye the collecting scene in 1893: the numismatist aspiring to collect the larger mint mark denominations, especially
                  $5, $10, and $20, would find no such coins in dealers' stocks, save by the merest chance, as cabinets did not contain these pieces, except as
                  stray fillers for dates in which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> coins were not readily
                  available. Thus gold coins had to be acquired from circulation or through banks and other commercial channels.</p>
               <p>Thus it is demonstrated that as late as 1893, no concerted effort had been made to collect mint mark varieties of higher denominations, and
                  only a few numismatists aspired to collect mint marks of the $1 and $3 values. Apparently no attempt whatever had been made to secure <placeName>Charlotte</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_7317834">Dahlonega</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>, or <placeName>Carson City</placeName> coins at their time of issue, or to preserve quantities of mint mark coins for investment or other
                  purposes. Because of this, numerous gold coins which had been minted in large quantities were found by a later generation of numismatists to
                  be extremely rare in Uncirculated state. Consider for example the 1876-S $5, of which 4,000 were minted, and which is always found in worn
                  grades. In Gem Uncirculated grade, equal today to MS-65 or better, apparently just one exists‚Äîthe Garrett Collection coin which sold for
                     $34,000,<ref target="CH6-n32">32</ref> despite a catalogue value of just $275 (1969, the last year for which a catalogue value was
                  listed).</p>
               <p>Although <persName>Heaton</persName> laid the foundations for mint mark collecting in 1893, and although generous space was devoted to
                  gold coins by mint mark varieties, his efforts did not precipitate a groundswell or, for that matter, even a serious ripple. Even by 1933, 40
                  years later, few numismatists were interested in mint mark sequences of the larger gold denominations. By that time, however, the collecting
                  of $1 and $3 pieces by varieties had become firmly established.</p>

               </head>
               <p>As noted, numismatists of the late nineteenth century did not aspire to collect mint marks. <persName>T. Harrison Garrett</persName>, who
                  collected from the mid-1860s until his untimely death in a yachting accident in June 1888, developed an interest in gold coins, acquiring
                  numerous <pb n="96"/> rarities from <persName>W. Foster Ely</persName>, <persName>Harold P. Newlin</persName>, the Chapman brothers,
                  and other specialists of the era; but the emphasis was always on dates, not mint marks. Two decades later his son, <persName>John
                     Work Garrett</persName>, continued the family collection and added to it through the 1930s. Following <persName>John Work
                     Garrett's</persName> death his collection, and the magnificent mansion housing it, were bequeathed to <placeName>Johns Hopkins
                     University</placeName>. Similarly, <persName>Lorin G. Parmelee</persName> sought to form a comprehensive collection of U.S. gold coins, and
                  by 1890 had built the most extensive cabinet ever gathered, but again he did not pay attention to mint marks. By June 1, 1889, the date of the
                  first entry in his coin journal, <persName>Virgil M. Brand</persName>, a wealthy <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> brewer, had begun to collect coins, eventually gathering a vast holding which by the time of his death in 1926 comprised
                  some 350,000 pieces estimated to be worth several million dollars. While Brand had numerous gold Proofs and rare dates (including an 1822 Half
                  Eagle and an 1861 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint Paquet $20), and although he had
                  common date Double Eagles by the hundreds or possibly by the thousands (these were disposed of at face value after his death), there is no
                  evidence that he seriously sought rare mint marks. <persName>William Forrester Dunham</persName>, whose collecting interest dated from
                  the turn of the century and continued through the 1930s (his collection was sold by <persName>B. Max Mehl</persName> in 1941), also
                  sought gold coins, particularly rarities, and at one time had an 1822 $5, but mint marks were not his forte. Such other numismatists as <persName>John Story Jenks</persName>, <persName>James Ten Eyck</persName>, and <persName>Waldo C. Newcomer</persName> had
                  impressive collections of gold coins (<persName>Newcomer</persName> once owned the unique 1870-S $3), but mint mark varieties of larger
                  denominations were ignored.<ref target="CH6-n33">33</ref>
               </p>
               <p>During the early twentieth century, gold coins were readily available at banks, although except for certain parts of the west they were rarely
                  seen in everyday circulation. From all indications, <persName>Heaton</persName>'s advice given in 1893, that rare mint marks could be
                  obtained at face value from banks and other sources, was still appropriate in 1920. Emphasis continued to be on dates and dates alone,
                  although a few numismatists, the aforementioned <persName>George Clapp</persName> among them, were beginning to set aside mint marks.</p>
               <p>The <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> coinage of 1907, which is extensively detailed in many other places including my <hi rend="italic">United States Gold Coins: An Illustrated History</hi>, will not be discussed at length here, except to state that upon the release of the
                  MCMVII High Relief Double Eagles at the end of 1907, a popular speculation arose, and soon the coins had a market value of $25 to $30. This
                  may have spurred additional interest in collecting gold coins, but if it did, the effects were not lasting, for Matte Proof and related Proof
                  gold coins pro- <pb n="97"/> duced from 1908 through 1915 attracted few buyers. By 1920 the market for Proof <persName>Double
                     Eagles</persName> dating from the late 1880s onward was so sluggish that <persName>B. Max Mehl</persName>, for one, stated (in a
                  conversation with the present writer) that it was easier to turn such pieces in to the bank for face value, than to offer them for sale and
                  have them bring $21 or $22.</p>
               <p>In April 1933, it was announced that no more gold coins would be manufactured by the U.S. government, and, moreover, all earlier issues were
                  to be surrendered to the U.S. Treasury, with the exception of certain pieces which were considered to be of numismatic value, including
                  Quarter Eagles of all dates. By this time the collecting of gold coins, especially of larger denominations and by mint mark varieties, was not
                  of interest to many collectors, and few cared that millions of mint mark pieces were headed to the melting pot. As a result, by 1935 countless
                  rarities had been destroyed.</p>
               <p>Relatively new on the coin collecting scene was <persName>Louis Eliasberg</persName>, a <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> gentleman who was to become a prominent banker during the 1930s, and who was first attracted to the hobby when he
                  realized that gold coins would be withdrawn from circulation. Seeking to form a collection, he set aside pieces at face value; later he
                  obtained numismatic reference books and decided to become a full-fledged numismatist. In 1942 he purchased en bloc the <persName>George Clapp</persName> collection through Stack's, paying an unheard-of $100,000 for it‚Äîa sum greater than realized by the entire <persName>William Forrester Dunham</persName> collection sold by <persName>Mehl</persName> in 1941. By the late 1940s, <persName>Eliasberg</persName> was within striking distance of doing something no person had done before or has done since: acquiring one of
                  each date and mint mark issue of U.S. coinage from 1793 onward. By 1950 his quest had ended, and he was the proud possessor of the 1870-S $3,
                  one of three known 1822 $5 gold pieces, and numerous other legendary rarities. In the meantime, several collections containing mint mark coins
                  had been formed and dispersed, notable among them being the <persName>Jake Bell</persName> and <persName>Col. James W.
                     Flanagan</persName> holdings sold by <persName>Stack'</persName>s in 1944.<ref target="CH6-n34">34</ref> Both <persName>Flanagan</persName> and <persName>Bell</persName> aspired to collect mint mark varieties.</p>
               <p>By the late 1940s, as <persName>Louis Eliasberg</persName> drew close to his goal, several dozen numismatists competed to put together
                  sets of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> $20 pieces, 1907‚Äì32 by mint mark variety. Especially in demand were the branch mint issues
                  from the late 1920s. The <persName>William Cutler Atwater</persName> Collection sold by <persName>B. Max Mehl</persName> in 1946
                  contained numerous mint mark gold coins. The $10 pieces were described as "virtually complete in all mints," while the $20 denomination was
                  offered as "from 1850 to 1920 complete in all mints."</p>
               <p>The collection of movie personality <persName>Adolphe Menjou</persName> was sold at <pb n="98"/> auction in 1950 by <persName>Numismatic Gallery</persName> (<persName>Abe Kosoff</persName> and <persName>Abner Kreisberg</persName>) and included many mint mark
                  issues. The vast numismatic holdings of <persName>King Farouk</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>,
                  sold at auction in February 1954, contained many gold rarities, primarily in the Proof and pattern series.</p>
               <p>To detail the collections of coins sold at auction or still intact from the early 1950s to date would involve many pages. Suffice it to say
                  that in modern times collecting gold coins by date and mint mark sequence has emerged as a popular discipline, and many authors, <persName corresp="#viaf_244611490">Walter H. Breen</persName> and <persName>David W. Akers</persName> prominent among them, have
                  studied the subject intensely and have published fine reference books. The firm of Stack's, Numismatic Gallery (originally <persName>Kosoff</persName> and <persName>Kreisberg</persName>, later <persName>Abner Kreisberg</persName> joined with <persName>Jerry Cohen</persName>), Paramount International Coin Corporation, <placeName>New Netherlands</placeName> Coin Company, Superior Galleries,
                  Rare Coin Company of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> and others, including Auctions by Bowers and Merena, Inc.,
                  of which the author is co-owner, have produced many fine auction catalogues and have sold collections bearing such names as <persName>Davis-Graves</persName>, <persName>Garrett</persName>, <persName>Melish</persName>, <persName>Judd</persName>, <persName>Wolfson</persName>, <persName>Peake</persName>, <persName>Gilhousen</persName>, <persName>Carter</persName>, <persName>Kaufman</persName>, <persName>Brand</persName>, and <persName>Norweb</persName>, among a list of many others.</p>
               <p>Deserving special mention is the collection of the pharmaceutical executive <persName>Josiah K. Lilly</persName>, formed over a period of
                  years through the offices of <persName>Stack's</persName>. Following <persName>Lilly's</persName> death on May 5, 1966, executors of
                  his estate consummated an arrangement with the U.S. government whereby in exchange for tax credit to the estate in the amount of $5,532,208,
                  his collection of gold coins would be donated to the Smithsonian Institution. Assisting with the appraisal were <persName>Abe
                     Kosoff</persName> and <persName>Hans M. F. Schulman</persName>. Today the <persName>Lilly</persName> Collection is a proud part of
                  the Numismatic Department of the Smithsonian and is a prime attraction for all those who visit there.</p>
               <p>While these and other names have made the front pages of auction catalogues, a number of important collections have been formed behind the
                  scenes. <persName>Harry W. Bass, Jr.</persName>, former President of the ANS, assisted by <persName>Mike Brownlee</persName>, began
                  in the 1960s the formation of what was to become a major coin collection. Harry developed his interest to the finest extent, and soon was
                  conversant not only with history, mintages, and other technical details, but had discovered new die varieties and had aided the fund of
                  numismatic knowledge.</p>
               <p>While gold coin collecting of our own era is well documented in auction catalogues and books of our own generation, less well documented are
                  the activities of our numismatic forebears. It is hoped that the present discussion will illuminate in particular the collecting scene as it
                  existed for gold coins during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>

                  <p>See <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 30 (1895), pp. 25-26, where a correspondent (W. P. B. of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, otherwise unidentified) inquired of the editors about the differences between the regular issue 1861 $20 and the
                     Paquet reverse 1861-S $20 gold pieces. The editors of the journal noted: "We have to say in reply that while these differences have not
                     been specially noted in any descriptions of the coin, so far as we remember, they have, we are informed, long been known to the few
                     collectors who carry gold of this denomination in their cabinets...." Clearly even in 1895 there were very few collectors who included
                     Double Eagles in their collections, and probably fewer still included them in any systematic fashion.</p>

            <pb n="102"/>
            <p>This is not the first time I have been to the American Numismatic Society. As a senior in high school I came into this building to see the
               Confederate half dollar. While it is no longer on display, the Society continues to exhibit some extraordinary things. It is certainly fortunate
               for all of us that the Society exists.</p>
            <p>I have chosen to speak on the politics of coinage because I think it is a topic that is discussed more than you might imagine in numismatic
               literature but not identified as such. When I was a child in Lafayette I turned to the pages of one of the only sources of information available,
               Yeoman's <hi rend="italic">Guide Book</hi>.<ref target="CH6-n1">1</ref> The illustrations were of course the first thing that attracted me, as
               they attract anyone at any age. The empathy you feel toward certain designs is probably the irrepressible motive that brings most people to
               collect not only coinage but anything else. But the dates, the beginnings and ends of the periods of time in which designs were used, are also
               direct political records. It is no accident that our first coinage was struck in 1792; it falls at the end of the First Congress of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in authorization, at the onset of the Second Congress of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in
               implementation.</p>
            <p>Throughout the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book</hi>, in the section headings, are to be found references to "Acts of Congress." If you scan the
               pages, you will see arrows appear in leaves, rays introduced to the reverse: all of these things correspondingly depend on acts of Congress. When
               people say it "takes an act of Congress to do it," the fact of the matter is that it does, because in September 1787, in Section 8 of the first
               article of the Constitution, we placed the legislative power to make coins in the hands of the Congress of the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName>. It has rested there for two centuries; each and every change, no matter how minute, has in some manner a political source and a
               political consequence.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">HR 3251</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Let us take the case of a recent commemorative coinage proposal and see what it illustrates‚Äîlet us turn to HR 3251. One of the first things
                  you learn as a Member of Congress is that in order to get an HR you have to write a bill; you put the text into a hopper which is right where
                  you see it on television, to the right of the viewer as he looks at the speaker. There is no fanfare; a leaflet is quietly dropped in on a
                  noisy afternoon and it is given a number. In this instance, on September 10, 1987, <persName>Dante Fascell</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</placeName> dropped in an unpretentious bill requiring simply that we have a Bicentennial of
                  the <placeName>United States</placeName> Congress Commemorative Coin Act. It specified the denominations that ultimately resulted‚Äîa half
                  dollar, <pb n="103"/> dollar and five dollar gold coin. The concept was similar to previous programs of recent years commemorating such events
                  as the Olympic games.</p>
               <p>So on September 10, we initiated and five days later, on September 15, referred the bill to the appropriate subcommittee, Consumer Affairs and
                  Coinage, a subcommittee of the Committee on Banking. It is important to recognize this committee process as it has developed in Congress.
                  Sometimes when we move beyond the Beltway in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>, we have the feeling that every
                  legislator handles everything. The letters that I receive in my office daily are on every imaginable subject, and each one of these will move
                  toward its niche in a legislative effort.</p>
               <p>The Committee on Banking moves everything related to coinage. The Subcommittee on Coinage was combined with Consumer Affairs in order to hold
                  down the number of subcommittees. We already have enough with 17 full standing committees, and their subcommittees which now total over
                  100.</p>
               <p>Remarkably, hearings were held on HR 3251 on September 15, the same day it was referred. Markup was held on September 15 and on September 29
                  the bill was moved up on the House calendar under a suspension of the rules.</p>
               <p>What that means is that there is a quiet day on the floor and non-controversial measures are usually listed automatically by voice vote; in
                  the rare case when someone calls for a vote, it usually refers to a previous motion and allows it to be voted on the following day. For
                  example on Monday, when I get back to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington D.C.</placeName>, there will be eight or nine bills
                  stacked up. These will not be voted until late in the afternoon no matter when they were debated, if there are votes at all. They are all
                  under suspension, all allegedly non-controversial as was HR 3251. It was passed by voice vote on September 29, the same day it was brought up.
                  The following day it went to the Senate Banking Committee. So far, so good.</p>
               <p>In May of 1988, the Senate Banking Committee finally took up HR 3251. In June it was reported to the Senate with a few amendments, and placed
                  on the calendar June 10. June 15 there was a motion to proceed to consideration; June 15 it was laid before the Senate and passed, with a few
                  amendments, 96-0. On June 23 the House agreed to most of the amendments but disagreed with some, so on July 12 the measure was laid before the
                  Senate by unanimous consent. The Senate concurred with most amendments, not all. The House agreed to the Senate amendments on July 13 and
                  cleared the bill for the White House. On July 27 it was presented to the President, on August 1 it was signed by <persName>Mr.
                     Reagan</persName> and became Law <pb n="104"/> 100-378. Great story, right?</p>
               <p>It has absolutely nothing to do with commemorative coinage. That bill died 24 hours later. The amendments that I glossed over were amendments
                  put in during the late days of July. As I said earlier, it was the Banking Committees‚Äîthe act extended for one year, until August 10, 1989,
                  the moratorium on voluntary termination of Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation insured status. All other provisions were repealed.
                  The Senate used this vehicle to accomplish an emergency need in banking and therefore sacrificed the commemorative bill in order to get the
                  FDIC and FSLIC issues before the President of the <placeName>United States</placeName> by the end of the year. The bill began, it
                  ended.</p>
               <p>There is an educational film used in schools to show how a bill is passed. The film shows how a bill starts with filing and then moves to
                  subcommittee. Hearings are held, then it goes before the full committee, then before the House. The same thing occurs in the Senate; the two
                  houses get together in conferences, and finally there is a conference report. That is voted on. If passed it goes to the President who either
                  signs it, vetos it or does nothing. It becomes law. That is perhaps true in the sixth grade, but in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington D.C.</placeName> things are more bizarre.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Let us jump to the next year. Now we're dealing with a different House bill‚ÄîHR 5280. Undaunted by what happened the previous year, Dante
                  Fascell, on September 13, files a slightly different bill. This one contains the same provisions he originally had for all the proceeds to be
                  applied toward retirement of the national debt. The bill has the same title and this time he doesn't even have a hearing. He's able to move it
                  more quickly because of the hearing the previous year.</p>
               <p>On October 1 the new bill is referred to the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, on October 3 called up by the House, on October 3 considered by
                  the House as unfinished business. On October 4 it is passed on a vote of 411-8‚Äîvery controversial. October 5 it is received in the Senate and
                  read twice. Apparently that took two days. On October 7 the measure is laid before the Senate by unamimous consent, October 7 it is passed by
                  the Senate with a mild amendment by voice vote. October 20 the House concurs in the Senate amendments. On October 20 the Senate agrees to the
                  House amendment by voice vote and it is cleared for the White House. On November 10 it is presented to the President, and signed by him
                  November 17 to become Public Law 100-673.</p>
               <pb n="105"/>
               <p>This time it went through quietly and without political controversy, didn't it? Not quite.</p>
               <p>The original bill, under Section 8, had a provided that "...all surcharges received by the Secretary from the sale of coins minted under this
                  Act shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury and shall be used for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt." The bill the
                  President signed contains a slightly revised form of Section 8, resulting from a compromise. In summary, it provides that the first half of
                  the first $40 million in surcharges shall be deposited in the Capitol Preservation Fund and available to the <placeName>United
                     States</placeName> Capitol Preservation Commission. That's good‚Äîexcept there was no Capitol Preservation Commission. But a few days later there
                  was one. The bill creating it came out of the Senate, was concurred in by the House, and the President decided to sign these bills in <hi rend="italic">reverse order</hi> of their passage. Therefore the Capitol Preservation Act was signed after the Commemorative Coin Act and
                  the Preservation bill contained language that funnels <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of the funds and the surcharges to the Capitol Preservation
                  Fund and the Capitol Preservation Society. Therefore by reversing the order between passage and signing what we now have is a lot of money
                  going to the Capitol Preservation Fund.</p>
               <p>This is an illustration of politics in coinage. It was certainly not the original intention to use this commemorative coinage vehicle to
                  create the Capitol Preservation Fund or to finance it. But in the political arena, particularly toward the end of the year, when people are
                  scrambling to complete legislation, vehicles are sought in both the House and the Senate to accomplish these ends. This has been true for
                  years. Some of you may remember the 1960s when Senator <persName>Everett Dirksen</persName> passed the School Prayer Bill as an amendment
                  to National Little League Baseball Day, a commemorative bill which was then in the Senate. We are not dealing with something new but we are
                  dealing with something that is very, very real. The Capitol Preservation bill was one of the projects of Senator <persName>Robert
                     Byrd</persName> of <placeName>West Virginia</placeName>, then the Majority Leader in the Senate. From that position and with a pretty good
                  staff he found a vehicle which was very attractive, which was very popular on both sides of Congress and he was able to utilize it in order to
                  accomplish his goal. I don't criticize him for that, I commend him for it.</p>
               <p>Passage of the bill also brought about a second floor fight. Section 4 of the original bill, dealing with design of the coinage, provided for
                  "consultation" between the Commission of Fine Arts and the Secretary of the Treasury. In the subsequent bill that became law, Section 4 states
                  that the "design for each coin authorized shall <pb n="106"/> be selected by the Secretary after consultation with the Speaker of the House of
                  Representatives, the President pro tem of the Senate, and the Commission of Fine Arts." In the interim, Senator <persName>Byrd</persName>
                  had become President pro tem of the Senate. I suspect that is not a coincidence. In the intervening legislation we also moved from the
                  Commission of Fine Arts to the Capitol Preservation Society which was going to make recommendations (though it didn't exist) and we then moved
                  to the particular individual interested in, and the driving force behind it, Senator <persName>Byrd</persName>.</p>
               <p>How then did the Speaker of the House get involved? Speaker <persName>Jim Wright</persName> was not particularly desirous of getting
                  involved with anything during these times in 1988. But even before the Speaker was elected a member of Congress, he was a close friend of
                     <persName>Mrs. Corinne C. Boggs</persName>, the dean of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> delegation
                  who also happens to be the Chairman of the Bicentennial of Congress Commission. <persName>Mrs. Boggs</persName> asked the Speaker to
                  become involved, so that the input of the Architect of the Capitol as well as those who had appeared before the Commission could be equally
                  felt. So you end up with a political compromise that has the Speaker of the House, President pro tem of the Senate, the Fine Arts Commission,
                  but ultimately poor <persName>Mr. Brady</persName> having to make each one of these groups happy and having to distill these various
                  inputs into his final decision.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Politics of Implementation</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I now move from point one‚Äîthe politics of legislation to point two‚Äîthe politics of implementation. As you can imagine the competition among
                  artists to become part of the unique numismatic history of America is very keen. Those who were interested in this particular opportunity
                  submitted a multitude of different designs. The political consequences of those submissions are something that numismatic scholars sometimes
                  overlook. This is not the first or the last time it will happen.</p>
               <p>Three designs were represented in the press kit circulated by the U.S. Mint. These designs reflect the political sensitivities of a House
                  leader, a Senate leader and the Secretary of the Treasury, endeavoring to make everybody happy.</p>
               <p>The reverse design of the dollar is the mace which resides in the House of Representatives; it never leaves there. It belongs to the Office of
                  the Sergeant-at-Arms or it's on the House floor. The mace is placed on a pedestal when we go into the Committee of the Whole.</p>
               <p>The reverse of the five dollar coin is the magnificent eagle you <pb n="107"/> will see if you watch a rerun of <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Mr. Smith Goes</persName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>
                  </hi>, right behind <persName>Jimmy Stewart</persName> as he makes an impassioned plea for the young men who want to save their property
                  from being dammed up and flooded. The eagle has never left the <placeName>United States</placeName> Senate.</p>

                  <p>1. U.S. Congressional Coins, 1989.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>Finally, the reverse of the half dollar is the Capitol with both the House and Senate grounds showing. So we have an emblem of the House, an
                  emblem of the Senate and an emblem of the full Congress.</p>
               <p>The obverse designs are the complete Capitol Dome which is dead center between the Senate and House Chambers; the magnificent bronze statue of
                  Freedom which stands atop the dome dead center; and a closeup design on a half dollar of that same figure dead center. We have compromised
                  perfectly then the interests of the Senate and the interests of the House, and we have laid down the geographic boundary that's the midpoint
                  of both chambers in order to design the coinage commemorating this Capitol.</p>
               <p>This is political implementation, based on the give and take of those present, each one wanting to assure a portion of the body that he
                  represents as well as those things that are emblematic for all people. The point that I wish to emphasize here is that political
                  considerations have always been a part of coinage and will probably <pb n="108"/> always be. This has been true from the time that we argued
                  in the Second Congress of the <placeName>United States</placeName> over the compensation that would be paid to the Chief <persName>Coiner</persName>, to the time that the Secretary of the Treasury had vehement arguments with President <persName>Theodore
                     Roosevelt</persName> over redesign of coinage, to a few months ago when we had acceptance by committee of the final designs for what I think is
                  a beautiful series of commemorative coins.</p>
               <p>In the future, I would propose that numismatic scholars record the legislative histories of coinage bills as they are proposed; document the
                  hearings and comments when made; conduct interviews with key members; and solicit the private papers of those who make the decisions in order
                  to preserve the information in research institutions such as the ANS. Then posterity can look back to previous occasions, as I would love to
                  look back now and learn precisely what went into the work of <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName>, <persName>Hermon
                     McNeil</persName>, or <persName>James Earle Frazer</persName>. The political part of the process usually passes solely into volumes of
                  paper, the personality aspects disappear and archaeological work is needed to connect what happened with those people who were the driving
                  forces behind the legislation. Once lost, this information is virtually impossible to reconstruct.</p>

               <p>A final note on political consequence is in order here because to me it is quite personal. I no longer collect coins. I do however retain
                  vivid memories of the time that I did, the people that I knew and the people that I still know, the friendships made. The politics of that are
                  very simple.</p>
               <p>The Capitol Commemorative issues, like so many others before, will be found attractive and purchased based upon the criteria of design and
                  subject matter. Almost every commemorative coin issue based on popular subject matter, beautifully executed, has sold very well. Those that
                  have had some criticism of the design or were not a particularly popular idea, although considered worthy of commemoration, have not done
                  well.</p>
               <p>In the current case, during the first five weeks surcharges amounting to $10 million have been collected through this commemoration of the
                  bicentennial of the Congress of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. I don't know what the final figures will be. I suspect the
                  mintage will be fairly low, for we are going through a period of time when public criticism of the Congress is very, very high. So, despite
                  what I think is often excellent design work, the subject matter itself may not be remarkably appealing. That is wrong and unfortunate.</p>
               <p>The Statue of Freedom (which some people confuse with the <pb n="109"/> Statue of Liberty) that sits atop the Capitol Dome has been there
                  since <persName corresp="#viaf_76349832">Abraham Lincoln</persName> was President. Beneath this Dome, the remarkable panoramic painting
                  of major American events from <placeName>Columbus</placeName>'s landing to the Civil War, was completed after his death in 1865. Directly
                  below that chamber is the crypt that would have been prepared for <placeName>George Washington</placeName> who refused to be buried on the
                  Capitol grounds, insisting instead on being buried in his native <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName>. Beneath it is
                  Statuary Hall where each State is represented by those personalities deemed by the State Legislatures to represent some of the best and the
                  brightest. To the east and the west are the lawns where presidents have been inaugurated: to the east is where <persName>John
                     Kennedy</persName> stood and delivered the famous address that school children now recite; to the west is where <persName>Ronald
                     Reagan</persName> broke tradition and was inaugarated as president, followed recently by <persName corresp="#viaf_71559485">George
                     Bush</persName>. The gardens that <persName>President Bush</persName> looked down upon were designed by <persName>Olmsted</persName>
                  who also did the work at Central Park in <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and who also happens to
                  have done the magnificent design at the <persName>Audubon Zoo</persName> in my home in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The art work contained in the House of Representatives and the Senate is virtually unparalleled. The brass and marble work is unlike anything
                  elsewhere. Unfortunately much of this grandeur is lost through improper or deficient lighting. There are magnificent oils that you cannot even
                  see as you go up the chamber steps to turn in to vote. I think the 4 million Americans who tour the Capitol every summer should have an
                  opportunity to see it better and in a finer state of repair.</p>
               <p>So I salute <persName>Senator Byrd</persName> who used 50 years of legislative experience and his intimate knowledge of parliamentary
                  procedure to get the money to allow millions of people to see an impressive national treasure. I would like to see this commemorative issue
                  much more readily accepted by the American people. What is wrong with Congress, always in the public view, is also what is right with
                  Congress. The deficiencies of the people who serve in the Senate or the House are nothing more than a reflection of the fact that for 200
                  years people have directly participated in Government. The House of Representatives is in fact a microcosm of the American people. It is what
                     <persName corresp="#viaf_59096754">James Madison</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_49254995">John Jay</persName>, and <persName corresp="#viaf_66496514">Alexander Hamilton</persName> intended it to be 200 years ago when they set its boundaries geographically
                  in the Constitution and when they set its boundaries politically in that same document. In the Ladies Caucus Room is a bench where <persName corresp="#viaf_95296943">John Quincy Adams</persName>, the only President of the <placeName>United States</placeName> ever to
                  return to Congress as a member of the House of Representatives, stood in 1848 to make an impassioned speech regarding the <pb n="110"/>
                  despicable practice of slavery in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. Suffering a heart attack, he collapsed; he
                  was carried on that bench into the open room, where he died, by three lawyers who served in that Congress of 1848. One of them made the plaque
                  still displayed there‚Äîhis name was <persName corresp="#viaf_4944460">Daniel Webster</persName>. Another helped carry the crypt‚Äîhis name
                  was <persName>Henry Clay</persName>. The third was a Congressman from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4896861">Illinois</placeName>
                  named <persName corresp="#viaf_76349832">Abraham Lincoln</persName>.</p>
               <p>This is the heritage that goes into the issuance of these coins and the symbols that are placed upon them; but unlike any other museum in the
                  world, its collecting history continues each and every day. It is an evolving and continually growing museum; a political thought process that
                  is unparalleled on the face of the earth. There in small gold letters as you enter to vote in the House of Representatives is a single phrase
                  reading: "We have built a Capitol not a Palace, we consult no oracle but the Constitution." With all its frailties and all its faults, it is
                  still the most extraordinary political institution in the history of the thoughts of man. I deem it worth a few dollars on a coin.</p>

            <p>All reflections on life and history result in a mixture of happiness and sadness, and so it is with the subject of this paper. The first decades
               of this century were the last to see circulating gold coinage, when people still had the pleasure, even the tactile pleasure, of using gold coins
               on an everyday basis. How dreary by comparison are our present clad or "sandwich" coins, their original intrinsic qualities cheapened by mass
               production and recurrent inflation.<ref target="CH7-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Even a silver coin offers great aesthetic rewards. The older it becomes the more beautiful the patina; the more hands it passes through, the more
               brilliant the highlights of the relief. For these reasons I often regret that the <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George
                  Washington</persName> silver half dollar I designed in 1982 was only a commemorative issue, designed for a plastic-encased existence.</p>
            <p>Gold coins had practical advantages as well. In those days before World War I they gave everyone with a few gold coins in his pocket monetary
               freedom of movement, since gold was the universal currency. We did regain that freedom of unencumbered travel half a century later thanks to a
               different and not very aesthetically pleasing form of money‚Äîthe plastic card. Will there come a time when the American Numismatic Society
               maintains here a collection of credit cards, or even plastic legal tender cards?</p>
            <p>It is no coincidence, in my opinion, that the last good circulating coins were produced in what appears also to have been the last truly
               civilized period of our century. These coins came into being in that period before World War I through an extraordinarily fortuitous
               circumstance: a president's almost obsessive intention to give his compatriots a magnificent new coinage, and the personal relationship of that
               president, <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName>, with one of the greatest sculptors of the period, <persName>Augustus
                  Saint-Gaudens</persName>.</p>
            <p>Whatever one might say or think of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' coins, to appreciate fully the magnitude of his achievement one must
               look back, however briefly, to the gold coins of the late nineteenth century. Among the coins which continued to be struck until 1907 and which
               remained in circulation along with the new Double Eagles and Eagles by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> (figs. <ref target="#fig-49">1</ref>-<ref target="#fig-50">2</ref>) until 1933 is the <persName>James B. Longacre</persName> Double Eagle <ref target="#fig-51">(fig.
                  3)</ref>, first issued in 1849; its design was based on the 1839 Eagle by <persName>Christian Gobrecht</persName>. He in turn had based
               his design on the Half Eagle of <persName>William Kneass</persName>, who had redesigned <persName>John Reich's</persName> Liberty head
               of 1807. In short, despite a number of minor alterations, the basic composition had not changed for a hundred years, and it is no wonder that a
               president like <persName>Roosevelt</persName> wanted to change the nation's coinage.</p>
            <p>Comparison shows at once how iconoclastic <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' ap- <pb n="113"/> proach had been: the break with tradition is
               drastic, as if to form part of the artistic revolution that erupted in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> after the turn
               of the century. A common thread is the searching mentality and the desire to stretch established conventions‚Äîwhere possible, to discard them
               entirely. Yet in this case the goal had to be and was achieved by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> within the one inescapable
               limitation‚Äîthat of the circular format.</p>

            <p>Even devotees of nineteenth-century coins admit that the <persName>Longacre</persName> coin is static in style; the <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> design is full of movement and vigor, radiating the hope of a new age. The most obvious contrast is the surface, almost
               entirely filled, in which the symbolic elements appear in a narrative context rather than in the isolation of nineteenth-century coins. A closer
               look at the model that <persName>Longacre</persName> used, the Eagle by <persName>Christian Gobrecht</persName> issued from 1839
               through 1907 <ref target="#fig-52">(fig 4)</ref>, shows how slight are the differences in <pb n="114"/> proportions of the head, the treatment of
               the hair with the added beads, or the size of the date. Such trifling changes could do little to improve <persName>Gobrecht</persName>'s
               uninspired attempt to perpetuate at the Mint the imported Empire style of the Napoleonic era.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>One might also allude to English neoclassicist traditions, even in such mundane manifestations as postage stamps with portraits of the then-young
                  <persName corresp="#viaf_95738652">Queen Victoria</persName>
               <ref target="#fig-53">(fig. 5)</ref>. Our coins of 1839 and 1840, which follow closely upon her coronation in 1837, seem to appropriate her young
               idealized profile, turned leftward, with upswept hair. It is as if our young republic was now embarrassed by the earlier rendition of Liberty in
               Phrygian cap and drapery, looking, in the words of <persName>Cornelius Vermeule</persName>, like "a milkmaid on her way to the fair."<ref target="CH7-n2">2</ref> The replacement was an altogether more regal image, which included a diadem or coronet enhancing the head as well as
               ever more elaborate hair styles. This coronet type remained essentially unchanged and was minted from 1839 to 1907; as <persName>David
                  Bowers</persName> has observed, this was the longest lifespan of an unrevised design of any coin in American history.<ref target="CH7-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>What is true of the obverses is also true of the reverses. Thus the Eagle and the Half Eagle share the same design, based on the 1807 reverse by
                  <persName>John Reich</persName>, adapted through the decades to various obverses (figs. <ref target="#fig-54">6</ref>-<ref target="#fig-55">7</ref>). The only noticeable difference between the Eagle and the Half Eagle appears to be the size and thickness of the
               lettering. One wonders whether this conservatism was the result of a young republic's desire to establish its own traditions (including the
               laudable one of prohibiting the likenesses of living individuals) or just the indifference of a commerce-oriented society for which coinage had
               only a utilitarian significance.</p>
            <p>Victoria's long reign ended with her death in 1901, a date of symbolic significance since it was also the year in which <persName>Roosevelt</persName>‚Äîthe youngest president ever at 42 years‚Äîentered upon his first term with an explosion of vitality and optimism appropriate
               to the new century. <persName>Roosevelt</persName>'s extraordinary energy permitted him not only <pb n="115"/> to attend to political issues
               of the day, but to focus on the redesign of a coinage representative of another era.</p>
            <p>In the eyes of the public the change must have appeared dramatic when at last the new coins were issued in 1907. The continuation of the older
               issues in circulation meant that both designs were constantly before the public eye. The contrast between the reverses was just as striking as
               that between the obverses. <persName>Longacre's</persName> heraldic eagle, which had been in existence since 1849, is very decorative, but
               in such a balanced way that it is actually quite elegant <ref target="#fig-56">(fig. 8)</ref>. The first version of the <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> reverse with its flying eagle does not yet carry the legend In God We Trust, which appears in subsequent issues after it
               was imposed by law in 1908 as a permanent fixture on all <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> coins.</p>

            <p>The creation of the new coinage of 1907 not only involved two illustrious protagonists but thanks to their correspondence it also remains one of
               the most vividly documented episodes in our numismatic history. The letters reveal <persName>Roosevelt's</persName> and <persName>Saint-Gaudens'</persName> mutual understanding and growing friendship, as well as a rare case of collaboration between artist and statesman.<ref target="CH7-n4">4</ref> In the spring of 1901 the sculptor was asked to join the Commission for the Improvement of the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>, and thereafter frequently saw the ten-year-younger <persName>Roosevelt</persName>. The Vice President was
               also familiar with <persName>Saint-Gaudens'</persName> work. After having seen his sculptures on view at the Pan-American Exposition in
               Buffalo in May 1901, he had lunch with <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> on the train trip back, an experience he described as "great
               fun."</p>
            <p>After <persName>McKinley's</persName> assassination in September, <persName>Roosevelt</persName> became President, and by Executive
               Order made <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, together with Frederick Law Olmsted and the architects <persName>Daniel
                  Burnham</persName> and <persName>Charles McKim</persName>, consultants to the Board of Public Buildings. <persName>Roosevelt</persName>
               referred to this select group as his "art cabinet," and as such it represents a direct antecedent to today's Fine Arts Commission. After the
               election of 1904, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was asked by the Citizens' Inaugural Committee to design the President-elect's portrait
               medal <ref target="#fig-57">(fig. 9)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The modeling was entrusted to one of his principal assistants, <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Adolph Weinman</persName>, who would later
               win the 1916 competition for new dime and half dollar designs. <persName>Saint-Gaudens'</persName> work on <persName>Roosevelt's</persName> portrait must have deepened their relationship and helped to direct the President's thoughts toward the renewal of the
               country's coinage.</p>
            <p>Two days after Christmas 1904, the President made his first, slightly conspiratorial move, writing to Secretary of the <persName>Treasury Leslie M. Shaw</persName>: <q>I think our coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. Would it be possible, without asking
                  permission of Congress, to employ a man like <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to give us a coinage that would have some beauty?<ref target="CH7-n5">5</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Within three weeks <persName>Roosevelt</persName> had advanced the matter enough to tell Shaw: <q>Of course he is to be given an absolutely
                  free hand...it is of the utmost importance that the artist should be left absolutely unhampered in working out the design and execution of the
                  coin or medal. I do not wish there to be the slightest interference with <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> in connection with the
                  coinage from its artistic side.<ref target="CH7-n6">6</ref>
               </q>

            <p>This statement‚Äîsurprisingly sensitive to the dichotomy inherent in mass-producing works of art‚Äîmust have been music to the artist's ears. It
               certainly is so to the few in the service of today's government, which has lost the capacity to understand creative processes and to take such a
               truly humanistic attitude towards art. What a contrast to the inevitable mass production schedules of today's mint, and their often nearly
               impossible deadlines, which have to be met just to get models to the marketing agents, literally before the plaster is dry. <persName>Saint-Gaudens'</persName> son Homer remembered: "To accomplish this result [the obverse and the reverse of the Double Eagle] my father altered
               and realtered the coins for a year and a half." Specifically about the reverse he writes, "in all, he created 70 models of this bird, and often
               stood twenty-five of them in a row for visitors to number according to preference."<ref target="CH7-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever time and effort it took, the result is indeed our most majestic coin, if not the most sculptural in all modern coinage. On display in
               one of the mint's hallways is a twelve-inch bronze cast of the Double Eagle's obverse. Every so often I run my fingers over the high relief of
               the standing Liberty, and indeed the relief is so pronounced, so sensuously sculptural, that the loss of this quality <pb n="118"/> in the course
               of the coin's execution will always be regrettable. But the problems that such relief presents in coining are hard to solve except by reducing
               its height. They remained after <persName>Saint-Gaudens'</persName> death a source of frustration for <persName>Henry
               Hering</persName>, the assistant who made the revised plaster casts.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> described his ideas regarding the emerging design in a letter to <persName>Roosevelt</persName> in
               November 1905: <q>...on the other side I would place a (possibly winged) figure of liberty [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] striding energetically
                  forward as if on a mountain top holding aloft on one arm a shield bearing the Stars and Stripes with the words Liberty marked across the
                  field, in the other hand perhaps a flaming torch. The drapery would be blowing in the breeze. My idea is to make it a living thing and typical
                  of progress.<ref target="CH7-n8">8</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>However much <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> succeeded in making the design a "living thing," for the source of his inspiration he could
               not but <pb n="119"/> go back to antiquity. This was also in accord with <persName>Roosevelt's</persName> virtual dictate that the <placeName>United States</placeName> was to get a coinage that would rival that of ancient Greece. It is worth taking a closer look at the
               now-familiar image of the obverse to get the full measure of the prototype's transformation and the resulting innovation.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> broke with the neo-classicist tradition of the eighteenth century by abandoning the abstract plane of the
               empty background. Moreover, he ignored the antique convention of presenting relief figures in side views. In response to <persName>Roosevelt's</persName> request for coins with the highest possible relief, his Liberty appears in a frontal posture that clearly implies
               three-dimensionality. At the same time this posture also imparts spatial depth to the background: Liberty is to be perceived as having ascended
               the summit. This effect becomes even more obvious in comparison with her famous antecedent, the Victory of Samothrace <ref target="#fig-58">(fig.
                  10)</ref>, which was meant to have descended from the sky onto the prow of a ship. Her torso still convincingly displays the violence of the
               arrested movement.</p>
            <p>There can be little doubt that this hellenistic sculpture had made a profound impression on <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>‚Äîprobably the
               more so as he had first seen it at the age of 19 in 1867, only four years after it had entered the Louvre. When <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> himself took up the subject of a walking Victory as part of the Sherman monument for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, he was again in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, living and
               working there from 1897 to 1900.</p>
            <p>Yet the Liberty of the Double Eagle is not just a variation on a hellenistic theme, but a complex and involved composition. The posture, for
               example, still conforms to the classic canon of the fourth century B.C. as to which leg should carry the weight or which arm should be
               outstretched. In her motion the Liberty occupies an intermediate stage. The hellenistic figure is all movement, the body's forceful motion
               appears independent and directed against the equally forceful counter-motion of the many-folded garment. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>
               has his Liberty make steady moves upward, maintaining her poise from step to step. Her hair and dress‚Äîa Greek chiton‚Äîare billowing in what is
               obviously a calmer breeze. With her right arm she holds up the torch‚Äîmore precisely, she presents the flame of freedom to the people for them to
               guard eternally, if they are to enjoy the prize of peace. She promises that peace with the olive branch held in her laterally extended left
               arm.</p>
            <p>Among sources of inspiration for <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> is the famous <hi rend="italic">Liberty Leading the People</hi> of 1830
               by Eug√®ne Delacroix <ref target="#fig-59">(fig. 11)</ref>. The importance of this painting, which in our day has acquired the status of an icon,
               will not have escaped <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>. In particular the ascending movement of the young woman to the top of the taken
               barricade may have played a role in his own composition.</p>

            <pb n="121"/>
            <p>Delacroix's Liberty also represents one of those iconographically interesting transitions from the Nike/Victory goddess of antiquity to the
               modern, more mortal personifications of Liberty. As one would expect, she loses some of her divine qualities. In <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' design process, she quite literally loses her wings <ref target="#fig-60">(fig. 12)</ref>.</p>
            <p>Even <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' contemporaries observed that "none of his predecessors had recognized the possibilities of low
               relief; he revealed them."<ref target="CH7-n9">9</ref> His approach‚Äîto fill the field of a coin with elements of sufficient substance to render
               it a miniature bas-relief‚Äîis equally evident on the reverse of the Double Eagle. Although its relatively larger elements make the composition of
               this side less a tour-deforce of scale, "the eagle in flight against the sun...achieves complete domination of motion and expanding vista over
               the confines of a tiny tondo."<ref target="CH7-n10">10</ref> There was, incidentally, the precedent of a realistically rendered flying eagle,
               which <persName>Gobrecht</persName> had designed for a silver dollar in 1839 and which, in its later <persName>Longacre</persName>
               reincarnation of 1857, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> is said to have much admired.</p>
            <p>Before his death in 1907, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> had only been able to fulfill <persName>Roosevelt's</persName> second
               request for a new Eagle coin, which some consider even a greater achievement. Before discussing the coin itself, however, I should like to relate
               my personal encounter with one if its manifestations. On assuming my position as Chief Engraver in 1981, I was given the usual tour of the mint
               premises and shown the vault, which is the Chief Sculptor and Engraver's exclusive responsibility. This vault contains not only current work, but
               also fascinating pieces of history: dies and hubs going back to the turn of the century, including many made for various foreign governments. The
               hidden treasures I discovered afterward were a couple of shoe boxes filled with copper patterns of the last century, and nearby, to my pleasure,
               bronze castings of the obverse and reverse of <persName>Saint-Gaudens'</persName> Eagle. I also want to mention another pair of castings,
               not just because they were of one of my favorite coins, the Buffalo nickel, but because its designer, <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName>, had been a principal assistant of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>.</p>
            <p>All these relics I had properly mounted and hung on the then-bare walls of my office. While this collection serves its invaluable study purpose
               and, I might add, acts as a constant reminder of the artistic standards every Chief Sculptor and Engraver should endeavor to reach, I have also
               wondered whether it should not be made accessible to a larger public and placed in proper curatorial care, such as only a museum can provide.</p>
            <pb n="122"/>
            <p>Whether as a consequence of familiarity or of its perfection, one always has to take a second look to be reminded how unusual the image on the
               Eagle obverse is in its combination of idealized Greek beauty and native American symbol. <persName>Saint-Gaudens'</persName> model had
               originally been designed as a Victory head, intended for alternative versions of other pieces in the series. <persName>Roosevelt</persName>,
               however, had a different idea: he wanted an Indian feather headdress applied to the female profile on the obverse of the Eagle.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Roosevelt's</persName> enthusiasm for the proposed design matched his delight in the Double Eagle piece. In a complimentary letter
               to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> he remarks, "of course, all the designs are conventional, when embodied in a woman's head, and I don't
               see why we should not have a conventional headdress of purely American type for the Liberty figure." And in a subsequent letter he reiterates his
               argument: <q>Really, the feather head-dress can be treated as being the conventional cap of Liberty quite as much as if it was the Phrygian cap;
                  and, after all, it is <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Liberty not what the ancient Greeks and Romans miscalled by that title‚Äîand we are entitled to
                  a typically American head-dress for the lady.<ref target="CH7-n11">11</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The bronze cast that I have hanging on my wall is a rather rough casting of the Eagle's final version, that is with the date 1907 instead of the
               word Liberty inscribed at the base. In studying the cast I am always surprised by the contrast between the modeling of the head, the stars and
               numerals, and on the other hand the rendering of the feathers and the word Liberty. The former elements are quite clearly defined‚Äîthe edge of the
               profile more than the surface modulation of the face itself, while the feathers are treated with such subtlety that they seem to fade into the
               background, except for a few more detailed ones interspersed here and there.</p>
            <p>What <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> achieved was to create volume without mass, to use a sweeping shape, which in the most elegant way
               follows the contour of the coin, to fill entirely one quarter section of the circle. It is obvious that the nineteenth-century formulas have been
               abandoned for good, not so much in the overall asymmetry of the design as in the less visible tension with the symmetrical parts of the
               composition. The row of stars is regular, the date is positioned axially under the beveled truncation of the neck, which functions almost as a
               pedestal supporting a beautiful sculpture. In its profile the head shows a most striking resemblance with the face of Delacroix's Liberty; the
               lower half from the nostrils and the short upper lip down to the curve of the chin is almost identical.</p>
            <p>The so-called standing or perched eagle of the reverse is con- <pb n="123"/> sidered one of the most powerful incarnations of the heraldic animal
               on a coin. It had evolved from previous designs by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, most directly from the eagle on the reverse of his
               inaugural medal for <persName>Roosevelt</persName>. Similar eagles appear as three- dimensional sculptures as early as 1893, on either side
               of the Shaw memorial where they clearly allude to their ancestry from those proudly perching eagles of <placeName>Ptolemaic Egypt</placeName>.
               Looking at the enlarged obverse and reverse next to each other on the wall of my office I am always surprised by the difference in the modeling
               of the two sides. The relief is much higher on the reverse, the eagle's musculature solidly present beneath the extremely detailed feathers.</p>
            <p>Already in 1791 <persName corresp="#viaf_66496514">Alexander Hamilton</persName> addressed the emblematic aspects of coinage in a report to
               the House of Representatives.<ref target="CH7-n12">12</ref> Although he considered the Eagle a not very expressive or apt appellation for the
               largest gold pieces, he concluded that there was nothing better. He had the acumen to observe, "the fewer sharp points and angles there are, the
               less will be the loss by wearing." Thus, to quote <persName>Vermeule</persName>, "from the beginning of the full national coinage, technical
               problems were deemed on a par with, or superior to, aesthetic considerations."<ref target="CH7-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>I agree with <persName>Vermeule</persName>'s assessment of the historical record, but I do not accept the implied principle that technical
               problems ought to be given superior consideration. The obverse of my Statue of Liberty five dollar gold piece is a case where the design
               intentions met the technical requirements by anticipating rather than yielding to their limitations. I knew full well that the relief of the
               original model and the final reduction hub had to be kept to an extremely low tolerance (measured in ten thousandths of an inch down from the
               highest elevation, the tip of Liberty's nose), and I took these constraints into account in the conceptual as well as the development stages of
               my design. During the actual modeling I could rely on a plaster basin, supplied by the Department of Technology, which had such a high-precision
               curvature that the measurements I took over and over again were bound to be absolutely precise (figs. <ref target="#fig-61">13</ref>-<ref target="#fig-62">14</ref>). Thus I was able, throughout the design process, to avoid compromising my artistic standards by accommodating the
               technical demands of today's mass production.</p>
            <p>Obviously in an ideal world the Department of Technology would provide whatever means an artist's innovative design might require for its
               execution. But what ought to be possible even under present conditions is the sort of collaboration that occurred in this case and which brought
               recognition to the participants: the Statue of Liberty five dollar gold coin was given the rare MS-70 status for its <pb n="124"/> technical
               perfection, and the International Coin of the Year Award for its artistic merits <ref target="#fig-63">(fig. 15)</ref>.</p>

            <p>I had one advantage over <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> or his assistants <persName>Pratt</persName>, <persName>Fraser</persName>, and <persName>Weinman</persName> (all of whom created outstanding coin designs): I was not forced to work as an outsider
               in the process of adapting my coin designs for production. I was able to learn inside the mint what limitations are involved in the manufacture
               of coins. Still the history of coinage in this country would be much less impressive, or at least less varied, were it not for the work of
               outsiders, such as the famous (or, immediately after issue, infamous) Half Eagle by <persName>Bela Lyon Pratt</persName>
               <ref target="#fig-54">(fig. 16)</ref>.</p>
            <p>At <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>' death the new series of coins envisioned by the President remained incomplete. The two additional
               pieces are known as the Bigelow-Pratt coins, because <persName>Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow</persName>, a friend of <persName>Roosevelt</persName>, had not only suggested Pratt for the execution, but also advocated use of the incuse technique. <persName>Bela
                  Lyon Pratt</persName>, who had been a principal assistant of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> and gained a reputation of his own, decided
               nevertheless to retain the same images and compositions as the Eagle coin. While he probably did this in tribute to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, he deviated from the precedent in two important respects: one was the technique of incuse carving, reminiscent of
               Egyptian mural reliefs; the other was the exceptional realism of the obverse.</p>
            <p>The Indian head looks indeed as if a photograph had been transferred mechanically to the surface of the coin. Not surprisingly it was much
               criticized as lacking in beauty: the Indian looked emaciated, and was not at all the noble savage of the <persName>James Fenimore
                  Cooper</persName>
               <pb n="125"/> tradition. But to me it is a very strong and convincing portrait; in view of contemporary tendencies toward beautification, one can
               only admire <persName>Pratt's</persName> courage in producing such an unorthodox image. This gold piece in fact marks the transition from
               the idealized Indian head of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to the rugged characterization on the Buffalo nickel of 1912 by <persName corresp="#viaf_46689449">James Earle Fraser</persName>.</p>
            <p>With <persName>Pratt's</persName> homage to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> ends the great period of circulating gold coinage. No
               new designs were added before the banking crisis of 1933 forced the other President <persName>Roosevelt</persName> to take the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> off the gold standard and prohibit the ownership and use of gold. In fact most of the 70
               million <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> Double Eagles were melted down, over 22 million at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> mint alone in 1934.</p>
            <p>A world war and three decades had to pass before, in 1975, once again the precious metal was allowed to circulate in all forms (except, of
               course, regular coinage). The Kr√ºggerrand had been introduced to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> in 1967 and now
               became ubiquitous in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName>, a coveted market that prompted an increasing number of
               nations to produce bullion coins. Finally, in 1980 the U.S. took tentative steps to issue her own gold bullion variety in the form of a series of
               half-ounce and one-ounce medals. Called the American Arts Commemorative Medallion, this attempt was unsuccessful, because the bullion buyers
               preferred legal tender coins. Thus the newly-established Gold Commission met twice in 1981 to consider the state of affairs, and after its second
               meeting in September there was talk about the production of gold bullion coins.</p>

            <p>I mention these developments because their chronology obviously had an influence on the design of our first bullion coin <ref target="#fig-65">(fig. 17)</ref>. After my staff and I were notified that the Double Eagle obverse by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was to be used
               again for the obverse of the planned <pb n="126"/> bullion issue, we were somewhat startled to learn that the design of a sculptor from <placeName>Texas</placeName>, <placeName>Miley Busiek</placeName>, had been chosen for the reverse. I had heard about her "Family of Eagles"
               concept personally, for she had telephoned me at the office shortly after my appointment as Chief Sculptor and Engraver in the autumn of
               1981.</p>
            <p>We came to know each other quite well over the years, since she had continued her interest in coins and medals. But it was only recently, in
               connection with this presentation, that I asked her how she had the idea to submit a design for the reverse of the future bullion coin. She
               responded, rather bemusedly, "I was on an airplane and saw an article in the <hi rend="italic">Wall Street Journal</hi> about the Gold Commission
               and their deliberations. So I wrote them and asked for the reports on those meetings, and that was the beginning of it all." Her success involved
               not only the execution of her design, but an extensive and persistent lobbying effort probably never undertaken by any earlier artist. At the end
               of our conversation she said, "You see, one person really can make a difference."</p>
            <p>The Chief Sculptor and Engraver was not consulted concerning the obverse, nor do I wish to comment now on the decision to reuse the <placeName>Saint-Gaudens</placeName> design. But it was obvious from the beginning that the original had to be adapted to current mass production
               requirements, as well as to the specific demands of proof coins and fractional denominations. In my mind the technical and artistic aspects were
               once again in conflict. In particular, the proof polishing would necessarily eviscerate the sculptural qualities of <placeName>Saint-Gaudens'</placeName> coin, as its execution requires extreme precision of design. The stars not only had to be increased in number, but made
               exactly alike; the sun's rays not only had to be strengthened, but made geometrically precise. Other details had to be adjusted, such as the foot
               of Liberty on the rock, which even in <placeName>Saint-Gaudens'</placeName> Double Eagle had been the most difficult part of the die to
               fill.</p>
            <p>The most damaging and least essential interference with <placeName>Saint-Gaudens'</placeName> original, in my eyes and those of others
               including members of the Fine Arts Commission, was the slimming-down of Liberty. My staff and I first took this for a joke until we realized that
               it was, indeed, an order from above. Perhaps I am simply too sensitive about the inviolabilty of a great artist's work, or perhaps I am just too
               great an admirer of <placeName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</placeName>, for my objections are not shared by everyone.</p>
            <p>The new bullion coins fell short of their promise, but unpredictability of demand has always determined the fate of commemorative coins. This is
               a subject that I can touch on only briefly here.</p>

            <p>The first commemorative gold coins of this century were the gold dollars struck in 1902 and 1903 in connection with the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> Purchase Exposition in <persName>St. Louis</persName>
               <ref target="#fig-66">(fig. 18)</ref>. Offered at a premium of $3, the coins were not popular and many were melted down. The same happened to the
               gold dollars authorized by Congress to commemorate the <persName>Lewis</persName> and <persName>Clark</persName> Exposition in 1904
                  <ref target="#fig-67">(fig. 19)</ref>. It is not difficult to see why these coins failed to sell: as souvenirs they were too expensive, and as
               collectors's items they had little aesthetic appeal.</p>

            <p>In celebration of the 1915 <placeName>Panama-Pacific</placeName> Exposition, three gold coins were issued, and the $50 coin <ref target="#fig-68">(fig. 20)</ref>, designed by <persName>Robert Aitken</persName>, is a good example of <placeName>Saint-Gaudens'</placeName> impact on the design of commemorative coins. They are not only more artistically conceived, they are stylistically in
               step with the period, most notably <pb n="128"/> in the graphic reinterpretation of Greek motifs such as the helmeted Athena with her attendant
               owl of wisdom. In the octagonal version the added spaces at the edge were filled with dolphins, a direct reference to the coins of ancient
               Syracuse. In spite of their considerable aesthetic merits and their relatively small edition, even these coins were not a success.</p>
            <p>As a result of the 1933 legislation the U.S. did not see another commemorative coin until 1982, when the Bicentennial of <persName>George Washington's</persName> birth prompted the issue of a silver half dollar. Its instant popularity opened the door for subsequent
               commemorative series. The Olympic Eagle of 1984, minted at <placeName>West Point</placeName>, was the first <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold piece issued in over 50 years. In size, weight and fineness it is identical with the last <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> Eagles coined in 1933. No competitions were yet being held, and only the Mint's engraving staff submitted
               drawings for final selection by the Secretary of the Treasury. I did not submit a proposal, as I had already designed the Olympic Silver Dollar
               of the previous year. The design chosen for the Eagle obverse had been conceived by <persName>James Peed</persName>, head of the Exhibits
               and Art Department at the Mint head-quarters, and adapted for production by <persName>John Mercanti</persName>, an engraver at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint, whose own submission provided the heraldic eagle for the
               reverse <ref target="#fig-69">(fig. 21)</ref>.</p>

            <p>Collectors and critics alike considered the Olympic coins of mediocre artistic quality, and a congressional hearing was held to look into the
               selection and approval process. This was followed by ever more frequent public demands‚Äîespecially from the country's community of medallic
               artists but also from members of the Fine Arts Commission‚Äîfor the reinstatement of the competitions that had been customary as recently as the
               1930s. The generally excellent results of those years owed much to the procedures that <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> had helped to
               introduce. As a member of various commis- <pb n="129"/> sions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> he was also "a
               frequent juror and gave advice in connection with a number of commissions for monumental sculpture for the government. Through these efforts he
               was able to help establish <hi rend="italic">the principle that such competitions be judged by a jury of peers‚Äîother artists and
               sculptors</hi>‚Äîand assured that the participants would be given monetary awards for the time and effort spent to enter such competitions [italics
                  mine].<ref target="CH7-n14">14</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Bicentennial of the Constitution in 1987, which was to be celebrated by the striking of a silver dollar and a Half Eagle, offered the first
               occasion for an invited competition in which outside artists as well as the Mint's staff participated. The Half Eagle was won by the renowned
               medalist and sculptor <persName>Marcel Jovine</persName>
               <ref target="#fig-70">(fig. 22)</ref>. That there is a quill on both faces was not his original intention, but in the final selection the design
               he had submitted for the silver dollar reverse, which showed a quill in the center, was combined with the obverse of his Eagle design. As a
               result the coin shows not only a redundancy of symbols but an ambiguity as to which side is obverse or reverse. Still, <persName>Jovine</persName> produced an original design by marrying abstraction and naturalism in the treatment of the eagle.</p>

            <p>While mismatching the designs for obverse and reverse against the artist's intentions is questionable enough, what is worse is the "mix and
               match" that combines obverse and reverse designs of different artists, especially two artists so distinctive as <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_56857083">Charles Barber</persName>. <persName>Don Taxay</persName> gives the
               following account of that regrettable episode: <q>
                  <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> first contact with the Mint developed during 1891, when he served on a committee to judge coin
                  designs submitted through public competition. Subsequently, he was asked to design the 1892 Columbian Exposition medal. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> accepted the commission with misgivings, which, as it turned out, were fully justified: for after considerable delay,
                  the artist was informed that his obverse had been combined with a reverse supplied by the Mint's own engraver, <persName corresp="#viaf_56857083">Charles Barber</persName>. Thereafter, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> avoided the Mint.<ref target="CH7-n15">15</ref>

            <p>The commemorative coins issued to support the American athletes participating in the 1988 Olympic games held in Seoul were also the outcome of an
               invited competition among 12 outside artists and the engravers of the Mint. I found the subject matter rather awkward, so I decided to enter a
               head of the Greek goddess Nike, or Victory, which was not only appropriate to the occasion but was a welcome excuse for an excursion into
               antiquity. I was required to place the word Liberty on the obverse, and I decided to make it large enough that it would assert itself as a design
               element. In any case I felt the games ought to stand for the freedom of all nations to participate. Not wanting to diminish the prominence of
               this element I incised in minute lettering the other required legend, In God We Trust, on the victor's ribbon emerging from her hair <ref target="#fig-71">(fig. 23)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The reverse was designed by <persName>Marcel Jovine</persName>, with a stylized rendition of the Olympic flame as its central motif <ref target="#fig-72">(fig. 24)</ref>. His original drawing had the five Olympic rings following the coin's edge; our Olympic officials insisted
               that the rings appear in their standard logo form, i.e. interlocking in two parallel rows. More unfortunate was the international Olympic
               committee's ruling that the letters <placeName>USA</placeName> had to be placed inside the rings. Although the mint pressed the point that the
               inscription <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States of America</placeName> already appeared along the lower edge, the Committee
               could not be persuaded to abandon its legalistic position.</p>
            <p>The letters within the graphic symbol together with all the other inscriptions mandated by law contributed only clutter to the artist's basic
               idea. There is in fact one option to unclutter coins (though it is considered unaffordable nowadays): transferring one of the four mandatory
               inscriptions from the surface to the edge of the coin. Edge lettering is still practiced abroad, and was so here until 1933, as the <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> Double Eagle carried the inscription E Pluribus Unum around the edge. In the adaptation of his design for
               the gold bullion coin the inscription was moved from the edge to the already letter- saturated reverse.</p>
            <p>With bicentennial celebrations following on one another's heels, <pb n="131"/> the 1989 Bicentennial of the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> Congress was the most recent occasion for a commemorative issue. The genesis of this issue, in all its fascinating political
               details, is the subject of an article by Representative <persName>James A. Hayes</persName> appearing elsewhere in this publication.</p>
            <p>One point I hope to have made here is not only that we owe to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> two of our artistically most outstanding
               coins. Through his influence, both direct and indirect, all subsequent <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> coins gained a
               level of artistic quality unprecedented in our history and rarely reached by any other country in this century and ultimately not even diminished
               by the debased materials used for today's coinage.</p>
            <p>No single factor accounted for the deep and lasting influence of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>, but its origin may be traced to one
               cause: the historic encounter and personal relationship of two great men with vision. Will there‚Äîcan there ever be again a moment when the
               president has a dialogue with an artist on the subject of coinage?</p>
