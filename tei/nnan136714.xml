            <p>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">Jenny Lind</hi>, the famous <persName>prima donna</persName>, was born at <placeName corresp="#geonames_2673730">Stockholm</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</placeName>, October 6th, 1820, in
               comparatively humble circumstances. She received her dramatic education and early training at the Musical School of the Royal Theatre, where she
               made her debut in 1838, singing the important r�le of <persName>Agatha</persName> in Weber's <hi rend="italic">Freisch�tz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the following six years she appeared with marked success in <placeName corresp="#geonames_660013">Finland</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</placeName>, <placeName>Germany</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Her first great triumph, however, was achieved in 1844 at the <placeName>Court Theatre</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_berlin">Berlin</placeName>, where owing to <persName>Meyerbeer's</persName> influence she had been engaged.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>On the 18th of February, 1847, occurred in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</placeName> the memorable performance of <persName>Meyerbeer's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Vielka</persName>.</hi> The chief r�le in this opera had been expressly written for <persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind</persName>, and at the final fall of the curtain a graceful compliment awaited her. <persName>Radnitzky</persName>, on behalf of
               the music lovers of <persName>Vienna</persName>, had designed an appropriate and finely conceived medal I (see No. 17), which, struck in
               gold, was presented to the young Songstress, together with a scroll, encircled by a silver laurel wreath, bearing the signatures of leaders in
               the Viennese Art-world.</p>
            <p>The <persName>prima donna's</persName> noted <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> debut took place on May 4th of the
               same year. She had chosen the part of <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Alice</persName>
               </hi> in <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Roberto il Diavolo</persName>,</hi> one of her most successful r�les, and the crush caused by those who clamored to hear her is
               said to have been terrific. The Queen, the <persName>Prince Consort</persName>, the <persName>Queen Dowager</persName>, and other
               members of the Royal Family were present, as well as representatives from almost every important family in London. The entire performance appears
                  <pb n="3"/> to have called forth one long-sustained ovation.</p>
            <p>To mark this epochal event in <persName>Jenny Lind's</persName> career, an artistic medal was struck by <persName>Allen</persName> and
                  <persName>Moore</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName> (see No. 25).</p>
            <p>The following Spring, at the request of <persName corresp="#viaf_31969433">King Oscar I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</placeName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind</persName> returned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2673730">Stockholm</placeName>, the city which ay so close to her heart, for a brief engagement at the <placeName>Royal
                  Theatre</placeName>. She was to give eight concerts, only; the tickets were put up at auction, and the entire profits generously donated by her to
               the fund for the education and support of pupils of the <placeName>Royal Theatre School</placeName>. Thus did the Nightingale charmingly pay a
               debt of gratitude to the theatre which first gave her voice to the world.</p>
            <p>In June, 1848, she received a tribute illustrating in a remarkable manner the deep-felt affection of her co-patriots. A portrait medal (see No.
               1), dignified in conception and graceful in line—much the finest, in our opinion, of all the <persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny
                  Lind</persName> medals—was designed by the famous <pb n="4"/> Swedish medallist Quarnstrom, and struck in gold, in silver and in bronze at the
               Royal Mint. The medals were presented to the Songstress with an address signed by the <persName>King</persName>, the Royal Family, and
               almost every person of prominence in <placeName>Stockholm's</placeName> c�terie of Art and Music.</p>
            <p>These three medals were treasured by the recipient throughout her life, and were left to the <placeName>National Museum</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2673730">Stockholm</placeName>, where they now are.</p>
            <p>January 9th, 1850, was a most important day in the career of <persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind</persName>, since it was then she
               signed the contract for an <placeName>American</placeName> concert tour under <persName>P. T. Barnum's</persName> management; a venture
               which was to bring her fresh laurels and a substantial fortune.</p>
            <p>When we consider how she had set all <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> aflame; had been admitted to be the greatest of
               living singers by the first musical critics of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, <placeName>Prussia</placeName>,
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</placeName>, and even by a large portion of the critical press of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>; when we read how people fought to hear her in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>; how in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_berlin">Berlin</placeName>, <pb n="5"/> bouquets were thrown at her feet; how in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</placeName>, the students unhitched the horses of her carriage and drew her through the streets in
               triumph; how the <persName>Queen Dowager</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</placeName> opened her jewel casket
               that <persName>jenny</persName> might choose a souvenir; it is hard to believe that millions of <placeName>Americans</placeName> scarcely
               knew her name.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this, <persName>Mr. Barnum</persName> risked a guarantee of $187,500 before the prima donna set sail. But in his memoirs, he
               frankly and shrewdly explains his reasons for the venture,—which ultimately proved so enormously profitable: <q>"I may as well state, that
                  although I relied prominently upon <persName>Jenny Lind's</persName> reputation as a great musical <hi rend="italic">artiste,</hi> I also
                  took largely into my estimate of her success with all classes of the <placeName>American public</placeName>, her character for
                  extraordinary benevolence and generosity. Without this peculiarity in her disposition, I never would have dared make the engagement which I
                  did."</q>
            </p>
            <p>An observant reporter who interviewed <persName>Jenny</persName> about the time of her arrival in <pb n="6"/>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> furnishes us with a colorful word-picture of her charming appearance: <q>"Her
                  figure is commanding, her action majestic, and her voice the freshest and sweetest ever heard. Her face which is of an oval cast, has all the
                  characteristics of a Northern clime; and one can scarcely fail to recognize the unmistakable lineaments of birth and country. Though lacking
                  what the world calls 'beauty', her face is nevertheless extremely pleasing and strongly indicative of a pure and noble character which finds
                  expression in a clear open brow, an eye of peculiar brightness, and a sweet kind smile seems forever to linger around her small and well
                  formed mouth.</q>
               <q>"If we add to that, luxurious clusters of auburn hair, and hands and feet of extreme smallness, and beauty, you have a faint but in some
                  measure truthful sketch of sweet, charming, generous, <persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind</persName>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thousands of people are said to have covered the shipping and piers in the neighborhood of <placeName>Canal Street</placeName>, and the wharf
               was packed with wildly cheering humanity as the <hi rend="italic">S. S. Atlantic,</hi> which brought her, swung into its berth. The ever prompt
                  <persName>Mr. Barnum</persName> had already boarded the steamer by means of a <pb n="7"/> launch, and standing by the side of his noted
               visitor, benignly received his full share of the plaudits.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Mr. Nathaniel Parker Willis</persName>, Editor of the Home Journal, and quite a <hi rend="italic">beau</hi> of the period, no
               doubt was among the throng on the pier, for he describes <persName>Jenny's</persName> arrival in a good naturedly caustic paragraph: <q>"All
                  the stars in the Union have dimmed before the star of <persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind</persName>. She walked like a
                  conqueror from the ship to the dock-gates under an arcade of evergreens—and at its entrance the American eagle (stuffed) offered her flowers.
                  All New York hung around her chariot on its way to the <placeName>Irving House</placeName> where she was lodged like a princess; and at
                  midnight thirty thousand persons hovered about her hotel. At one in the morning, one hundred and fifty musicians came up to serenade her, led
                  by seven hundred firemen, to pump upon the enthusiasm, we suppose, in case it should get red hot."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The days that followed must have been exciting ones for the Songstress. Accustomed as she was to homage, the furore she created in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and in other <placeName>American cities</placeName> seems to have al-
                  <pb n="8"/> most swept her off her feet. Indeed, she soon was obliged to leave the <placeName>Irving House</placeName> and take lodgings in
               a quieter part of the city, to escape an avalanche of invitations and attentions.</p>
            <p>We hear of a glove <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> to be hers being sold at a good round price; of her shawl which happened to drop from a
               balcony, being instantly torn into shreds by the overzealous crowd below.</p>
            <p>"Everything for sale has <persName>'Jenny'</persName> to it!" remarked a lady in one of the shops. Judging from the following amusing news
               items, clipped from contemporary Boston papers, we are inclined to agree with her.</p>
            <p>One enterprising Journal advertises a '<persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind</persName> tea kettle', which being filled with water
               and placed on the fire "commences to <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> in a few minutes"!</p>
            <p>"A provision dealer at <persName>Lynn</persName>," says the Post, "sells '<persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind</persName>
               sausages.'"</p>
            <p>"On <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> street, near the <placeName>Rox-bury</placeName> line, there is a
               bar-room just opened, under the name of '<placeName>Jenny Lind Hotel</placeName>.'"</p>
            <p>"Our foreman," avers a well known periodical, "made his appearance this <pb n="9"/> morning with a red and black plaid coat, which our 'devil'
               soon christened as the '<placeName>Jenny Lind coat</placeName>'. If this is not the age of progress, what is it?"</p>
            <p>Even the Editors, usually sedate and sober-minded, appear to have temporarily suffered from <persName>"Jenny Lind mania"</persName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>"Jenny Lind"</persName>, declares an important weekly, "is the most popular woman in the world; at the present moment, perhaps the
               most popular that ever was in it." The same paper speaks of the <persName>Nightingale's warblings</persName> as notes "which she spins out
               from her throat like the attenuated fibre from the silkworm, dying away so sweetly and so gradually, till it seems melting into the song of the
               seraphim, and is lost in eternity ". To turn once more to the serious side of the <persName>prima donna's</persName> career, her first <placeName>American</placeName> concert was held in <placeName>Castle Garden</placeName> on Wednesday evening, September the 11th, 1850. Under
                  <persName>Mr. Barnum's</persName> direction the 4,484 tickets were sold at public auction, the average price paid per ticket being $6.38.
               The entire amount <pb n="10"/> received was $17,864.05. <persName>Mr. John N</persName>. <persName>Gennin bid</persName> in the first
               ticket for $225; regarding this incident, it is an open secret that he acted on the advice of the <persName>wily Mr. Barnum</persName>. The
               benefit derived was mutual however, since <persName>Gennin's</persName> name appeared in every paper in the Union and his reputation as a
               fashionable hatter was permanently established.</p>
            <p>The immense success made by the <persName>Nightingale</persName> in her first concert is a matter of history and need not be dwelt on here,
               but it is interesting to note that true to her generous heart and wide sympathy, she freely gave her entire share of the proceeds of this concert
               and the second, over $10,000, to charitable institutions in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Mr. Barnum</persName> displayed his <persName>Yankee shrewdness</persName> by quickly taking advantage of the advertising
               value of this act; the medal struck under his supervision is characteristic of the showmen's craft (see No. 4). For the obverse, he freely
               borrowed the head on <persName>Radnitzky</persName> medal (see No. 17); the reverse, forcibly emphasizes the <pb n="11"/> success of the
               first Castle Garden concert, and <persName>Jenny's</persName> benevolent gift. This medal, struck in white metal, undoubtedly sold in large
               numbers as an interesting souvenir.</p>
            <p>After "taking <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> by song", <persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind</persName> visited <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5224151">Providence</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> and other prominent cities in the West and South, also journeying to Cuba where she remained a
               month. Everywhere she met with pronounced success and unqualified praise from both public and critics.</p>
            <p>At the termination of the ninety-fifth concert she permanently concluded her engagement with <persName>Mr. Barnum,</persName> as a clause in
               the contract enabled her to do, and continued the tour under her own management.</p>
            <p>On February 5th, 1852, while in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, she was married to <persName corresp="#viaf_107639675">Mr. Otto Goldschmidt</persName>, a friend of her girlhood, and a musician of note who had been her accompanist during
               the latter part of the American tour.</p>
            <p>In the spring, <persName corresp="#viaf_74649260">Jenny Lind Goldschmidt</persName> passed through <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> on her way to <pb n="12"/>
               <placeName>Germany</placeName>. She gave occasional concerts in <placeName>German</placeName> and <placeName>Austrian</placeName>
               cities, and in 1863 once more delighted her admirers in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> at an historic revival of
               Handel's music to the <hi rend="italic">Allegro</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Penseroso</hi> of Milton.</p>
            <p>During all her wanderings and triumphs, the <persName>Nightingale</persName> never forgot the city of her birth. She was made a member of
               the Royal Musical Academy of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2673730">Stockholm</placeName> in 1840, and in 1883, she returned to serve there as
               Professor of Singing for a term of three years.</p>
            <p>Her death occurred at her home, among the beautiful <placeName>Gloucestershire</placeName> hills of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, November 2nd, 1887.</p>
            <p>As a mark of appreciation of the untiring and devoted service of <placeName>Jenny Lind Goldschmidt</placeName>, the Academy in 1891 caused a
               very beautiful portrait memorial medal to be struck in her honor. (See No. 2.) It was designed by <persName>Adolf Lindberg</persName>,
               Engraver of medals to the King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</placeName>, and struck in gold and in silver at the Royal
               Swedish Mint.</p>
