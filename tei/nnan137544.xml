            <p>The money of pre-federal <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> provided the subject for the seventh annual Coinage of the
               Americas Conference sponsored by the American Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the
               Society's governing Council as a forum for the dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of <name type="place">North and
                  South America</name>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present
               papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all interested in the
               topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants to come to know the Society's collections and library
               better during the days of the conference.</p>
            <p>Registrants at the Coinage of the Americas Conference had a particular reason to attend. At the initiative of ANS Councillor <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_48535855">Joseph R. Lasser</name>, a special exhibit of outstanding examples of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926"
                  >Massachusetts</name> silver was organized by <name type="pname">Anthony Terranova</name> with the assistance of ANS Associate Curator of
               Modern Coins <name type="pname">John M. Kleeberg</name> and ANS Registrar <name type="pname">Johanna Bergmann</name>. This exhibit (an assemblage
               of what Lasser termed the "caviar of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver") showed selections from the
               collections of <name type="pname">Andrew Hain</name>, <name type="pname">Alan V. Weinberg</name>, <name type="pname">Anthony Terranova</name>,
                  <name type="pname">Larry Stack</name>, <name type="pname">Joseph Lasser</name>, and <name type="pname">Eric Newman</name>, plus examples from
               the collection of the ANS. A catalogue of this exhibit is Appendix 1.</p>
            <p>ANS Curator of Medals <name type="pname">Alan M. Stahl</name> has devoted much time to the study and cataloguing of the ANS collection of Indian
               peace medals, partly in connection with a paper he delivered at the conference of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de la M√©daille in <name
                  type="place">Helsinki</name>, partly while working on an exhibit for the centennial convention of the American Numismatic Association, and
               partly in connection with this conference. A catalogue of the ANS collection of Indian peace medals is among the fruits of his work and is
               Appendix 2.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Until the Civil War, the <name type="place">United States</name> was largely an agricultural country. This had two important consequences: first,
               the chief investment outlet was land speculation. This meant high indebtedness, meager cash flow, and frequent financial catastrophes. Secondly,
               the harvest always put unusual strains on the financial system, often leading to collapse: this is why stock market crashes occur in October.</p>
            <p>These strains, present throughout the nineteenth century, were even more intense in colonial <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North
                  America</name>, which produced no precious metals of its own. British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>
               needed specie. But in the <name type="place">British</name> imperial system, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>, in
               close proximity to the mines of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3932488"
                  >Peru</name>, had to serve as a source for silver‚Äînot a destination. The destination for silver was the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_1814991">China</name> trade and Britain's growing empire in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>,
               particularly after <name type="pname">Robert Clive</name>'s conquest of <name type="place">Bengal</name> in 1765 and in response to imperial
               crises such as <name type="pname">Haidar Ali</name>'s invasion of the Carnatic in the 1770s. In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india"
                  >India</name> silver was so short that the multi-talented Warren Hastings sought to remedy the problem by minting gold mohurs. An answer to
               the specie shortage in <name type="place">British North America</name> would not be forthcoming from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london"
                  >London</name>‚Äîneither from <name type="place">Whitehall</name> nor from <name type="place">Plantations House</name>. <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> must look to herself. And so she did; at first tentatively, in the end violently. The coins and
               paper money reflect this. The looser reins of the Commonwealth allowed the first steps: the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926"
                  >Massachusetts</name> silver is astonishing for its variety, its abundance, and its sophistication. <name type="pname">Richard G. Doty</name>
               shows that the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> mint was using machinery at a time when the Tower Mint was still
               striking coins by hand. The New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token, I argue, is <pb n="x"/> another
               remnant of this looser period; a period when central control of minting collapsed in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131"
                  >England</name> as well, as evidenced by the vast token issues of the mid-seventeenth century. Under <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_805714"
                  >Queen Anne</name>, the reins were drawn tighter. But if coins were still a regal prerogative, paper was not. <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_64112980">Eric P. Newman</name> shows how native American ingenuity, abundantly evidenced for <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver, was applied to paper money as well‚Äîboth its licit and illicit production. Paper money
               is important evidence of another kind: for the backgrounds of men of property. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_48535855">Joseph R.
                  Lasser</name> examines this aspect, which is part of an extremely important larger question: was the American Revolution really a social
               revolution? <name type="pname">Charles Beard</name> argued many years ago that it was not; Lasser uses the evidence of paper money to argue that
               it was.</p>
            <p>The revolution was successful; but the new nation had many struggles before it. The Articles of Confederation soon proved inadequate. Under <name
                  type="place">Britain</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> was not permitted to coin its own money;
               under the Articles of Confederation, it could. And so could <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name>, <name type="place"
                  >Vermont</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name>; and so, as it proved, could raffish types like <name type="pname">Jarvis</name>,
                  <name type="pname">William Duer</name> and <name type="pname">Thomas Machin</name>. <name type="pname">Dr. Philip L. Mossman</name> unravels
               some of the mysteries of the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coinage, probably the most complex of the state copper series. <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> never authorized an official state coinage, but produced many of the most
               fascinating issues in the series. <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name> argues for the authenticity of one highly controversial <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> issue, the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons of <name
                  type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>. Finally, the adoption of the Constitution and the establishment of the Mint did not mean that the
               struggle was over. Medals are usually a luxury item, but Indian Peace Medals were not a luxury item, they were a necessity of policy. <name
                  type="pname">Alan M. Stahl</name>'s account of the Indian Peace Medal is the first to examine the very important French medals as well as the
               English medals since 1918. The history of the Indian peace medals parallels that of the copper halfpenny/cent: first English imports, then
               American strikings on English planchets, then a crude medal of wholly American manufacture, and finally skillful American strikings on American
               planchets. The Mint needed to import its planchets to strike Indian peace medals, just as it had to import planchets from <name type="pname"
                  >Matthew Boulton</name> or overstrike <name type="pname">Talbot</name>, <name type="pname">Allum</name> and <name type="pname">Lee</name>
               tokens to produce early cents and half cents.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Whitehall</name> starved the <name type="place">North American</name> plantations of specie because of a fundamental economic
               error: it believed that the wealth of a nation consisted in its holdings of silver and gold. Only at the very end of the colonial period would a
               great philosopher show that it came from the productive employment of land, labor, and <pb n="xi"/> capital. The philosopher was <name

            <p>
               <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver, centering on the Pine Tree shilling, is among the most famous and
               best-loved of early American coinage. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that the creation and circulation of this series suggests
               to us that our remote predecessors had some of the virtues which we still consider a peculiar monopoly of Americans: self-reliance, cleverness,
               ingenuity, the ability to dissemble (as with the frozen date, 1652, used on virtually all of the coins) in a good cause‚Äîin sum, the gift of
               making the best of a bad situation, of actually prospering from it.</p>
            <p>But there is also a good deal of solid historical importance about these coins. They were our first attempts at moneying, struck only one step
               removed from our arrival upon these shores. There is simply nothing like them in any other colonial area of that time, and there are very few
               remotely comparable examples in subsequent times. So in and of themselves, and because of what they tell us about ourselves when very young,
               these crude silver coins are important.</p>
            <p>But they are also imperfectly understood in a number of important ways. We don't know how many were struck. We don't know when production of one
               type ended, when that of another began‚Äîor even, as <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name> recently observed to me, whether members of various
               series were elaborated in a simple sequence or simultaneously.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> We don't know the precise origins of the very silver
               used to coin them.</p>
            <p>Finally, we don't know how they were struck. It is this last area which intrigues me and which forms the topic of this paper.</p>
            <p>My interest in the methodology of coinage for the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> series was aroused when I
               saw a comment by <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name>, appended to Lot 5505 of the <name type="pname">Bowers</name> and <name type="pname"
                  >Merena</name> sale of the <name type="pname">Chris Schenkel</name> Collection, held in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city"
                  >New York City</name> on November 12-14, 1990. This lot consisted of a Pine Tree shilling, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe"
                  >Noe</name> 8, with two heavy planchet bends. Hodder observed that such bends had been traditionally ascribed to early attempts to ward off
               witches. He disputed this explanation, suggesting instead that the curious "S" bends might have resulted from the employment of a <name
                  type="pname">Taschenwerke</name> or rocker press to strike the coin.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> While I would dispute his evidence as
               presented by this coin, for reasons to be mentioned later, I believe that he is correct in his major assumption, and that something very much
               like a rocker press was employed to strike a major portion of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> issues.</p>
            <p>Before going into what I see as evidence for the mechanized production of early <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926"
                  >Massachusetts</name> silver, let me quickly examine the phenomenon of the "witch piece." Hodder observes that "there is no contemporary
               evidence for this practice," that is, of bending <pb n="3"/> coins to ward off malign paranormal influences.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> I must
               concur: the earliest reference to the practice I have found is contained in <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Sydney P. Noe</name>'s
               monograph on the Pine Tree coinage, published in 1952. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> explains: <q>We are told that it
                  was the superstitious belief of the time that wearing a bent coin afforded protection against the power of "witches." Some of our Pine Tree
                  coins show evidence of having once been bent even though as we see them now they have again been flattened. Some show dents which imply that
                  teeth must have been the means of bending them initially. The thinness of the Pine Tree coins made bending an easy operation, and some with
                  holes for suspension may have seen service in the same manner as those which were bent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> suggests that this bending of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926"
                  >Massachusetts</name> silver coincided with the witchcraft hysteria of the early 1690s, but he cites no contemporary sources for this, or for
               connecting the practice of bending coins with the hope of warding off witches.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> He illustrates several bent Pine Tree
               shillings (including one of the thicker second type, interestingly enough) on plate 6 of his monograph. It is important to observe that the
               positions of the bends vary from coin to coin.</p>
            <p>As indicated earlier, it is my opinion that a portion of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver coinage
               was created by means of a rocker press or something very similar. I would include all of the Oak Tree coinage in this group, as well as all of
               the large, and presumably earlier, members of the Pine Tree shilling series, and, probably, all of the subsidiary Pine Tree issues. It is my
               belief that later Pine Tree shillings were struck on a screw press, for reasons which I shall discuss at the end of this paper.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi rend="bold">The Rocker Press</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The rocker press, and several related machines such as sway and lever presses, were early alternatives to the screw press, and variants on a
                  better-known mechanism, the roller press. All of the mechanical contraptions of the early modern period attempted to perform the same labor:
                  to impress designs into the upper and lower faces of a coin more accurately than possible with the traditional hammering method. But they
                  impressed their designs at different stages in the moneying process. The screw press represented the final step in the methodology of which it
                  was the center: round, flat pieces of metal, called planchets, were created first, and then struck in the machine, emerging as finished coins.
                  But for the roller press and <pb n="4"/> its relatives, striking tended to occur as an intermediate step: a strip of metal of the proper
                  thickness would be passed between the upper and lower dies, embossed, and only later cut into individual coins. <name type="pname">Denis R.
                     Cooper</name> devotes an entire chapter of his recent book to this second type of coining technology ("Development of Rolling Mills for
                  Coining, 1530-1730 AD").<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> He notes that it was developed in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2921044"
                     >Germany</name> in the sixteenth century, dividing rather quickly into methods utilizing designs engraved on rollers ("Walzenwerke"
                  coining) and those engraved on inserts, which were fitted into axles where the rollers would have been. This second method was known as "<name
                     type="pname">Taschenwerke</name>," and I believe it was the basis for the Oak and a portion of the Pine Tree coinage.</p>
               <p>In either case, the key to the technique was to keep the upper and lower rolls or inserts in perfect alignment with each other. This was to
                  prove a perpetual difficulty, even though elaborate gearwork was eventually created for this purpose, as illustrated (<ref target="#fig-2"
                     >fig. 1</ref>). But the method had a certain amount to recommend it to early coiners. With the roller press, it became possible to make
                  extremely large coins, as anyone who has ever seen a Spanish cincuent√≠n, or 50 real piece, will surely agree. And the rocker press and its
                  variants had one signal advantage for earlier moneyers, one which <name type="pname">Cooper</name> overlooked in his description of early
                  coining practices: it obviated the necessity of creating large male and female screws, one of the most difficult of all metalworking
                  operations in a preindustrial setting. All one would need for coining with a rocker press was a wooden frame sturdy enough for the purpose,
                  cast-iron gears to keep the upper and lower dies in proper relation to each other, and the dies themselves. Those dies would have to have
                  curved faces, however: the action of this type of coining press is a rolling, cycloidal one, and it would be impossible to perform it with
                  normal, flat-surfaced dies (<ref target="#fig-3">fig. 2</ref>). And the images on those dies must be somewhat oval, again to compensate for
                  the rolling motion of the press. As <name type="pname">Cooper</name> explains: <q>As the edges of the blanks were inserted between the rolls
                     only a small area met the engravings, but as the rolls turned, the area of the blank to be embossed increased until it was at its maximum
                     at the diameter; from this point the area decreased until the embossing was completed at the opposite edge of the blank. The greatest
                     force, therefore, was needed at the diameter, but the greatest compression came at the shortest length of embossing on the edges which were
                     furthest from the diameter. This resulted in oval coins. To counteract this ovality the <pb n="5"/>
                     <name type="pname">Taschenwerke</name> dies were made with a modified curved surface and the engravings were oval to allow for the blank
                     stretching during the rolling. Coins made in this way are characterised by the edges which have a rolled-over appearance, and uncirculated
                     coins often reflect the light in bands. The in-going and out-going edges are usually thinner and the coins correspondingly elongated.<ref

               <p>The anomalies described above may be familiar to students of the Oak and Pine Tree series. They will also be familiar to students of early
                  German and Austrian coinage. Two coins, a quarter and a half thaler from <name type="place">Salzburg</name>, both from the closing years of
                  the seventeenth century, display most of the characteristics <name type="pname">Cooper</name> described, particularly the warping effect which
                  so often appears on coinage struck on roller and rocker presses. A slightly earlier one-sixth thaler from <name type="place">Salzburg</name>
                  displays similar characteristics, but its warp is a <hi rend="italic">double</hi> one (<ref target="#fig-4">fig. 3</ref>). Several Oak and
                  Pine Tree pieces display similar characteristics.</p>
               <p>The American Numismatic Society is very fortunate in having a die for a rocker press, created for minor coinage in <name type="place"

                     <pb n="6"/> gradual at one end and fairly pronounced at the other (<ref target="#fig-5">fig. 4</ref>). I hazard the opinion that the die
                  would have been elaborated in this way in order to provide a certain acceleration within the movement of the coining process. <name

                  conclusions.</p>
               <p>The first bit of possible corroboration comes from an entry in the will of <name type="pname">John Coney</name>, a prominent <name
                     type="pname">Boston</name> silversmith who died in 1722. Among Coney's personal effects at death there was listed "An engine for Coining
                  with all utensils belonging thereto ¬£. 10-10-0." Coney may have been apprenticed to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_30880042">John
                     Hull</name>, who was one of the principals in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> mint. Certainly the two men
                  knew each other, Coney acting as pallbearer for one of Hull's relatives, another silversmith named <name type="pname">Daniel Quincy</name>, in
                     1690.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> This is a very weak peg upon which to hang an argument, but one part of it strikes me as significant.
                  That is the value assigned to the "engine for Coining," ten pounds. I assume that Coney's will was speaking in terms of local currency: if so,
                  it must be observed that ten pounds was not a very large sum of money in 1722, and that it would not have been an accurate valuation for a
                  screw press, even an old one. I base this on a later transaction between <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> and <name type="pname"
                     >Thomas Williams</name>, by which the former purchased used screw presses from the latter at ¬£. 105 each, Sterling. The presses had been
                  used to strike Parys Mines halfpennies, slightly larger than Pine Tree shillings.<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> Even allowing for the 70-year
                  gap between the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> will and the Midlands sale, ten pounds in an inflated
                  local currency would have been an inaccurate valuation for a screw-type coining press. But it might not have been an excessively high one for
                  a smaller machine of the rocker type, one which, by now, might not have been self-evident as to use.</p>
               <p>Still, this scarcely proves that the coining engine of the will was a rocker press, let alone that it had been <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#viaf_30880042">John Hull</name>'s press, used to strike Oak and Pine Tree coinage. We shall get farther if we go into the other
                  available evidence, the testimony offered by the coins themselves.</p>

               </head>
               <p>First of all, many of the surviving coins display a warped appearance, somewhat similar to that seen on the Austrian coins mentioned earlier.
                  A <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 5 Pine Tree shilling shows the typical planchet deformation or warp frequently
                  visible on well-preserved Oak and early Pine Tree coins. The warp is double, S-shaped, and runs at right angles to the top and bottom of the
                  coin. When a production <pb n="8"/> warp is present on these pieces, this is how it will look (<ref target="#fig-6">fig. 5</ref>).</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-6">

                  <p>5. Pine Tree shilling, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 5.</p>

               <figure xml:id="fig-7">

               </figure>
               <p>Secondly, the die axis on this coinage is very consistent, generally at a twelve o'clock relationship with very little internal variation.
                  This fact does not prove that a rocker-type press was used to strike the coinage, but it does suggest that some form of mechanization was in
                  force at the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> mint.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the inner beaded borders surrounding the tree or the denomination on these coins is frequently oval rather than perfectly round. This
                  is seen early in the coinage, as with <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 1 and 2 in the Oak Tree series, but it appears
                  among Pine Tree coins as well‚Äîbut only among Type I (broad and thin, presumably earlier) members of that group.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when coins are struck off-center, only one side will ordinarily be misstruck, and it will usually be misaligned either to the north
                  or south, but not to the east or west. An ANS <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 21 Oak Tree sixpence displays this
                  oddity, which is by no means conclusive but which does fit in with how a rocker press might have operated, with one die out of alignment from
                  the other (<ref target="#fig-7">fig. 6</ref>).</p>
               <p>Fifthly, several varieties of Oak and early Pine Tree coins show metallic striations tending in a distinctly parallel, vertical fashion, which
                  is what one might expect in a press featuring a rolling type of motion. A <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 6 Oak Tree
                  shilling displays this movement of metal, along with an interesting reverse die break, also explainable in conjunction with a rolling rather
                  than an up-down relationship of coining dies (<ref target="#fig-8">fig. 7</ref>).</p>
               <p>These are all possible pointers toward a coining methodology. But there are members of the two series which offer much broader hints as to how
                  they were made. For example, many Oak and Pine Tree shillings show a peculiar smashing or broadening of denticles or other design elements at
                  twelve o'clock, nearly always on the obverse side. A <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 2 Pine Tree shilling displays
                  this feature in a typical fashion (<ref target="#fig-9">fig. 8</ref>). Two <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 1 Pine
                  Tree coins at the ANS show differing degrees of metal deformation, indicating that it was indeed <pb n="9"/> taking place during the coining
                  process and was not the product of a defective die. This spread or smashed effect suggests to me a deformation of metal at one point on the
                  coin but not at others, at some time during the striking process, most probably at its end.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Does this peculiarity find expression on other people's coinage, pieces we know were created on rocker or roller presses? Yes, it does: two
                  Austrian 15-kreuzer coins of the 1660s, one from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</name> and the other from <name
                     type="place">Neuburg-am-Inn</name>, manifest a very similar sort of deformation, at nine and three o'clock respectively (<ref
                     target="#fig-10">fig. 9</ref>). This suggests a similar machine, with dies affixed in a position ninety degrees away from the <name
                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> norm. But the warping on these coins is also ninety degrees away from our
                  norm: we are, I think, justified in speculating that whatever was seeing use by a mintmaster in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston"
                     >Boston</name> in 1662 would not have occasioned excessive surprise among his Austrian contemporaries.</p>

               <pb n="10"/>
               <p>With the examination of three more coins, we can move still closer to an informed guess as to how early <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> money was created. Our first witness is a piece already described by <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>, his third variety of Oak Tree shilling (<ref target="#fig-11">fig. 10</ref>). <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> recorded the impressions of what he determined to be either a square or octangular die, one in the
                  shape "of a prism rather than a cylinder." From this, he concluded that the flattened sides of Oak Tree dies made it possible to mount them
                  securely in place and strike coins without the rotation which had plagued members of the Willow Tree series‚Äîwith or without the addition of a
                  screw press to the equation.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>'s reference to prismatic dies is a trifle difficult to visualize, and he was, I
                  think, on somewhat dubious ground concerning the Willow Tree coinage. But he had unquestionably discovered the traces of a die on this coin.
                  And it was probably the traces of a lower die. That is, in <name type="place">Massachusetts Oak</name> and early Pine Tree coinage, the tree,
                  or obverse, die was probably positioned on the bottom, and the die with the date and value, the reverse die, was probably positioned on the
                  top.</p>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>'s coin suggests as much. But so does a member of the Pine Tree series, a <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 1 with an incuse IIX below the tree. Many specimens of this die variety display the odd
                  marking, which came about as the result of a clash between the two dies, an accidental striking when there was nothing there to be struck. The
                  IIX, of course, was the IIX of the reverse die, which created a raised XII on the obverse die (just as it would have on an ordinary coin), and
                  another incuse IIX on any coinage subsequently struck with that damaged die. A clash does not necessarily indicate which die was upper and
                  which lower, but common sense suggests that it would <pb n="11"/> be far easier to create a die clash on the bottom die than on the top one.
                  Such a clash also suggests the existence of dies in some fixed relationship with each other, as in a coining press. And the fact that the IIX
                  is not directly opposite the place where we would expect it suggests a press whose parts could have shifted out of alignment rather easily. It
                  suggests a rocker-type press, not a screw press (<ref target="#fig-12">fig. 11</ref>).</p>
               <p>With one final coin, we approach as near as we are likely to an unravelling of the mysteries of early <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> moneying. This is a poorly-struck <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>
                  5 Oak Tree shilling. The coin has an up-curling lip of metal at 12:00 on the obverse. On that side, flow lines may be faintly seen below the
                  letters H and V of MASATHVSETS. On the reverse, metal flow lines appear <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the G and L of <name type="place"
                     >ENGLAND</name>. It seems to me that what we have here is a coin struck in a press whose dies were oriented parallel to the direction of
                  the rolling movement of the strike‚Äîwhich of course would also explain the direction taken by the distinctive warp seen on this coin and on so
                  many of the others we have been examining. If I am correct about the top/bottom, reverse/obverse die arrangement on <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver of this period, what this coin indicates is a positioning of those dies so that
                  their tops were located at the very end of the rolling process; those tops would have been the last element of the coin to be struck, and, in
                  this particular case, a misalignment of upper to lower die resulted in the unstruck metal at the top of the obverse being bent downward as the
                  coin was created (<ref target="#fig-13">fig. 12</ref>).</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Based primarily on the evidence of the coins themselves, I conclude that the Oak and early Pine Tree issues of colonial <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> were struck on something resembling a rocker press. I conclude that it must have looked
                  very much like the drawing <pb n="12"/> reproduced by <name type="pname">Denis Cooper</name> of a "sway" or "lever" press, essentially a
                  primitive version of the rocker press. <name type="pname">Cooper</name> observes that such a machine existed as early as the sixteenth
                  century. He also opines that the small size of a surviving press of this type, from which his drawing was created, would have rendered it
                  impractical for striking anything broader than around 20 millimeters, although I see no reason why a larger press could not have been
                  constructed along similar principles.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Cooper</name> advises that a sway press would have been less than fully successful: <q>The construction is such that it
                     would have been relatively difficult to get the opposing impressions opposite one another on the blank or strip. The interlocking lugs
                     could not have engaged accurately in their recesses and they would have allowed unacceptable movement between the dies<ref
                        target="#CH1-n11">11</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>‚Äîwhich would go far toward explaining some of the striking anomalies among the silver coins of <name type="place"
                  >Massachusetts-Bay</name>.</p>
               <p>In time, the rocker-type press must have fallen out of favor with the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> coiners. For
                  the Pine Tree shilling, it was replaced by a new contrivance, whose actions at least were those of a screw press. There is no surviving
                  written testimony about this change, but there is the evidence of the coins. They become smaller and thicker. As with <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> varieties 19 and 20, this new generation of coins begins to develop the types of die breaks we
                  associate with "normal," screw press-struck money of the period.</p>
               <p>The downward squeezing action of a screw press may have left traces on an ANS <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 29,
                  whose reverse displays a peculiar radiating effect in the denticles between seven and twelve o'clock. And specimens of <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> 26 and 28 from the same museum show evidence of double-striking of a type difficult to explain except
                  through the intervention of a screw press. These two double-struck coins are perhaps our clearest indicators as to what was happening (<ref
                     target="#fig-14">fig. 13</ref>).</p>
               <p>But we are primarily interested in the earlier, rocker-type press. And a major question remains to be answered: where did the <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> coiners get the idea?</p>
               <p>I wish I could supply the answer. I had originally assumed that they might have gotten it from the contemporaneous British token coinage of
                  pence and halfpence, which reached its height just as the Oak Tree coinage was getting under way. I had originally assumed that that coinage,
                  consisting of diminutive pieces in copper and brass, would have been struck on traveling rocker or sway presses, affording a possible direct
                  inspiration to the colonists. But an admittedly cursory examination of several hundred examples in the <pb n="13"/> ANS of seventeenth-century
                  tokens from the <name type="pname">Norweb</name> Collection proved inconclusive. I encountered no tokens with the telltale signs for which I
                  was looking, and, while a much more extended search by <name type="pname">John Kleeberg</name> did turn up a few specimens with something like
                  the warping we have been discussing, the majority of this collection does not exhibit such a characteristic. Moreover, while many of these
                  tradesmen's tokens showed edge clips, all of the clips I saw appeared to have occurred before striking and not after‚Äîwhich is the precise
                  opposite of what we might have expected, were rocker presses in common use.</p>

               <p>So I fear that we must look elsewhere for the inspiration of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> coiners.
                  They may have gotten the idea from the lever presses used for affixing seals to colonial documents. Or it may have simply been in the public
                  domain by that time, one of those concepts of which any middling mechanic would have been aware. We cannot know.</p>
               <p>But we can, at last, clear up one misapprehension, confusion over witch pieces versus ordinary, rocker-struck coins. Coins reworked as amulets
                  or talismans will have two roughly parallel bends, but they will almost certainly not function at a ninety-degree angle from the top or bottom
                  of the coin. Pieces struck with the rocker-type press, if manifesting a bending acquired during the coining process, will always display it as
                  two strictly parallel warps in a perpendicular relationship to the top or bottom of the coin. A warp acquired outside the mint will, in
                  addition, be very bold, as evidenced by <name type="pname">Lot</name> 5505, the piece which led me into this investigation. But a warp
                  acquired as part of the normal moneying process will be subtler, <pb n="14"/> even though distinctive. However acquired, each type of warping
                  is evidence of a sort, shedding precious light upon the earliest generations of English settlers in <name type="place"

                  corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>, are more abundant, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> can

               example is the <name type="pname">Brasher</name> doubloon; but more mysterious than even the doubloon is the New Yorke token.</p>
            <p>The New Yorke token first came to the attention of a wider public in October 1861, when <name type="pname">Fisk Parsons Brewer</name>, then a

               <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_haven_connecticut">New Haven</name> at this time was a hotbed of numismatic research‚Äîsometimes of
               numismatic frauds (the <name type="pname">Fugio</name>
               <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_haven_connecticut">New Haven</name> restrikes). In 1860 the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_2293888">Yale</name> coin cabinet was arranged by <name type="pname">Brewer</name>, and a catalogue of that cabinet was
               published with the preface dated July 29, 1863. The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_haven_connecticut">New Haven</name> Numismatic

            <p>The presence of that notorious creator of imaginary coins, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_36547176">Charles Wyllys Betts</name>, in the same

               but although <name type="pname">Betts</name> was inspired by the token to create fabrications, he did not fabricate it himself. The pedigree of
               at least one piece gainsays this. This is the piece in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2751773">Leiden</name> which was donated to the
               cabinet in 1851, when <name type="pname">Betts</name> was six years old. The Bache-Hall-Norweb-Smithsonian lead example has an even earlier
               pedigree, back to 1834, if we can trust the entry in <name type="pname">Dr. Thomas Hall</name>'s ledger.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref>

               years when he was at a loss for employment‚Äîevidently his health was too poor to allow him to fight in the Civil War. Finally, in July 1869, he

                  >Yale</name> electrotype; they all have a large cud over the "I" in IN. This cud is clearly visible in the excellent drawing published in the

               turned up on the market very early: the earliest auction I have found is that of the cabinet of <name type="pname">Joseph N. T. Levick</name> (an

               was described as "curious, lead, good" and realized 75 cents. Another early auction, that scheduled for December 14, 1874, but postponed to
               December 21, was catalogued by <name type="pname">William Harvey Strobridge</name>; lot 657 had electrotypes in "type metal and copper" which
               were sold to <name type="pname">Edward Cogan</name> for 10 cents. Among the Society's six electrotypes, two have a very early pedigree: these

               discovered before the brass ones, the latter was at first considered the rarer of the two; <name type="pname">Woodward</name> set a limit of $20
               on the lead ("very rare"), but $50 on the brass ("unique") when he auctioned them together in 1874. <name type="pname">Abe Kosoff</name>'s
               auction of the <name type="pname">Robert Prann</name> collection combined the worst known brass example with one of the finest known lead
               examples: the brass had an estimate of $125, realized $90; the lead an estimate of $150, realized $80. The last appearance of the brass and lead
               together was at the Roper sale in 1983, when the brass attained $3,740, the lead $3,960. Yet there are only four known of the lead (nearly
               unique, Rarity 8), but over a dozen now known of the brass (very rare, Rarity 6). Such are the vagaries of condition censuses and numismatic
               value. Clearly, there is a distrust of lead strikings among collectors, who do not want to watch a coin disintegrate before their eyes, as lead
               and tin are wont to do.</p>
            <p>Two brass specimens apparently turned up in lots of Civil War tokens in the 1950s, needlessly, as <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> says,

            <p>The coin itself is hotly disputed; some consider it a genuine colonial piece, others consider it a nineteenth century creation.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> What is it? What was it intended for? When was it minted? The best way to answer these questions is to examine its
               peculiarities.</p>
            <p>I believe the coin emerged from the same milieu as the English seventeenth century tradesmen's tokens of 1600-1673; I shall point out each of the
               peculiarities of the coin, and indicate how these peculiarities are consistent with the English seventeenth century token series.</p>
            <p>It is a very peculiar coin indeed. One side has no legend, but a bucolic scene with Cupid and a maiden‚ÄîVenus and Psyche have been suggested‚Äîthe
               other side has a legend, New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>, with an eagle sitting on what looks like a
                  branch.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> There is a protrusion below the branch, which <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name> has suggested is
               a "broad British arrow";<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> I believe, however, that this is only the tail of the eagle. Eagles' tails, as countless
               German thalers witness, are usually depicted with but three feathers.</p>
            <p>The outstanding element of the coin is the final "E" in "YORKE." <name type="pname">Fisk Brewer</name> used this spelling as an argument for an
               early date, between 1664 and 1710, stating that the spelling with the final "E" was rarely used after 1710. <name type="pname">Crosby</name>,
               however, pointed out that the spelling with a final "E" was used on the reverse of the pattern for the Continental Dollar. This is true, of
               course, but it should also be pointed out that although the final "E" appears on the pewter patterns, it is dropped from the paper currency, an
               indication that by 1776 the spelling without the final "E" was more prevalent. This is a curious variation when we consider that the dies for the
               pewter patterns and the plates for the currency were made by the same man‚Äî<name type="pname">Elisha Gallaudet</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n16"
                  >16</ref> This is unsurprising in light of <name type="pname">Gallaudet</name>'s inconsistent orthography for the pewter patterns themselves,
               with CURRENCEY/CURRENCY. Another piece which uses this design with the names of the states is the "Happiness, Britain and America" medal of 1783
                  (<name type="pname">Betts</name> 614). The ANS specimen is too worn to be certain, but it <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> as though it may
               spell <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> with a final <pb n="20"/> "E." The standard catalogue of these
               medals, that of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_36547176">Charles Wyllys Betts</name>, only increases the confusion; in the text <name
                  type="pname">Betts</name> gives the spelling as "N. IORKE," but his engraving gives the spelling as "N. YORK."<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref>
               The very rare American Congress reverse of the <name type="pname">Fugio</name> cent (<name type="pname">Newman</name> 1-CC) has the spelling
                  "<name type="place">N.YORK</name>."<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> The colors of the second <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Regiment
               of 1777, which also use the same design, use the spelling "<name type="place">N.YORK</name>."<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> The spelling is
               confused, but in general it seems as though the spelling without the final "E" prevailed in the eighteenth century, with the odd exception such
               as <name type="pname">Elisha Gallaudet</name> with his peculiar orthography, and <name type="pname">Gallaudet</name>'s imitators. In short,
               although the spelling with a final "E" is prevalent in the seventeenth century, and virtually disappears thereafter, it is not enough to allow us
               to date the coin more securely than that.</p>
            <p>The coin has no date. Furthermore, the legend on the coin does not go all the way around, but stops about nine-thirty, the remaining space taken
               up by an arabesque. This peculiarity is easy enough to solve once we consider that this arabesque is where the date should be, and the date has
               been left off because the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token is a pattern; many English patterns
               (although not all) leave off the date. On the pattern halfpenny of <name type="pname">Charles II</name>, a date is lacking; once regular
               production of the halfpenny begins, the date appears in the exergue (<ref target="#fig-18">fig. 4</ref>).</p>

            <p>English seventeenth century tokens are known with spaces where the date should be. An interesting group is from <name type="place"
                  >Lymington</name> in <name type="place">Hampshire</name> (Hants.88 and 92).<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref>
               <name type="pname">Bartholomew Bulkly</name> had a token made up which on the reverse has a space where we would normally expect a date. <name
                  type="pname">Bartholomew Harmood</name> also had tokens made up, also <pb n="21"/> lacking dates; but in his case there are two varieties, one
               where his last name is the full size, and another where it is reduced to cram it onto the flan. It is not clear which is the earlier and which
               the later variety. But it is interesting that all these tokens lack dates. Apparently stock reverse dies would be prepared in advance, and then
               the obverses made and the initials of the issuer punched into the center of the reverse die, and the date would be added. In the case of these
               three tokens, however, the date was omitted, and the remaining space is usually occupied by other punches, such as lozenges (<ref

            <p>Patterns in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> in the seventeenth century served slightly different purposes than ours
               do. Whereas modern patterns are distributed to influential persons, usually politicians, and not intended to circulate, the English seventeenth
               century patterns were test marketings of coin designs, and were often introduced into circulation. The <name type="pname">Charles II</name>
               pattern, QVATTVOR MARIA VINDICO, usually shows at least some wear. Many of the patterns in the Rosa Americana series also appear worn.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n21">21</ref> The New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> piece suffered a similar fate; it
               occurs in all grades, but always shows at least some wear.</p>
            <p>The coin has a legend in English, not Latin; this use of the vernacular is characteristic of the Protestant coinages of the mid-seventeenth
               century, such as those of the Commonwealth, of the <name type="place">Brunswick</name> duchies, and of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name>. Significantly, one of the few English coinages of the mid-seventeenth century to use Latin
               is that of <name type="place">Lord Baltimore</name>: an ostentatious use of Latin to emphasize the Roman Catholic faith of the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</name> colony. The legend also exhibits the fondness for the prepositional phrase such as we find on
               English seventeenth century legends: "At the Golden Hart in Leaden Hall Market A Sope Shop" (Lon. 1702). "The Commonwealth of England. God With
               Us." "<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name>."

               seventeenth century fondness for the preposition that this extended even to Latin legends, although Latin, because of its declensions, has less
               need for prepositions than English does. Hence the Latin legend: <name type="pname">Carolus A Carolo</name>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Another unusual factor is the striking of issues in both brass and what I presume to be lead. I have not been able to determine whether the token
               in white metal is made of lead or tin; I have opted for lead because of the use of this metal in many seventeenth century tokens, such as that of
                  <name type="place">Bristol</name>, and because of the battered appearance of the <name type="pname">Appleton</name> specimen. Issuing tokens
               in two metals is also consistent with English seventeenth century token issues. Not only were English tradesmen's tokens first issued in lead‚Äîthe
               ANS has one issued by <name type="pname">John Brown</name>, a grocer of <name type="place">Bristol</name>, in 1598‚Äîbut there are even instances
               of simultaneous issues, with the same dies, of tokens in both copper and lead, as in examples from <name type="pname">Andover</name> of 1666
               (Hants. 12; <ref target="#fig-20">fig. 6</ref>). The <name type="pname">Norweb</name> syllogae list a number of tokens issued in pewter or some
               other white metal‚Äîfrom <name type="place">Chester</name> (<name type="pname">Norweb</name> 507, Ches.27), <name type="place">Cockermouth</name>
                  (<name type="pname">Norweb</name> 575, Cumb.4), <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2649808">Exeter</name> (<name type="pname">Norweb</name>
               707, Dev. 134), and <name type="place">Thaxted</name> (<name type="pname">Norweb</name> 1395, Ess.317). The seventeenth century, after all, was a
               period of experimentation with various base metal coinages. Copper fractional coins were themselves an innovation. Copper was the front runner,
               but it met with competition from lead and tin‚Äîduring 1684-94 the Royal Mint coined farthings and halfpennies in tin.<ref target="#CH2-n23"
                  >23</ref> Thus the same coin would be in circulation in the two metals at the same time. Tin was also the metal for another coin minted for
               the plantations in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>‚Äîthe 1/24 real piece of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_3265477">James II</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> The issue of the coin in these two metals‚Äîwhether brass and lead, or
               brass and tin‚Äîis thus another argument for a seventeenth century date.</p>
            <p>The weight of this coin is also unusual. I have assembled the weights of 12 examples, ranging from 1.35 g to 3.56 g (see Table 1). This is not
               enough for me to make a positive argument toward a weight standard, but it is enough, I feel to make the negative argument that these weights are
               inconsistent with regal farthings issued after 1672. Although it is the size of a farthing, it is lighter than any farthing coined after 1672;
               regal farthings weigh 4.72 g, Irish far-things <pb n="23"/> also weigh above 4 g. Even Irish counterfeit farthings are often heavier than the New
               Yorke piece. <name type="place">Nuremberg</name> jetons of this diameter, by contrast, are too light, usually weighing about 1 g. Although we do
               not have anywhere near enough examples to determine the actual weight standard, the weights are fully consistent with English token issues of the
               seventeenth century, in particular the <name type="place">Bristol</name> farthings of 1662 (peak between 2.7 and 2.9 g) and 1670 (peak between
               2.9 and 3.1 g), as can be seen from <name type="pname">Thompson</name>'s frequency tables for the <name type="place">Bristol</name> token
                  issues.<ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref>

                  tin farthings, which weighed above 5 g (a very worn ANS specimen of a <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_100194418">William III</name> farthing
                  weighs 4.88 g).</p>
               <p>The die axis is also peculiar: slightly off twelve o'clock (eleven o'clock, eleven-thirty, eleven-fifty-five have all been reported). Again,
                  this is suggestive of the <name type="place">Bristol</name> farthings of the 1670s, which have a twelve o'clock die orientation. The dies are
                  often out of alignment; <pb n="24"/>

                  and results in a "gutter" on the left edge on the obverse. This "gutter effect" due to misaligned dies is also found on seventeenth century
                  tokens as on one from <name type="place">Dorchester</name> of 1669 (Dors.53; <ref target="#fig-23">fig. 8</ref>).</p>

                     <name type="place">Gloucestershire</name>, and also of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver (<ref
                     target="#fig-25">fig. 10</ref>). So again, the holing of the coin is consistent with a seventeenth century origin. The fabric of the coin
                  is similar to <name type="place">Bristol</name> farthings; it is not at all similar to Dutch jetons (which it was originally thought to be);
                  Dutch jetons are better struck, they are thicker, and they usually have broader flans (<ref target="#fig-26">fig. 11</ref>). Dutch jetons were
                  done by professionals; although the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token is a beautiful piece, the
                  unevenness of the lettering shows that we are dealing with an amateur, rather than a mighty factory in <name type="place">Nuremberg</name> or
                  the Low countries. The coin does not have a mark of denomination, as the coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_88905668">James I</name>,
                     <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_67750325">Charles I</name>, the Commonwealth (including the issues of <name type="place"

                  of <name type="pname">Charles II</name> have. Finally, so far as style is concerned, the eagle is rather mannerist, as is the figure of Cupid
                  on the obverse and the grove of trees; in the figure of the nude woman and the cloak which falls from her shoulders, however, we are beginning
                  to get a hint of the Continental baroque, indicative of the Continental influences brought in upon the return of <name type="pname">Charles
                     II</name>, plus the general moral laxity of the Restoration period.</p>

                     (<name type="place">Sussex</name>. 127) which <name type="pname">Richard G. Doty</name> brought to my attention, where a tree has been
                  treated very similarly (<ref target="#fig-27">fig. 12</ref>). But is the tree on the token of <name type="pname">Midhurst</name> meant to
                  represent a palm tree? <name type="pname">Boyne-Williamson</name>, the standard catalogue of English seventeenth century tokens, describes the
                  piece as "two pilgrims near a palm tree." The <hi rend="italic">Victoria County History</hi> doubts the existence of a seal for <name
                     type="pname">Midhurst</name>. The Hospital of <name type="pname">St. John</name> did have extensive holdings in <name type="pname"
                     >Midhurst</name> in the middle ages, and it is possible that pilgrim imagery may have been used in lieu of a seal of <name type="pname"
                     >Midhurst</name>. On the other hand, <name type="pname">James Dallaway</name>, writing in 1815, says that the burghers of the borough of

                     type="pname">Dallaway</name> may have misdescribed the seal of <name type="pname">Midhurst</name>. At any rate, the token is the only
                  representation of the arms of <name type="pname">Midhurst</name> that has come down to us, and thus has an added importance for English local
                  history‚Äîin addition to whatever light it may shed on related style to the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001"

               <p>The most puzzling part of the New Yorke piece is the eagle. The eagle only became part of the arms of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> on March 16, 1778 (four years earlier than it was adopted by the <name type="place"
                     >United States</name>), but did not form part of the official seal in the colonial period.<ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref> But although the
                  eagle did not form part of the official seal of the colony of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, the
                  Duke of York only forwarded a formal seal for the colony from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> on July 4, 1669. A
                  legal brief of 1713 by <name type="pname">Governor Robert Hunter</name> states that before then, and occasionally afterward, the governors
                  used their personal seals to seal official documents.<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref> Although the seals in the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> State Library in <name type="place">Albany</name> were destroyed by the fire of
                     1911,<ref target="#CH2-n31">31</ref> I have confirmed that this was the case by finding an example of the second governor of <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, <name type="pname">Governor Francis Lovelace</name>, sealing a
                  commission in the Flatlands militia of April 1, 1669, with his personal seal, in the manuscript collection of the <name type="place"
                     >New-York</name> Historical Society. <name type="pname">Lovelace</name> used two seals: a great seal with his full coat of arms‚Äîhe used
                  this on the commission in the Flatlands militia‚Äîand a small seal with the crest by itself, which he used when he signed the deed buying Staten
                     <name type="place">Island</name> from the Indians.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="27"/>
               <p>The use by the first two governors of their own seals is of particular importance here since the coat of arms of <name type="pname"
                     >Lovelace</name> has as its crest, "On a staff, raguly, vert, an eagle, displayed, argent."<ref target="#CH2-n33">33</ref> The question now
                  becomes what a ragulated staff is. A ragulated staff is a heraldic depiction of a tree branch, with trapezoidal protuberances (<ref
                     target="#fig-29">fig. 14</ref>). This, I would argue, is precisely what our eagle is sitting on. <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name>
                  has argued that the ragulated fesse in the <name type="pname">Lovelace</name> crest must be vertical. This confusion has arisen because Hodder
                  used Fairbairn's nineteenth century reference work about crests.<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref> It is quite possible that Fairbairn is
                  correct, that the proper way to display the <name type="pname">Lovelace</name> crest is with the fesse vertical; but that is not the way <name
                     type="pname">Francis Lovelace</name> thought it should be. I have obtained a photograph of the small seal of <name type="pname">Francis
                     Lovelace</name> from the British Library, and it is clear that the ragulated fesse is horizontal, not vertical (<ref target="#fig-30">fig.
                     15</ref>).<ref target="#CH2-n35">35</ref>

               </figure>
               <p>This is the crucial point. In short, the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token has on its reverse
                  an accurate depiction of the crest of the <name type="pname">Lovelace</name> arms. The issue is complicated, however, because <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> has had not one, but two governors from the <name type="pname"
                     >Lovelace</name> family: <name type="pname">Francis <pb n="28"/> Lovelace</name>, during 1668-73, and <name type="pname">John
                     Lovelace</name>, in 1708-9. But I think it is clear enough that the New Yorke piece was issued by the first governor <name type="pname"
                     >Lovelace</name>. The second governor <name type="pname">Lovelace</name> was taken ill on his voyage to <name type="place"
                     corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</name>, and arrived in December 1708. What energy he had was taken up clearing up the
                  mess left behind by <name type="pname">Viscount Cornbury</name>, who as governor of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                     York City</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> had put the provinces into turmoil. Viscount Cornbury
                  persecuted Jews and Presbyterians, an odd combination; established a political machine, the Cornbury Ring; was the first historically recorded
                  recipient of a bribe in the State of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name>; and according to some accounts and a
                  painting on the fourth floor of the <name type="place">New-York</name> Historical Society, was a transvestite who regularly wore dresses to
                  bring out his resemblance to his cousin, Queen Anne.<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref> (We must remember, however, that our view of Cornbury
                  relies heavily on calumnies by his political opponents. It is possible that a revisionist biography will put him in a better light.) <name
                     type="pname">John Lovelace</name>, at any rate, was overwhelmed by work and his illness, and he died of apoplexy on May 6, 1709.<ref
                     target="#CH2-n37">37</ref>
                  <name type="pname">John Lovelace</name> was governor for too short a period and had too many other concerns to devote much time to coinage
                  proposals. The reign of Queen Anne was also a period when England attempted to tighten its restrictions on issuance of coin or "crying up" of
                  money in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>. For example, on July 3, 1709, an order of the Queen in council
                  disallowed the provincial act which would have raised the values of Spanish colonial pieces of eight.<ref target="#CH2-n38">38</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Francis Lovelace</name>, on the other hand, not only was governor of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city"
                     >New York City</name> for nearly five years; he was governor at a time when the fractional coinage of England was in a parlous state, and
                  private issuers could get away with issuing copper, lead, and tin tokens. <name type="pname">Lovelace</name> had fought on the Royalist side
                  during the English Civil War, and so it made sense to reward him with the governorship (actually deputy governor, since <name type="pname"
                     >James</name>, <name type="pname">Duke</name> of <name type="place">York</name>, was formally the governor) of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>. The best accounts of his life say that he was the brother of <name type="pname"
                     >Richard Lovelace</name>, the cavalier poet, noted for two famous phrases:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Stone walls do not a prison make</l>
                  <l>Nor iron bars a cage;</l>
               </lg>
               <p>(from his <hi rend="italic">To <name type="pname">Althea</name>, from <name type="place">Prison</name>
                  </hi>), and</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>I could not love thee, dear, half so much,</l>
                  <l>Loved I not honour more.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>(from <hi rend="italic">To Lucasta, on going to the Warres</hi>).</p>
               <p>Although this cannot be regarded as absolutely certain (since there <pb n="29"/> were three <name type="pname">Francis Lovelaces</name> active
                  at this time in the seventeenth century) the fact that both <name type="pname">Francis Lovelace</name>, the governor, and <name type="pname"
                     >Francis</name> and <name type="pname">Richard Lovelace</name>, the cavaliers, had a brother named <name type="pname">Dudley
                     Lovelace</name>, suggest the identity of the governor and the poet's brother. <name type="pname">Richard Lovelace</name>'s poetry led <name
                     type="pname">Richardson</name> to name the coxcomb protagonist of <name type="pname">
                     <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi> Lovelace</name>, and so the name became a synonym in English and in French for a <name type="pname"
                     >Lothario</name>.</p>
               <p>As governor, <name type="pname">Francis Lovelace</name> showed a praiseworthy tolerance of the various religions represented in <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and attempted to assuage the feelings of the newly conquered <name
                     type="place">Dutch</name>. He worked at establishing a regular mail service with the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New

                     Island</name>. He was very idiosyncratic in his prose style; thus he wrote to <name type="pname">Secretary Williamson</name> on 3 October
                  1670: <q>I cannot but acknowledge your high civilety to mee, for a remembrance, to affourd us, what is acted on the stage of Brittany, if you

                  <ref target="#CH2-n40">40</ref> on <name type="place">Staten Island</name>) and practiced extensive nepotism, placing his brothers <name

                  in 1672, <name type="pname">Lovelace</name> was caught unprepared. While he was on a trip to <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_haven_connecticut">New Haven</name>, a Dutch fleet sailed up the Eastern seaboard and captured <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> in August 1673. On his return to England, he was thrown into the Tower and an
                  investigation made of his governorship, but he fell ill and was released before a full investigation could be made. Lengthy lawsuits were
                  pursued by his heirs.<ref target="#CH2-n41">41</ref> He died in the latter half of 1675 at <name type="place">Woodstock</name> in <name

               <p>In short, the reverse of the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token shows the arms of <name

               <p>What then is the obverse of this coin? First, who is the maiden? I am obliged to Brooks Emmons Levy who pointed out that it must be Psyche.
                  This is because the maiden has a protuberance behind her shoulder which is a diaphanous, butterfly-like wing‚Äîa traditional attribute of
                  Psyche. The identification of the soul, psyche, with the butterfly is an ancient one, and goes back to the Pythagorean brotherhood; the idea
                  of the soul having wings, particularly developed when the soul is in love, is familiar from <name type="pname">Plato</name>'s <hi
                     rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> (Steph.246-56). So the obverse represents Cupid, having just shot Psyche with an arrow, beneath a grove of palm
                  trees.</p>
               <p>What is the obverse supposed to represent? I think it must be a rebus on the name "<name type="pname">Lovelace</name>." Rebuses are used on
                  seventeenth century tokens to represent names of people and towns: for example, a token of Gateshead has a goat's head as its device
                  (Durham.46) and <name type="pname">John Oulef</name> of <name type="place">Tewkesbury</name> in <name type="place">Gloucestershire</name> has
                  a dove with an olive branch in its beak on his token (olive/oulef; Gloucs. 196). As a compound word, lovelace has not been used in English
                  since the fourteenth century; but there is a good seventeenth century citation to <name type="pname">Edward Fairfax</name>'s 1600 translation
                  of <name type="pname">Torquato Tasso</name>'s <hi rend="italic">Gerusalemme liberata</hi>, where Fairfax uses the line, "The king had snared
                  been in loues strong lace," to describe the snare of Love. This was an influential usage, and is cited in both the <hi rend="italic">Oxford

               <p>An examination was made of emblem books of the period for a depiction of love as a snare. The use of emblems is well known for paper money‚Äîthe
                  emblems on the Continental currency‚Äîand on coins, the sundial emblem on the <name type="pname">Fugio</name> cent and the emblematic thalers of
                     <name type="place">Brunswick-L√ºneburg</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n43">43</ref> In the case of the <name type="place">Brunswick</name> coins,
                  the derivation from emblems was quite explicit: the mint records for 1676 contain the remark "Emblematische getoppelte Schauthaler verfertigt"
                  ("Emblematic double medallic thalers have been prepared").<ref target="#CH2-n44">44</ref> However, I failed to find, in over a dozen books of
                  love emblems, an identical emblem to the one on the token. I believe the artist who designed the token was not inspired directly from an
                  emblem book, but there are emblems that have certain resemblances, which help us see how a seventeenth century person would visualize
                  "lovelace." There is an interesting example in the <hi rend="italic">Amorum Emblemata</hi> of <name type="pname">Otto Vaenius</name> (<name
                     type="pname">Octav van Veen</name>, an eminent painter and the teacher of <name type="pname">Peter Paul Rubens</name>), published at
                  Antwerp in 1608. The Italian emblem uses words very close to the name "<name type="pname">Lovelace</name>": "Dolci lacci d'Amore." Here we see
                  one Cupid trying to ensnare another with ropes; the emblem reads:</p>
               <pb n="31"/>
               <lg>
                  <l>Ludendo capimur, bibimus ridendo venenum,</l>
                  <l>Atque iocos inter vincula miscet Amor.</l>
                  <l>Si timeas laqueos, et si te vincula terrent,</l>
                  <l>Terreat et lusus lustraque; liber eris.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Or translated:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whilst playing we are caught, laughing we drink poison;</l>
                  <l>Love mixes jokes among the chains.</l>
                  <l>If you fear nooses, if chains frighten you,</l>
                  <l>Then fear also games and bosquets; you will be free.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This quotation sounded very familiar, and I originally thought it might be from some classical author; but I could find no reference to it in
                  the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</hi>. In fact, although it resembles many tropes we find in <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#viaf_88342447">Ovid</name> and other authors, it has some blemishes which we would not find in a true classical author: the lack
                  of <hi rend="italic">variatio</hi> by repeating vincula between the second and third lines, the false quantities in scansion of the first
                  line, where the o in ludendo is short, yet the o in ridendo is long, and finally the ugly rhyme brought about by juxtaposing ludendo and
                  ridendo. So I think this emblem must be a seventeenth century creation, quite possibly by <name type="pname">Vaenius</name> himself.</p>

               <p>The key word here is "lustra"; unfortunately, the printer in the original has this word wrong, printing lucta for what I think we must emend
                  to lustra. A lustrum is a wooded grove, but also a place of debauchery, a bagnio, a bordello. Notice also the use in the French emblem of the
                  word "embuscade," which is also related to bosquet; and finally the depiction of a grove of trees in the emblem itself (<ref target="#fig-31"
                     >fig. 16</ref>). Love plants his snares, his lace, in a wooded grove; just like the wooded grove depicted on the obverse of the New Yorke
                  in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token. A wooded grove is depicted partly because it is an ideal place for an
                  ambush, but also because of the play on the word lustrum.<ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The gesture by <name type="pname">Cupid</name> is indeed unusual; he could be raising his left arm because he is pulling on a noose in which
                  he has entrapped Psyche; or again he could have just shot an arrow, as is the case in a painting, "Lovesickness," by <name type="pname">Jan
                     Steen</name>, which is now in the <name type="place">Alte Pinakothek</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#viaf_2867714">Munich</name>. On
                  higher grade examples than the ANS piece, it is clear that Psyche has just been hit in the breast by an arrow. That is why her hand rests upon
                  her breast.</p>
               <p>A question I have been unable to solve is why a grove of palm trees. I have suggested that since both Cupid and Psyche are nude, it helps to
                  be in a warm climate where palms grow. Another possibility is that this was the only tree the die cutter could depict, as on the token from
                     <name type="place">Midhurst</name> in <name type="place">Sussex</name>. Art historians have found these explanations rather too pragmatic.
                  A palm as an emblem means strength.<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref> It does occur on coins, used as an emblem: the "emblematischer Schauthaler"
                  of the Duchy of <name type="place">Brunswick</name> of the 1670s (Dav.6573).<ref target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> If we read the palm as meaning
                  strength, then the obverse of the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token, read from left to right,
                  reads like Fairfax's Tasso: "love's strong lace." But this may be reading too much into the emblem.</p>
               <p>Finally, I have emphasized throughout the similarities between the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>
                  piece and the English tradesmen's tokens issued between 1650 and 1673. I consider the piece of English manufacture. I am most impressed by the
                  similarities between this piece and tokens issued in the West country of England. In an attempt to get a clearer picture, I examined three
                  major compilations of English tradesmen's tokens of the seventeenth century, looking for tokens which like our coin have a mute obverse: the
                  type occupies the entire field of the coin. These tokens are unusual, but not unknown, particularly among the town pieces, as tokens issued by
                  municipal corporations are called. The three compilations I examined were the <name type="pname">Boyne-Williamson</name> catalogue, which
                  unfortunately has no plates; the <name type="pname">Norweb</name> syllogae, which have excellent plates, but only extend through <name
                     type="place">Gloucestershire</name> (ten more volumes are in <pb n="33"/> preparation); and finally our own collection which was given to
                  the ANS by <name type="pname">Mrs. Norweb</name> in the 1960s, plus tokens bought in a Glendining's sale in 1951, which combined give us one
                  of the top three collections in the world for these tokens. I excluded from my list tokens which had any inscription on them, even if it was
                  only initials; and I also excluded an important sub-variety of town piece, namely those with arms depicted within a shield.<ref
                     target="#CH2-n48">48</ref> A map constructed by ANS Registrar, <name type="pname">Johanna Bergmann</name>, of all the pieces with a design
                  only on one side, and that design not within a shield, reveals an interesting pattern, with most of these coins coming from the <name
                     type="place">West of England</name>, or from places near enough to the seacoast so that the <name type="place">Bristol</name> coasting
                  trade would provide close connections with the West of England (<ref target="#fig-32">fig. 17</ref>).</p>

               </figure>
               <pb n="34"/>
               <p>There are also Irish tokens with mute obverses; unfortunately our collection is not as good as it should be in that particular area, and the
                     <name type="pname">Norweb</name> syllogae will not reach <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name> until another five
                  years have passed. But from what I can tell, most of these Irish pieces come from <name type="place">County Cork</name> and <name type="place"
                     >County Kerry</name>, especially the former;<ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> in other words the two southern-most counties of <name
                     type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, and those which are closest to <name type="place">Bristol</name> by sea. The Cork
                  municipal tokens, in particular, are very similar to the <name type="place">Bristol</name> pieces. Of special interest is the piece from <name
                     type="pname">Dingle</name> in <name type="place">County Kerry</name>, issued in 1679, because it has an oversized Cupid shooting at two
                  lovers seated beneath a tree (<ref target="#fig-33">fig. 18</ref>). The style is very different, but it is significant that an erotic subject
                  could be considered suitable for Dingle, as well as for <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-33">

               </figure>
               <p>I would argue that the mute obverse of our piece indicates it was made at or in the area around <name type="place">Bristol</name> around 1670;
                  this is suggested by the geographical distribution of coins with mute obverses, and is also what we might expect, given the importance of
                     <name type="place">Bristol</name> in the trade with British <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>.</p>
               <p>I consider the coin itself too crude to have been made in the actual <name type="place">Bristol</name> mint, which was by all accounts a very
                  professional operation, but think it was made in the region around <name type="place">Bristol</name>, patterned after <name type="place"
                     >Bristol</name> designs and struck according to the weight standard of the <name type="place">Bristol</name> farthing.<ref
                     target="#CH2-n50">50</ref> I have looked to see if there were any obvious punch links between the New Yorke in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> piece and the <name type="place">Bristol</name> farthings. There are not, because the <name
                     type="place">Bristol</name> pieces use punches of a larger size. But the makers of seventeenth century tokens did use sets of punches of
                  multiple sizes, so if they ran out of room (as happened on the <name type="place">Dorchester</name> tokens) they could switch to a smaller
                  punch size. I believe that this happened on the New Yorke piece as well. The eagle was first cut into the die; but when the time came to make
                  the legend, a smaller punch face had to be used because the normal punch size would not fit. This miscalculation of the size of the type (that
                  is, the image) on a coin, so that the type interrupts the legend, is found on many other coins issued <pb n="35"/> by comparatively unskilled
                  mints, such as the Roman bronzes of Antioch.<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref>

               <p>The monetary situation in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> in the 1670s was what is familiar to us in
                  other colonies: a chronic need for silver and for small change, and the use of many ingenious substitutes. Wampum, and a variant of wampum,
                  seawant, were commonly used.<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> Beaver skins were another substitute, with a rate in 1668 set at 3 beaver skins
                  equal to 40 shillings.<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> Liquor was a popular monetary substitute; it kept well, and was easy to split to make
                  change. In 1669 the sheriff of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, <name type="pname">John
                     Manning</name>, paid the expenses of the trial and execution of the infanticide <name type="pname">Angle Hendrickson</name> with French
                  wine and brandy. The jury, for example, received 12 shillings worth of French wine‚Äîpresumably after, not before, they concluded their

                  1672, gives us a picture of the monetary substitutes in use: some subscriptions were paid in seawant, wampum, and beaver skins. Many
                  subscriptions were paid in kind through goods‚Äîbeer, corn, a barrel of beef‚Äîothers were paid in services‚Äî"een broeck te maeken" (Dutch for

                  "Country pay" (presumably flour).<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref> Some coins were already in circulation: a burglar on March 16, 1668/9 at

               <p>The Duke of York himself also considered this matter, writing to <name type="pname">Andros</name> on April 6, 1675: <q>As to y<hi rend="sup"

               <p>As we might expect, given the chronic need for coinage in the American colonies, many English tradesmen's tokens of the seventeenth century
                  found their way here; sometimes after the tokens had ceased to serve a purpose in their homeland (i.e. after 1672). An earlier experiment with
                  small copper farthings‚Äîissued not by the king, but by noblemen given royal patents‚Äîdid lead to these farthings finding their way to <name

                     which, as a boy, I had picked up at the Toll bridge across the Allegheny River, and in digging them out I found two coins which I enclose
                     for your collection, if wanted. I well remember the ancient English (?) one which came with a miscellaneous lot of small Roman bronzes, but
                     the English "Trade Token" I do not remember at all and it may be worth while, I hope so.</q>
                  <q>At the time I made my "bridge collection," in the early Seventies, large cents were quite common but generally in worn or battered
                     condition. Due to the shortage of small silver, although 3¬¢, 5¬¢, and dimes were rather plentiful, many small foreign coins were slipped in
                     during rush hours. The toll was 1¬¢ for a foot passenger and the Toll taker, a good natured <name type="pname">Irishman</name> who liked
                     small boys, would throw all of the "odds and ends" into a box to save them for the boys, and we got them at "cost". We were satisfied with
                     "one of a date" in cents and so would trade our duplicates. Many collections were started in this way.<ref target="#CH2-n67">67</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Roman bronze, it becomes clear from <name type="pname">Clapp</name>'s later letters, was not in circulation in western <name type="place"

               <p>What has hitherto been called the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token was, in my opinion, a coin
                  struck under Governor <name type="pname">Francis Lovelace</name>‚Äîin other words, in the period 1668-73‚Äîwith a rebus upon lovelace as its
                  obverse, and the crest of the <name type="pname">Lovelace</name> arms serving as the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                     York City</name> provincial arms on the reverse. The lack of date may indicate that the coin was a pattern farthing, but it did enter
                  circulation. All examples show at least some wear. It does not seem very likely that any of the coins ended up in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</name>.</p>
               <p>Little can be told from pedigree, because so much could have happened in the two centuries between the striking of the coins and the earliest
                  pedigrees, but it is interesting that many of the pedigrees go back to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>: one piece

                     >68</ref> then the <name type="pname">Vicksburg</name> piece also has a Continental pedigree. The <name type="pname">Baches</name> are an

                  the Continent is as good as another; they might have been shipped over in a lot during the French Revolutionary wars, when the demand for
                  copper skyrocketed. It is curious that the eagle side usually shows much more wear than the Cupid and Psyche side; almost as if the owner
                  wished to eliminate all trace of this early attempt at an independent coinage for <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</name>. The <name type="pname">Smithsonian</name> lead specimen has gashes on the eagle side, as if someone were cancelling the token.
                  Perhaps this was done on some specimens before they were shipped to the Continent. As to why the coins themselves never reached <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, nor got into the historical literature, the sudden <name type="pname"

                  explanation. Only the coins themselves remain to bear witness to this failed experiment.</p>

                  and some for their rarity. As they do not properly come in any distinct class, they are here thrown together under the above head." <name
                     type="pname">Woodward</name> and <name type="pname">Betts</name> at least had the virtue of admitting that these pieces were fabrications.
                  Their next sale of <name type="pname">Betts</name> fabrications, however, was rather more questionable. This, the auction of <name
                     type="pname">Betts</name>'s collection in May 1864, contained a note from <name type="pname">Woodward</name>, "Very many of the pieces here
                  offered, are struck from excessively rare dies, recently engraved, <hi rend="italic">all of which are destroyed</hi>; and every piece being
                  the best in existence, it is the sincere wish of the owner that they meet with satisfaction." This, however, was a lie, because the dies were
                  not destroyed; they are preserved at the ANS, the gift of <name type="pname">Frederick C. C. Boyd</name> in 1950. <name type="pname"
                     >Betts</name> did, however, confess to the creation of these fabrications in 1878 when <name type="pname">Frossard</name> was taken in, and
                  he also donated a set of them to the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2293888">Yale</name> cabinet. Unfortunately, they are no longer

               <p>Did <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_36547176">Charles Wyllys Betts</name> make these fabrications just for the fun of it? Or did he intend

                  that he was honest. On the other hand, <name type="pname">Betts</name>'s remark that the dies had been destroyed in 1863, when they had not

                  certainly made very real contributions to numismatic scholarship, most notably through his catalogue of early American medals which <name
                     type="pname">Lyman Haines Low</name> published after <name type="pname">Betts</name>'s death. It would be good if <name type="place"

                     <name type="pname">Betts</name> likewise; but it is very likely that in <name type="pname">Betts Yale</name> produced a numismatic rogue. A

               <p>It is interesting to note that the <name type="pname">Appleton</name> specimen of the New Yorke in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token is in such poor condition that one writer (probably either <name type="pname">Lyman Haines
                     Low</name> or <name type="pname">David Proskey</name>) suggested that it was made by <name type="pname">Betts</name>, writing in the <hi
                     rend="italic">Coin Collector's Journal</hi> of March 1887, that the "one in lead generally supposed to be genuine is, perhaps, a copy of
                     <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_haven_connecticut">New Haven</name>

                  certainly genuine.</p>
               <p>These fabrications are important for two reasons: first of all, they show the influence of the New Yorke in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token on the numismatic community, and secondly they show us what nineteenth century
                  fabrications looked like; by comparing the New Yorke in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token with the fakes, we
                  can understand the elements which distinguish the genuine from the nineteenth century creations.</p>

               <p>Tracing the provenance of coins has been called by one very eminent numismatist "the least important branch of all numismatics." The collector
                  certainly feels a thrill in holding a coin which was held by <name type="pname">Cogan</name> or <name type="pname">Mickley</name> before him,
                  and the dealer feels a thrill in marking up the price accordingly; but of what interest is provenance to the scholar? I can only answer for
                  myself and explain why I assembled the provenances of these coins. I attempted to locate the weights of as many examples as I could find, and
                  once I had finished writing to major collections, I then turned to recent auction sales. Naturally I did not want to count the same coin
                  twice. For this reason I began to trace the recent provenances of some of the coins. I next was interested in determining the original sources
                  of the coins, because that would in part determine whether the piece was genuine or a nineteenth century fabrication. This led me to read
                  through the early auction catalogues from 1859 to about 1890, trying to find every occurrence of the New Yorke in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> token. Curiously, many pedigrees go back to the Continent of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>, as may be seen with the <name type="pname">Smithsonian</name> brass example, the <name
                     type="pname">Fonrobert</name> specimen, the three pieces in the <name type="pname">Legras</name> collection, the <name type="pname"
                     >Grotefend</name> specimen, and the two examples now in <name type="place">Holland</name>. Finally, having gone through the early sales and
                  some of the recent sales, I became tempted to try and link up the pedigrees, and solve questions such as "Who is the present owner of the coin
                  depicted in the plate in <name type="pname">Crosby</name>?" (<name type="pname">Smithsonian</name> Institution.) It is also interesting to
                  note <pb n="43"/> which four coins were known to <name type="pname">Crosby</name>: they were the first three lead examples, plus the brass
                     <name type="pname">Parmelee-Norweb-Smithsonian</name> specimen. These reconstructed pedigrees are still very tentative, especially for the
                  brass specimens.</p>

                     <name type="pname">R. H. Thompson</name> has recently argued that the seventeenth century tokens were struck in <name type="place"

                     local orders. This is a seductive theory, but regional patterns, such as the mute obverses of the <name type="place">West Country</name>,
                     to my mind argue in favor of regional mints. Larger collections must be assembled, more photographs of more tokens must be published (such
                     as those in the <name type="pname">Norweb</name> syllogae which <name type="pname">Thompson</name> has prepared), and punch studies must be
                     done before this problem can be definitely solved. <name type="pname">R. H. Thompson</name>, "Central or Local Production of Seventeenth

                     <name type="pname">Roger Bland</name> is currently preparing a study of the Antiochene issues, and the clumsiness in calculating the space
                     allotted to the type and the legend struck me as very similar to problems which the die cutters for tokens were often faced with. Of
                     course, the problem was slightly different because the Romans generally did not use punches.</p>

                     blown up during the <name type="place">Paris Commune</name> of 1871. But these losses did not discourage him, and he rebuilt his
                     collections with renewed energy. Even when he was 70 years old, he spent 5 days going through 50,000 one centime pieces looking for mints
                     and dates he did not have, and was rewarded by finding the rare one centime of 1870. He was one of the first collectors to devote much time
                     to jetons, and had restrikes made of a number of pieces he did not own. He died on September 14, 1881. His collection was sold in 1882 in

            <p>Early American printers were usually confronted with urgent requests by the authorities to prepare paper money as quickly as possible. For the
               period up to the American Revolution the required approval by British authorities of any authorization by an American assembly was often denied,
               delayed or conditioned, so that printing a much needed issue could not be undertaken until approval came. After the Revolutionary War began,
               every issue was an emergency. Thus printers and engravers were forced to expedite their work in producing money which had to be acceptable and
               protected. The printers and engraving artists had to plan and work together. There was always a choice as to whether the engravers would cut a
               complete copper plate or only cut elements in metal or wood for inserts or to cast inserts for typeset paper money. In the course of this work
               ingenuity and expediency were resorted to, coupled with short cuts, novelties and some errors. The printing of the money, whether from engraved
               plates or by letter press, had to be done on one side of a sheet at a time followed by drying time for the sheet whether it was printed on the
               back or not.</p>
            <p>In the study of these paper money issues certain unusual printing features are evident and are categorized in the grouping which follows.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> The illustrations are primarily parts of bills showing the specific features described and are placed as close to the
               descriptions as is practical.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>

               </head>
               <p>Denominations were customarily written in lettering or numbers or both. A decorative symbol representing the denomination was sometimes
                  added.</p>
               <p>As to shilling denominations, a common usage of a "crown" for 5 shillings and "crowns" for multiples thereof caused appropriate symbols to be
                  included in bills printed by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</name> (<ref target="#fig-35">fig. 1</ref>). In
                     <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, probably beginning on April 10, 1731 (certainly by August 10, 1739), and in <name type="place"
                     >Delaware</name> beginning on March 1, 1734, crown symbols in an appropriate number are evident on bills of five shillings or multiples
                  thereof. Those crown symbols continued to be used into the American Revolution.</p>
               <p>The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> issue under the February 10, 1727/8 Act originally designated the sun and
                  moon as symbols for specific denominations. Half a moon was 3d; one moon was 6d; two moons 12d; and 2 1/2 moons 15 pence. Half a sun was 30d;
                  a full sun ¬£3; and two suns ¬£6. Whether <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</name>, who was working for <name
                     type="pname">Samuel Keimer</name> in printing that issue, influenced the legislature to adopt such a system is not known. This system was
                  impractical because the <pb n="61"/> moon and the sun were the same circular shape and had to be distinguished by rays. <name type="pname"
                     >Franklin</name> sometimes used crown symbols on appropriate <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> issues
                  through July 2, 1746 (<ref target="#fig-36">fig. 2</ref>). The sun symbol was retained for 30s., ¬£3, and ¬£6. <name type="pname">James
                     Parker</name> as printer for issues of May 15, 1755, and until the American Revolution, used crowns on the face and back and retained the

               <p>In <name type="place">Connecticut</name> for the redated issue of May 1713, an animal or the name of a color was engraved on the plate to tie
                  into the denomination and these were to be printed in the color named. This was impractical and some later issues retained only the animal
                  printed as part of the face plate.</p>

               <p>They were bell shaped and of the type used on scales. For denominations of ¬£1, ¬£2, and ¬£3, the number of pound weights indicated the
                  denomination. For denominations of ¬£5 and ¬£10 there was a V for 5 placed over the pound weight symbol to hold the number of needed symbols to
                  a minimum (<ref target="#fig-37">fig. 3</ref>). These insignia were inefficient as the distinction between a weight without a V over it and
                  one with a V over it was difficult, particularly for the ¬£2 and ¬£10 both of which had two weight symbols side by side. Thus they were
                  inadequate for accurate recognition of a denomination or as an alteration deterrent.</p>

               <p>In some issues of bills the text on the face or on the back of a bill was sometimes arranged in a specially outlined shape for each
                  denomination. In the Arms or seal on some issues the shape was different for each denomination. These denominational differences were in
                  addition to the size and shape of the bill itself.</p>
               <p>In the February 17, 1776 fractional issue of the Continental Congress, there are respectively one, two, three or four ornaments outside the
                  circle of the face device, the number of ornaments increasing in the rising order of the four denominations (<ref target="#fig-38">fig.
                     4</ref>). Yet the rosettes under the top border of the face vary in number and in placement and have no relationship to any denomination or
                  its order in the issue.</p>

                  apart to use a half or quarter section as change rather than paste or sew the parts together. Some people tore the bills deliberately to make

                  prohibited sectioning of bills of 5 shillings or greater, apparently being unconcerned about the sectioning of <pb n="64"/> its outstanding 2

                  <name type="place">Connecticut</name> found a way to solve the problem somewhat when it issued bills pursuant to its October 9, 1735 Act. On
                  each quadrant of the letter press backs of its eight denominations from 2 shillings to 5 pounds of this redated July 10, 1733 issue there was
                  printed "Quarter of 2 shillings," "Quarter of 3 shillings" or similar appropriate language on other denominations. It was apparently simple
                  for the public to make the calculation. In the redated issues from July 10, 1733 up to the May 8, 1745, the quadrants on the back carried
                  similar language (<ref target="#fig-39">fig. 5</ref>). But then the calculation of the quadrant's value is printed on each of the four
                  quadrants on the back on the only known piece as:</p>

               </head>
               <p>For an engraver to cut an intaglio mold into which lead is to be poured to make a cast for a printing cut, it is not necessary to make a
                  mirror image (reversed) or mirror image lettering. The cast becomes the mirror image and the printed sheet appears the same as the original
                  mold. It is just the opposite for both an engraved printing plate or a wood block which must be cut in mirror image. An eighteenth century
                  engraver had to be skilled in cutting either way. It is therefore understandable that an engraver may on occasion have been forgetful of the
                  image transfer sequence he was to prepare and cut a design or letters in a reversed manner.</p>
               <pb n="65"/>

               </figure>
               <p>Examples of such errors are found on the early paper money. In the Continental Currency issues the seal on the $5 denomination contains the
                  word ABSTINE which was cut into the seal mold. For the issues prior to July 17, 1776, the B is normal and well cut. It was determined to
                  strengthen the motto in the seal and in so doing the vertical stroke on the B was cut in backward, being on the right instead of the left. The
                  engraver thought he was cutting in mirror image. The result was two vertical sides to the B which makes it appear somewhat like an H. This
                  error is evident in the July 22, 1776, and all subsequent issues of the $5 denomination.</p>
               <p>In the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4482348">North Carolina</name> $5 Triton design, the date is intended to be April 2d, 1776, as on
                  other denominations but appears as April d2, 1776 (<ref target="#fig-40">fig. 6</ref>). The engraver, <name type="pname">Gabriel Lewyn</name>
                  of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</name>, forgot for the moment that he was supposed to be cutting from right to
                  left and was supposed to place the number and the letter in reversed order, even though he did remember to cut each of them in the proper
                  mirror image.</p>

               <p>In the May 15, 1779 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4482348">North Carolina</name> issue, the top border cut contains the words "No
                  Carolina Currency" in white script letters on <pb n="66"/> a black panel. On one variety of the printed $25 bill all letters appear in mirror
                  image while in all other bills the lettering in the top border is correct (<ref target="#fig-41">fig. 7</ref>). This was apparently due to the
                  engraver being under the impression that he was cutting a mold from which a cast would be made rather than engraving a cut which was to be
                  used directly in the printing form.</p>

               <p>In all $3 Continental Currency bills up to January 20, 1779, the seal depicting a fight between an eagle and a crane originally had the birds
                  facing left, but when the new and smaller copies of the seals were engraved for the 1779 issue the birds are facing right (<ref
                     target="#fig-42">fig. 8</ref>). This is the only one of the Continental Currency seals which was copied by cutting the seal as it appeared
                  on prior bills instead of cutting it in mirror image.</p>

               <p>The S in SHILL in the two side border columns on the face of the 10 shilling denominations of the October 25, 1755 <name type="place"
                     >Pennsylvania</name> issue is in mirror image (<ref target="#fig-43">fig. 9</ref>). This mistake of reversal was made by the engraver who
                  cut the intaglio border mold from which both borders were cast. These erroneous side borders were used for printing the 10 shilling on 13 out
                  of the 16 issues of the 10 shilling denomination for a period of about 21 years from 1755 through <pb n="67"/> 1776. The three issues on which
                  no erroneous die border was used on the 10 shilling denomination were those of March 10, 1769 (no engraved side border), October 1, 1773 (new
                  columnar side borders with ten shillings in script) and October 25, 1775 (same as October 1, 1773). In the July 20, 1775, December 8, 1775 and
                  April 25, 1776, issues the 10 shilling denominations contained only one erroneous die border, the other being the script border previously
                  used. The printing frame used to impress each sheet of bills containing erroneous side borders held the faces of two 10 shilling bills (Plate
                  A and Plate B), thus putting four erroneous borders in use at one time through March 20, 1771, and two erroneous borders in use at one time in
                  the three above named subsequent issues. <name type="pname">Franklin</name> and <name type="pname">Hall</name> as printer and its successor,
                     <name type="pname">Hall</name> and <name type="pname">Sellers</name>, printed an aggregate of 171,400 bills containing this very obvious
                  error. The erroneous border castings as they wore out or broke were probably replaced with new castings from the same mold, apparently because
                  the error was not considered of sufficient importance to merit engraving a new mold. Perhaps <name type="pname">Franklin</name> concluded that
                  it was a curiosity which people might notice and talk about. It certainly was no deterrent to counterfeiting.</p>

               <p>Instances of decorative cuts being placed in the printing form upside down are uncommon. In the 6 shilling bills of the <name type="place"
                     >Pennsylvania</name> issue of March 20, 1773, the arms of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> on Plate A are upside down as related to
                  the text whereas the arms of Plate B are properly positioned. These arms are both cast from the same mold and a correction could have been
                  made in the course of printing by loosening the printing frame and rotating that element to the proper position in that form. <name
                     type="pname">Hall</name> and <name type="pname">Sellers</name> obviously did not notice the error.</p>
               <p>In the Continental currency issues, the four face border designs contained engraved text in elaborate form. The choice made in positioning
                  those borders on all integral denominations was for the base of their text to be located toward the inside of the note and the top of the text
                  to be on the outside. This would enable some of the bill to be read right side up regardless in what position the face of the bill was held.
                  While this put the bottom border upside down in relation to the central typeset text it conformed to the juxtaposition of the side
                  borders.</p>
               <p>All of the Continental Currency borders on the integral denominations are so placed except the bottom border of the $4 denomination <pb n="68"
                  /> of the May 9, 1776 issue (<ref target="#fig-44">fig. 10</ref>). It reads from the same direction as the central type set text and that
                  border is therefore upside down. So far as is now known this was not corrected until the July 22, 1776 issue when the same border is rotated
                  into its intended position.</p>

               <p>Some few accidental spelling errors in paper money are found more in the cast decorations or in the engraved plates than in the setting of the
                  type. The type setters were naturally more skilled in spelling. When the denomination of the 7 shilling <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
                  issue of May 8, 1740 was spelled "SEAVEN" the engraver must have had his mind on the hereafter. This was not corrected in subsequent redatings
                  of bills printed from that plate. When in <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> the 6 pence bill of February 14, 1743/4 had a portion of its
                  Latin motto spelled "SPEARMUS" instead of "SPERAMUS", the engraver must have been in a belligerent mood. This error, after continued use for
                  that denomination in redated issues was finally corrected in the 1747/8 redating.</p>
               <p>In the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> issue of July 17, 1775, the 1 shilling 3 pence bills were equivalent in
                  stated value to the Spanish pistareen, but "PISTEREEN" was misspelled in the border. This border was used again in the May 6, 1776 <name

                  obviously being influenced by the OW in CROWNS in making his misspelling (<ref target="#fig-45">fig. 11</ref>). In the <name type="place"

               <p>A well known and pervasive spelling error occurred on the Continental Currency fractional dollar issue of February 17, 1776. <name
                     type="pname">Elisha Gallaudet</name> engraved the mold from which the decorative border elements were cast. The misspelling of "CURRENCEY"
                  appears twice on the face of an aggregate of 600,000 notes of $ 1/6th denomination (<ref target="#fig-46">fig. 12</ref>). These $1/6 bills
                  were printed from plates A, B, and C as part of every sheet of that fractional issue. The words "CONTINENTAL CURRENCY" were spelled correctly
                  on all other bills of all issues both before, during and after February 17, 1776. The misspelling occurred in large slanting block letters at
                  the top of the left border. At the top of the left border the "CEY" is black on a white background in plate A while it is white on a black
                  background in plates B and C. No correction was made and no further $1/6 notes were issued.</p>
               <p>This misspelling was compounded and repeated by <name type="pname">Gallaudet</name> in preparing dies for the 1776 Continental Currency
                  coinage. That die sinker had first misspelled "CURENCY" (Obverse 1) and corrected it in making the next die (Obverse 2). His next misspelling
                  was "CURRENCEY" (Obverse 4) repeating what he had done on the paper money. This was noticed and corrected (Obverse 5).</p>

                  modification of "It's" into "'Tis" was made so that it read "'Tis Death to counterfeit this Bill."</p>
               <p>In the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> ¬£2 for the February 16, 1771 bill, the date was written as
                  "February, 16, 1771" with an extra comma (<ref target="#fig-48">fig. 14</ref>). This was noticed and promptly corrected for the balance of the
                  printing run.</p>
               <p>In the April 20, 1781 <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> issue, plate A of the 3d denomination is spelled with "Penee" instead of "Pence."
                  On plate B the spelling is correct. If the colloquial pronunciation of "thrip-penny" was customary the misspelling may be somewhat understood
                     (<ref target="#fig-49">fig. 15</ref>).</p>
               <p>The <name type="place">South Carolina</name> issue authorized on December 23, 1776, was issued in 1777 as printed on the backs, but the
                  typesetter on the $2 and $4 denominations set the authorization date as December 23, 1777 (<ref target="#fig-50">fig. 16</ref>). This was
                  noticed during printing and before the issuance the misdating was changed in ink on those bills which had been printed and the correction made
                  in the printing form for printing the balance of the issue.</p>

               </head>
               <p>An obvious and major spelling curiosity in the printing of the bills of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> is the spelling of the name of
                  the Province with four different variations, <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, <name type="place">Pennsilvania</name>, <name
                     type="place">Pensylvania</name> and <name type="place">Pensilvania</name> (<ref target="#fig-51">fig. 17</ref>). That occurred in at least
                  20 issues over a period of at least 37 years. How early this happened is not now determinable because probative examples of many of the early
                     <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> bills are not known. The August 10, 1739 issue contains the variation, <name type="place"
                     >Pensilvania</name>, and was printed by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</name>. Before <name type="pname"
                     >Franklin</name> began printing <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> bills in 1731 there is no misspelling known. Because <name
                     type="pname">Franklin</name> would not have permitted such misspelling to go uncorrected for so long, the conclusion that the misspelling
                  was deliberate must be assumed.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-51">

               <pb n="72"/>
               <p>The systematic misspellings also indicate a voluntary plan of spelling variation. In the October 1, 1755 issue, at least the second group of
                  four consecutive denominations have four different spellings, the first consecutive group of four possibly having them also, but some bills of
                  that issue are unknown. The pattern in the many subsequent issues up to July 20, 1775, confirms four different spellings for four consecutive
                  denominations and the spellings are customarily in the same order. During this period when two bills (plates A and B) or four bills (Plates A,
                  B, C and D) of the same denomination were printed for any issue the spelling was identical on each bill of the same denomination. Likewise the
                  same denomination of issues of various dates carries the same spelling previously used. Some minor irregularity emerged as new denominations
                  were added, old denominations eliminated, or denominations were provided in other than groups of four.</p>
               <p>In the issue of July 20, 1775, which was the first issue by <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> during the American Revolution, the
                  spelling procedure was changed. There were four denominations, each having two plates. Each of the two plates of the same denomination
                  curiously carried a different spelling. The same four original spelling variations were used in this issue, but the same spelling variation
                  was used only on half of the bills of two of the denominations instead of only on bills of one denomination. The original pattern of variation
                  was restored for the October 25, 1775 emission. When the December 8, 1775 issue appeared, however, both plates of each of the two lowest
                  denominations had the correct spelling while both plates of the two higher denominations used the original variation pattern. By the April 25,
                  1776 issue, each of the three plates of both the 6d and 9d in the four low denomination group carry the identical misspelling PENSYLVANIA,
                  breaking the original pattern; the next four highest denominations, each with two plates for each denomination, have a spelling pattern
                  exactly like the July 20, 1775 issue. During the American Revolution the need for haste in printing money might have taken precedence over the
                  original spelling variation system.</p>
               <p>The misspelling or variation in spelling of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> by the general public in the first three-quarters of the
                  eighteenth century was not unusual. A logical counterfeiter would copy a genuine bill with a misspelling and would not correct it or change
                  it. If however a counterfeiter noticed a misspelling on a bill, that might have discouraged counterfeiting that bill for fear that before the
                  counterfeits could be prepared, corrected bills would have been issued and the error bills announced and withdrawn. Yet some of <pb n="73"/>
                  the denominations had the correct spelling of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>. It appears that counterfeiting protection was not the
                  basic reason for the variations in spelling.</p>
               <p>Possibly the protection sought was to deter alteration of the denomination of a bill by raising it to a higher amount. The denomination to
                  which the bill might be raised would have a different spelling variation from the genuine bill used for alteration. Therefore altering
                  denominations would require extra work to change the spelling or risk entrapment by not changing it. This would discourage the alterer as the
                  work had to be done one bill at a time. Even if the general public would not check the spelling to determine if a bill were raised, certain
                  merchants might check that feature in addition to the treasury officials. The fact that some low denomination bills had the same spelling of
                  the Province name as certain high denomination bills would be offset by a difference in size or design. It must therefore be concluded that
                  the variations in spelling were intended to be alteration deterrents which <name type="pname">Franklin</name> introduced into the printing of
                  money. He must have enjoyed the wonderment he created among the good spellers and the confusion he created for potential denominational
                  alterers. His nature printed backs on bills deterred counterfeiting of the bills he printed and his spelling confusion could have discouraged
                  alteration of them. These ideas to prevent fraud must have been very effective in helping <name type="pname">Franklin</name> convince the
                  authorities to give him, his firm and its successor the printing contracts for paper money.</p>

               <p>A curious correction of the wording of the engraved plates for bills of the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> issue dated May 8, 1740,
                  resulted when the Crown changed the redemption status of the emission. The language of the complete plates ended with "in all payments and in
                  the Treasury." It was ordered that the word "and" should be eliminated, restricting the legal tender meaning. The word "and" was hammered out
                  of some plates, but in others the word "and" had horizontal lines scratched through it. As a result the use of those plates which were redated
                  for several issues thereafter showed a word scratched out.</p>
               <p>Words with a line through them are found in the border ornaments of all <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</name> ¬£5 and ¬£10 bills of December 10, 1737 through May 10, 1746 issues. It is a puzzlement as to why this was done only on the two
                  highest denominations. No help as a counterfeiting deterrent seems logical unless it was felt the <pb n="74"/> counterfeiter would think the
                  lines were only on a few of the bills due to an accident. As an alteration deterrent in raising bills it is of little value because a line
                  could easily be inked in. If the border molds had been considered unsatisfactory and the portion to be redone was so defaced, there could have
                  been a decision to use them nonetheless and not make new molds.</p>

                  punch hammered out his initials I G into the nature print for the $4 denomination (<ref target="#fig-52">fig. 18</ref>). Even though he and
                  later his family as successors to his currency printing put their names as printers on all typeset bills before the American Revolution, <name

               <p>On the 10 shilling <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> bill of 1734, the engraver carefully boxed in the area for the engraved text with

               <p>Handwritten parentheses were used on a 1773 <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> emergency issue to eliminate
                  printed language on unissued currency forms. It had then been hoped that the operation of the James River Bank would be authorized by the
                  crown and specially engraved forms for currency had been received in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> awaiting
                  that approval before issuance. When <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> needed an emergency money issue in 1773,
                  there was no time to wait for normal currency preparation <pb n="75"/> and it was realized that the available <name type="pname">James River
                     Bank</name> forms could be quickly adapted for use by the Colony and Dominion of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928"
                     >Virginia</name> by adding some words to and eliminating some words from these forms. Adding words could be done by handwriting or
                  over-printing but elimination by striking out words would have created an unacceptable appearance. The decision made was to write in the
                  needed text and to bracket out with inconspicuous parentheses the portions not to be effective (<ref target="#fig-54">fig. 20</ref>). The use
                  of parentheses was expedient and barely recognized. The public was only interested in reading the denomination and not the text of the bill.
                  Why imprinting the additions, including he date and denomination, were not undertaken in lieu of tedious extensive handwriting is difficult to
                  fathom. Yet the September 1, 1775 emergency issue using the same leftover forms was filled in by hand but had no elimination of words by
                  parentheses or strike outs. The original solution is apparently unique in numismatic history.</p>

                  one denomination down to one for a denomination. Each bill has a different vignette and there is no relationship between the vignettes and the

               </head>
               <p>When copper plates were engraved by artists for the printing of bills they usually remained in good condition after a print run. If portions
                  became weak the plates usually could be retooled and thus strengthened. When a new issue was authorized and it was determined that the
                  existing plates could be reused, the bills would have to be distinguished easily from a prior issue in circulation. Changing the back of the
                  bill was not as satisfactory as changing the face. Changing the date on the copper plate was first done in 1708 from the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> issue of November 21, 1702. Adding a new date was simpler. This method of redating began
                  in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> when the May 31, 1710 plates were redated 1711 by adding 1711 to a
                  lower right side space without disturbing the original date. This practice continued in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926"
                     >Massachusetts</name> from time to time through 1740 with some bills having 18 redatings (<ref target="#fig-56">fig. 22</ref>). When two
                  issues occurred in the same year, an asterisk or other mark was added after the first used date for that year. <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name>, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> and <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> adopted similar practices of
                  redating. In <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> redating of the face plate was sometimes not undertaken further when there was no more
                  room to add another date and then the date of the new issue would be included in the typeset back. Where old style years were in transition
                  the redating conformed by using dates such as "Mar 14, 1744/5."</p>

                  advertising and notices. They were of various sizes to coordinate with various type sizes. They were used alone or combined for headings,
                  separations, emphasis, borders and other uses to make printed matter more appealing. They came in geometrical, astronomical, linear, floral
                  and other standard designs. They were distinct from scenes, vignettes, arms, insignia, and other special purpose cuts engraved by colonial
                  artists. The standard ornaments were good counterfeiting deterrents because they could be well mixed and not all were readily obtainable.</p>

                  were supposed to remain unnoticed because there were such obvious and highly visible errors, such as an undersized out of line letter in a
                  word with a caret under it; as many as three different type fonts used in each line of text and often twelve different type fonts used in a
                  single bill.</p>
               <p>The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name> typeset bills of July 14, 1780, October 16, 1780 (both series) and March 1,
                  1781, have a group of spelling errors in the higher denominations but with one exception none in the lower denominations. This is clear
                  evidence of an alteration detection plan. BILL is misspelled QILL and DILL; DOLLARS is misspelled DOLLANDS, DOLLARAE, and DOLLAR8; HUNDRED
                  appears as HUNDNED; POUNDS as POUNS; and FIVE as OIVE. The cleverest of these is DOLLAR8, the 8 having the same general appearance as an
                  over-inked S.</p>

               <p>Two color printing was discouraging to counterfeiters and was undertaken in some paper money issues as a deterrent. It was additional work for
                  the printer and an additional burden for the counterfeiter. It began in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> in the
                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</name> colonies when the protective indenture design on the back of the bills of
                     <name type="place">Massachusetts Bay</name> for November 2, 1702, was printed in red. By the issue of November 2, 1708, for which fine
                  paper had been obtained from the Company of Stationers in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, there are large initials
                  A R (<name type="pname">Anna Regina</name>) in ligature (half normal and half mirrored) printed in red on the face of the bills. This same
                  design was used in issues of <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> in 1709 and gave rise <pb
                     n="79"/> to the name "red figured" bills. In <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> in 1717 G R (<name type="pname">Georgius Rex</name>)
                  had been placed on the back of lower denominations and C N H (Colony of <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>) on the back of the upper
                  denominations in similar fashion to the earlier use of initials.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Connecticut</name> in 1713 printed the name of a color on bills and printed that name and an insignia in that color, the
                  balance of the bill being printed in black ink. The committee signatures were to be written by hand with the same color ink as the portion of
                  the bill printed in color. These procedures were totally impractical.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> began multi-color printing of its sage leaf bills with the July 2, 1746 issue
                  by using a combination of some red and some black ink parts to distinguish the higher denominations of ¬£3 and ¬£6 from the lower denominations
                  from 1 shilling to 30 shillings which were printed only in black ink. In the January 26, 1756 issue a further distinction was made by printing
                  only the ¬£6 note in red and black, changing the 30 shilling and ¬£3 notes to all red and leaving the lower denominations in black. In the June
                  22, 1756 issue the faces of the 30 shilling, ¬£3 and ¬£6, being the three highest denominations, were printed in red and black with the back of
                  the ¬£6 note printed in green. In the April 12, 1757 issue only denominations of 15 shillings and above were issued and the faces were all
                  printed in red except the ¬£6 note which was printed in red and black on the face and a continuation of green on the back. By June 14, 1757,
                  another color arrangement resulted in every bill being printed in black except that the face of the ¬£6 was in red and black ink. In November
                  20, 1757 and May 1, 1758 issues all faces of bills were printed in red and black, thus adding 6 shilling bills to the two color category. For
                  the October 20, 1758 issue, the 30 shilling and the ¬£3 bills retained red and black faces but the ¬£6 bill was printed in red and brown on the
                  face and brown on the back. By this time there was no correlation between denomination and color except that bills below 6 shillings were
                  always printed in black and bills of ¬£6 were always in two colors. By the April 10, 1759 issue, the brown color ink was abandoned. In the
                  April 12, 1760 issue, the bills of 6, 12 and 15 shillings went back to black ink only, but by the April 23, 1761 issue, red and black was
                  resumed for 12 shillings and above. The April 8, 1762 issue changed the face of the ¬£6 bill to red and blue which was continued for all the
                  sage leaf issues through March 25, 1776, when the ¬£3 was also printed in red and blue. That issue also brought red and black for the first
                  time to the face of denominations as low as 1 shilling.</p>
               <p>Most of the higher denomination <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> bills continued to circulate until the
                  American Revolution in spite of their original <pb n="80"/> redemption and invalidity dates and are often found torn, dirty, split and patched
                  from extensive use. They are a colorful group of notes nonetheless.</p>
               <p>Although <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> bills had red and black printed text on their face and back by 1759, a remarkable printing
                  skill was demonstrated with the October 1, 1773 issue. A portion of the primary face letter press text of the bill was printed in red in the
                  shape of a symbol for the denomination and was closely surrounded by the balance of the text printed in black. Roman numbers X, XV and L were
                  respectively printed in red on the denomination corresponding to those amounts and a large lower case 1 representing "libra" or "pound" was
                  printed in red within the 20 shilling text. One decorative border on each denomination has its central portion printed in red while the
                  balance of that border is in black. There is perfect registry of the two color wording in the text and in the two color portions of the border
                  design in all bills examined. There is no visible evidence that a separate printing frame was used for each color.</p>
               <p>In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_614540">Georgia</name> red and black ink combinations on bills began in 1765 and involved only
                  certain words being printed in red ink. When the 1776 sterling issue was prepared, the two highest denominations had red and black ink on
                  their faces to distinguish them from lower denominations printed only in black. When the dollar denominations appeared in 1776, the two color
                  principle was restored and colored seals were added by a separate pressing in light blue, orange, green, red and blue-green. In the June 8,
                  1777 issue, the red printed portions at first permitted the "to" in the fourth line of the text of 1, 3, 4, 5 and 8 dollar denominations and
                  the "in" in the fourth line of all integral dollar denominations to remain in black while the balance of the line was in red. This became such
                  a problem in registry for the red impression that the text had to be reset so that the "to" was moved to line 3 and the entire fourth line was
                  set in red rather than only most of it.</p>
               <p>The final issue of Continental Currency of January 14, 1779, was printed in red and black on the face and back. In addition to some borders,
                  an interior portion of the emblem on both face and back was printed in red. There is a very thin white margin around the red portions
                  indicating that they were apparently cut out and removed from the basic frame for black printing and were separated or offset for red
                  printing. This ability to register the sheet for the second printing in a separate printing frame with parts of the devices by the simple use
                  of two projecting nails to put the sheet in an identical position was a masterpiece of printing achievement.</p>

               </head>
               <p>There was often a problem in each issue as to the quantity of each denomination to be authorized as part of the monetary total. The number to
                  be printed of the more needed denominations was far different than the number of less needed denominations. After the monetary total of an
                  issue was determined the printing problems also had to be faced. The sheets of paper for printing bills usually would hold four to sixteen
                  notes depending primarily on the size of the bills. Sometimes an Assembly in setting quantities of each denomination would ignore the
                  printer's problem. If more of the lower denominations were needed than higher denominations this often could be arranged by putting one group
                  on one printing plate or form and the other group on another, and then making a different number of pressings from each. Another solution was
                  to have a combination of denominations on one printing plate with only one of each less needed denomination and more than one of each more
                  needed denomination. This practice could produce different amounts of each denomination from a specific number of sheets of paper. A full
                  sheet had to be printed with each pressing or the waste of paper and labor would be substantial.</p>
               <p>In letter press printing of bills one side of a bill was customarily assembled separately from type, ornaments and insignia. A group of such
                  bills was locked into a printing frame which was slightly smaller than the size of the paper sheet. The backs were blank. If printing two
                  sides of a bill was desired there had to be two pressings to complete a sheet of the bills. If the forms for the faces and their respective
                  backs were both placed facing upward at the opposite sides of the same frame then after one side was printed and dried the sheet could be
                  properly rotated and replaced on the same frame for printing the other side, thereby completing both sides of all bills in the frame.</p>
               <p>To satisfy situations where printing from any frame would not result in the required number of each denomination, a substitution of one or
                  more additional bill forms could be resorted to. In the <pb n="82"/> first Continental Congress issue of the May 10, 1775 session, the
                  authorization of 49,000 each of eight denominations ($1 through $8) on June 22-23, 1775, was a properly planned arrangement for eight faces
                  and eight backs in the frame, but on July 25, 1775, an additional 33,333 bills of $30 denomination were added. Since there was no more room in
                  the frame to solve the problem, a game of musical chairs developed. Pressings of the eight faces and eight backs of the original denominations
                  would have to be done 19,824 times, producing two bills of each denomination for each two pressings. Then the $30 bill form was substituted
                  for the $1 denomination for 4,168 pressings; and similarly for each of the remaining denominations. This produced 33,344 of the $30
                  denomination and 29,176 for each of the other eight denominations. Adding the 29,176 pressings to the 19,824 initial run produced 49,000 of
                  each of the eight lowest denominations. Therefore the total requirements for all denominations would be produced with an aggregate of 53,168
                  (19,824 plus 33,344) pressings. This efficient procedure did not involve the $20 denomination which was of a different size and separately
                  printed on each side, one bill at a time, on marbleized paper obtained from <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin
                     Franklin</name>.</p>
               <p>Another very flexible method of printing different quantities of various denominations was from time to time to change the denomination in an
                  existing printing form by only resetting the denominational text. In this way denominational needs could be quickly and simply met. This
                  procedure was used in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_614540">Georgia</name> during the American Revolution. The design and layout of
                  ornaments on the borders of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_614540">Georgia</name> bills were varied and extensive. The text was short
                  and direct. Whenever one or more denominations were needed the few letters designating the existing denomination would be changed and the
                  border ornaments remained unchanged. Thus the same border ornaments are found in several denominations of the same issue and sometimes in
                  those of different issues. There was little precaution against counterfeiting or alteration using this methodology but <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_614540">Georgia</name> relied on two color printing and colored seals to protect its issues.</p>
               <p>The skills, the endurance, the problems and the accomplishments of the colonial money printers and engravers make one appreciate not only
                     <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</name>'s genius as applied to that field but the amazing ability of many
                  artisans and artists to furnish the colonial public with practical, beautiful and fascinating paper money.</p>

            <p>The late seventeenth and eighteenth century paper money of what is now the <name type="place">United States</name> not only provides a
               provocative field for numismatists primarily interested in specimens for styles, varieties, conditions, dates, etc., these notes also open wide
               research vistas for collectors exploring the politics, commerce and social environment of our nation's early years.</p>
            <p>All American Colonial and State notes were signed and numbered by hand. In some instances they were authorized to pay for the costs of military
               campaigns. At other times they were emitted to fund specific projects including lighthouses, jails, workhouses, etc. Some were issued against
               asset backed loan banks or anticipated tax receipts. Some were simply to provide a supply of currency for daily use and, on occasion, others were
               to replace preceding counterfeited issues or torn or worn bills.</p>

               <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> was late among the 13 colonies to authorize currency. It was the ninth to do so, starting with an issue on

               primarily by physical assets, the issue was redeemable in eight yearly payments. A second issue followed January 17, 1723/4‚Äîand thereafter 36
               more authorizations were approved (see Table 1).</p>

            <p>The evolution of the Colony and the major factors contributing to its development are readily discernible in the signers of its Colonial and

            <p>The signers of Colonial paper money were quite different from the bank officers and public officials that we are accustomed to seeing on later
               bank and government notes. As a whole, <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> colonial currency signers were prominent members of the community,
               especially the early government officers, merchants and industrialists. The Colony's landed gentry, proprietary officials, builders and craftsmen
               also are represented, and the radical Patriot mechanics and shopkeepers are very evident in the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary issues (see
               Table 2).</p>
            <p>Basically, the list of signers is a catalogue of many of the active political, economic and public leaders of early <name type="pname"
                  >Pennsylvania</name>, men who enabled the colony to grow from the sixth largest in 1701 to the largest in 1775 and who stimulated <name
                  type="pname">Philadelphia</name>'s rise to the largest city in <name type="place">North America</name> by 1760. Most were <name type="pname"
                  >Philadelphians</name> and, although the research is not yet complete, substantially more than a majority were members of the Colonial
               assembly and/or State legislature.</p>

            <p>As a group, the signers were younger than commonly might be imagined. Men in their twenties to forties account for a sizeable fraction of the
               total. Quakers and related sects, of course, predominate, stemming from <name type="pname">William Penn</name>'s proprietorship and his early and
               successful efforts at proselytization and colonization. Anglicans comprise a small but important elite group of signers. In part, their <pb
                  n="89"/> presence is a reflection of the conversion of <name type="pname">William</name>'s son and successor, <name type="pname">Thomas
                  Penn</name>, to the Church of <name type="pname">England</name>, and Presbyterians represent a sizeable portion of the remaining, especially
               in the latter days of the colony.</p>
            <p>Overall, it appears that 308 men signed <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> currency from 1723 to 1785 (Table 3). The phrase "it appears" is
               necessary because of the many inconsistencies in eighteenth century handwritten and printed records. Identical names appear frequently. Sons or
               nephews dropped the suffix "Jr." when an elder relative died. More than one branch of a family gave ancestral first names to children, with the
               result that exactly the same names were carried by more than one person of the same generation. At the time that <name type="pname">Major Anthony
                  Morris, Jr.</name> signed the April 3, 1772 <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> issue (<ref target="#fig-60">fig. 1</ref>), there were
               three living <name type="pname">Anthony Morris</name>, Jrs. and three deceased earlier <name type="pname">Anthony Morris</name>, Jrs. Adding
               further to the identification tangle is the variance in names presented in printed records compared with actual signatures. For example, <name
                  type="pname">John Reynell</name>, signer of the June 15, 1767 notes, is listed as <name type="pname">John Reynall</name> in the <name
                  type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> Record Book of Laws. And the ultimate problem is illustrated by <name type="pname">John Davidson</name> who
               signed the April 10, 1777 issue both as <name type="pname">John Davidson</name> and <name type="pname">John Davison</name>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-60">

               <p>1.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>Despite the blemishes, several valid conclusions can be drawn from available statistical data. Almost 59% of <name type="pname"
                  >Pennsylvania</name>'s currency signers are known to have been merchants and businessmen. <pb n="90"/> At first blush, this might seem
               surprising, but, upon review and analysis, it is logical and valid. In 1700, <name type="pname">Philadelphia</name> had a population of 5,000 and
               the Colony 15,000. By 1775, the totals were 35,000 and 300,000, but the number of relatively sophisticated and potentially active citizens in
               economic, political and civic terms was much more limited. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</name>'s papers at the
               American Philosophical Society indicate that about 2,000 people voted in the city of <name type="pname">Philadelphia</name> in 1765, which
               approximated 50% of the adult white males in a community that had an aggregate population in the neighborhood of 25,000. With only a small
               reservoir of competent people to draw upon, it is reasonable to assume that many merchants and businessmen were politically active and most
               probably wore several hats in promoting and serving their own and the general community's interests.</p>
            <p>Other well educated and prosperous segments of <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> society accounted for a substantial majority of the
               remaining non-merchant paper money signers until the Revolution, after which a younger radical Patriot group emerged as a significant factor. Not
               surprisingly, 36 of 72 as yet unidentified signers were new appointees during the 1775-85 period. The disruptions of war, the post-war
               unsettlement, the toppling of the Quaker establishment and rise of a new political order all undoubtedly were contributing factors. Simply
               expressed, it was a time of major change which swept out the old and brought in many new, previously unknown, vigorous personalities.</p>
            <p>Chronologically, <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name>'s paper money issues and signers fall into four distinct periods: 1723-49, 1755-60,
               1764-73, and 1775-85 (see Table 1). Each era evidences its own specific characteristics in addition to common threads that encompass the entire
               62 year span.</p>

               <p>The initial authorization of April 2, 1723, is archetypically representative of the first period, 1723-49. All four signers of the notes were
                  important men on the contemporary scene. <name type="pname">Anthony Morris, Jr.</name> was the fourth member of his family to carry that name.
                  Born in <name type="pname">London</name> March 15, 1661/2, he emigrated to <name type="place">North America</name> in February 1682/3.
                  Extremely active as a merchant/investor, <name type="pname">Morris</name> owned part of a brewing business, participated in at least six iron
                  furnaces and forges, and held several corn and gristmills in addition to being a large landowner. Elected to the <name type="pname"
                     >Philadelphia</name> Common Council in 1715, he also was a member of the <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> Colonial Assembly for five
                  years 1721-26, and the Mayor of <pb n="91"/>
                  <name type="pname">Philadelphia</name> 1738-39. Several other Morrises followed this <name type="pname">Anthony, Jr.</name>, as important
                  figures in <name type="pname">Philadelphia</name> and <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name>'s commercial and political history. A total of
                  ten Morrises signed the Colony's currency including the <name type="pname">Anthony Morris, Jr.</name> of the April 3, 1772 issue who, as a

                  founded a community known as "The Plymouth Friends," was a member of the Colonial Assembly for 11 years between 1704 and 1726 and was

               <p>The second series of <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> paper money issues encompassing the 1755-60 period presents a very different
                  profile from the first group. Although, according to <name type="pname">Henry Phillips</name>, the stated purpose of the initial authorization
                  dated October 1, 1755, was to exchange new notes for torn bills of previous issues, in fact, a large portion of this emission plus the nine
                  others approved between 1756 and 1760 went for military costs incurred during the French and Indian War. Merchants account for more than 60%
                  of the signers with prominent builders, professionals, and landed gentry comprising the remaining identifiable signers.</p>
               <p>Among the commercially important individuals in the group is <pb n="92"/>
                  <name type="pname">John Baynton</name>. <name type="pname">Baynton</name>, a signer of the January 1, 1756 bills (<ref target="#fig-61">fig.

                     >Baynton</name> and <name type="pname">Wharton</name>. However, in 1763, following the expansion of the firm by the addition of <name
                     type="pname">George Morgan</name>, the partnership began to engage in extremely large, speculative undertakings. A total of 300 men, 600
                  packhorses and 65 boats participated in <name type="pname">Baynton Wharton</name> and <name type="pname">Morgan</name>'s illegal expedition
                  into <name type="pname">Illinois</name> Indian country in 1766. This grandiose venture, targeted at trading with the Indians, French fur
                  traders, the British Army and the Department of Indian Affairs, developed into a ¬£120,000 disaster, causing the company to declare bankruptcy
                  with the stresses eventually contributing to <name type="pname">Baynton</name>'s death in 1770.</p>

               <p>Merchants again dominated the 1764-73 issues, accounting for over 70% of the known signers of this group. Some had achieved sizeable wealth by

               <p>Becoming a merchant, however, was not an automatic passport to success. Importing and trading involved taking substantial risks‚Äîand assuming
                  them again and again. The extended span of time between ordering goods and receiving them; the problems of vessel ownership and/or shipping
                  space, the necessity of extension of several months credit for the payment of accounts receivable, and the vagaries of weather and crop
                  harvests were only some of the <pb n="95"/> obstacles that made the financial positions of most merchants both volatile and stressed. <name
                     type="pname">Henry Drinker</name> (signer of the June 18, 1764 notes, <ref target="#fig-63">fig. 4</ref>), of the extremely important
                  trading firm of <name type="pname">James</name> and <name type="pname">Drinker</name>, felt he had acquired sufficient wealth by the age of 42
                  to retire to become a country gentleman, but <name type="pname">Abel James</name>, his partner and signer of January 1, 1756, June 18, 1764
                  and March 10, 1769 notes, remained active and finally went bankrupt in 1784.</p>
               <p>Although there were rapid rises and equally sharp declines in individual careers, Quakers dominated the merchant group with Anglican and
                  several ethnically founded firms also visible as constants.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Philadelphia</name>'s growth into <name type="pname">America</name>'s largest trading city is amply documented by the wide
                  range of destinations of its merchant shipping in the immediate pre-Revolutionary period. Initially focused on <name type="pname"
                     >Britain</name>, with some sailings to the Caribbean, by mid-century <name type="pname">Philadelphia</name>'s vessels were reaching <name

                     type="pname">Portugal</name>. By 1772 the city's merchants were ranging beyond the straits of <name type="pname">Gibraltar</name> to <name
                     type="pname">Leghorn</name>, <name type="pname">Barcelona</name> and <name type="pname">Genoa</name>. <name type="pname">James</name> and

                     <name type="pname">Samuel Meredith</name>, were among the most active. The largest firm, <name type="pname">Willing</name> and <name

               <p>Imperfect research and acceptance by precedent have resulted in some errors in identification of the Colony's currency signers of German
                  origin. During the closing years of the seventeenth century, <name type="pname">William Penn</name> and other Quakers undertook missionary
                  trips to <name type="pname">Germany</name> and as early as 1682, members of a number of German Protestant sects, primarily Mennonites, began
                  to emigrate to <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name>.</p>
               <p>In 1704, <name type="pname">John Jacobs</name> settled in <name type="pname">Van Bebber</name>'s township, a Mennonite community adjacent to
                     <name type="pname">Germantown</name> and there founded a very prominent Quaker family. Two of his grandsons signed <name type="pname"
                     >Pennsylvania</name> currency. <name type="pname">Joseph Jacobs</name>, a <name type="pname">Philadelphia</name> merchant, Treasurer of the

                     <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> notes of April 10, 1777, and three issues of Continental Currency. <name type="pname">John

               <p>In all, 43 signers of <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> currency and Continental Currency were involved in the episode‚Äî21 who were
                  arrested, 16 political and military officials and 6 men who aided the Quakers after their arrest.</p>
               <p>With the signing of the March 16, 1785 issue, the era of <name type="pname">Pennsylvania</name> government emissions came to a close.
                  Thirty-six issues aggregating ¬£2,253,150 had been authorized. In addition, a $1,250,000 emission dated June 1, 1780, carrying the guarantee of
                  the Continental <pb n="100"/> Congress, was payable in Spanish milled dollars and the $300,000 of the March 21, 1783 issue, was payable in
                  undesignated specie.</p>
               <p>It appears highly probable that a substantial majority of currency signers were members of the General Assembly or held other government posts
                  at the time that they signed the authorized bills. Logically, all or virtually all were Philadelphians or residents of neighboring counties.
                  Although merchants dominated the 308 total signers population, the character of the group unquestionably changed substantially during and
                  after the Revolutionary War. Patriot activists, many of whom were minor tradesmen, storekeepers, craftsmen etc., became a much more prominent
                  element. Having taken control of the State's financial affairs including the signing of currency, it is not surprising that half of the
                  presently unidentified signers were active in the 1775-85 period. Despite this deficiency, adequate data is available to supply a provocative
                  and plausible analysis of this aspect of the commercial, political and social history of our Keystone State.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Following cessation of the Revolution, the economy of the American Confederation was in shambles, the nation having been plunged into a
                  serious depression. The country was staggering under an oppressive war debt, the price of credit was high, exports faltered, a massive trade
                  deficit existed, and bankruptcies were commonplace. Although silver and gold were in very short supply, there was an excess of copper money.
                  For years, this small change medium was composed of English coppers but these regal issues, both in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> and its American colonies, had become diluted with large numbers of lightweight, counterfeit
                  halfpence. After the Revolution, the flow of spurious coppers into American commerce resumed as each arriving ship from <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> brought more and more counterfeit copper currency into the country. These false coins were
                  imported at a considerable profit to speculators and it was estimated that this false money comprised from 50 to 95% of the circulating small
                  change medium during the Confederation period. The problem was intensified since the general public was indifferent about these counterfeit
                  coppers which they accepted "without discrimination," together with genuine halfpence, as long as they received the established token value.
                  Legitimate and counterfeit coppers circulated in parallel.<ref target="CH5-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A memorial recorded in the <hi rend="italic">American State Papers</hi> succinctly summarized the situation: <q>The coinage of copper is a
                     subject that claims our immediate attention. From the small value of the several pieces of copper coin, this medium of exchange has been
                     too much neglected. The more valuable metals are daily giving place to base British half-pence, and no means are used to prevent the fraud.
                     This disease, which is neglected in the beginning, because it appears trifling, may finally prove very destructive to commerce.<ref
                        target="CH5-n2">2</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Several state legislatures attempted to curb the economic injury caused by this unrestricted volume of counterfeit coppers, since it was
                  perceived that these false coins were inflicting financial damage especially on the poorer, working classes. In 1781, the <name type="place"
                     >Pennsylvania</name> legislature issued a decree recommending "all the faithfull [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] inhabitants of this State to
                  refuse it [i.e. counterfeit British halfpence] in payment, and by all other lawful ways and means discourage the currency thereof.‚Ä¶" A more
                  definite course was adopted by <name type="place">Vermont</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> in 1785, <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> in 1786, and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> in 1787.
                  These four jurisdictions responded with a <pb n="105"/> plan to replace these spurious coppers with a high grade, pure copper, state coinage
                  on the theory that these new coppers would be received preferentially in commerce and thus drive the lightweight counterfeit imports out of
                  circulation. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> undertook a different stratagem in 1787, demonetizing
                  all coppers less than 145.8 gr and revaluing all others from 14 to 20 per local shilling.<ref target="CH5-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>According to the measure adopted by the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> legislature in 1785, a franchise was granted to the Company for
                  Coining Coppers of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_haven_connecticut">New Haven</name> for the purpose of providing reliable, small
                  change copper coins for the state. The authorized coins were to weigh 144 gr of pure copper and a 5% royalty was due to the state for this
                  monopoly. This coinage spanned from 1785 to 1789 during which period at least five additional illegal mints also participated in the

                  illegal operations which avoided the 5% payment to the state and whose coppers made no attempt to meet the authorized weight of 144 gr.<ref

               <p>The official design chosen for the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers was influenced by the motif on the contemporaneous English
                  halfpence; these in turn, when first minted in 1672, were inspired by the A.D. 140 sestertius of Antoninus Pius commemorating his triumph over
                  the Britons (<ref target="#fig-66">figs. 1</ref>-<ref target="#fig-67">2</ref>).<ref target="CH5-n5">5</ref> This classical numismatic theme

               <p>The die sinker for the Company for Coining Coppers was the well known engraver, <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name>, described by his
                  biographer as "an uncommonly ingenious mechanic." <name type="pname">Buell</name> was a man of many talents with several inventions and
                  accomplishments to his credit. One of his youthful misadventures, however, left him with a cropped ear <pb n="106"/> and branded forehead when
                  convicted for the alteration of paper currency.<ref target="CH5-n6">6</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Buell</name> was responsible for all the 1785-dated <name type="place">Connecticut</name> copper dies with the probable
                  exception of the famous "African head" which appears to be from a different source.<ref target="CH5-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Buell</name> introduced a new design, the Mailed Bust Left, dated both for 1785 and 1786. In preparing these issues, <name
                     type="pname">Buell</name> employed a new technology by which all dies were sunk from a common complex hub so that these several issues were
                  "mechanically identical" with the individual details of punctuation and some ornamentation later strengthened by hand. This was a very
                  advanced procedure for the times and a testament to <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s innovative genius. The hallmark of the Company for
                  Coining Coppers was the large letters in the legends. It is further postulated that the legend ornamentations on <name type="place"
                     >Connecticut</name> coppers, be they crosses, fleurons, cinquefoils, or scrolls, comprise a yet undeciphered code relative to some aspect
                  of the minting process, such as the signature of the die sinker or the mark of the issuing mint.</p>
               <p>In 1786, <name type="pname">Buell</name> next introduced the first of the Draped Bust Left series, a style which was then continued into 1787
                  with some 29 varieties having been identified from the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_haven_connecticut">New Haven</name> mint of
                  the Company for Coining Coppers.</p>
               <p>Another series, struck from <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s hand engraved dies, comprised the 1787 Mailed Bust Left issues. This small group
                  is composed of the very rare 1787 Hercules head and the Miller 8 obverses which were cut by hand and not impressed from a common hub.</p>
               <p>The Company for Coining Coppers ceased its legal operation on June 1, 1787, when the firm was reorganized with <name type="pname">James
                     Jarvis</name> as the principal stockholder. This new business entity was created for the purpose of minting <name type="pname">Fugio</name>
                  cents under a Federal contract. Records do not clearly indicated whether or not the <name type="pname">Jarvis Mint</name> was legally
                  sanctioned to strike <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, but nonetheless, <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> continued production of
                  1787 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers with <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s Draped Bust Left design using Federally owned copper
                  stock embezzled from the <name type="pname">Fugio</name> project. The earlier 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers from the Company for Coining
                  Coppers are distinguishable from the later issues of <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company minted after June 1, 1787, by the size of
                  the lettering; large letters in the legends are characteristic of the former, while smaller letters are found on <name type="pname"
                     >Jarvis</name>'s coins. <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers attributed to <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> also have other
                  features, particularly the cinquefoil and certain letter punches, in common with <name type="pname">Fugio</name> cents.<ref target="CH5-n8"
                     >8</ref>
               </p>
               <p>This attribution of mint based on letter size is supported by examination of the die analysis chart for <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
                  coppers wherein <pb n="107"/> the large lettered 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers are related to the 1786 issues through biennial pairing; 22 of
                  the 29 1787-dated large lettered issues are seen to be die-linked to the earlier 1786 Draped Bust Left Coppers from the Company for Coining
                     Coppers.<ref target="CH5-n9">9</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It appears that <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company continued to mint 1787 small lettered Draped Bust Left coppers from June 1, 1787,
                  until September 1788. It was at this time the fraud in the <name type="pname">Fugio</name> project was uncovered and the Federal contract was
                  voided. The 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers with small lettering are by far the most common <name type="place">Connecticut</name> type coin
                  today, and survivors are about six to eight times more common than their earlier large lettered counterparts from the Company for Coining
                     Coppers.<ref target="CH5-n10">10</ref> Usable Draped Bust Left hubs were combined later with new 1788 reverses and additional coppers
                  illegally struck from an undetermined location, but probably <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>.</p>
               <p>After dissolution of the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> enterprise in September 1788, the engraver, <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name>,
                  fled to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> because of some anxiety on his part relative to the collapse of the
                     <name type="pname">Fugio</name> project. Records indicate that on his departure, <name type="pname">Abel</name> left his son, <name
                     type="pname">Benjamin</name>, in control of his coining interests at a time prior to April 1789. The state legislature subsequently
                  suspended the original authorization to mint coppers effective June 20, 1789.<ref target="CH5-n11">11</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Breen</name> conjectures that <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name> had turned over to his son the existing obverse and
                  reverse hubs of the Triple Leaves <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, which he, the father, had engraved.<ref target="CH5-n12"
                     >12</ref> While these 1787 coppers have well executed central figures impressed from hubs, the finished legends are amateurish with <name
                     type="pname">Fugio</name>-type cinquefoils on many, and certainly are not the work of the senior <name type="pname">Buell</name>. The
                  coppers were probably back-dated "1787" but minted in 1789, a circumstance which is not surprising since commonly the dates on the
                  Confederation coppers are no guarantee as to when the coins were actually struck. These Triple leaves hubs and some old, yet serviceable 1787
                  completed dies later came into the possession of the illegal <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> mint and were used for 1788-dated
                  coppers, a story to be related.</p>
               <p>After <name type="pname">James Jarvis</name> and <name type="pname">Benjamin Buell</name> terminated their minting activities, it is
                  speculated that their usable equipment was procured by <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>. Most <name type="place">Connecticut</name>
                  coppers dated 1788 are attributed to that mint, since none can be positively linked to any authorized facility.<ref target="CH5-n13">13</ref>
                  This explains why <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s Triple Leaves and Draped Bust Left obverse punches appear again on 1788-dated coins. In
                  fact 7 of his old 1787 dies were recombined with new 1788 reverses producing 12 biennially paired combinations. The sponsor of these 1788
                  coppers had no regard for weight standards since <pb n="108"/> these and all other 1788 coppers fall between 112 and 120 gr. Obviously, when
                  coppers were produced in clandestine operations, lightweight coins are expected since by avoiding the 5% royalty and skimping on planchet
                  thickness, a greater profit margin could be realized. The authors of these series were concerned only with personal gain and had no regard for
                  improving the quality of the circulating copper medium. Even though the intrinsic value of all coppers at best was never more than half their
                  monetary value, there was a developing public consciousness concerning the quality and quantity of this copper medium as people were becoming
                  more discriminating as to what they would receive even as token currency. In fact, the addition of these illegal lightweight <name
                     type="place">Connecticut</name> counterfeits to the circulating pool of small change currency only adulterated it further and hastened the
                  demise of the medium during the Coppers Panic of August 1789.<ref target="CH5-n14">14</ref>

               <p>In research for my book,<ref target="CH5-n15">15</ref> I recorded the published weights of all Confederation coppers available to me from the
                  numismatic literature.<ref target="CH5-n16">16</ref> My purpose was to determine how well the various mints achieved their expressed goal of
                  supplying full weight coppers as an alternative to replace the hodgepodge of counterfeit coppers which comprised the majority of the
                  circulating small change medium. I firmly believe that all coinages must be studied from the aspect of contemporary circulating money; in this
                  instance did these coppers satisfy the popular demand for a good quality token currency? For <name type="place">Connecticut</name> the
                  standard weight for copper money was 144 gr, in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> it was 157.5, while in
                     <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> it was 150. Such a gravimetric analysis would accomplish two objectives:
                  first of all I could determine whether the various legal state or contract mints actually delivered to their citizens the full weight coppers
                  they promised; and secondly I could look for weight variation within specific issues. If coin weights were inconsistent within the same type,
                  this would suggest the presence of more than one planchet population. Such a variation could result from a change in planchet production, an
                  alteration in minting techniques, or perhaps a different mint or sponsorship over the workable life of the dies.</p>

               <p>In a weight analysis, the counterfeits from the several illegal mints were all well below the authorized weight, averaging mostly in the range
                  of 115 to 120 gr, except for the slightly heavier Muttonheads at 132 gr. The error recorded is the first standard deviation, which is an
                  expression of the variation in coin weights around the mean. The greater the first standard deviation, the greater the range in planchet
                  weights. These counterfeit <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coins did not contribute in the least to the improvement of the lightweight
                  copper medium but rather degraded it further.</p>
               <p>The current study concerns a detailed weight analysis only of those coppers struck from dies engraved by <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name>.
                  These specimens include: 1) the 1785 to June 1787 issues from the Company for Coining Coppers; 2) the June 1787 to September 1788 output of
                  the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> mint; 3) those 1787-dated Triple Leaves varieties probably manufactured in 1789 from a yet undiscovered
                  location; and 4) those 1788 coppers made from old 1787 obverses or new dies from <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s central hubs but finished
                  by other unknown individuals <pb n="110"/> and minted at an illegal facility. These particular issues have been selected since the engraver is
                  known, in many instances the mint is relatively certain, the census represents all the legally minted coppers, and there are sufficient
                  specimens for a meaningful analysis.</p>
               <p>Now that we have seen that coppers from illegal mints fell far below the standard, the first question can now be asked, how well did the
                  Company for Coining Coppers succeed in achieving the authorized 144 gr?</p>

               <p>All 294 1785 and 1786 dated specimens from the Company for Coining Coppers, except the 1786 Draped Bust Left issues, can be combined as a
                  homogeneous weight group at 135.3 ¬± 11.2 gr (p = 0.1452). Of importance, the first fifteen months' output from the legal mint falls below the
                  authorized standard of 144 gr and is just barely within the limits of error. This deficiency is evident on the respective histograms (<ref

               <p>The rare 1787 Mailed Bust Left issues from hand engraved dies are few in number with only 27 specimens in this study, but average weight of
                  this small sample is very good.</p>
               <p>The new style Draped Bust Left coppers, first introduced in 1786, are very rare for that year with only 18 recorded weights available to me.
                  Although these preliminary results suggest this group is much heavier than the required 144 gr, more specimens must be examined to determine
                  the level of significance for this finding. For the following year, 1787, however, the Draped Bust Left with the larger letters from the
                  Company for Coining Coppers are much more common and this group reaches the authorized standard both by statistical analysis (p = 0.6787) and
                  within range of error at ¬± 11.6 (<ref target="#fig-71">fig. 5</ref>).</p>
               <p>After June 1, 1787, all legal coppers came from the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company mint whose legends are characterized by the
                  smaller lettering. It was discovered on examination of the weights for the 1787 small lettered <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> varieties that
                  this is not a homogeneous population.</p>

               <p>Those varieties with crosses in both the obverse and reverse legends with Miller attribution obverses 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 38 and 45 with
                  the "g," "CC," "DD," "FF," and "GG" reverses weigh 145.0 ¬± 12.7 gr and exceed the legal requirement.<ref target="CH5-n17">17</ref> The
                  histogram has the suggestion of a double distribution but no specific varieties are found to coincide with either peak (<ref target="#fig-73"
                     >fig. 6</ref>).</p>
               <p>The other subgroup which is distinctly heavier than the usual 1787 Draped Bust Left are the varieties with "fleurons" in their obverse and
                  reverse legends. These ornamental fleurons vary in size and composition indicating that different punches were used to convey the required
                  code, whatever it be. These coppers weighed 142.0 ¬± 11.6 gr and are in agreement with the 144 standard (p = 0.0511). This group includes
                  Miller 1787 obverses 34, 36, 37, 39 and 56 together with reverses "e," "h," "i," "k," "l," "cc," "ee," "ff," "HH," and "RR."<ref

               <p>When these two heavier groups are removed from the entire 1787 Draped Bust Left population with small letters, the average weight of the
                  coppers comprising the residual 135 varieties was only 134.6 ¬± 12.0 gr.<ref target="CH5-n21">21</ref> The difference between this average
                  weight of 134.6 gr and the 144 gr standard has statistical significance, although this disparity falls within the limits of the first standard
                  deviation of ¬± 12.0 gr (<ref target="#fig-77">fig. 8</ref>).</p>
               <p>This large group of Draped Bust Left coppers is by far the most common <name type="place">Connecticut</name> type, with the populous 33-Z
                  family alone accounting for 62 or more separate varieties. These coppers have characteristic cinquefoils, a design with five leaves, on both
                  obverse and reverse. This same ornamentation was also used on the <name type="pname">Fugio</name> coppers from the same mint.</p>
               <p>When the 1787 dated Triple Leaves coppers were inspected according to weight, two distinct populations became apparent. The individual die
                  combinations responsible for the second peak are easily identified as 1787 2-B, 11.1-E, 11.2-K, and the rare 11.3-K. This group has been
                  described by <name type="pname">Breen</name> as a "New Hub, Leaves in Triplets <pb n="115"/> with paired berries, Large Letters and Small
                  Dates" (<ref target="#fig-79">fig. 9</ref>).<ref target="CH5-n22">22</ref> The high first standard deviation is an acknowledgement that there
                  was a wide range in planchet weight due to less exact manufacturing precision than available at the Company for Coining Coppers or its
                  successor, <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> and Company. An interesting rare mule exists, Miller 1787 37.6-B, which combines a fleuron obverse
                  with a Triple Leaves reverse, but this marriage could have occurred at a later time.<ref target="CH5-n23">23</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The 10 1787 Light Triple Leaves varieties are alike in weight to the non-overstruck 1788 Triple leaves at 121.0 ¬± 16.1 gr (p = 0.4673; Table
                  1). This suggests a similar planchet fabric which is neither that from the Company for Coining Coppers nor the <name type="pname"
                     >Jarvis</name> facility (<ref target="#fig-81">fig. 10</ref>).</p>
               <p>The 1788 dated Draped Bust Left issues, while using <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s hubs, are considerably lighter than any previous coppers
                  of the same design with an average of 118.7 ¬± 14.7 gr (Table 1), a value which is nearly identical for the previous light 1787 and 1788 Triple
                  Leaves samples (<ref target="#fig-83">fig. 11</ref>).</p>
               <p>The results of this gravimetric analysis of <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers can now be summarized in a chronological

               <p>Now what conclusions can be drawn from these data? These weight variations are obviously a reflection of inconsistencies in planchet
                  preparation. Planchet production, itself, was probably the greatest challenge facing the early mintmaster using the primitive <pb n="118"/>
                  equipment available.<ref target="CH5-n24">24</ref> While planchet diameter was a function of the diameter of the cutter, the most difficult
                  chore was to roll the copper fillets to the correct thickness from which to cut flans. The more the copper stock was rolled, the more work
                  hardened it would become; consequently it would require repeated annealing, or softening, for all subsequent passes through the rollers and
                  prior to striking. Generally planchet diameters were consistent and any slight variation could be a matter of the pressure exerted by the
                  coining press. It is known that multiply struck coins without collars have a wider diameter. The Tower Mint permitted a 2.5 to 3.33% weight
                  tolerance for coppers struck there, but it is not recorded what remedy was allowed the Confederation mintmasters.<ref target="CH5-n25"
                     >25</ref> What level of precision can we reasonably anticipate from these early mints? Even if a 5% tolerance were postulated, then the
                  acceptable range would be 136.8 to 151.2 grains.</p>

               <p>As a group, the 1785 and 1786 Mailed Bust Right and Mailed Bust Left coppers fell 6.66% below the statutory requirement. Then into <pb n="119"
                  /> 1786, and until its dissolution on June 1, 1787, full weight coppers were the rule for the Company for Coining Coppers.</p>
               <p>In my opinion, it is unlikely that in 1785, the newly franchised Company for Coining Coppers would have embarked on a program of deception so
                  early in its career. I believe that the initial emissions for the first 15 months were underweight because of technical problems in rolling
                  the sheet copper to the proper thickness. When the geometry of these coppers is calculated, it becomes apparent that thickness of the copper
                  fillets is very crucial in determining weight. Assuming a constant diameter of 28 mm and the density of the copper stock to be 8.84 g per
                  cubic cc,<ref target="CH5-n26">26</ref> then the thickness required for a 144 gr coin is 1.71 mm. If the planchet stock were only 0.10 mm
                  thinner, or the approximate thickness of a sheet of paper,<ref target="CH5-n27">27</ref> then the coins produced would weigh 135.3 gr, or the
                  average of the 1785 and 1786 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers. It appears that into 1786 and 1787, these mechanical problems with
                  proper roller spacing were overcome, since then coppers of required weight were manufactured at the Company for Coining Coppers.<ref
                     target="CH5-n28">28</ref> So in at least the last six months of its life (until June 1787), this legal mint produced Mailed Bust Left and
                  Draped Bust Left coppers which met the legislative challenge to replace lightweight counterfeits with quality, full weight, state coppers.</p>
               <p>Within the 1787 large lettered Draped Bust Left population from the Company for Coining Coppers, there are several varieties with crosses or
                  "√ó's" in their legends, depending on the rotation of the figure. A similar design is on <name type="pname">Jarvis</name>'s small lettered
                  Draped Bust Left coppers with crosses and both populations of coins are of good weight.</p>
               <p>Since the legend design contains some code, which <name type="pname">Breen</name> has suggested reveals the identities of "the different
                  workman who completed the dies from <name type="pname">Buell</name>'s hubs," the common theme in legend ornamentation and the near equal
                  planchet weights implies that they were issued in sequence, and/or were from the same sponsor who had regard for the authorized standard.
                  Supported by other collateral evidence, <name type="pname">Breen</name> has placed the small lettered cross varieties as the first group
                  emitted from the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> mint stating that "the group with crosses came first because cross ornaments were used on
                  earlier Company (i.e. Company for Coining Coppers) dies."<ref target="CH5-n29">29</ref> The gravimetric evidence is compatible with that
                  conclusion.</p>
               <p>The other sample of small lettered 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers of acceptable weight is that group with fleurons. <name type="pname"
                     >Breen</name> has indicated that this fleuron group falls in an intermediate position between the earlier cross and the final cinquefoil
                  coppers. As mentioned, <pb n="120"/> several varieties share obverse fleurons and reverse crosses and are die-linked with the cross group
                  (24-g.5 and 48-g.5; 24-g.5, 24-FF and 53-FF).</p>

               <p>At the lower end of the weight spectrum are the lightest 1787 Draped Bust Left coppers with cinquefoils, a design that is shared with the
                     <name type="pname">Fugio</name> cents. <name type="pname">Breen</name> has written that this large group comprises the last 1787-dated
                  emissions from the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> Mint. This largest category of all <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, Division
                  III in the 1975 EAC catalogue, is characterized by "incredible haste and carelessness" in its production manifested by defective planchets,
                  early die breakage, and corrected and uncorrected blunders in the legends.<ref target="CH5-n30">30</ref> Another circumstance which suggests
                  they were the last issues is the observation that two Division III obverses are found biennially paired with 1788-dated issues.</p>
               <p>The average weight of the 610 specimens with cinquefoils in this study was 6.5% below the standard. Since we know that their predecessors in
                  business, the Company for Coining Coppers, had <pb n="121"/> been capable of full weight coppers, and being aware of <name type="pname"
                     >Jarvis</name>'s reputation regarding the <name type="pname">Fugio</name> contract, my interpretation is that this deficiency was quite
                  purposeful in order to augment profits. The full weight of the preceding three populations of Draped Bust Left coppers and the 1787 Mailed
                  Bust Left issues indicates that the technology was available at the time for <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> to roll the fillets to the
                  required 1.71 mm but he chose to ignore it. If the standard deviation of the average weight of his coppers was particularly high, then one
                  might reason that his machinery was flawed and imprecise, and/or the copper purity uncontrolled, but the standard deviation for all these
                  issues is similar, indicating a relative consistency in planchet weight. Such business practices which promoted lightweight coins caused
                  further deterioration of the copper medium. The <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> mint was capable of producing heavier planchets since the
                     <name type="pname">Fugio</name> coppers were minted by the same establishment, presumably from the same copper stock but rolled to a
                  different thickness. The 667 specimens reported in a recent <hi rend="italic">CNL</hi> database averaged 150.0 ¬± 12.7 gr, or 4.8% below the
                  157.5 gr Federal standard.<ref target="CH5-n31">31</ref>
               </p>
               <p>For the 1788-dated Draped Bust Left coppers, the average weight was well below standard and these coins were the product of an illegal
                  operation. This proposed emission sequence demonstrates that the 1787-dated <name type="place">Connecticut</name> Draped Bust Left coppers
                  while starting off with good weight under the auspices of the Company for Coining Coppers, then deteriorated in quality with the passage of
                  time, which by inference was due to changing business practices within the operating mint.</p>
               <p>The 1787 Triple Leaves also contain two distinct populations, lighter ones well below the legal requirement, and a heavier grouping which
                  meets it. Both averages have a high first standard deviation which is an indication of a wide range in planchet weights. This variation is
                  doubtless the result of difficulty in rolling the copper stock to a consistent thickness. These planchets are so different from those
                  attributed to the Company for Coining Coppers and the <name type="pname">Jarvis</name> Company, they must have been the product of some yet
                  unidentified mint. It becomes a matter of conjecture in this instance whether full weight coins are an indication of altruism on the part of
                  the mintmaster or rather the result of an imperfect technology due to the inability to roll the fillets any thinner. The fact that the heavier
                  coins have been isolated by <name type="pname">Breen</name> as a specific group raises the possibility that this one segment of the 1787
                  Triple Leaves dies was struck independently of its lighter peers. The lighter 1787 issues are equal in weight to 1788-dated Triple Leaves
                  coppers, suggesting a common source. The presence of these two distinct populations <pb n="122"/> of 1787 Triple leaves may be explained by an
                  earlier theory advanced by <name type="pname">Breen</name>. It was his conjecture that for a brief time <name type="pname">Benjamin
                     Buell</name> struck coppers from his father's dies before relinquishing the equipment to <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>. One
                  could elaborate further on this plausible scenario and suggest that the full weight 1787 Triple Leaves were made first by <name type="pname"
                     >B</name>uell and the lighter ones later came from <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name>. This proposal is further strengthened by the
                  observation that the heavy 1787 obverse Miller 11.1 is later reused at <name type="pname">Machin's Mills</name> in 1788 as Miller obverse 7,
                  producing coppers 20 gr lighter.<ref target="CH5-n32">32</ref>
               </p>
               <p>This paper has concentrated its emphasis on coin weight. One may reasonably ask, "Why all the concern about a 15% deficiency in the weight of
                  a non-legal tender copper token which at best has only 50% intrinsic value?" "If a copper were only a token and received for a regulated
                  value, what difference could it make whether the piece be genuine or counterfeit?" "Who would have cared if the rollers were offset by a few
                  tenths of a mm and one token were slightly heavier than another?" All these are appropriate questions which can be answered by reading the
                  newspaper accounts and the legislative actions of the late 1780s.<ref target="CH5-n33">33</ref> Those contemporaneous sources had much to say
                  about the intrinsic worth of circulating coppers and considered that underweight coins cheated the public. While for years there was little
                  attention paid to the composition of the copper medium, a definite concern evolved which I believe occurred when the accumulation of
                  lightweight coppers reached such surplus proportions that people could not dispose of them in commerce since they could not be spent for large
                  purchases or used in overseas transactions. The collapse of the copper medium occurred in the summer of 1789.</p>

                     the Company for Coining Coppers where their weight deficiency is thought to have arisen from imperfect rolling technology rather than
                     purposeful deception.</item>
                  <item n="2.">Economic manipulations to augment profits. This was the case for all illegal mints that skimped on coin weight and likewise
                     avoided the 5% royalty. The high standard deviation of the average weights also confirms planchet inconsistency. In addition to the obvious
                     planchet production problems, these illegal mints intentionally produced lightweight coppers. In regard to <pb n="123"/> the <name

                     quality deteriorated. Into 1788, all coppers were deficient in weight even though many of the dies were originally form an authorized

                  harmony with the earlier work of <name type="pname">Breen</name> reported in the oft-quoted 1976 ANS publication. In my opinion, this current
                  report has barely scratched the surface but has defined areas for future investigation using such modern technologies as photographic
                  superimposition for die punch examination and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry for planchet composition analyses to determine
                  common copper sources. <name type="pname">Damon Douglas</name> was correct as he challenged us to continue investigation into this fascinating
                  era of numismatics.</p>

               <p>There are few early American coins that can rival the public celebrity enjoyed by <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>'s <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons. The "<name type="pname">Brasher</name> Doubloon" has
                  been featured in popular detective genre novels, on television dramas, and in motion pictures. It has become the archetype for the valuable
                  coin in the public imagination. The appearance of a specimen at auction creates more publicity than any other coin offering, and the prices
                  realized for <name type="pname">Brasher</name> doubloons far exceed those of rarer and more historically important coins. It is, perhaps, the
                  most notorious of all early American issues, yet remains today one of the least studied.<ref target="CH6-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Another gold coin type which bears an "EB" counterstamp has been known for nearly a century, the so-called "<name type="place">Lima</name>
                  style" doubloon. Apart from a few auction catalogue descriptions of indifferent usefulness, and a report by the American Numismatic Society
                  published in 1915, even less of value has been written about this putative <name type="pname">Brasher</name> product. Today, a seemingly more
                  impenetrable aura of mystery surrounds the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon than the more familiar <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style type. It has attracted none of the public attention that has fastened upon the
                  latter, and among serious collectors of early American coins little is known or understood about it.<ref target="CH6-n2">2</ref>
               </p>
               <p>This study will examine and analyze the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon in some depth. The few prior references to the type will
                  be examined, to place the present study into its proper historiographical context.<ref target="CH6-n3">3</ref> Minute descriptions of both
                  obverse and reverse dies, together with their individual elements, including the "E.B" counterstamp, will be presented later. Finally, the
                  paper will offer previously unpublished information about this issue, primarily of a technical nature, that may suggest something about it
                  based more on scientific numismatic techniques than on the imprecise descriptions of its gross physical characteristics typical of earlier
                  studies.</p>

               <p>This was, to say the least, a somewhat laconic description, particularly the reference to the rarity of the coin, since no other was then
                  known and this was the first time the type had been introduced to the numismatic public. Readings of the peripheral legends were not included,
                  an important part of the <name type="pname">Brasher</name> signature was overlooked, and no attempt to contrast the piece with the regular
                     <name type="place">Lima</name> Mint doubloon of the period was made. In an era of auction cataloguing not usually known for its depth,
                     <name type="pname">Scott</name>'s description stands as an exemplar of understatement.</p>
               <p>The "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>" specimen appears to have attracted little attention at the time, and between
                  1894 and 1915 no further references to the newly discovered type are recorded. It seems largely to have been forgotten by collectors and
                  serious numismatists, perhaps due to its extreme rarity. In fact, its very existence was later overlooked by every specialist in early
                  American coins save one.</p>

               <p>The <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon was "rediscovered" late in 1914, when Waldo Newcomer acquired the second known specimen
                     (<ref target="#fig-86">fig. 2</ref>). <pb n="130"/>
                  <name type="pname">Newcomer</name> submitted the new specimen to the ANS for examination by the Committee on <name type="place">United
                     States</name> Coins. Comprised of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_6372710">William H. Woodin</name>, <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#viaf_75915787">Wayte Raymond</name>, and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_adams_edgar">Edgar H. Adams</name>, the
                  committee studied the piece and published its findings in 1914.<ref target="CH6-n5">5</ref> The report is worth quoting at length, since it
                  was the earliest careful examination of the new type and has not been improved upon by later writers. After describing the circumstances of
                  its "discovery," the report went on: <q>On the obverse of the piece, around the border reads what seems to be PHILIP V. D. G. H. REX ANO 17
                     (00, or 80). In the center of the field, which is surrounded by a large circle of pearls, are two columns, representing the pillars of
                     Hercules, each of which is surmounted by a fleur de lis. Above is a flowered ornament. In three lines, running across the columns, is the
                     inscription L. 8. V. | P. V. A. | 7. 4. 2. Below the columns are four lines representing waves of the sea, and below these is the word
                        <name type="pname">BRASHER</name>. Still further below, between D. G. and H. of inscription, are the letters N. Y. The reverse shows a
                     cross of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</name>, quartered with castles and lions. In the center of the field is
                     counterstamped E B. Around the border is inscribed HISPANIARUM ET IND REX. The piece weighs 409 3/4 grains.</q>
                  <q>From a careful examination, it is certain that the whole coin design was entirely fabricated outside of any authorized Spanish mint, and
                     the stamp of <name type="pname">BRASHER N Y</name> must have appeared in the original die, although the counterstamp E B was added after
                     the piece had been struck, and seems to be exactly like the stamps of this assayer which have been examined on the various <name
                        type="pname">Brasher</name> doubloons and other gold coins, usually of Spanish or Portuguese origin, which have appeared from time to
                        time.<ref target="CH6-n6">6</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The report went on to speculate about the origin of the newly "discovered" type, as well as the more familiar <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style <name type="pname">Brasher</name> gold coins, concluding that their existence
                  suggested that <name type="pname">Brasher</name> operated a private mint that struck gold coins of the approximate weight of the then current
                  Spanish 8 escudos. The authors very carefully avoided the appearance of authenticating the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon they
                  studied, but left their readers with the distinct impression that they favored such a conclusion.<ref target="CH6-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>One of the authors of the report, <name type="pname">Adams</name>, was not as circumspect when he recounted the "discovery" for the popular
                  numismatic <pb n="131"/> press.<ref target="CH6-n8">8</ref> In what began as a reiteration of the ANS committee's report, <name type="pname"
                     >Adams</name> went on to assert that: <q>
                     <name type="pname">Brasher</name> very likely struck the goldpiece first described [i.e., the <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                     doubloon] for circulation in the American Colonies, rather than in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3571219">West Indies</name>,
                     and it may be that his issue of the <name type="pname">Brasher</name>
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> Doubloon was suggested by the piece which has been acquired by
                        <name type="pname">Mr. Newcomer</name>. Considering all that we know regarding these pieces, it would seem as if there was, after all,
                     some plausibility to the theory that the New York Doubloon was actually intended to be circulated in the American Colonies at the value of
                     a Spanish doubloon, as we had no gold currency of our own in 1787. The discovery of this goldpiece, bearing the name and address of <name
                        type="pname">Brasher</name>, is undoubtedly one of the most important of late years, and will make American numismatists all the more
                     eager to learn additional facts regarding the operations of America's first private gold coin maker.<ref target="CH6-n9">9</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Adams</name> clearly accepted the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon as <name type="pname">Ephraim
                     Brasher</name>'s handiwork, a conclusion he may have come to as a member of the ANS committee but been reluctant to publish as such. More
                  importantly, <name type="pname">Adams</name> believed that the <name type="place">Lima</name> style piece had been struck before the <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style issue, and that it somehow "suggested" the striking of the latter.
                  He did not, however, pursue this possible emission sequence further. A rather simple means of testing such a conclusion will become an
                  important feature of this present paper.</p>
               <p>In 1922, <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl</name> offered the "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>" Collection specimen as
                  lot 375 of his sale of the <name type="pname">James Ten Eyck</name> Collection.<ref target="CH6-n10">10</ref> Although, as <name type="pname"
                     >Lyman Haines Low</name> had already pointed out, <name type="pname">Mehl</name>'s was not the first auction description of the <name
                     type="place">Lima</name> type, it was the lengthiest, and incorporated sections of <name type="pname">Adams</name>'s 1915 notice of the
                  piece quoted above. Nothing further of an original nature was included in <name type="pname">Mehl</name>'s masterful catalogue description,
                  however, save for a suggestion that the date following ANO on the obverse might read 1703 (the ANS committee had earlier suggested readings of
                  1700 or 1780). <name type="pname">John Work Garrett</name> purchased the "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>"-<name
                     type="pname">Ten Eyck</name> coin, but later sold it back to <name type="pname">Mehl</name> in order to purchase from <name type="pname"
                     >Mehl</name> the <name type="pname">Newcomer</name> "discovery" specimen, the finer of the two.</p>
               <p>Thirty-five years later, <name type="pname">A.M. Kagin</name> authored an impressionistic essay on the <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                  doubloon, apparently inspired both by his purchase of the "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>"-<name type="pname">Ten
                     Eyck</name>-<name type="pname">Garrett</name>-<name type="pname">Mehl</name>-<name type="pname">Green</name> specimen for a client, and by

                  <name type="pname">Kagin</name>'s essay reprinted the earlier <name type="pname">Mehl</name>/<name type="pname">Ten Eyck</name> catalogue
                  description, together with the story of <name type="pname">Kagin</name>'s own attraction to <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s products, but
                  also added something new.<ref target="CH6-n12">12</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Kagin</name> suggested that <name type="pname">Brasher</name> cut the dies for the <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                  doubloon in 1792, while in the employ of the U. S. Mint as a freelance assayer, and that the 1742 date on the <name type="place">Lima</name>
                  issue was chosen to "correspond" with the then calendar date 1792. <name type="pname">Kagin</name> evidently overlooked the remnants of a
                  second, different date on the obverse of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style piece and discarded <name type="pname">Mehl</name>'s
                  suggestion of 1703 and the ANS committee's earlier readings of 1700 or 1780. However, no evidence of any but a subjective nature was offered
                  for <name type="pname">Kagin</name>'s 1792 dating of the type.</p>
               <p>The <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon was first listed in the 10th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Guidebook</hi> (1957), and for
                  the next three years following. It was listed finally in the 14th edition (1961), but now dated 1792-1742, apparently following <name
                     type="pname">Kagin</name>'s unsubstantiated earlier suggestion, and with the proviso "New evidence indicates that it may be a fabrication
                  of a much later date."<ref target="CH6-n13">13</ref> Although the "evidence" referred to was not published, the <name type="place">Lima</name>
                  style doubloon was subsequently dropped from the listings in the 15th through 43rd editions (1962-90). In the most recent, 44th edition (as of
                  this paper), a note about the type reads "A mystery also surrounds the origin and intent of the 1742 '<name type="place">Lima</name> Style

               <p>To commemorate the bicentennial of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloon's date, <name

                  sequence was the sole explanation for the striking of the two very different types. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander"
                     >Alexander</name> referred to the analytical tests done on the <name type="pname">Garrett</name>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons six years earlier,
                  and argued that because the metallic contents were the "same," both types must necessarily be "fabrications of a much later date" or both must
                  be genuine.<ref target="CH6-n24">24</ref> He concluded by stating "The scientific evidence strongly suggests that both types of doubloon were
                  struck by <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name> in 1787," echoing <name type="pname">Breen</name>'s dating, discarding <name type="pname"

                     >Alexander</name> and <name type="pname">Thomas K. Delorey</name> in 1990.<ref target="CH6-n27">27</ref> The editors repeated the

                  style doubloons, but by 1990 had no hesitancy in accepting the latter as a genuine <name type="pname">Brasher</name> product. While the <name
                     type="pname">Garrett</name> cataloguers stated that the metallic analyses of the two showed them to be "virtually identical," the word
                  "virtually" was omitted from this new characterization of the test results.<ref target="CH6-n28">28</ref> More importantly, a reference was
                  included that seemed to prove the authenticity of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon beyond any shadow of a doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and <name type="pname">Delorey</name> stated that "Through exacting photo
                  overlay analysis, numismatist <name type="pname">John J. Ford, Jr.</name> showed that the <name type="place">Lima</name> coin's EB punch was
                  identical to that of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> pieces, but in an earlier state of wear,
                  proving the <name type="place">Lima</name> style pieces to have been struck before the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                     York City</name> issues."<ref target="CH6-n29">29</ref> Unfortunately, the editors did not provide any references as to when such identity
                  had been established, where the narrative results of the photo overlay analysis had been published, or to whom Ford had shown the necessary
                  film prints.<ref target="CH6-n30">30</ref> That controversy still surrounds the authenticity of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                  doubloons suggests that such definitive evidence has not been widely disseminated, if at all.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing, it is clear that the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons have not enjoyed the same general acceptance as have
                  the more familiar <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style pieces. From the discovery of the first
                  specimen in 1894, until the type's authenticity was challenged in 1961, the general consensus of opinion favored the <name type="place"
                     >Lima</name> style as a genuine product of <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>'s workshop, even if its purpose and timing were
                     unsettled.<ref target="CH6-n31">31</ref> After 1962, the type was no longer carried in the popular handbooks until 1990, when an equivocal
                  listing appeared in one and a less than reliable acceptance in another. Although the evidence offered against the <name type="place"
                     >Lima</name> style doubloon in 1961 has never been published, proponents for and against its authenticity appear to have adopted a
                  partisanship that is not gentle with the numismatic facts.</p>
               <p>The emission sequence of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                  doubloons has also been unsettled recently. <name type="pname">Adams</name>, who accepted the <name type="place">Lima</name> style pieces
                  without hesitation, believed in 1915 that they had been struck before the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</name> style doubloons. <name type="pname">Kagin</name> suggested a much later date, without sound basis. <name type="pname"
                     >Breen</name> posited in 1958 that the <name type="place">Lima</name> style was struck after the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style, and repeated his assertion in 1988. <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_alexander">Alexander</name> and <name type="pname">DeLorey</name>'s note in 1990 regarding the photographic overlay
                  analysis seemed to mark a return to <name type="pname">Adams</name>'s earlier sequence, but if the evidence were to be accepted, on a much
                  sounder basis than before.</p>
               <p>Only on one point do all the published accounts of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style <pb n="135"/> agree. All previous writers have
                  adopted <name type="pname">Adams</name>'s opinion that the <name type="place">Lima</name> style, as well as the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style pieces, were made for local, <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and environs, circulation, and not for export to the West Indies or elsewhere.<ref
                     target="CH6-n32">32</ref> Clearly, it is time to reevaluate the evidence pro and con the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon's
                  authenticity, and to do so in as impartial a fashion as is possible, avoiding the partisan enthusiasm of its supporters and the regrettable
                  silence of its opponents. There is a considerable body of evidence about the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon which has been
                  alluded to in various of the sources noted above, but which has never been published in an open forum, subject to scrutiny and challenge.
                  There is an even larger, unpublished body of technical information which has only recently been evaluated. The <name type="place">Lima</name>
                  style doubloons are a far more interesting, indeed, curious, coinage than has been suspected before. The type's stylistic intricacies, method
                  of manufacture, dating, even the correct reading of its legends, all the truly important features of concern to the numismatist, have been
                  overlooked since its discovery. It is the author's expectation that the conclusions of this study will be seen as an effort toward a better
                  grounded understanding of a coinage which has unfortunately become a pawn in a factious dispute.</p>

               <p>The gross physical characteristics of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon have never been thoroughly and accurately published,
                  despite the apparent care taken by the authors of the 1914 ANS committee report. This oversight extends even to the simple transliteration of
                  the legends, particularly the reverse's. In addition, the style of letter and numeral punches on both sides has not been described. The "E.B"
                  counterstamp has been claimed as identical to that found on the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style
                  doubloons, but the evidence for this assertion has not been published.</p>
               <p>Although two specimens are known, only one, the <name type="pname">Newcomer</name>-<name type="pname">Garrett</name> coin, is well-enough
                  preserved to offer legible peripheral inscriptions. The other, the original discovery piece, lacks peripheral legends although the central
                  devices on both sides are complete. Since they are both from the same dies, the descriptions that follow are based upon examination of the
                     <name type="pname">Newcomer</name>-<name type="pname">Garrett</name> specimen but apply equally well to the other.</p>
               <p>The apparent prototype for the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon was a 1742 dated Spanish colonial 8 escudos piece (<ref
                     target="#fig-87">fig. 3</ref>). While the general types of both are quite similar, they differ in several important details. The obverse of
                  the prototype bears the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</name> cross, or <pb n="136"/> cross potent. On the <name
                     type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon, this form was altered to that of a cross potent-rebated, with part of the crutch removed from each
                  limb. Other obverse design details are essentially the same on each.<ref target="CH6-n33">33</ref> The pillars of Hercules on the reverse of
                  the prototype are tapered, with small capitals topped by ornaments variously resembling acanthus leaves copied from the Corinthian order or
                  large floral shapes. The pillars engage the waves, below. Above is found either a crown, or a crowned cruciform shape. On the <name
                     type="place">Lima</name> style, the pillars are more square in cross section, and bear flat capitals modeled after the Doric order, each of
                  which is capped by a fleur-de-lys. Above the pillars is a cross fleury. The pillars are free-standing upon flat bases and do not engage the
                  waves, below.</p>

               <p>One major design difference would have served to distinguish for contemporaries the prototype from the <name type="place">Lima</name> style at
                  a first glance. The obverse of the prototype, the side bearing the royal name, was always the side with the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</name> cross; the pillars side bore the two dates (central and peripheral) and the continuation of
                  the royal titulature. The <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon bears the royal name on the pillars side, while the cross side bears
                  the continuation of the titulature, directly opposite to the required style of the prototype. The <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                  doubloon does not appear to have been a slavish copy from its prototype. The substitution of a cross fleury for the expected Spanish element
                  is another difference that would have been immediately noticeable to a contemporary familiar with the usual appearance of the prototype.<ref

               </p>
               <p>The inscriptions on the obverse die cut for the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon were created from three different punch sets
                     (<ref target="#fig-88">fig. 4</ref>). The peripheral letters were made from a single letter punch set, while the central letters and
                  numerals were from another, larger, punch set. The numeral 2 has an entirely different appearance from the other central numerals and appears
                  to have been hand-engraved onto the die face, rather than being punched into it. The <name type="pname">Brasher</name> signature <pb n="137"/>
                  near the bottom of the die was from the third set, the smallest used, and was added after the beaded circle and waves had been drawn onto the
                  die. They are from a different punch set than used for the <name type="pname">Brasher</name> signature found on the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons. The letters <name type="place">N.Y</name> at the base of the die
                  face were hand engraved, not punched, and overlie the scribed circle on which the peripheral letters rest, indicating that they were added
                  after most of the design had been completed. It should be noted that an address does not seem to appear as an element of the design of the
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons, although there are suggestions of a "<name
                     type="place">N.Y</name>" at the base of <name type="pname">Garrett</name>:607.</p>

               <p>The peripheral inscription was anchored onto an outer scribed circle, which was drawn around the die face twice. The spacing and shapes of the
                  inner circle of large beads indicates that it was hand punched using a single element punch and not a gang punch composed of two or more
                  beads. The two pillars, their fleur-de-lys decorations, the cross fleury between them, the lines on which they are superimposed, and the wavy
                  lines below, were all hand engraved onto the die.</p>
               <pb n="138"/>
               <p>The obverse die, then, was created by using a combination of three punch sets for the letters and numerals, while other elements were hand
                  engraved. There are clear signs of doubling visible on the obverse, the result of the planchet having been struck twice, the second time

               <p>The reverse presents an entirely different picture, and is one of the curious features of the type not noticed before (<ref target="#fig-89"
                     >fig. 5</ref>). All letters and the four numerals in the peripheral inscription were hand engraved onto the die face, as were the <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</name> cross and the elements of the <name type="pname">Leon</name> and <name
                     type="pname">Castile</name> arms. No punches were used to create this die, which has a very crude appearance quite unlike the more finished
                  obverse. It is entirely likely that the reverse was made by a different hand than was responsible for the obverse. Numerous mistakes by the
                  engraver can be seen, such as the failure adequately to remove the remnants of the misplaced battlements in the second quarter of the arms,
                  the scratch from the field in the first, the scratch below the castle in the third, and the traces of a stray ornamental <pb n="139"/> element
                  from the crude rosette which ends the inscription. There are faintly visible signs of double striking, most noticeable around the bases of
                  some peripheral letters.</p>
               <p>In the center of the reverse, at the juncture of the arms of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</name> cross, is
                  the "E.B" counterstamp. The counterstamp was applied with a single blow from a prepared punch. On the "<name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>" Collection-Ten Eyck-Kagin specimen, the punch was entered correctly orientated so that the letters
                  EB were in their normal alignment when that side of the coin is viewed. On the <name type="pname">Newcomer</name>-<name type="pname"
                     >Garrett</name> specimen, however, the "E.B" punch was entered upside-down in relation to the normal orientation of the design, and the
                  coin must be rotated 180¬∞ to read the letters correctly. Due to the design of the host, and the placement of the counterstamp over the raised
                  arms of the cross, neither of the two <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons presents a completely visible impression of the "E.B"
                  punch. On the <name type="pname">Kagin</name> specimen the lower left downstroke and serif of the E, as well as the upper edge of that
                  letter's first cross stroke, are obscure. The letter B, however, is complete. On the <name type="pname">Garrett</name> coin, the bottom third
                  of the downstroke and the entire length of the bottom cross stroke of E are obscure. The upper two thirds of that letter are complete,
                  however, as is all of the neighboring B.</p>
               <p>The edge of the <name type="pname">Garrett</name> specimen is rough and irregular, suggestive of having been struck on a cast flan. Its cross
                  section would appear squared-off rather than rounded, more like British late eighteenth century coins than contemporary American ones. No
                  evidence of the use of a collar remains. The edge was not filed, and shows no signs of any alteration after striking, such as clipping.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Kagin</name> specimen lacks any vestiges of the peripheral inscription. The <name type="pname">Garrett</name> coin's
                  inscription is about 50% off flan. The weights of both are nearly identical, (<name type="pname">Garrett</name> specimen: 407.5 gr; <name
                     type="pname">Kagin</name> specimen: 407.3 gr), but the latter appears to have been struck on a thicker flan. On the <name type="pname"
                     >Garrett</name> specimen, the peripheral letters run off the flan, and it is clear that the dies were broader than the flans they struck.
                  This is another curious feature of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon, and suggests either that the coiner's intention was
                  deliberately to create an issue that lacked complete legends, or that he misjudged the diameters of the dies when preparing his planchets.</p>
               <p>The inscriptions on both sides have always been inaccurately transcribed since the discovery of the type. The closest reading was the 1914 ANS
                  committee's, but the authors of that report incorrectly recorded the reverse legend. An accurate reading of both legends underscores the
                  curious nature of the type.</p>
               <p>The obverse peripheral inscription reads: ‚Ä¢ PHILIP ‚Ä¢ V ‚Ä¢ D ‚Ä¢ G <pb n="140"/> ‚Ä¢ H ‚Ä¢ REX ANO 1786. The central inscription was accurately
                  described in the 1914 ANS report, and need not be repeated here. This inscription is very similar to the prototype's, which would have read
                     <name type="pname">PHILIPPVS V D. G. HISPAN</name>, with varying styles of punctuation. The reverse of the <name type="place">Lima</name>
                  style type is inscribed I HISPAN [followed by vestiges of other letters and the upper elements of four numerals representing another date, all
                  too far off flan for a sound reading] IND REX, the inscription ending with a clumsy floral ornament. The letters between N and the second I
                  are so far off the flan as to be entirely illegible. The reverse inscription needlessly repeats the Spanish title found on the obverse in an
                  abbreviated form, another of the curious features of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon. The reading suggested by the authors
                  of the 1914 ANS committee report is not supported by the evidence of the coin. On the prototype, the inscription would have read ET INDIARVM
                  REX, continuing the obverse titulature, ending with a date composed of four numerals.</p>
               <p>The prototype <name type="place">Lima</name> mint 8 escudos of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_87644221">Philip V</name>'s reign were
                  generally rounded, but with extremely irregular edges and imperfect centering of the die faces over the flans, resulting in coins whose
                  inscriptions were, for the most part, partially off flan. The layout of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style dies, with their own legends
                  partially off flan, strongly suggests a deliberate attempt to duplicate the gross physical appearance of the prototype, and not a failure to
                  match the diameters of the dies and flan.</p>
               <p>The obverse date of 1786 on the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon has not been noticed before. The authors of the 1914 ANS
                  committee report believed that the date was either 1700 or 1780, while <name type="pname">Mehl</name> ventured a reading of 1703. The identity
                  of the first two numerals is agreed upon by all previous writers, given the vectors of the strokes of those numbers. The third numeral shows a
                  closed loop composed of two parts, each equally wide, whose vectors describe a circle of evenly decreasing circumference. The fourth numeral's
                  closed loop is wider on the right than the left, but is wider in diameter than the third's. The only possible candidate for the third is a
                  numeral half of whose shape includes a closed loop with design elements of the required vector and thickness, eliminating all but 8 as
                  possible choices. It may be remembered that this reading was one of the two suggested by the ANS in 1914. The fourth numeral, similarly, can
                  only have been 6, given the varying thickness and apparent vector of the visible stroke. The thickness of the strokes with which it was drawn
                  are too narrow on the left to accommodate the shape of a "0," and a reading of "2," "3" or "5" is ruled out by the loop's obvious closure on
                  the left. All numerals composed of <pb n="141"/> straight line elements, such as "1," "4," "7" and "9," are clearly impossible as candidates.
                  Of the remaining two numerical choices, "8" is eliminated by the width of the visible loop and comparison with the vectors of the strokes in
                  the third number of the date, leaving "6" as the only logical choice.</p>

               <p>The metrology of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon has never been examined, but rather than being an academic numismatic
                  exercise, an analysis of the technical parameters of the type, with reference to the metrologies of both Spanish colonial gold and the <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloon, can serve to place it into the context originally
                  intended for it by its maker, be he <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name> or a later counterfeiter. The "<name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>" Collection-<name type="pname">Kagin</name> specimen weighs 407.3 gr, while the <name type="pname"
                     >Newcomer</name>-<name type="pname">Garrett</name> example weighs 407.5. The mean weight of six of the seven known <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons is 408.8 gr.<ref target="CH6-n36">36</ref> The weights observed from
                  the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons range from 406.8 to 411.5 gr, with a first
                  standard deviation of 1.9 gr which is low, but probably not unexpected on a private gold coinage. While falling in the low side, the observed
                  weights of the two <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons are within the range discovered for the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style type.</p>
               <p>Weights of specimens of the 1742 prototype for the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon are infrequently recorded. However, some data
                  from contemporary <name type="place">Lima</name> mint 8 escudos is available for comparison with the above observations: 1720, 413.2 gr;
                  172-(last digit off flan), 415.9 gr; 1729, 416.7 gr; 1740, 414.4 gr; 1743, 414.5 gr and 1746, 416.9 gr.<ref target="CH6-n37">37</ref> The mean
                  weight of this sample is 415.3 gr, with a first standard deviation of 1.5 gr.</p>
               <p>The <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons appear to have been struck to a weight standard
                  close to, but slightly below, that observed from the sample of contemporary Spanish colonial 8 escudos specimens. The difference between the
                  means of the former and latter is only 6.5 gr, a measurable amount under controlled conditions but probably negligible for late eighteenth
                  century <name type="place" corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</name> banking purposes. For example, the schedule of expected
                  weights and corresponding values in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> currency and British sterling,
                  published by the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> in 1786, called for a Spanish doubloon to
                  weigh 17 dwt, 0 gr, equivalent to 408.0 gr.<ref target="CH6-n38">38</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons, similarly, are close in weight to the mean of the <name type="place">Lima</name> Mint
                  sample's, but lower still than the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style's. If a true weight standard
                  can be discovered from the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons, it corresponds closely to that of the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style, <pb n="142"/> which, in turn, corresponded to the standard employed at the
                     <name type="place">Lima</name> Mint, itself. More interestingly, it is just sixth-tenths of a grain below the expected weight of a Spanish
                  doubloon published by the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> in 1786, and it will be remembered
                  that the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons are dated 1786. It is more than likely, therefore, that the choice of the Spanish
                  colonial <name type="place">Lima</name> Mint type as the prototype is linked to the close approximation of that mint's apparent weight
                  standard.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Garrett</name> sale cataloguers referred to metallic analyses made on a <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloon and the <name type="place">Lima</name> style piece offered in that
                  sale, but did not publish them beyond saying they were virtually identical. These tests were carried out in facilities at The <name
                     type="place">Johns Hopkins University</name> and the National Bureau of Standards, and were conducted for <name type="pname">Bowers</name>
                  and <name type="pname">Ruddy Galleries</name>, Inc., prior to the sale of Part 4 of the <name type="pname">Garrett</name> Collection in March
                  1981. Test procedures included x-ray emission spectrographic analysis via SEM, equipped to detect Auger electron emission as a control check
                  on x-ray emission results and calibrated against standard dental gold.<ref target="CH6-n39">39</ref> Seven years later, in March 1988, in
                  connection with an investigation of the <name type="pname">Brasher</name> half-doubloon conserved at the National Numismatic Collection,
                  elemental probe scan analyses of that coin, together with the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style

               <p>The percentages of content readings for gold and iron in all the tested coins were closely equivalent. The readings for silver and copper
                  content, on the other hand, show clear distinctions among the three groups of coins tested. The silver contents of the <name type="place"

                     City</name> and <name type="place">Lima</name> style coins were lower than those found in the U. S. half eagle, but approximately twice

               <p>It is clear from the foregoing that the gold and alloy melts used for the planchet stock for the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons were, as the <name type="pname"
                     >Garrett</name> cataloguers described, "virtually identical."<ref target="CH6-n42">42</ref> It is also clear that the melts were entirely
                  dissimilar to any of the standards required for <name type="place">United States</name> gold coins of any date. Finally, the melts, with their
                  lower silver and higher copper contents, are quite different from those used for the planchet stock of contemporary Mexican colonial gold
                  issues. The conclusion is inescapable, therefore, that neither standard U. S. gold, nor unrefined Spanish colonial gold, served as the source
                  for the planchet stocks used on the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> or <name type="place">Lima</name>
                  style doubloons. Although no trace of an undertype has ever been detected beneath them, it has been suggested that the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons were struck over rolled out or planed down 8 escudos hosts. This may
                  now be ruled out. It appears, on the contrary, that the planchet stock used for the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                     York City</name> and <name type="place">Lima</name> style pieces was either obtained from another source, or was the result of refining
                  Spanish colonial gold for silver recovery, following which additional copper was added for tensile strength.</p>

               <p>The authors of the 1914 ANS committee report believed that the "E.B" counterstamp appearing on the reverse of the <name type="place"
                     >Lima</name> style doubloon was the same as <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>'s E.B touchmark applied to the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style pieces. They were careful, however, to state that "‚Ä¶the counterstamp EB‚Ä¶seems
                  to be exactly like the stamps of this assayer which have been examined on the various <name type="pname">Brasher</name> doubloons‚Ä¶," hardly an
                  unequivocal assertion of the identity of the two.<ref target="CH6-n43">43</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Adams</name>, on the other hand, who was one of the troika of authors of the report, definitely accepted the two punches as
                  the same.<ref target="CH6-n44">44</ref> All other published accounts agreed with <name type="pname">Adams</name>'s opinion until the statement
                  which appeared in the 14th edition of the <pb n="145"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Guidebook</hi>, which amounted to a reversal of prior opinion about the authenticity of the "E.B" counterstamp.
                  Unsubstantiated reports of photographic overlay analysis published in 1990 did little to rehabilitate the <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                  doubloon.</p>
               <p>As part of the testing conducted on the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and <name type="place"
                     >Lima</name> style doubloons carried out at The <name type="place">Johns Hopkins University</name> and the National Bureau of Standards,
                  SEM micrographs of the "E.B" punch on the <name type="place">Lima</name> style coin and the E.B punch on a <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> doubloon were made at 33.6 diameters enlargement, for comparative purposes. A total
                  of 20 individual measurements were made along the identical portions of each punch, and then compared for evidence of linear equivalence.
                  These readings (Table 2), together with their interpretive key (<ref target="#fig-90">fig. 6</ref>), are published here for the first
                  time.</p>

               <p>In four cases, the measurements of both punches were found to be identical. These were dimensions C, D, L and Q, representing the total height
                  of the letter "B," the distance from the extreme left edge of the oval depression to the extreme left edge of the downstroke of "E," and the
                  length of the central cross stroke of "E." In eight cases, the measurements taken from the <name type="place">Lima</name> style <pb n="146"/>
                  punch were larger than those taken from the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style piece. These
                  differences ranged from 0.008-0.022‚Ä≥, with a mean of 0.012‚Ä≥. Similarly, in eight cases the <name type="place">Lima</name> style's "E.B"
                  measurements were smaller than those taken from the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style's punch.
                  These differences ranged from 0.008-0.038‚Ä≥, with a mean of 0.018‚Ä≥. Smaller and larger measurements were not confined to either one or the
                  other letter, but were evenly distributed between the two.</p>
               <p>The means of the differences noted above are equivalent to less than half a millimeter in each case, which, while perhaps significant, is so
                  minute as to be nearly negligible. In fact, the authors of the <name type="pname">Johns Hopkins</name> report stated "The agreement between
                  these measurements strongly suggests that they were made with the same punch and differences are due to differential wear and differential
                  impression." The tilt of the first letter of each punch was also measured, yielding results of 5 ¬∞ for the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style E.B, 6 ¬∞ for the <name type="place">Lima</name> style "E.B." This close
                  equivalence further supports the conclusion that both punches are identical, since the tilt corresponds to the way the original punch was laid
                  out when made by or for <name type="pname">Brasher</name>.</p>
               <p>As part of the analysis of the counterstamp undertaken for this present paper, identically sized film prints of the E.B punches appearing on a
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style and the <name type="pname">Garrett</name>
                  <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons were made. These were then overlaid atop each other, for visual examination and to test the
                  dimensional results described in the <name type="pname">Johns Hopkins</name> report.<ref target="CH6-n45">45</ref> Additionally, macro
                  photographs were made of the punch elements, for further comparative purposes. The results of the photographic overlay examination confirmed
                  those described earlier by the <name type="pname">Johns Hopkins</name> evaluators. The E.B counterstamp on both the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> and <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons is identical, and if the former's
                  was <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>'s touchmark, then so was the latter's.</p>
               <p>A particularly interesting confirmation of this identity between the two E.B punches may be seen in the macro photographs of two of the <name
                     type="pname">Garrett Brasher</name> doubloons. This feature, first noticed by <name type="pname">Ford</name> in 1982, also serves to
                  confirm <name type="pname">Adams</name>'s earlier belief that the <name type="place">Lima</name> style pre-dated the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloon.<ref target="CH6-n46">46</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The punch appearing on <name type="pname">Garrett</name>:607, the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>
                  style, shows clear evidence of rusting (<ref target="#fig-91">fig. 7</ref>). This is most noticeable directly above the downstroke of the E,
                  in the space between the top serif of the central cross stroke and the middle of the bottom edge of the upper cross stroke of that letter, and
                  in the field above the B, just before the initial curve of that letter. The first is a single rust mark, which describes a nearly triangular
                  shape lying along a <pb n="147"/> diagonal vector. The second is composed of a cluster of three roughly oval rust spots, while the third
                  largely resembles the first in shape, but lies along a diagonal apposite to the first's.</p>

               <p>These three areas of rusting appear in identical states of development on other <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York

                  specimens. The unique punch on breast example, <name type="pname">Garrett</name>:2340, shows the first and third of the above described rust
                  spots, but only one of the cluster of three in the E, indicating that it had been counterstamped before most of the surviving specimens known
                  today.</p>
               <p>The unique half doubloon, conserved at the National Numismatic Collection, shows all three areas of rust described, but with additional signs
                  of rusting on the field of the punch and two larger areas of rusting above the top of the first cross stroke of the E, indicating that it had
                  been counterstamped after all the known <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style pieces had received the
                  punch.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Newcomer-Garrett</name>
                  <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon, the best preserved of the two specimens known, clearly shows the first rust spot described
                  above, but in an earlier stage of development than seen on any known <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>
                  style piece (<ref target="#fig-92">fig. 8</ref>). Additionally, the third area of rust is present, but also in a much earlier stage of growth.
                  There are no signs of the second, the cluster of rust spots, on this <pb n="148"/> example of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                  doubloon. The discovery specimen, the "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>" Collection-Kagin coin, shows the third rust
                  spot as seen on most of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style pieces, but none of the cluster of
                  spots inside the E. Since its punch was entered with the top of the E above the juncture of the edge of the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</name> cross and the table of the coin, that portion of the letter was not impressed on the coin and
                  it is unknown whether the first rust spot described above was present. Given the presence of the third, and the absence of the second, it is
                  likely that the first was present and that the punch was in the same condition as when it was applied to the <name type="pname"
                     >Newcomer-Garrett</name> specimen.</p>

               <p>It is clear, therefore, that the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons were counterstamped with the same E.B punch that was impressed
                  into the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons and the unique half doubloon. The state of
                  the punch, however, shows that the <name type="place">Lima</name> style pieces were counterstamped before the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style coins, and thus pre-dated them, an observation borne out by the dates which
                  appear on the two, 1786 on the former, 1787 on the latter. There is evidence for an emission sequence in these observations for the entire
                  class of E.B counterstamped coins, with the <name type="place">Lima</name> style first, followed by the punch on breast variety of the <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style, the "regular" <pb n="149"/> punch on wing variety, ending with
                  the unique half doubloon.</p>
               <p>The myriad English, Spanish, and Portuguese gold coins bearing an "E.B" counterstamp are not within the interest of this paper. It should be
                  said, however, that those with a genuine <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name> touchmark deserve study, since they might be fitted into
                  the punch emission sequence and so provide a better understanding of the course of <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s activities as a private
                  assayer. The presence of the die rust spots noted above would, in addition, serve as a rather simple means of authentication of any purported
                  "E.B" punch.<ref target="CH6-n47">47</ref>

               <p>The 1786 <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon appears to be a genuine product of <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>'s <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> workshop, given the identity of the E.B touchmark and the virtual
                  identity of their alloys. Neither was struck on cut down or rolled out Spanish colonial gold coins, but refined Latin American gold may
                  probably have been the source for their planchet stock. Both were struck to a close approximation of the Spanish colonial weight standard for
                  the 8 escudos denomination. The weights of the two known <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons are essentially identical to the
                  required weight of a Spanish colonial 8 escudos piece called for by the Bank of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</name> and the New York City Chamber of Commerce in a notice dated 1786.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Adams</name> originally suggested that the <name type="place">Lima</name> and <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons were struck for local, American, circulation purposes, and this
                  hypothesis has been accepted by all who have publicly written on the subject.<ref target="CH6-n48">48</ref> Assuming him to have been correct,
                  the questions of specific circulation patterns and purposes arise. A privately issued gold coinage would have been an expensive and somewhat
                  risky affair, given the limited usefulness of the gold medium in daily commerce. In this respect, <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s coinage
                  does not resemble <name type="pname">John Chalmers</name>'s silver issues of 1783. Silver coins were far more current in small trade than were
                  gold, and although Chalmers's issues were not intrinsically up to standard, their original purpose had been a pro bono publico one.<ref
                     target="CH6-n49">49</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s gold issues, with their high intrinsic values, probably never entered normal, public commerce. Rather,
                  they would have been confined to serving the needs of large transactions between the better-off merchants of the city, and, perhaps, colonial
                  banks. It has been suggested that <name type="pname">Brasher</name> may have struck his doubloons for the Bank of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, to supply a gold coinage of known weight and fineness, attested to by a gold and
                  silversmith of known repute.<ref target="CH6-n50">50</ref> Alternatively, others have suggested that <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s
                  doubloons represent his assay and refining of lightweight gold coins taken from circulation, effected under the <pb n="150"/> auspices of a
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> financial institution, and point to <name type="pname"
                     >Brasher</name>'s activities in 1792 on behalf of the nascent <name type="place">United States</name> Mint as a parallel.<ref
                     target="CH6-n51">51</ref> Neither hypothesis is supported by the evidence known today, although each is plausible.</p>
               <p>There are several other mysteries remaining about <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon, technical
                  numismatic ones that may never be adequately explained. The presence of two different hands on the dies is especially curious, particularly
                  when the relative professionalism of the obverse is contrasted with the naive, untutored appearance of the reverse.<ref target="CH6-n52"
                     >52</ref> Since the E.B counterstamp obscures the central portion of the reverses of both known <name type="place">Lima</name> style
                  doubloons, it is certain that the obverse and reverse dies were contemporary with each other, and more importantly, with <name type="pname"
                     >Brasher</name>'s activities as an assayer. The state of the rust in the punch shows that it was applied to the <name type="place"
                     >Lima</name> style doubloons before it was impressed into the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>
                  style ones. Therefore, both <name type="place">Lima</name> style dies existed contemporaneously with those cut for the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloon. The naively drawn reverse, in other words, could not have been a
                  concoction made many years later, as a mate for an unmarried obverse, since it shows the impression of a punch applied in its earliest known
                  state.</p>
               <p>Although arguments based upon observations of style are among the least sound in numismatics, the obverse of the <name type="place"
                     >Lima</name> Style doubloon does seem to resemble <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s style visible on the <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> doubloon, while the reverse is unworthy of such an attribution. It is barely
                  conceivable that <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s obverse was clandestinely mated with a reverse by a hand entirely unconnected to <name
                     type="pname">Brasher</name>'s workshop, but given the sound weight and fineness of the <name type="place">Lima</name> Style doubloons, the
                  motive for such extracurricular activity is obscure. There certainly would have been little or no profit in making the <name type="place"
                     >Lima</name> Style doubloons. Perhaps the reverse was entrusted to an apprentice through necessity, and the crudity of his work and <name
                     type="pname">Brasher</name>'s dissatisfaction with it accounts for the rarity of the issue compared to the number of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> doubloons known to have survived.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Brasher</name>, like other contemporaries, often signed his name and city address on silver, but none of the <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> doubloons seems to show "<name type="place">N.Y</name>" beneath his
                     signature.<ref target="CH6-n53">53</ref> Why did he feel the need to put his address on the <name type="place">Lima</name> style pieces,
                  but not on the later, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style, coins? Perhaps the <name type="place"
                     >Lima</name> style was expected occasionally to circulate outside of the <name type="place" corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York
                     City</name> area, where <name type="pname">Brasher</name> was known, and his address was added as an aid to its redemption, much like the
                  edge devices on the later <name type="pname">Talbot</name>, <name type="pname">Allum</name> &amp; <name type="pname">Lee</name> coppers. The
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons, on the other hand, proclaimed <pb n="151"/> their
                  state of origin in their types.</p>
               <p>Why <name type="pname">Brasher</name> used two different letter punch sets for his name on the <name type="place">Lima</name> and <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> style doubloons is another unresolvable question. A silversmith's punch
                  sets were a valuable property, often being pledged for loans or specifically bequeathed at death.<ref target="CH7-n54">54</ref> It is unlikely
                  that a perfectly good set of letter punches would be discarded and another purchased in their place. Whatever the reason may have been, it
                  escapes us today.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Newcomer-Garrett</name>
                  <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon was more sharply struck than any surviving <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city"
                     >New York City</name> style coin, an observation that has led one authority to suggest that different minting equipment must have been used
                  to coin the former.<ref target="CH7-n55">55</ref> The two known <name type="place">Lima</name> Style doubloons were both struck at least
                  twice, to bring up the detail in the dies. Since they are on thicker planchets than the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city"
                     >New York City</name> style doubloons, they necessarily required a sharper impact from the dies and so higher striking pressures than did
                  the latter. If their sharpness of detail does imply different presses, however, the question remains unanswered.</p>
               <p>Contemporary source material available today cannot answer these questions, nor can the present state of numismatic technology. They remain as
                  mysteries about an issue which, however, may now rightfully take its place as a legitimate early American coinage.<ref target="CH7-n56"

                     <p>The story of the discovery of the <name type="pname">Newcomer</name> specimen has been variously told. The authors of the 1914 ANS
                        committee report related that <name type="pname">Newcomer</name> "‚Ä¶recently obtained a number of early Spanish and other foreign gold
                        coins from a lady, who informed him that they had been accumulated many years ago." ("ANS Proceedings," p. xxxiii). When <name
                           type="pname">Garrett</name> later acquired this example from <name type="pname">B. Max Mehl</name>, a different story seems to have
                        accompanied the coin. According to a letter from <name type="pname">Sarah Elizabeth Freeman</name> of The <name type="place">Johns
                           Hopkins University</name> to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64112980">Eric P. Newman</name>, dated May 5, 1958, the <name
                           type="pname">Newcomer</name> piece "‚Ä¶had been contributed to the Red Cross in 1914 by an elderly lady then residing in <name
                           type="place">Cumberland, Maryland</name>. It had presumably been in her family for years, without anyone knowing what it really was."
                        Although the documentation no longer survives, it is plausible that the Red Cross suggested that the "elderly lady's" numismatic
                        donation be turned into a cash one, and that <name type="pname">Newcomer</name> was chosen as the purchaser. The author is indebted to
                           <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64112980">Eric P. Newman</name> for making this interesting letter available for this study.</p>

                        that <name type="pname">Raymond</name> did not accept it as genuine. <name type="pname">Raymond</name>'s listings only included pieces
                        that both advertised their maker's occupations and places of business, as well as serving some currency purpose. Further, neither the

                        have fallen within <name type="pname">Raymond</name>'s time frame of 1789-1850. It should be noted, in addition, that <name type="pname"
                           >Raymond</name> was <name type="pname">Colonel E. H. R. Green</name>'s numismatic advisor and that <name type="pname">Green</name>
                        insisted that <name type="pname">Raymond</name> regularly review all of <name type="pname">Green</name>'s intended purchases before
                        payment was tendered. When <name type="pname">Green</name> decided to buy the "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>"
                        Collection specimen from <name type="pname">Mehl</name>, who had just received it back from <name type="pname">Garrett</name> in trade
                        for the finer <name type="pname">Newcomer</name> coin, it may be assumed that <name type="pname">Raymond</name> gave the discovery
                        specimen his "imprimatur" at that time. It does not seem probable that the omission of the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon
                        from <name type="pname">Raymond</name>'s listings of <name type="place" corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</name> store
                        cards suggests anything about his opinion of its authenticity.</p>

                        stated that the health of the modern collecting hobby owes him a great debt of gratitude. His lengthiest and most interesting catalogue
                        descriptions often included quotations from more serious numismatists about the coin offered for sale. His description of the "<name

                        was simply noted in the introductory paragraph to the private gold issues section and was not plated. The wording of the description was
                        somewhat equivocal: "The very first American private gold is not actually listed in this section, for tradition's sake, but really
                        deserves the name. It is the series of doubloons and similar pieces issued by <name type="pname">Ephraim Brasher</name>, goldsmith, of
                           <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>. Some of these are imitation Peruvian doubloons, of cob
                        design, but signed <name type="pname">BRASHER</name>." What the "similar pieces" were was not stated, unless the myriad gold coins with
                        various "E.B" counterstamps were meant to be understood. As the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>
                        style doubloon was included in the early <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> section, but just as
                        easily could have been moved to the private gold coins part of the volume since they were not struck under any authority other than
                           <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s own, the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloons could have been included earlier in the
                        listings.</p>
                     <p>This confusion of placement is easily explained. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_75915787">Wayte Raymond</name> had died in 1956,
                        leaving the rights to the <hi rend="italic">Standard Catalogue</hi> to his widow, <name type="pname">Olga</name>. According to <name
                           type="pname">Ford</name>, who was the de facto editor of the 18th edition and gave this account to the author, <name type="pname"
                           >Mrs. Raymond</name> refused to make any changes to the layout of the Standard Catalogue, for reasons of economy. Accordingly, while
                        both <name type="pname">Ford</name> and <name type="pname">Breen</name>, who was responsible for the basic research for the series,
                        wanted the <name type="place">Lima</name> style doubloon listed under <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                           City</name> issues, <name type="pname">Mrs. Raymond</name> would not allow its addition since that would mean changing the layout of
                        the book. The only space open in the planned 18th edition that could accommodate the listing for the <name type="place">Lima</name>
                        style doubloon was in the text portion of pp. 175-76, under "Private Gold Issues," and so it was placed there. Even so, there was no
                        space available for a plate without deleting some text, and so no illustration was included.</p>

                     <p>Although some of his conclusions have been contested, <name type="pname">Everett T. Sipsey</name> offered a suggestive observation when
                        he wrote that <name type="pname">Brasher</name>'s work in early 1786 was "‚Ä¶done by some man in <name type="pname">Ephraim
                        Brasher</name>'s employ who was quite capable and could space and align the letter punches very professionally. At the end of 1786 the
                        workmanship deteriorated. Perhaps <name type="pname">Brasher</name> had hired a less skilled worker at this time," see "Dies by <name

                  <p>On the contrary, in a letter to the author dated Jan. 9, 1991, noted silver expert <name type="pname">Mrs. Dean A. Fales</name> wrote "The
                     fact that the back appears to be by a different hand, however, does raise a lot of questions in my mind." She went on to say that it was
                     "‚Ä¶totally unlikely that an apprentice would be employed for this more difficult and specialized task [of cutting the die]. Any hint of

            <p>When <name type="pname">Lewis</name> and <name type="pname">Clark</name> gave Indian chiefs medals bearing the portrait of <name type="pname"
                  >President Jefferson</name> they were following a practice of over a century's duration. The medals were engraved and struck in the <name
                  type="place">United States</name> Mint on official authority and were distributed by Presidential instructions. They bore a simple portrait of
               the President on the obverse and the joined hands of an Indian and a European with a peace pipe and tomahawk above.<ref target="CH8-n1">1</ref>
               This type would be maintained through the following five decades with the substitution of the image and name of the current President. The
               development of the imagery and practice which led up to these medals was far less regular and straight-forward than their subsequent history.</p>
            <p>Though hundreds of medals are documented as having been distributed to Indians in the eighteenth century by the French, the English and the
               Americans, almost no specimens are known from controlled archaeological context, and the identification of a specific object as a colonial Indian
               Peace Medal can only be made on the basis of vague and often suspect provenances, descriptions culled from documentary sources and the physical
               appearance of pieces in modern collections. It is evident that the record of surviving types is incomplete, and some pieces often adduced as
               Indian Peace Medals have no clear claim to such designation.</p>
            <p>American Indians appear to have had a developed tradition of gift exchange before their first contacts with Europeans. When treaties were made
               between tribes, exchanges were made of beaver pelts, wampum belts, peace pipes and tomahawks; the skins and belts were then worn as a symbol of
                  alliance.<ref target="CH8-n2">2</ref> It did not take Europeans long to enter the network of gift exchange; by 1602 Indians of the <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> coast proudly wore copper chains, earrings and collars of European origin.<ref
                  target="CH8-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Europeans began the practice of wearing a medal with the portrait of a ruler by the early sixteenth century, as illustrated in a 1533 portrait by
                  <name type="pname">Lucas Cranach</name> the elder, showing <name type="pname">Gregor Br√ºck</name> wearing a medal of the newly installed
               elector of Saxony. By the seventeenth century, Germans commonly wore oval medals, sometimes in elaborate mounts, as signs of loyalty to
                  rulers.<ref target="CH8-n4">4</ref> In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, also, the wearing of medals of rulers
               became common; the medal of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_88905668">James I</name> of 1604 for the treaty with <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> is often found mounted for wearing.<ref target="CH8-n5">5</ref> The oval medal of Parliament of 1642,
               which proclaims a rather limited allegiance to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_67750325">Charles I</name>, is usually found with a loop for
                  wearing.<ref target="CH8-n6">6</ref> In <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>, men of the seventeenth century also wore
               medals depicting their rulers, as well as metal badges showing membership in orders of knighthood.<ref target="CH8-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Among the earliest medals relating to European colonies in the <pb n="161"/> New World are several of <name type="pname">Cecil Calvert</name>,
                  <name type="place">Lord Baltimore</name>, from 1632 (<ref target="#fig-93">fig. 1</ref>). Nothing is known about the use of these medals, but
               as most have loops, it can be inferred that they were made for wear, possibly even by Indians in the new colony of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</name>.<ref target="CH8-n8">8</ref> An early documented case for the giving of medals and similar objects
               to Indians friendly to the early English colonies comes from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>. A decree of 1661
               provided that to be able to identify friendly Indians within colonial settlements, "badges, silver plates and copper plates, with the names of
               the town graven upon them, be given to all adjacent kings within our protection."<ref target="CH8-n9">9</ref> Probably to be associated with this
               is a silver badge depicting tobacco plants with the legend "The King of Patomeck" (<ref target="#fig-94">fig. 2</ref>). A related silver badge
               bears on its only engraved side the title of <name type="pname">Charles</name> the Second with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928"
                  >Virginia</name> as one of his kingdoms, around a shield within a garter, a crown above and the legend "The Queen of Pamunkey" on a plaque
               below. It resembles the Garter badge of the period.<ref target="CH8-n10">10</ref>
               <name type="pname">Patomek</name> and <name type="pname">Pamunkey</name> were <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</name>
               tribes of the seventeenth century. The Queen of <name type="pname">Pamunkey</name> badge is engraved in fine style and was probably produced in
                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>; the King of <name type="pname">Patomek</name> is cruder and might have been
               made in the colonies.<ref target="CH8-n11">11</ref> Neither is a product of a royal mint, and their distribution seems to have been more for
               identification and control than as a sign of alliance or treaty.</p>

               is the "Felicitas Domus Augustae" medal of 1693; a letter by a nun written in 1723 describes Indian chiefs as being buried with this medal, which
               was suspended from a fire-colored ribbon. This medal was awarded, into the early years of the eighteenth century, to Europeans as well as to
                  Indians.<ref target="CH8-n16">16</ref> It was probably the type of the 40 medals, 30 in silver and 10 in vermeil, documented as being sent to

            <p>The gifts of royal French medals to Indians continued in great number in the reign of <name type="pname">Louis XV</name>, at the rate of about a
               dozen a year in the early 1720s.<ref target="CH8-n18">18</ref> It is not certain what medals were sent early in his reign, but by mid-century the
               Abenaki chiefs are documented to have worn a medal depicting two allegorical figures and the simple <pb n="163"/> legend "Honos et virtus."<ref
                  target="CH8-n19">19</ref> This medal is distinctive among those of <name type="pname">Louis XV</name> in not having a date; it was probably
               intended to be given over a span of years. As all specimens found have an obverse die by <name type="pname">Duvivier</name> used also with
               reverses dated 1730, it can be assumed that the type was initiated around that year, and may well have been issued until the end of the French
               colonies in 1763.</p>
            <p>The English were in wide-ranging competition with the French for the allegiance of various Indian tribes and confederations. On the peace medal
               level, they were at a decided disadvantage in comparison to the well-organized medallic bureaucracy of the Sun King. In England, official medals
               were made and distributed for coronations, but medals for other occasions were at the personal initiative and profit of the mint engravers.<ref
                  target="CH8-n20">20</ref> In 1710, when the Governor of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> sought to
               convince the chiefs of the Five Iroquois Nations of the superiority of English rule over that of French, he gave one medal to each tribe
               illustrating a recent victory of Queen Anne, as well as 20 silver coins pierced or mounted for wear.<ref target="CH8-n21">21</ref> The identity
               of these medals is not known, but there were no English medals of the period of the size or splendor of the French medals being given to Indians.
               The pierced and worn example in the ANS Collection of a 1703 medal for the capture of continental cities by <name type="place">Marlborough</name>
               may be one of those given by the English to Indians on this or a similar occasion.<ref target="CH8-n22">22</ref> The medal was engraved by the
               mint master <name type="pname">John Croker</name> and is known with two sets of dies, so is as close to an official issue as English medals offer

            </figure>
            <p>On the accession of <name type="pname">George I</name> in 1714, <name type="pname">Croker</name> produced a series of medals for the entry into
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> and the coronation of the new monarch (<ref target="#fig-95">fig. 3</ref>). These
               followed the standard pattern of obverse legend in <name type="place">Latin</name> and reverse legend bearing the date. A gold example <pb
                  n="164"/> of the coronation medal is documented as having been given in 1721 by the governor of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> to the
               head of the Five Nations.<ref target="CH8-n23">23</ref> A number of medals have been found, chiefly in <name type="place">Western
                  Pennsylvania</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, which appear to have been distributed to the
               Indians in the name of this king.<ref target="CH8-n24">24</ref> They are, however, anomalous in many aspects and cannot be considered in any way
               official issues. All known are of copper alloy, though some may have been silver plated. The obverse, which is clearly copied from that by <name
                  type="pname">Croker</name>, bears a legend in English, rather than the Latin on the mint issues; on some examples the initials TC appear to
               copy the IC on the <name type="pname">Croker</name> obverse. The reverse depicts an Indian shooting a deer, with no legend or date. Despite the
               entreaties of colonial governors for presents to distribute to Indians, and the presentation of one gold coronation medal to an Indian chief, the
                  <name type="pname">George I</name> medals with the Indian scene reverse appear to be the results of the private initiative of <name
                  type="pname">James Logan</name>, an agent for <name type="pname">William Penn</name>, who had them made by a private <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name> manufacturer. Their distribution may have been more to further Logan's interests in the fur
               trade than as an act of government policy.</p>
            <p>The official nature of the medals given in the name of <name type="pname">George II</name> is no less problematical than those of his
               predecessor. A source from 1753 reports that the new British governor in that year brought with him from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> 30 silver medals on scarlet ribbons to distribute to the Indians; these were reported to have the
               king's portrait on one side and the royal arms on the other.<ref target="CH8-n25">25</ref> Corresponding to this description are two surviving
               medals, one in the British Museum and the other in the ANS Collection. Both are cast; that in the ANS is reported to have been found on an Indian
               trail in <name type="place">Labrador</name>.<ref target="CH8-n26">26</ref> The source of the obverse is clear; the pieces are cast directly from

               4</ref>). The reverse is more problematic; none of the medals by <name type="pname">Croker</name>, or other English medalists of the period,
               display the royal coat of arms as the reverse type. The only other medal of the period with such a depiction is a Dutch piece made for the

               coins of the reign which carry a simple shield as a type. The reverse of the <name type="pname">George II</name> Indian Peace Medal appears to
               have been made specially for that use; the fact that both known examples are cast and without an artist's signature suggests that it was the
               product of an unofficial manufacture, perhaps at the initiative of the individual who presented it, rather than as <pb n="165"/> an act of the
               government.</p>

               period, as well as the size and documented use of the English medal for presentation, combines with its availability to an American engraver in
               1750 to suggest that the 1732 English medal may have been used as an Indian Peace Medal, even though no examples are known which are pierced or
               from Indian contexts.</p>
            <p>Members of the Society of Friends, or Quakers, were among the most active distributors of medals to Indians in the middle of the eighteenth
               century. In 1756 they are documented to have distributed silver medals with the king's head on the obverse and his arms on the reverse, probably

            <p>The obverse of Duffield's medal appears to have been copied from the English silver crown of the period, with its short and unabbreviated legend
               and distinctive lion epaulet (<ref target="#fig-99">fig. 6</ref>). The reverse depicts a Quaker and an Indian sharing a peace pipe. This same
               scene appears on a gift gorget with the hallmark of Richardson from about the same period, but it has not been determined on which piece the
               image was used first. The ANS collection has an unpierced pewter striking of this medal, probably a pattern, and three holed strikings in silver
               from the unbroken dies. All three of the silver pieces have the traces of edge marking, which indicates that they were overstruck on coins
               originally struck in a decorated collar, though no trace of an undertype is visible on any. The edge marking does not correspond to that on the
               English crown which served as a model for the obverse; this has a lettered edge. Rather, it corresponds to that on Spanish 8 reales of the era,
               such as those of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>, which are known to have circulated in <name type="place"

            <p>In 1760, British forces under the command of <name type="pname">Sir William Johnson</name> took the French town of Montreal. To reward the

                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</name> Indians. The obverse appears to have been copied after the 1761 official
               coronation medal of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49264990">George III</name> by <name type="pname">Lorenz Natter</name>, an engraver at the

               to a bench on the shores of a harbor, but the Indian and European are still sharing a pipe beneath a tree. <name type="pname">Johnson</name> also

            <p>There is a series of medals, apparently given to American Indian Chiefs by the British, whose manufacture and chronology are a mystery. These are
               usually looped, are found chiefly in American collections, occasionally have more-or-less trustworthy provenances to Indian owners (including
                  <name type="pname">Tecumseh</name> and <name type="pname">Pontiac</name>), are known in two sizes and as both solid medals and joined
                  shells.<ref target="CH8-n37">37</ref> The unsigned obverse is known in at least two dies for the 3 inch variety and one for the 2 3/8 inch
               diameter. This is close in appearance to that of a medal by <name type="pname">Thomas Pingo</name>, an engraver at the Royal mint, and issued in
               1760 at the time of the accession of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49264990">George III</name>.<ref target="CH8-n38">38</ref> Reverses of
               examples in both sizes bear the royal arms as appropriate for the Hanoverian kings in the eighteenth century, with the fleur-de-lys in the second
               quarter. Other examples of the smaller size, using the same obverse die, have on their reverse a coat of arms eliminating the fleur-de-lys in the
               second quarter. This heraldic change was decreed in 1801, so these specimens cannot have been made before <pb n="170"/> then. It is evident,
               then, that the obverse die with the youthful royal portrait was in use into the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Sometime in this period, the same 2 3/8 inch obverse die was mated with a reverse which depicts a comfortable lion being harassed by a wolf, with
               a settlement in the background. Explanations of the scene are generally dependent on assumptions about the date of issue, but there is no good
               evidence to assign the medal to any specific occasion in the period 1760 to 1801. The lion probably represents <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, protecting European settlements in the Americas, but the challenge represented by the wolf could
               be <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>, hostile Indian tribes, revolutionary colonists in the 13 southern colonies, or the
               forces of nature. It is also uncertain where these medals were made; the dies are of good style but the lack of signature, the frequent use of
               shells rather than solid blanks, and the continued use of two of the reverse dies despite major breaks, casts doubt on the assumption that these
               were official products of the Royal mint.<ref target="CH8-n39">39</ref>
            </p>
            <p>At the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the leaders of the new <name type="place">United States</name> of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> had then three models to consider as approaches to the creation and distribution of medals to make
               allies of the leaders of Indian tribes. For the French, the distribution of medals had been an official part of colonial policy and was tied into
               the ambitious medallic program of the royal government. Though English governors distributed medals to Indians, there is no evidence that the
               crown ever sponsored such distribution or even that products of the Royal Mint were ever given to Indians; private manufacturers in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> appear to have made most of the medals distributed by English governors, using medals
               of the Mint as models. The third approach to medal manufacture was to have the pieces made by silversmiths in the colonies, who had adequate, if
               crude, facilities for casting, striking and hand engraving medals.<ref target="CH8-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Medallic and heraldic issues were among the first things the leaders of the new nation dealt with, setting up a committee to design a seal for
               the new nation and a gold medal for General <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> on July 4, 1776, the very day of the
               signing of the Declaration of Independence.<ref target="CH8-n41">41</ref> This committee, consisting of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_56609913">Benjamin Franklin</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_95296943">John Adams</name> and <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</name>, with the assistance of Pierre du Simiti√®re, took six years to come up with a seal that would
               be adopted by Congress. In the meantime, there was a need for medals to be given to Indians to replace those of the English. The design of the
               first medals seems to have been effected on an ad hoc basis. In July of 1776, representatives of the Micmac tribe and other <pb n="171"/> members
               of the Wabanaki federation met with <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</name> in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> and handed over gorgets with the image of the King and Queen of <name type="place"

               promised to reciprocate with a new gorget with "a bust of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</name> and proper devices
               to represent the United Colonies."<ref target="CH8-n42">42</ref> The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> Council
               had such medals made and in 1778 these were distributed to chiefs at a peace council. A few months later, some of these chiefs switched
               allegiance to the British side and handed over the presents they had received from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963"
                  >Washington</name>. That is presumably how one example of the medal entered the collection of <name type="pname">King George III</name> and is
               now in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</name>; the other known specimen has remained in the possession of

            <p>The medal follows the promise of having a picture of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</name> on the obverse,
               identified only by his initials. The similarity of this depiction to that of a Minuteman on pieces printed <pb n="172"/> by <name type="pname"
                  >Paul Revere</name> in this period has lead to an attribution of the medal to Revere, an attractive but as yet unproven hypothesis. In any
               case, it is almost certainly the work of a colonial silversmith. The reverse shows an Indian seated by a free-standing pillar, a symbol of
               Liberty as on a Dutch medal of 1772 for the birth of an heir to the throne, and on a German medal of 1783 celebrating American independence.
               While the European medals depict the column hung with coats of arms, on the Micmac medal the column is surrounded by 13 hands, representing the
                  colonies.<ref target="CH8-n43">43</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the decade after 1776, Congress came under increased pressure to authorize a medal for distribution to Indians. In 1786, the Indian
               Commissioners who met with the Choctaws in <name type="place">South Carolina</name> received British medals from the chiefs and were eager to
               have American medals to give them in return. The next year, Secretary of War Knox sought to get <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963"
                  >Washington</name> to authorize the issue of medals bearing the arms of the <name type="place">United States</name>. By 1788, dies are
               documented to have been manufactured by <name type="pname">Albion Cox</name> for striking medals for the Indians. In 1792, an Indian produced a
               medal which he reported he had received from one of the Indian Commissioners four or five years before, so there must have been medals
               distributed by about 1788. No silver medals have been found which can be identified with this time period, but a unique bronze piece in the ANS
               collection appears to be a trial strike for such a medal.<ref target="CH8-n44">44</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The obverse bears a scene of an Indian stepping on a tomahawk and handing a peace pipe and an olive branch to a bare-breasted woman, who is
               stepping on arrows and carrying a staff with a pileus or liberty cap on the end. Stars surround her head and an eagle displays his wings behind
               her. The woman is an allegorical figure, combining the attributes of the classical depiction of Liberty and the newly invented Seal of the <name
                  type="place">United States</name>.<ref target="CH8-n45">45</ref> The obverse as a whole combines aspects of the obverse and reverse of a
               design which was proposed to Congress in 1780 for the Seal. The passing of the calumet above the fire recalls the Quaker medal of 1757 and the
               vignette on the presentation certificate of <name type="pname">Sir William Johnson</name>. A panel at the top has been left empty for an
               inscription.</p>
            <p>The reverse bears the Seal of the <name type="place">United States</name> within a chain of 13 links, copied from the 1776 Continental Currency.
               The seal is represented in most respects as in the version of the Great Seal adopted by Congress in 1782, which thus sets the earliest likely
               date for this medal. The principal differences are that the head of the eagle is turned the other way, the arrows and branch are in opposed
               talons, and the wings are pointed down, rather than displayed. All of these differences can be found on versions of the seal used <pb n="173"/>
               by Presidents in later years; it may be that this is intended to be a Presidential rather than a national seal and thus in a very subtle way
               perpetuate the personal aspect of earlier Indian Peace Medals.<ref target="CH8-n46">46</ref> As Albion Cox was a principal in the Rahway mint in
               1786, it is likely that the dies were produced with the intention of striking medals there.<ref target="CH8-n47">47</ref> It remains uncertain
               whether any silver medals were actually struck from these dies and given to Indians.</p>
            <p>The Indian Peace Medal of 1789 is much more familiar in the literature, and survives in two silver specimens generally acknowledged to be
               authentic, but virtually nothing is known of its origin.<ref target="CH8-n48">48</ref> A treaty of 1790 prescribed the granting of "a great medal
               with proper ornaments" to chiefs of various Creek tribes; the date of 1789 on these pieces may be meant to indicate the year of <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>'s inauguration, rather than that of a treaty or of presentation. This medal
               resembles the presumably earlier bronze pattern in having an obverse scene of an Indian and an allegorical figure and a reverse depiction of the
               Great Seal. The reverse does not present the heraldic anomalies of the other piece; the eagle is facing left, his wings are raised and the branch
               and arrows are as on the seal. The scroll bearing the motto "E pluribus unum" is lacking from his beak and the stars are scattered around his
               head rather than gathered above it. The positions of the figures on the medal's obverse recall the reverse on the Honor and Virtue Indian Peace
               Medal of <name type="pname">Louis XV</name>.</p>
            <p>The allegorical figure on the obverse is now Minerva, in her guise as a warrior. She resembles the depiction of this figure on a prize medal
               engraved in 1767 by <name type="pname">Elisha Gallaudet</name> for what was to become <name type="place">Columbia University</name>.<ref
                  target="CH8-n49">49</ref> On the Indian Peace Medal, Minerva wears her sword, but her shield lies at her feet. The Indian drops his hatchet
               while passing the peace pipe with his other hand. The scene has been moved from the Indian's environment, the open fire, on earlier peace medals,
               to that of the European settlers, a ploughed field. Though <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> is not pictured, his
               name appears above the scene. Neither of the known specimens bears a hallmark, and no documents have come to light concerning the manufacture,
               but they appear to have been engraved by an American silversmith.</p>
            <p>The next known medals are dated 1792, and initiate a series with pieces bearing that date, 1793 and 1795.<ref target="CH8-n50">50</ref> These are
               known in three sizes, though not all dates are known in all sizes. There is also documentation to link the presentation of some of these medals
               to Indian chiefs, the most famous being <name type="pname">Red Jacket</name> of the <name type="place">Seneca</name>, who proudly wore his medal
               for his portrait painted in 1828 by <name type="pname">Charles Bird King</name>. The obverse of this medal differs in several ways from <pb
                  n="174"/> the 1789 one, the most obvious being the substitution of the figure of Minerva with a portrait of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>. This may have been as a result of complaints by Indians who resented being depicted dealing
               with a female figure, or in order to give a more personal quality to the presentation by actually depicting <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name> as well as having his name. The reverse bears the heraldic eagle, now with the scroll with "E
               PLURIBUS UNUM" in his beak. Some of the 1783 medals, and all of the 1785 examples, bear hallmarks, one as yet unassigned and one attributable to
                  <name type="pname">Joseph Richardson, Jr.</name>, of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>, son
               of the silversmith who produced the Quaker medal of 1757. In this case, it is clear that Congress contracted with two or more local silversmiths
               to engrave these medals by hand, an expensive and time consuming process.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Another engraved piece of this era is very problematic; the piece <pb n="175"/> which purports to be for the Treaty of Greenville, 1795 (<ref
                  target="#fig-101">fig. 8</ref>).<ref target="CH8-n51">51</ref> While it is documented that medals were distributed to Indians on the occasion
               of this important assembly, it is unlikely that the medals were engraved with the date of the treaty on a few day's notice or even that the date
               was added on the occasion to pre-engraved medals. The other anomalies include the fact that the identical image was used for obverse and reverse,
               with only minor differences in detail of engraving, and that the only piece with a reasonably secure provenance is not pierced and has no sign of
               a rim or loop. The provenance of the piece in the collection of The Historical Society of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> traces it to an
               1877 purchase from the grand-daughter of a chief of the Wyandot tribe; it is possible that the piece was made sometime between 1795 and 1877,
               using as a model the reverse of the 1793 medal which was sold with it.</p>

            <p>The next pieces distributed by the <name type="place">United States</name> government to Indians represent a great departure in imagery as well
               as in manufacture.<ref target="CH8-n52">52</ref> Rather than having been intended as emblems of political and military alliance, they appear to
               have been made to reward Indians for adopting aspects of European life, specifically agriculture, animal husbandry, and spinning and weaving.
               Each depicts one of these activities on the obverse, engraved by <name type="pname">C. H. K√ºchler</name> following designs by <name type="pname"
                  >John Trumbull</name>; on the reverse they simply identify the second presidency of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963"
                  >Washington</name> and bear the date 1796, even though they were actually manufactured and distributed in later years. Probably to save money,
               the medals were struck from engraved dies by the firm of <name type="pname">Boulton</name> and <name type="pname">Watt</name> in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, the town of the
               manufacture of the <name type="pname">George I</name> Indian Peace Medals early in the century. These so-called "Seasons" medals were presented
               to minor Indian leaders, while major chiefs were given the larger, and more traditional, <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> medals.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> medal in many aspects represents a return to the French conception of the Indian Peace Medal (<ref
                  target="#fig-103">fig. 9</ref>).<ref target="CH8-n53">53</ref> It was struck at a mint, under government supervision. Its simple devices were
               personal in import. As in royal medals, the obverse is a bust of the governing individual; no attempt is made to include an Indian <pb n="177"/>
               as had been done on most of the medals from the Quaker piece through those of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>.
               It is not known whether this represents a change in the ideologies of those who conceived of the medal or, more likely, an effort to present an
               image which the recipients would view with more respect. The peace pipe and tomahawk are moved to the back, where they surmount a handshake
               between European and Indian hands with a simple English legend. The medal was made in three sizes; for technical reasons it was struck on uniface
               sheets which were bound with a ring. For the issues of later Presidents, the Mint became more proficient in the striking of medals and solid
               planchets were used, but the personal imagery and simplicity of the <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> piece was maintained.</p>
            <p>The colonial period, then, witnessed a variety of approaches to the creation and presentation of medals to Indians as signs of alliance. With the
                  <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> medals, the experimentation ended and a truly national medallic tradition began.</p>

                     >Gardner A. Sage</name> Library of the Dutch Reformed Theological Seminary not far from <name type="pname">Rutgers</name>, where he worked
                  under <name type="pname">Dr. C. Van Dyke</name>. In 1915, he was appointed Librarian of the American Numismatic Society. The appointment of
                     <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> coincided with the period when <name type="pname">Edward Theodore Newell</name>
                  was taking control of the American Numismatic Society‚Äî<name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> became President in
                  1916‚Äîand <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> was <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s
                  right-hand man. It seems odd to us that these two men, so dissimilar in their personalities, should have worked so well together; <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> was so spirited, so alive, so innovative; <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> rather dry and strict. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>, however, knew
                  and appreciated <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>'s steadiness, which complemented his own meteoric qualities, and he
                  certainly counted on <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>'s phenomenal capacity for work. <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> carried on the work of the Society during the World War I while <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> served the Army at a desk job in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963"
                     >Washington</name>. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> designed and constructed the rearrangement and the cataloguing
                  of the books in the ANS library. He also created a photofile of photographs of coins from auction catalogues, making up 10,000 cards in the
                  first year. Subsequently he served the Society as Secretary, Editor and Chief Curator. His major work was the publishing of Greek coin hoards:
                  these include <hi rend="italic">The Mende Hoard</hi> (1926), <hi rend="italic">Two Hoards of Persian Sigloi</hi> (1956), <hi rend="italic">A
                     Lycian Hoard</hi> (1958) and <hi rend="italic">The Corinth Hoard of 1938</hi> (1962). He produced studies of the Greek mints of Metapontum,
                  Thurium, Sicyon and Caulonia. In addition to his work on Greek coins and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name>
                  silver, he also wrote <hi rend="italic">Hacienda Tokens of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>
                  </hi> (1949) with <name type="pname">O.P. Eklund</name>. He was a devout <name type="pname">Christian</name>, and went to Bethlehem, PA, every
                  Easter to play the organ. He was married to the former <name type="pname">Elizabeth Wilber</name>, and had two daughters. This strictness was
                  also in evidence at the Society; <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> was loath to let the staff take Christmas Eve as a
                  holiday, and when <name type="pname">Henry Grunthal</name> asked him if he could leave at one o'clock on Saturday to run some personal
                  errands, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> said, "<name type="pname">Mr. Grunthal</name>, it is not for me to give you
                  time off." But this inflexibility was accompanied by a very great kindness, in part rooted in his deep <name type="pname">Christian</name>
                  beliefs. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> was a gentleman of the old school; both <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_carpenter">George C. Miles</name> and <name type="pname">Henry Grunthal</name> have used this phrase in describing
                  him. As early as the 1950s, the staff called him "Papa <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>" behind his back. Every autumn
                  he would go out to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> to pick apples <pb n="183"/> in the orchards for the
                  exercise (on one occasion accompanied by <name type="pname">Grunthal</name>), and would bring back bushels of apples for ANS staff members. He
                  retired in 1953, but continued to come into the Society regularly, especially on Saturdays, carrying a bag of fruit‚Äîduring the day, at least,
                  he kept to an all fruit diet. He was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society of Great Britain and, in 1937, the <name type="place"
                     >Huntington</name> Medal of the American Numismatic Society. He was also a member of the American Antiquarian Society of <name type="place"
                     >Worcester, MA</name>, partly because of his interest in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> coinage and
                  early Americana inspired by <name type="pname">George Hubbard Clapp</name>. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> died on
                  June 4, 1969.<ref target="APPI-n1">1</ref>

               <p>One might think that since <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> was curator at the ANS, the Society would have an
                  elaborate reference collection of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver. Such is not the case. There are
                  perhaps half a dozen collections in private hands (some photographed here) which are better than the ANS collection in quality. Where the ANS
                  collection excels, however, is its breadth; only a few <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> varieties are lacking.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> was well aware of the Society's weakness in the <name type="place">United
                     States</name> series, and did his best to remedy it. In the <hi rend="italic">Coin Collector's Journal</hi> of January 1939, <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> wrote, <q>It would be natural to suppose that the Museum of the American Numismatic
                     Society would be richest in the coins of our own country, but such is not the fact. Perhaps our institution is not yet old enough.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We should remember, however, that other areas, which we now think of as strong at the ANS, were then very weak. <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> described the collection of ancient coins as "far less developed than the other departments," and in
                  1939 the ancients were weak, for they were yet to receive the <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> bequest. His
                  account of the ANS collection of English coins is riddled with the phrases "not strong," "not represented in strength," "lean and meagre"‚Äîthe
                     <name type="pname">Norweb</name> donations were then many years in the future. The Spanish and Latin American sections were not as strong
                  as they are now‚Äîalthough the latter was fairly well advanced thanks to the donations of Julius Guttag. There were some hidden strengths at the
                  ANS in 1939 which <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> overlooked: the collection of Caribbean coins was very strong,
                  thanks to <name type="pname" corresp="numismatics_wood_howland">Howland Wood</name> and judicious purchases during the Depression, the German
                  trays had many of their great rarities from <name type="pname">Daniel Parish, Jr.</name>, and the fabulous collection of Swedish coins from
                     <name type="pname">Robert Robertson</name> was already part of the Society's cabinet. Oddly, the two areas of coinage which we may consider
                  world class at the ANS in 1939 were Islamic coins, where the ANS had acquired <name type="pname">Edward Theodore Newell</name> and <name
                     type="pname" corresp="numismatics_wood_howland">Howland Wood</name>'s collections in 1917, <pb n="184"/> and Chinese coins, where the
                  Society had acquired the collection of <name type="pname">John Reilly, Jr.</name>, in 1930. But many of the cabinet's current great
                     strengths‚Äî<name type="pname">Alexanders</name>, large cents, Spanish and Spanish colonial‚Äîall lay in the future. The years from 1941 onward
                  saw the Society's collection grow faster than it ever had before. This coincided with, and may not have been unconnected to, an explosion in
                  the demand for coins in the <name type="place">United States</name> during and after World War II. <name type="pname">Burdette G.
                     Johnson</name> minuted at the bottom of his letter to <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> of March 15, 1943, "In the
                  40 or more years I've been in this business I've never seen anything like the present demand for coins."</p>
               <p>If <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> was somewhat stiff and dry‚Äîcharacteristics reflected in his prose style‚Äîhe had a
                  remarkable capacity for work, and the ability to turn his hand to many different questions. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe"
                     >Noe</name> was aware that the ANS cabinet was weak in the <name type="place">United States</name> series, and he did his best to remedy
                  that, even though his main interest was Greek coins. Throughout this period he was in frequent correspondence with <name type="pname">George
                     Clapp</name>, and <name type="pname">Clapp</name> provided funds, encouragement and advice for many acquisitions. Thus Clapp warned <name
                     type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> about Rochester dealer <name type="pname">Barney Bluestone</name>'s tendency to
                  overgrade: <q>I should have answered your statement that you were bidding on a <name type="pname">Willow Tree XII</name> at the <name
                        type="pname">Bluestone</name> sale, it is a good plan always to see the <name type="pname">Bluestone</name> coin before bidding on them
                     as I have discovered that he is rather liberal in interpreting quality. The last lot he sent to me for examination were all returned as in
                     one case his "about uncirculated" I could not rate as "better than fine" as it showed evidence of having been cleaned and buffed. I do not
                     believe that dealers will buff silver coins but they are apt to over-rate.<ref target="APPI-n2">2</ref>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> is not often thought of in connection with <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> state coppers, but in 1945, he expanded the Society's holdings of <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</name> state coppers dramatically by purchasing the <name type="pname">Prescott Beach</name>
                  collection from <name type="pname">Henry Grunthal</name>.</p>
               <p>The impulse for <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>'s interest in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926"
                     >Massachusetts</name> series came in 1942, when the ANS held an exhibition of coins of America. The highlight of this exhibit was the
                  display of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver, including pieces then owned by <name type="pname">T.
                     James Clarke</name>, the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> Historical Society, <name type="pname">William
                     B. Osgood Field</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_64112980">Eric P. Newman</name> and <name type="pname">Burdette G.
                  Johnson</name>. The coins were photographed, and these photographs then served <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> as the
                  basis for his three monographs on <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver coins. <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name>'s interest in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver coins arose
                  from his interest in hoards: he prepared a small pamphlet about the Castine hoard in connection with the exhibition, <pb n="185"/> and this
                  decided him to apply the basic technique of researchers like <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> in the Greek
                  series‚Äîthe die study‚Äîto the early coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name>.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> tried to encourage the exhibitors to sell or donate their pieces to the Society, and
                  in some cases, such as <name type="pname">Field</name>, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> and <name type="pname">Carl W√ºrtzbach</name>, he met
                  with success. In the course of preparing his monographs, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> was always eager to acquire
                  new examples for the Society's cabinet. The major donor to the cabinet was <name type="pname">Field</name>.</p>
               <p>Curiously, in this section of the cabinet the major acquisitions (other than those donated by <name type="pname">Field</name>) were made by
                  purchase. <name type="pname">W√ºrtzbach</name> sold the Society <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> silver and
                  state coppers at reduced prices. The <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> coins depicted here which were
                  purchased from <name type="pname">W√ºrtzbach</name> are not among the coins shown in his photographic book on <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</name> coins; rather, they were part of <name type="pname">W√ºrtzbach</name>'s "number two set."
                     <name type="pname">W√ºrtzbach</name> acquired most of his "number one set" from <name type="pname">Charles E. Clapp</name>, and sold it on
                  to <name type="pname">T. James Clarke</name>; from him it went to <name type="pname">Frederick C. C. Boyd</name>, and thence to <name
                     type="pname">John Ford, Jr.</name>
               </p>
               <p>The ANS bought many of its finest coins from <name type="pname">Johnson's St. Louis Stamp</name> and Coin Company. <name type="pname"
                     >Johnson</name> was the main agent for <name type="pname">Armin W. Brand</name>'s portion of the Brand inheritance, and many of the coins
                  bought from <name type="pname">Johnson</name> trace their pedigrees back to <name type="pname">Virgil Michael Brand</name>, and often beyond
                  him, to other owners such as <name type="pname">Dr. Thomas Hall</name>, <name type="pname">Dewitt S. Smith</name>, <name type="pname">Lorin G.
                     Parmelee</name>, even <name type="pname">Charles I. Bushnell</name>. <name type="pname">Johnson</name> commented in a letter of January 10,
                  1939, "As you doubtless know, my own stock and the stock of Brand coins I am holding gives me at this time, undoubtedly, the largest stock of
                  coins in the world." <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> replied on January 13, <q>I do know by experience that I can
                     frequently obtain from your firm material which I fail to find elsewhere in this Country‚Ä¶. As to the Brand coins, I suppose they consist of
                     rarities which are beyond our means, but if this is not the case I must rely on you to disillusion me. Do you have any of the multiple
                     thalers of <name type="place">Brunswick</name>, etc.? You know that <name type="pname">Mr. George H. Clapp</name> is interested in the
                     large cents; does he know what you have? His collection is ultimately to come to us and he desires to add to it anything he does not
                     already possess. I presume <name type="pname">Mr. Newell</name> knows what Greek coins there are in the Brand collection‚Äîdoes he know what
                     you have in your stock?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Johnson</name> answered: <q>Owing to the expense of vault space, I try only to keep <pb n="186"/> coins on hand in <name
                        type="pname">St. Louis</name> that are selling well at the time, which medieval silver (outside of the English series, which is pretty
                     well sold out) is not doing.‚Ä¶ The same thing applies to the multiple thalers of <name type="place">Brunswick</name>, of which <name
                        type="pname">Mr. Brand</name> has a vast number, including many 10 thaler pieces, but they are selling at present so far below the
                     prices <name type="pname">Mr. Virgil Brand</name> paid for most of them, that I have put them to one side, hoping in the future they will
                     do better.<ref target="APPI-n3">3</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> took advantage of this connection to <name type="pname">Johnson</name>, and
                  bought numerous ancient coins from the <name type="pname">St. Louis</name> Stamp &amp; Coin Company; doubtless many of those coins can be
                  traced back to Brand.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately when <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_noe">Noe</name> published his monograph about the Willow Tree coinage, he singled
                  out <name type="pname">Burdette G. Johnson</name> by describing him as a "Midwest Coin Firm," when all pieces that were owned by collectors
                  were referred to by name. <name type="pname">Johnson</name> did not like discrimination between dealers and collectors, and said so: <q>The
                     treatment of my Willow Tree coins in the monograph was extremely unsatisfactory to me and I will not give further assistance in preparing
                     these sort of pamphlets. For some reason or other which I have never been able to fathom, there seems to be an inclination to treat dealers
                     and collectors as being of two entirely different breeds‚Äîthe dealers not being entitled to the same treatment given collectors even though
                     members of the same society.</q>
                  <q>Just why coins provided by collectors should have a name of the owner given while coins furnished by me are referred to as belonging to a
                     "Midwest Coin concern" is more than I can understand. This book appeared while I was in <name type="place"
                        corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</name> and before I had seen a copy of it, an extremely important collector told me
                     about it and appeared to think that I had been very shabbily treated. If <name type="pname">Mr. Clarke</name>'s coins had been referred to
                     as belonging to a "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name> State Collector," it would have been entirely
                     all right to refer to mine as belonging to a "Midwest Coin Dealer" but I have a name the same as <name type="pname">Mr. Clarke</name> has
                     and if one name is used, the other should be.</q>
                  <q>This is not from any desire for advertising because these coins were not included at my request but at your own urgent desire. As a matter
                     of fact, I have never offered them to anybody being in no hurry to dispose of them. What I absolutely object to is the discrimination shown
                        <pb n="187"/> between dealers and collectors and I would feel exactly the same about it if it was another dealer and not myself who was
                     affected.</q>

            <p>This is a catalogue of medals in the ANS Collection which are believed to have been manufactured and distributed to American Indians up to the
               end of the eighteenth century. Pieces which are aftercasts and restrikes are generally omitted unless there is evidence that they were copied and
               distributed during the period in question. Much of the research on the provenance and die states and identities of these pieces was carried out
               by <name type="pname">Scully</name> as his 1991 Field Work Term project for <name type="place">Bennington</name> College; the final catalogue was
               prepared by Stahl.<ref target="APPII-n1">1</ref>
