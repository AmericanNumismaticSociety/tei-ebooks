            <p>The coins described in the present catalogue were unearthed in the course of excavations conducted more than twenty years ago by <persName>Dr. Erich F. Schmidt</persName> on behalf of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, the University Museum of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, at several sites in the region of <placeName>Persepolis</placeName>
               in <placeName>southern Iran</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-pg1-n1">1</ref> By far the largest number come from the test excavations at <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>, about six kilometers north-northeast of <placeName>Persepolis</placeName> at the foot of the mountain known as
               the <placeName>Kūh-i Raḥmat</placeName>. The date of the initial founding of <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> is obscure, but at all events
               there is plentiful archaeological evidence of the city's importance in <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> and early Islamic times. A much smaller
               number of coins (73 to be exact) were recovered in the limited excavations at <placeName>Naqsh-i Rustam</placeName>, the site of the famous
               rock tombs of the Achaemenian kings and the <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> rupestrian sculptures, a little more than six kilometers directly
               north of <placeName>Persepolis</placeName>. At <placeName>Persepolis</placeName> itself, aside from the Greek coins discovered in the
               foundation deposits and elsewhere on the terrace,<ref target="#CH1-pg1-n2">2</ref> nineteen miscellaneous coins, ranging in date from the 3rd to
               the 19th century were found at various spots within and just outside the royal buildings.</p>

               <p>The coins found in the <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> excavations, which took place in 1935 and 1937, received preliminary notice in a

                  treatment of the material was delayed first by the second World War and subsequently by numerous other commitments. The nature and results of

                  than "sondages." An aerial view of the site (see Plate XIX) shows the location of the various tests:<ref target="#CH1-pg2-n4">4</ref> 1) a
                  test in the center to virgin soil; 2) a trench west of the center in the Islamic stratum; 3) a poorly defined gate structure in the north-west
                  area near the edge of the mound; 4) a trench in the extreme west exposing almost exclusively <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> foundations
                  and some remnants of Islamic buildings; and 5) a long north-south trench with random separated plots east of the modern village fort
                  (popularly known as the Takht-i Ṭā'us), all Islamic. No systematic records of coin finds were available to me of other tests conducted by
                     <persName>Ernst Herzfeld</persName> previous to <persName>Dr. Schmidt</persName>'s excavations.<ref target="#CH1-pg2-n5">5</ref>

                  in terms of the area occupied or the size of the population at different times. The total area of the site is extensive: the circumvallated
                  inner city measures 1,400 meters from east to west, and 650 meters from north to south. While the fortified enceinte evidently dates from the
                     <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> period and continued to define the city proper in early Islam, the suburbs spread far beyond the city

                  of <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> coins and the preponderance of Islamic numismatic evidence is fortuitous, and that further excavations
                  in other sections of the site might present us with quite a different numismatic pattern and a correspondingly different picture of the

               <p>The <placeName>'Abbāsid</placeName> is by far the largest class, and of this class all but ten coins (nos. 521, 553, 615, 850–856) are
                  dated, or datable, before the year 200 of the Hijrah (815 A.D.). The preponderance of 8th century bronzes among excavation coins in the
                  regions of the Eastern Caliphate has been remarked on before. As I observed in the preliminary publication of this material, "Just how
                  important this fact is with respect to the dating of levels, buildings and objects it is difficult to say. The paucity of copper coins struck
                  in <placeName>Persia</placeName>
                  <pb n="5"/> after the end of the second century H. (at least down to the <placeName>Mongol</placeName> period) is a well-known phenomenon,
                  and it was my experience also in the excavations at <placeName>Rayy</placeName> that the vast majority of copper coins (and of course
                  copper coins predominate in excavation finds) found at all Islamic levels were of the second half of the 2nd century. This was true also at
                  Antioch. Whatever other causes there may have been to explain the limitation of copper issues in later centuries, it is quite possible that
                  the large volume of coppers struck under the rules of al-Manṣūr, al-Mahdi and Hārūn al-Rashīd met the needs for small change of most
                  communities throughout the East for several centuries.<ref target="#CH1-pg5-n11">11</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Among the <placeName>'Abbāsid</placeName> coins are no less than 24 hitherto unpublished issues (30, if varieties are counted): including
                  one of Arrajān, four of <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName>, five of <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>, one of <placeName>al-Ahwāz</placeName>, one of <placeName>Birāmqubādh</placeName>, one of <placeName>Jayy</placeName>, three of <placeName>Sābūr</placeName>, one of <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName>, one of <placeName>Fārs</placeName>, two of <placeName>Fasā</placeName>, one
                  of <placeName>Wāsiṭ</placeName>, and one without mint name. Three new mints are recorded: <placeName>Jūr</placeName>, the specific mint
                  name for the chief town of the district of <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName>; <placeName>Tawwaj</placeName>, a town near <placeName>Kāzirūn</placeName> in the <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName> district; and <placeName>Kūrat al-Mahdīyah</placeName> min
                     <placeName>Fārs</placeName>, a temporary official name for <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-pg5-n12">12</ref> Some of these coins bear names of officials and fill gaps in the recorded history of <placeName>'Abbāsid</placeName>
                  administration.</p>
               <p>The next most numerous category is the post-reform <pb n="6"/>
                  <placeName>Umayyad</placeName>, and here again we find several unpublished types: three of <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>, one of <placeName>Sābūr</placeName>, one of <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName>, one (or two?) of Wāsiṭ and at least one with no mint name.</p>
               <p>Only slightly less numerous are the pre-reform <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> coins and it is in this group that we find the most
                  interesting material. Aside from a few dirhems which are comparable to published varieties, virtually everything in this category is new.
                  Unfortunately, except for the silver dirhems, these coins are in a miserable state of preservation, as the plates will attest, and are for the
                  most part exceedingly obscure; but what remains is of remarkable interest and adds much to our knowledge of the transitional period between
                  the Arab conquest of <placeName>Iran</placeName> and the adoption of a standardized purely Arab coinage at the very end of the 7th
                     century.<ref target="#CH1-pg6-n13">13</ref> It is not surprising to learn that at least ten of these issues (probably we would be able to
                  say most of them, if the mint name was preserved in every instance) were struck at <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> itself. Especially
                  noteworthy are the following: an issue of <persName>al-Muhallab b. abi-Ṣufrah</persName> (?) with MUHLUP in <persName>Pahlevi</persName> and what appears to be a purely epigraphical <persName>Pahlevi</persName> reverse (no. 137); another issue evidently
                  of the same governor with two varieties of busts, the one on the obverse Arab and that on the reverse copied from an exceptional type of
                  Khosrau II, the divinity with the flaming headdress (nos. 138–141); two issues possibly attributable to <persName>'Abd al-Raḥmān b.
                     Muḥammad b. al-Ash'ath</persName>, one with a conventional <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> obverse but accompanied by an Arabic inscription,
                  and a purely epigraphical <persName>Pahlevi</persName> reverse, and the other a hybrid <placeName>Sasanian Arab-Byzantine</placeName>
                  coin showing the Caliph "orans" (nos. 142–143); another hybrid with <pb n="7"/> a <placeName>Byzantine</placeName>-derived cross on the
                  reverse (nos. 146–147); an issue with <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> obverse and an epigraphical reverse bearing the declaration of Moslem
                  faith in <persName>Kufic</persName> and the mint name in <persName>Pahlevi</persName> (nos. 148–149); several specimens with a
                  modified <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> bust, the name of the <persName>Caliph al-Walīd</persName> (?) and Arabic epigraphical
                  reverse (nos. 155–159).</p>
               <p>No dates are preserved on any of these <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> bronzes, but for various reasons explained in the catalogue, I
                  have assigned most of them to the years between 75 and 90 H. (between 694 and 709 A.D.), a few as early as ca. 60 H. (679 A.D.) and a few
                  possibly as late as 120 H. (738 A.D.). While theoretically <persName>'Abd al-Malik</persName>'s coinage reform went into full effect in
                  79 H. (698 A.D.), we know that a few dirhems of <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> type were struck as late as 84 H. (703 A.D.);<ref target="#CH1-pg7-n14">14</ref> and it is not too unexpected to find that governors and mint-masters continued even later to experiment with
                  new adaptations in their local bronze coinage.</p>
               <p>A few words about the specific find-spots of the coins from the <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> excavations. The largest number of coins
                  from any single area was found in the 1935 excavations of four ten-meter squares in the center (no. 1 on Plate XIX, and see Plate XX): some
                  240 specimens. The other 1935 trench (no. 4 on Plate XIX) produced about 40 coins (plus six more in 1937). The balance of the recovered coins
                  was scattered widely throughout the rest of the excavations, with relatively heavy concentrations in the area of the "poorly defined gate
                  structure" (no. 3 on Plate XIX) and in three squares (GL 35, HL 76 and IL 56) of the long trench east of the fort (no. 5 on Plate XIX). The
                  large number from the area of the gate structure is chiefly accounted for by the finding in pit no. 1 of DF 65 (field no. I–2–1520) of 74
                  coins in an oxidized lump <pb n="8"/> 2.70 meters below the mouth of the pit. Whether a beaker with molded design, unearthed in the pit 1.90
                  meters above the coins, had any connection with this lot is uncertain. In any case this hoard or accumulation of coins is homogeneous and
                  appears to have been placed or lost in the pit toward the very end of the 2nd century of the Hijrah: 23 unidentifiable specimens are <placeName>'Abbāsid</placeName> of the 2nd century (no. 633 of the catalogue), 20 are of <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName>, 192 H. (no. 522),
                  five are of <placeName>Sābūr</placeName>, 183 H. (no. 510), five unidentifiable assigned to the "<placeName>Umayyad</placeName> or <placeName>'Abbāsid</placeName>" group (no. 258), two each of <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName>, 182 H., <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>, 182 H., and <placeName>Fasā</placeName>, 182 H. (nos. 327, 478 and 562), and the rest, single specimens ranging in date
                  from ca. 80–100 H. (no. 172) to 182 H. The earliest actually dated is a single specimen of <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>, 104 H. (no.
                  179).</p>
               <p>There were two other sizable groups of coins found together in the <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> excavations. One was the lot of ten
                  silver coins of <placeName>Persis</placeName> datable to about the 1st c. A.D. (nos. 3–12 of the catalogue) excavated in the south-west
                  quarter of the center test (no. 1 on Plate XIX), among pre-Islamic debris 3.80 meters below the surface. These coins were stuck together but
                  relatively lightly oxidized, and there was no trace of a container. The other group, field no. I–1–928, clearly constituted a hoard and
                  comprised 33 <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> silver dirhems (catalogue nos. 103–134). All were issues of a single governor, <persName>'Umar b. 'Ubaydullāh</persName>, and were struck at the same mint, <placeName>Bishāpūr</placeName>: five of the year 67 H., two
                  of 68 H. and 26 of 70 H., i.e., 686–690 A.D. This hoard also was found in the center test, in the north-east quarter of the 20 × 20 meter
                  square. The coins, partly stuck together and partly loose, were recovered from a pit, 9.27 meters below its mouth, which in turn was 2.35
                  meters below the surface.</p>

               <p>Of particular interest was a hoard of 36 <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> and <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> dirhems,<ref target="#CH1-pg10-n17">17</ref> unearthed on the floor of what appears to have been a rather extensive building of the early Islamic
                  period, about one meter below the surface in front of the rock tomb of Darius I (see Plate XXI). No container was preserved. The hoard
                  consisted of 12 <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> and 24 <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> coins. Of the <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> two were of Hormizd IV (catalogue nos. 4 and 5), the earlier of which is dated 583 A.D.,<ref target="#CH1-pg10-n18">18</ref> and ten of Khosrau II, ranging in date from 596 to 626 A.D. (nos. 4–9, 11–14, 16–17). Several governors are represented among the
                     <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> specimens: one anonymous of the year 651/2 (no. 30), one of Ziyād b. abi-Sufyān of 672/3 (no. 33),
                  one of <persName>'Ubaydullāh b. Ziyād</persName> of 681/2 (no. 34), two of <persName>'Abdullāh b. Zubayr</persName> of the years
                  685/6 and 688/9 (nos. 31–32), 16 of <persName>'Umar b. 'Ubaydullāh</persName> of the years 686–690 (nos. 35–50), two of <persName>'Aṭīyah b. al-Aswad</persName> of 692/3 and 693/4 (nos. 51–52), and one of <persName>Qaṭari b. al-Fujā'ah</persName> of 694/5
                  (no. 53). The <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> dates range therefore from 651–695, with the heaviest concentration between 685 and 690;
                  and the over-all dates of the hoard are 583–695. It is interesting, but not surprising, to note that <placeName>Sasanian</placeName>
                  dirhems, not counterstamped, appear to have circulated along with the <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName>. In general appearance, of
                  course, these coins are very similar and only the literate could have distinguished between a dirhem of Khosrau II and one of an Arab
                  governor.</p>
               <p>The distribution of mints in the hoard is of some interest. The coins of Hormizd IV and Khosrau II were struck at seven mints: <placeName>Nihāvand</placeName> (4), <placeName>Rayy</placeName> (2), <placeName>Merv</placeName> (2), <placeName>Nahr-Tirâ</placeName>, <placeName>Darabjird</placeName>, <placeName>Shīrajān</placeName> (?) and <placeName>Zaranj</placeName> (1
                  each). Thus six different <pb n="11"/> provinces are represented: <placeName>Khurāsān</placeName>, <placeName>Sīstān</placeName>, <placeName>Kirmān</placeName>, <placeName>Fārs</placeName>, <placeName>Jibāl</placeName> and <placeName>Khūzistān</placeName> (from
                  east to west). The mints represented in the <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> portion of the hoard are the same in number but are
                  geographically more concentrated: <placeName>Bishāpūr</placeName> (14), <placeName>Kirmān</placeName> (3), <placeName>Darabjird</placeName> (2), an uncertain mint VIŠP etc. (2), <placeName>Nahr-Tīrâ</placeName>, <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName>,
                     <placeName>Baṣrah</placeName> (1 each). The majority, therefore, are from the province of <placeName>Fārs</placeName> (17 specimens
                  at least, or 19, if, as is probable, the uncertain mint is located in that province), and the rest from the neighboring provinces of <placeName>Kirmān</placeName>, <placeName>Khūzistān</placeName> and <placeName>'Irāq</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Two unique and very interesting <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> bronzes (nos. 54 and 55) also came from the <placeName>Naqsh-i
                     Rustam</placeName> excavations: a hybrid <placeName>Byzantine</placeName>
                  <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> piece with a facing bearded head surmounted by a cross on the obverse and an M reverse accompanied by
                  legible <persName>Pahlevi</persName> inscriptions (the name of <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> written out almost in full, and the word
                     <hi rend="italic">apastān</hi>); and an equally remarkable coin with a new type of bust combined with <persName>Kufic</persName>
                  legends of post-reform type.</p>
               <p>While the <placeName>Sasanian</placeName>, <placeName>Umayyad</placeName> and early <placeName>'Abbāsid</placeName> coins from <placeName>Naqsh-i Rustam</placeName> are perhaps to be associated with settlements there, the post-<placeName>'Abbāsid</placeName>
                  specimens, like all the Islamic coins from the <placeName>Persepolis Terrace</placeName>, have no real archaeological significance and are
                  simply evidence of the visits of "tourists" throughout the ages at this spectacular site.</p>
               <p>It will be noted that the catalogue is in three parts: <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>, pp. 19–84, <placeName>Persepolis
                     Terrace</placeName>, pp. 85–90, <placeName>Naqsh-i Rustam</placeName>, pp. 91–107. In each section the arrangement is basically
                  chronological, with sub-divisions, where appropriate, according to mints. For the convenience of the excavator and archaeologist whose
                  interest is primarily in the provenience of each coin as evidence for the dating of levels or of objects, an Inventory of Field Catalogue
                  numbers, in numerical order, is appended at the end of the numismatic catalogue (pp. 108–115). Opposite each field number is the <pb n="12"/>
                  catalogue number under which that coin is described. In numerous instances there is more than one specimen of a given type (e.g., nos. 344–363
                  are all specimens of a single issue of <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>, 140 H.); only the initial catalogue number of this series (344) is
                  listed in this concordance.</p>
               <p>Following each description in the numismatic catalogue are the field numbers of the relevant coins (I–1 = <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>,
                  1935; I–2 = <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>, 1937; PT–3, PT–5, PT–7 = <placeName>Persepolis Terrace</placeName>, 1935, 1937 and 1939,
                  respectively; NR–1, NR–2 = <placeName>Naqsh-i Rustam</placeName>, 1936 and 1938–1939, respectively). This number is followed by the
                  abbreviation for the metal, the diameter in millimeters, and the weight in grams. In many cases the weight was not recorded in the field, or
                  even if recorded, is omitted here because of the fragmentary state of preservation. Frequently only a small fraction of the legends is
                  preserved but it has been possible to assign the coin to a given issue because one or more particular characteristics are present. In some
                  cases where there are only two or three specimens of a hitherto unpublished issue the transcription of the legends is composite: that is, the
                  inscriptions have been reconstructed by piecing together complementary bits from each specimen.</p>
               <p>The coins from the 1935 and 1936 excavations were originally catalogued at <placeName>Persepolis</placeName> by the writer. Those from the
                  subsequent years were preliminarily recorded by <persName>Wilhelm Eilers</persName>. Approximately half of the coins are now the property
                  of the Oriental Institute, the others of the Iranian Government, stored in the Archaeological Museum in Teheran. The writer's work was
                  facilitated by the temporary deposit of all the former at the Museum of the American Numismatic Society and by photographs, taken in the
                  field, of a large percentage of the coins now in the possession of the Iranian Government. A few of the latter, however, from the <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> excavations, were neither photographed nor described on field inventory cards because of their generally
                  hopeless condition, <pb n="13"/> and these are included statistically in the "unidentifiable" category (nos. 866–1046).</p>
               <p>It remains only for me to thank <persName>Dr. Schmidt</persName>, under whom I worked for three happy years at <placeName>Rayy</placeName> and in Luristan in 1934–1936, for giving me the opportunity to study this interesting body of material and for waiting so
                  patiently all these years for its publication.</p>

                  <p>As for the reverse, there can be no doubt that this bust is derived from that on certain coins of Khosrau II, the bust with the flaming

                     excavations at Shāpūr, which <persName>Ghirshman</persName> has attributed to Khosrau II, allegedly bearing the dates 16, 20 and
                        34.<ref target="#CH3-pg30-n31">31</ref> The obverse of these coins bears a bust with what appears to be a semi-conventional <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> headdress, but I should imagine that it is not out of the question that a close examination of better
                     preserved specimens of this type might reveal some characteristics sug- <pb n="31"/> gesting a post-Sasanian attribution. In any case it is
                     interesting to note that there is at least a precedent, if not a parallel, for the use of the reverse bust with the flaming nimbus on small
                     bronze coins found not far from <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> and undoubtedly of local origin. From the same site comes another
                     remarkably interesting bronze,<ref target="#CH3-pg31-n32">32</ref> which <persName>Ghirshman</persName> attributes to Ziyād b.
                     abi-Sufyān, bearing on the obverse a bust of Sasanian type but with a peculiar and distinctive headdress, and on the reverse a facing bust,
                     "coiffée d'une haute tiare." The name <hi rend="italic">Ziyād</hi> appears in <persName>Pahlevi</persName> on the obverse, and <persName>Ghirshman</persName>'s supposition that this is Ziyād b. abi-Sufyān is doubtless correct. On the reverse there are two legends,
                     which <persName>Ghirshman</persName> reads <hi rend="italic">šaš panča</hi> (56) and "Bassorah?." In the plate I believe I can see
                     SIHPNJA (53); but the mint signature I cannot read, unless perhaps it is BIŠ for <placeName>Bishāpūr</placeName>, which, in view of the
                     fact that the coin is bronze and therefore in all probability of local origin, would be more likely than <placeName>Baṣrah</placeName>.
                     If the date is indeed 53, it would well suit Ziyād, who struck dirhems at <placeName>Bishāpūr</placeName> in 50, 51, 52, 53 and 54.<ref target="#CH3-pg31-n33">33</ref> But irrespective of the legends the chief point of interest is the curious facing bust of the reverse
                     which, as <persName>Ghirshman</persName> points out, doubtless derives from the type of the divinity with the flaming nimbus. Also
                     probably of the same derivation are nos. 160–161, below.</p>
                  <p>One other bronze issue undoubtedly struck in <placeName>Fārs</placeName> and exhibiting an obverse certainly related to the reverse of
                     the coins under discussion should be mentioned in this connection. <persName>Herzfeld</persName>
                     <ref target="#CH3-pg31-n34">34</ref> writes: "In <placeName>Alt-Shīrāz</placeName> sind kleine kupferne obolen gefunden, aus der Zeit
                     Khusraus II oder seiner nachfolger, wo auf der Vs. ein roh gezeichneter männlicher kopf mit dem wie gesträubte haare aussehenden <pb n="32"/> flammennimbus des feuergottes erscheint, mit beischrift <persName>Dārāb oder Dārāy</persName>, bei keiner geschichtlichen figur der

                     I have seen photographs of the reverse of these coins, but not of the obverse. There is, of course, no evidence that this issue is to be
                     dated after the Arab conquest, but at least we have here another example of the divinity with flaming headdress in <placeName>south-west Persia</placeName>.</p>

                  <p>Unfortunately the name on the obverse of this unpublished coin is incompletely preserved, but I propose to read it as MNSU [R]; therefore
                     relating it to no. 142 and again suggesting Ibn al-Ash'ath as the issuer. The reverse is extraordinary but not without parallel: the
                     standing figure of the Caliph "orans," in inspiration a <placeName>Byzantine</placeName> type, occurs on several <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> coins. In bronze we have a specimen struck at <placeName>Susa</placeName> (<placeName>Shūsh</placeName>),
                     with a <persName>Pahlevi</persName> inscription on the obverse and a purely Arabic epigraphical reverse, which <persName>Unvala</persName> read, probably correctly, as بسم لله | سنة اربع|و ثمنين (i.e., <pb n="34"/> 84 H.).<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n36">36</ref>
                     In silver there are several specimens of Bishr b. Marwān with three standing figures on the reverse, the central one facing and with hands
                        upraised.<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n37">37</ref> It is remarkable, however, that on neither of these types is the Caliph sword-girt as he
                     is here: in the present specimen there is a closer affinity with the common standing <placeName>Caliph Arab-Byzantine</placeName> type
                     and with the rare <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> imitations of the year 75 H.<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n38">38</ref> The headdress,
                     however, is quite distinctive: the top of the head appears to be covered with a cap, while the side hair (or is it a part of the covering?)
                     is arranged in large volutes or buns.</p>
                  <p>As for the reverse <persName>Pahlevi</persName> legends, the second letter of the mint signature is unfortunately largely missing
                     where the surface of the coin has flaked off, but enough of it is preserved to indicate that probably without any doubt the letter is a T,
                     and therefore the mint is <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>. The word at the left is identical with the word at the left of the "Pegasus"
                     on a <hi rend="italic">fals</hi> of <placeName>Shūsh</placeName>,<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n39">39</ref> which <persName>Unvala</persName> read <hi rend="italic">farrox<hi rend="sup">v</hi>īh</hi>, "bonheur, auspiciousness,"<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n40">40</ref>
                     and is perhaps related to a word which occurs in the margin of several dirhems: <persName>'Ubaydullāh b. Ziyād</persName> at <placeName>Kirmān</placeName>,<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n41">41</ref> and with a different ending, <persName>al-Muhallab b.

                  <p>I have attributed these remarkable and hitherto unpublished coins (nos. 155–159) to the <placeName>Umayyad Caliph al-Walīd</placeName>
                     on several grounds. The style, hybrid <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> and post-reform <placeName>Umayyad</placeName>, would suit
                     al-Walīd's dates.<ref target="#CH3-pg39-n44">44</ref> No governor or revolutionary by this name in <placeName>Persia</placeName> at this
                     time is known. The headdress of no. 159 suggests the possibility that the die-engraver is attempting to represent the Caliph.<ref target="#CH3-pg39-n45">45</ref> The inscription to the right of the bust is very puzzling. Is it in <persName>Kufic</persName> or
                     in <persName>Pahlevi</persName>? On no. 155 it might be an attempt at <persName>Kufic</persName>, but on no. 156, where the end
                     of the legend appears to be different, it looks more like <persName>Pahlevi</persName>. On no. 159 it again looks more like <persName>Kufic</persName>. With great reserve I suggest the possibility that the die-engraver was trying to write <hi rend="italic">amīr

                  <p>This type might be pre-Arab, but the curious bust and headdress suggest another Arab experiment of the same general nature as that on the

                  <p>It is just possible that the inscription on the obverse is to be read MNSUR, in which case the coin may be related to those which I have
                     tentatively assigned to <persName>'Abd al-Raḥmān b. Muḥammad b. al-Ash'ath</persName> (cf. nos. 142–143, above). On the other hand, if
                     this hesitantly proposed reading is incorrect the coin may well not be <placeName>Arab-Sasanian</placeName> at all, as there is nothing
                     else in the preserved epigraphy to distinguish it from a straight <placeName>Sasanian</placeName> issue; in which case the specimen
                     should be dated considerably earlier. But a comparable type, in all probability of Arab date, supports the post-conquest attribution. Among
                     the coins found by the French Mission at <placeName>Susa</placeName> was one with a similar "Pegasus" on the obverse, accompanied by
                        <persName>Pahlevi</persName> legends which <persName>Mr. Unvala</persName> read <hi rend="italic">farrox<hi rend="sup">v</hi>īh</hi> (cf. no. 143, above) and <hi rend="italic">pēročīh</hi>, "victoire."<ref target="#CH3-pg41-n47">47</ref> The reverse,

                  <p>These unpublished coins are interesting in that they fix the correct name of <persName>Salm b. al-Musayyib</persName>, '<hi rend="italic">āmil</hi> or prefect of <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName> on behalf of 'Abdullāh b. 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Azīz (governor of

                     him as <persName>Muslim b. al-Musayyib</persName>,<ref target="#CH3-pg45-n53">53</ref> and again in another connection he calls him
                        <persName>Muslim</persName> when speaking of his house in <placeName>Kūfah;</placeName>
                     <ref target="#CH3-pg45-n54">54</ref> but in two other passages he refers to the same house (<persName>dār al-mukhtār</persName>) as
                     being the one "now known" (at the time of his primary witness) as that of <persName>Salm b. al-Musayyib</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-pg45-n55">55</ref> It is therefore clear that <persName>Salm</persName> and <persName>Muslim</persName> are the
                     same person, and our coins establish the fact that <persName>Salm</persName> is the correct name. Also of interest is the small detail

                  <p>The obverse is very crude and almost illegible; the attribution is therefore doubtful. The coin appears to be the product of a provincial

                  <p>This unique coin is of uncommon interest. Not only is it the first known Umayyad issue bearing the mint name <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName>, but, so far as I know, it antedates by 140 years the earliest hitherto recorded coin of this mint (designated by this
                     name), a dirhem of the <persName>Abu-Dulafid Aḥmad b. 'Abd al-'Azīz.</persName>
                     <ref target="#CH3-pg47-n57">57</ref> Another unpublished issue of <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName> from the excavations is dated 192 (see
                     nos. 522–552, below); and a few years after this latter date the mint becomes active under the name of <placeName>Fārs</placeName> (or
                        <placeName>Fāris</placeName>), the name of the province of which <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName> was the capital.<ref target="#CH3-pg47-n58">58</ref> Theoretically <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName> was founded by the Arabs on the site of their encampment

                     had been occupied by the <persName>Sasanians</persName> before the conquest.<ref target="#CH3-pg47-n60">60</ref> However, the
                     relatively late date of the commencement of the mint's activity would suggest that the town, if it existed, was not of administrative
                     importance in the early 7th century.</p>

                  <p>It is evident that the words beneath the obverse and reverse areas are to be read together, because on coins of <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> and Fasā struck in the same year (nos. 478–489 and 562–580, below), the name <persName>Muḥammad b. Yaḥyâ</persName>

                  <p>I–2–1555 Æ 20, 1.34. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X</p>
                  <p>A crack, possibly caused by the counter-stamping, is present on the coin at the point where the mint name lies. To judge by the width of
                     the crack there would be a letter between the <hi rend="italic">و</hi> and the ج of the name; but on the other side only the letter <hi rend="italic">\</hi> is missing, so it appears that the crack is wider than the flan originally was at this point, and that no letter is
                     missing between <hi rend="italic">و</hi> and ج.</p>
                  <p>This very interesting coin not only is unique but it is the first known example of this mint. Tawwaj was a town on the <placeName>Ratīn River</placeName> (now the <placeName>Rūd-i Ḥilla</placeName>) in the district of <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName>, near
                     Kāzirūn and 32 farsakhs from <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName>. It was an ancient town,<ref target="#CH3-pg66-n85">85</ref> captured by the
                     Arabs in 18 or 19 H. (639–640 A.D.) and thereafter settled by them and embellished with mosques and a <hi rend="italic">dār
                           al-muslinitn.<ref target="#CH3-pg66-n86">86</ref>
                     </hi> The town's chief claim to fame in later Islamic times was its textile production <pb n="67"/> particularly of a type of linen known
                     as <hi rend="italic">tawwazi,</hi> produced both in <placeName>Tawwaj</placeName> and also in <placeName>Kāzirūn</placeName> by
                     artisans from <placeName>Tawwaj</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-pg67-n87">87</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our interest in this coin is not however limited to its topographical aspects. It will be noted that the obverse margin bears the unusual
                     Qur'ānic quotation <persName>Sūrah XLII</persName>, 22: "Say, for this I ask no wage of you, save love of my kin." This verse occurs
                     on a number of coins, both dirhems and <hi rend="italic">fulūs,</hi> struck by <persName>Abu-Muslim</persName> and '<persName>Abdullāh b. Mu'āwiyah</persName> during the period of the uprisings by 'Abbāsid partisans between 127 and 132 H. (744–749 A.D.).<ref target="#CH3-pg67-n88">88</ref> On this account one would be inclined at first sight to attribute this coin of <placeName>Tawwaj</placeName> also to the 'Abbāsid partisans, were it not for the fact that the reverse margin bears the name and title, <hi rend="italic">amīr al-mu'minīn,</hi> of the newly enthroned 'Abbāsid Caliph al-Ṣaffāḥ. The coin therefore is an 'Abbāsid issue and must
                     have been struck after 13 Rabī' I, 132 (30 October, 749), the date of <persName>al-Ṣaffāḥ's</persName> proclamation. The retention of
                     the propaganda slogan, Qur'ān XLII, 22, is remarkable, but we know that it still must have been on the lips of all well-informed
                     revolutionaries, for <persName>Ṭabari</persName> tells us that <persName>al-Ṣaffāḥ</persName> quoted the verse in his inaugural
                        address.<ref target="#CH3-pg67-n89">89</ref> This is, so far as I know, the first recorded example of a purely 'Abbāsid coin bearing
                     this celebrated passage; the other known issues of the year 132 were struck either before the final success of the revolution, or, at least
                     in the distant mints such as <placeName>Marv</placeName> and <placeName>Balkh</placeName>, before word was received of <persName>al-Ṣaffāḥ's</persName> enthronement.</p>
                  <pb n="68"/>
                  <p>Counterstamps on early 'Abbāsid coins are not at all common, and it is a pity that the present one is illegible. One can only speculate on
                     its significance. Perhaps it validated the coin in <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName>; or else it may have legitimized an issue which might
                     have appeared to those who did not examine it carefully to predate the 'Abbāsid rule.</p>

                     the date 181. Could he have misread it? The date of the present specimen is clearly 191. Beneath the reverse area of the <placeName>Paris</placeName> piece is the name محمد, and the reverse margin reads: مما امر به الحسين بن الجناح مولى امير المؤمنين. I have not been able

                     the date of these coins. However, this '<persName>Abdullāh's</persName> father was <persName>al-musayyib b. Zuhayr</persName>,
                     who was a prominent general and official throughout the forties and fifties of the century<ref target="#CH3-pg72-n93">93</ref> and was

                  <p>It is curious that only one specimen of these evidently plentiful issues (nos. 581–609) has hitherto been recorded, and this one specimen
                     was double-struck or overstruck like no. 609, so that the publisher was unable to decipher the mint name, although he did read the first
                     part of it, <hi rend="italic">Kūrah.</hi> This specimen belonged to <persName>F. Soret</persName> and was described by him in
                        1854.<ref target="#CH3-pg77-n107">107</ref>
                     <persName>Soret</persName> speculated on the possibility that the mint name was to be read <hi rend="italic">Kūrah al-mu'aẓẓam,</hi>
                     and for this reason supposed that the coin may have been struck in <placeName>Mecca.</placeName>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nos. 603–608 are the clue to the identification of this unrecorded geographical name, Kūrah al-mahdīyah min <placeName>Fārs</placeName>:
                     the <hi rend="italic">kūrah</hi> or district must be <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName>, and the mint <placeName>Jūr</placeName>, otherwise known as <placeName>Fīrūzābād</placeName>, in early Islamic times the chief town of the district.<ref target="#CH3-pg77-n108">108</ref> The five <hi rend="italic">kūrahs</hi> or districts of <placeName>Fārs</placeName>: in the
                     classical Arab period were <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName>, <placeName>Sābūr,</placeName>
                     <placeName>Arrajān</placeName>, <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> and <placeName>Darabjird</placeName>,<ref target="#CH3-pg77-n109">109</ref> and at one time during my preliminary study of the <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> excavation coins I came to the
                     conclusion that the Kūrah al-mahdīyah min <placeName>Fārs</placeName>: must be either <placeName>Iṣṭakhr</placeName> itself, <placeName>Shīrāz</placeName> or Sābūr.<ref target="#CH3-pg77-n110">110</ref> But at that time I had not noticed the significance of the
                     name Jūr on the variety (nos. 603–608). Obviously this new official name for the old Sasanian district was created to honor the Caliph
                        <persName>al-mahdi</persName> (father of <persName>Hārūn al-Rashīd</persName>),<ref target="#CH3-pg77-n111">111</ref> but
                     evidence that it did not continue long in vogue is provided by the issues of 167 H., only six years later, <pb n="78"/> where the old name
                        <placeName>Ardashīr-Khurrah</placeName> recurs (nos. 319–326); and the latter designation is still in use in 182 H. (nos.

                  <p>As is the case with almost all the coins of this mint the legends on this specimen are exceedingly difficult to read. Here an additional
                     difficulty is that the coin is double struck. My reading of the date is doubtful. The word جائز is dubious, but يزيد is almost certainly
                     correct. At all events I have not found in the published literature or in the collection of the American Numismatic Society any other

                  <p>The mint signature is enigmatic. Perhaps comparable are <persName>Paruck's</persName> no. 2 (AB, Abrashahr?), his nos. 186 and 208

                     to me the most likely identification. <placeName>Shīrājan</placeName> was the late Sasanian and early Islamic capital of <placeName>Kirmān</placeName> province.<ref target="#CH5-pg94-n119">119</ref>

                     it difficult to accept this interpretation. Could it by any chance be a rendering of the old <placeName>Pahlevi</placeName> name of

                  <p>It is a great pity that the reverse of this truly remarkable coin is not completely preserved so that the mint and exact date can be fixed.
                     The word عشر is fairly certain, placing the issue probably in the teens of the 2nd century of the Hijrah; at all events it is after 99 H.,
                     because مئة is entirely clear. The combination of a bust of Sasanian inspiration (though no longer the "bust of <persName>Khosrau
                        II</persName>") with a developed conventional post-reform reverse (one would normally call it the obverse since it bears the first part of
                     the <hi rend="italic">shahadah</hi> and the mint-date formula, but I have given precedence to the bust) presents an advanced stage of
                     transitional hybrid. It would be interesting to know whether or not the word محمد across the face is a counterstamp or is on the die
                     itself. Despite the fact that there appears to be no corresponding protuberance on the other side of the coin, I would judge that the word
                     is a counterstamp and that it was intentionally applied to mutilate the face, which one may assume had by this time become distasteful to
                     strict partisans of the nascent Islamic iconoclastic sentiment.</p>
