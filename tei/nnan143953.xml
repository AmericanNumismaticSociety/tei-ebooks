            <p>Students have always found the coinage of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> of more than passing interest, and the country of the early Romans is still a far from exhausted field of numismatic research. Few sections of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName> have had such a varied history. Few have been more fought over. Greeks, Romans, Vandals, Goths, Franks, Germans, Normans, Spaniards, Austrians and the Papal Authorities have had a hand in the mismanagement of the country's affairs, and all have left traces of their influence, but nowhere more definitely than in the field of numismatics. The changing coinage has always been interesting, and the publication of the Corpus Nummorum Italicorum, undertaken by His
<pb n="2"/>
Majesty, <persName corresp="#viaf_13103888">Victor Emmanuel III</persName>, is a magnificent demonstration of the value of numismatic research.</p>
            <p>In the time of Augustus, "Italia" was divided into eleven sections. In the feudal period many of these had been governed for centuries by members of the same family. It was a normal condition for these clans to wage war one upon the other, and this state of affairs existed almost uninterruptedly until the middle of the Nineteenth Century. "The destinies of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> were decided in the cabinets and on the battle-fields of <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729883">Northern Europe</placeName>—a Bourbon at Versailles, a Hapsburg at <placeName corresp="#geonames_2761333">Vienna</placeName> or a thick-lipped Lorrainer, with the stroke of his pen, wrote off province against province, regarding not the population who had bled for him or thrown themselves upon his mercy." Through it all, the Papacy has exerted a powerful influence. In the early period such a shifting of control was not to the best interests of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, as we know it today, did not exist, of course, until 1870. With the fall of the French Empire under <persName corresp="#viaf_88934487">Napoleon III</persName>, the assistance of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> was
<pb n="3"/>
no longer available, and Rome came under the dominion of <persName>Victor Emmanuel</persName>. All of that great mountainous peninsula was united and free. For over seventy years the country has been governed by a Prince of the House of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>. Its population has prospered more during that period than for many preceding centuries.</p>
            <p>These changing conditions were not without effect upon the organisations which we class as Orders of Knighthood. Many of the Orders of Chivalry founded by the Ducal or Princely rulers of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> were named for their patron saints. It has seemed expedient in this article to treat of the Orders and Decorations of all of these changing principalities separately. Insofar as is possible, any repetition which this course involves has been avoided.</p>

               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName>, the most northern province of Tuscany, lies between the Apennines and the Mediterranean Sea. Its principal city, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName>, on the River Sarchio, is famous for a remarkable bridge which is said to have been built about 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> From the time of the Narses, in the Sixth Century, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName> was an important city. Here and at <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542122">Pisa</placeName>, the earliest Italian school of painting flourished in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName> became an autonomous commune from the death of <persName>Matilda</persName> (1115). In 1314 <persName corresp="#viaf_23958294">Uguccione della Faggiola</persName> seized the reins of Government, but later he was superseded by the powerful <persName corresp="#viaf_57408051">Castruccio Castracani</persName>. Louis of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2951839">Bavaria</placeName>, after having occupied it by his troops, sold it to a Genoese banker, <persName>Gherardo Spinola</persName>; it was seized by <persName>John</persName>, King of <placeName>Bohemia</placeName>, pawned by him to the Rossi of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName>, sold to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName>, relinquished to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542122">Pisa</placeName>, nominally liberated by <persName>Charles IV</persName> (Emperor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, 1346-1678) and governed by his vicar. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName>,

subjected to endless vicissitudes, managed first as a democracy and after 1628 as an oligarchy, to maintain its independence, alongside of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176219">Genoa</placeName>, and painted the word "Libertas" on its banner until the French Revolution. In 1805, <persName corresp="#viaf_106964661">Napoleon I</persName> gave <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName> to his sister <persName>Eliza</persName>, who had married <persName>Bacciochi</persName>. It was occupied by the Neapolitans in 1814, and from 1816 to 1847 it was the Duchy of <persName>Maria Louisa</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName> (who married her cousin, <persName>Charles IV</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>), and was ruled by her son, <persName>Charles Louis</persName>. It later formed one of the provinces of Tuscany. Under the rule of the Lombard Dukes, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName> possessed a coinage of its own.</p>
               <p>MILITARY ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q727266">SAINT GEORGE</orgName> OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName>. <persName>Duke Charles Louis Ferdinand</persName>, a Spanish Bourbon, founded this Order on June 1, 1833. It was called <hi rend="italic">Ordine di San Giorgio per il Merito Militare</hi>, and was awarded for military services to the Duchy. It was also issued to officers and privates whose service exceeded three years.</p>
               <p>The Decoration is a Maltese cross, enamelled white. It is edged with gold for the
<pb n="6"/>
first class, with silver for the second, while for the third class it is silver without the enamel. In the centre is a white medallion, upon which there is a gold figure of <persName>St. George</persName> slaying the dragon, surrounded by the words <hi rend="italic">AL MERITO MILITARE</hi> on a green band. The reverse shows the initials of the founder, <hi rend="italic">C.L.</hi>, crowned, and the date <hi rend="italic">1833</hi>. The ribbon is bright red with a white stripe.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q247777">SAINT LOUIS</orgName>. Founded on December 22, 1836, by <persName>Duke Charles Louis</persName>, and awarded for civil merit. It was reorganized in 1849 by his son, <persName>Charles III</persName>, Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName>, a Bourbon, for Civil and Military service; it is, therefore, classed with the Orders of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName> also. See page 19.</p>
               <p>The badge of the first class is a white-enamelled cross, with heavy gold lines and with a large fleur-de-lis at the tip of each cross-arm. The obverse bears a shield upon which is an effigy of <persName>Saint Louis</persName> in golden armour; the reverse has a shield bearing the Bourbon crest of three lilies.

               <p>CIVIL MEDAL OF MERIT. This Decoration was also instituted by <persName>Duke Charles Louis</persName>. It is of silver and bronze.

                  <persName corresp="#viaf_238074082">Obizzo II</persName> (1240-1293), of the princely house of Este, received the lordship of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3173331">Modena</placeName>. The Este family was one of the oldest of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q4345530">Northern Italy</placeName>, dating back to about 917 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Through the marriage of an heiress of the house of Welf, of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2951839">Bavaria</placeName>, with a younger son of the house of Este, this family became connected with the houses of Brunswick and Hanover, from which are descended the Sovereigns of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, through the house of Guelph. At various periods, the Estensi received the sovereignties of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3177090">Ferrara</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3173331">Modena</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523630">Reggio</placeName>. The male branch of the family lost the duchies of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3173331">Modena</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523630">Reggio</placeName> on the death of <persName corresp="#viaf_43012269">Hercules Rinaldo</persName>, who died in 1803.

Members of the Este family and their descendants had held the Duchy of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3173331">Modena</placeName> almost continuously from 1288 until 1860. In that year the territory by a plebescite was declared part of the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE EAGLE OF ESTE. Founded by <persName>Francis V</persName> on December 27, 1855, and awarded for military and civil merit. The number of the members of the Order was limited to 20 for the Grand Cross, 40 for the Commander Class and 120 for the Class of the Knights. The decoration was surrendered on the death of the Knight. The insignia is a gold Maltese cross with gold knobs at the points, white-enamelled and edged with blue.

               <p>MILITARY MEDAL FOR LOYALTY. <persName>Francis IV</persName>, the first Hapsburg duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3173331">Modena</placeName> (1816-1846), caused a medal to be struck and awarded to those of his troops who remained faithful during the riot of February 4, 1831. This disturbance was organized by <persName corresp="#viaf_88725379">Ciro Menotti</persName>, and forced <persName>Francis IV</persName> to flee from his capital. It was thought by some that the Duke was in league with <persName>Menotti</persName>, but as the Duke caused <persName>Menotti</persName> to be put to death when the Revolution was suppressed, this is doubtful. The silver medal given to his supporting troops bears the inscription <hi rend="italic">FIDELI MILITI MDCCCXXXI</hi>. Within a wreath of laurel,

               <p>CROSS FOR SERVICE. Authorized by <persName>Francis V</persName>, May 16, 1852. This medal was awarded to officers who had served 25 years under the banner of the house of Este. It is a silver cross with a gilt edge. In the centre is the white eagle of Este, surmounted by a crown and the letters <hi rend="italic">F. V.</hi> The reverse bears the Roman figures <hi rend="italic">XXV.</hi> The cross is surmounted by the ducal crown, and the ribbon is white, edged with blue.</p>
               <p>MILITARY MEDAL OF MERIT. This decoration was created in 1852 for the junior officers and privates. It is silver.

               <p>MEDAL OF FIDELITY. <persName>Francis V</persName> appears to have been in a struggle with his subjects during most of the thirteen years of his reign. He was compelled to seek refuge in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> in 1849, but he returned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3173331">Modena</placeName> after the battle of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542119">Novara</placeName> on March 24th of the same year. Ten years later he was again forced to flee. In 1860 <placeName corresp="#geonames_3173331">Modena</placeName> became part of <placeName>United Italy</placeName>. To reward those of his subjects who had remained faithful to him during his exile, he created the Medal of Fidelity in 1863. It is bronze, 32mm. in diameter. On the obverse it bears the effigy of the duke and the inscription <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>FRANCESCO V</persName> AUST. ATESTENUS DUX MUTINAE</hi>; on the reverse, the words <hi rend="italic">FIDELITATI ET CONSTANTIAE IN ADVERSIS MDCCCLXIII</hi>, surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves.

               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName> was the Eastern section of Gallia Cispadane at the time of Constantine. It lies in the Lombard plain, north of the Apennines, south of the River Po and west of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3173331">Modena</placeName>. For the first fifteen centuries of the Christian era, the many rulers of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName> were of various nationalities. The duchy came into the possession of the Farnese family during the early part of the Sixteenth Century. Eight dukes of that family ruled over the destinies of its people. From Antonio, who died childless in 1731, the duchy passed to <persName>Charles</persName> of Bourbon (<persName>Don Carlos</persName>), Infante of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, who became King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName> in 1735. Both <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> governed it at various times. At the Congress of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2761333">Vienna</placeName> in 1815, the duchy was granted to <persName>Marie-Louise</persName> (daughter of <persName>Francis I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>), second wife of <persName corresp="#viaf_106964661">Napoleon I</persName>. She died in 1847. Spanish and Austrian rulers again came into possession. <persName>Charles III</persName>, a Bourbon and the grandson of <persName>Victor Emmanuel I</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523228">Sardinia</placeName>, reigned from 1849
<pb n="16"/>
until his assassination in 1854. In 1860, during the regency of his son <persName>Robert</persName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName> was incorporated in the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF CONSTANTINE. Authorities differ with regard to the date of the institution of this Order. It has been said that it was founded by Constantine the Great about the year 313 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Others give credit to the Byzantine Emperor <persName>Isaac II</persName> (<persName>Isaac Angelus Comnenus</persName>), and fix the year as 1190. This seems the more probable date. The Order is also called the Order of <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q537686">Saint Angelus</orgName>, the Order of the Golden Chevaliers, and the Military Order of Constantine of <persName>Saint George</persName>, it being under the patronage of that Saint and Martyr. Late in the Seventeenth Century its control appears to have been sold to <persName>Francis I</persName> (<persName>Francis</persName> of <persName>Farnese</persName>), Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName>, who became the Grand Master. The Order came into high repute because of the rules he observed in its distribution, and also because of the large domains he conferred upon it, including the church of the Madonna della Steccata at <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName>. Clark attributes its revival to <persName>Charles V</persName>.</p>
               <pb n="17"/>
               <p>In 1734 or 1735, after the extinction of the male line of the <persName>Farnese</persName> family, the heir to the Duchy of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName>, <persName>Infante Don Carlos</persName> (son of <persName>Philip V</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_242146462549627771334">Elizabeth Farnese</persName>), became the Grand Master. He transferred the Order to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName> when he ascended that throne. It was abolished in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName> by <persName>Joseph Bonaparte</persName> in 1806 but continued in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>. Revived in 1814, it remained in existence until the unification of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>. Owing to its transfer to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>, it is frequently classed among the Orders of the Two Sicilies. The members of the Order consist of Senators, Commanders, Knights, Serving-brothers and Squires.</p>
               <p>On August 8, 1922, the Count d'Caserta of the Austrian line of Bourbons, and a distant cousin of the King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> through the female line, honoured one Michael Cangiano, the official Interpreter of the Superior Court of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4931972">Cambridge</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>. Signor Cangiano was made a Knight of the Order of Constantine of <persName>Saint George</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171457">Parma</placeName> and of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>. This indicates that the Order has been continued as a Family Order by the old rulers of those Duchies.</p>

On the reverse is a figure of <persName>St. Louis</persName>, surrounded by the motto <hi rend="italic">DEUS ET DIES</hi> (God and light). The Grand Cross and that for Commanders and Cavaliers of the first class have a gold figure of <persName>St. Louis</persName> surmounted by a gold crown. The cross for the second class Cavaliers has a silver figure with a silver crown, and the fifth class is of enamelled silver without a crown. The ribbon is light blue and yellow.</p>
               <p>MEDAL OF MERIT.

               <p>When Marinus, the Dalmatian monk, and his companions settled in the Eastern Apennines, in the third century, they little thought they were establishing a community with such a future. For a long time <placeName corresp="#geonames_3168068">San Marino</placeName> was something like a buffer state, between hostile Italian dynasties in that vicinity. In 1631, the Independence of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3168068">San Marino</placeName> was acknowledged by the States of the Church. <persName corresp="#viaf_106964661">Napoleon I</persName> preserved its separate existence in 1797, and <persName corresp="#viaf_88934487">Napoleon III</persName> protected it from the designs of <persName corresp="#viaf_103211092">Pope Pius IX</persName> in 1854. At the unification of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, 1859-1860, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3168068">San Marino</placeName> was still allowed its independence, and today it is the <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> Republic in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName>.</p>

The badge or cross, which is surmounted by a gold crown, is a gold-edged, white-enamelled cross moline with a gold ball at the end of each arm. Between the arms are four gold towers. The obverse centre bears the effigy of <persName corresp="#viaf_18144292">Saint Marino</persName> to left, surrounded by a blue band, inscribed <hi rend="italic">

This title of King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523228">Sardinia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> continued until the unification of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> in 1859-1860.</p>

               <p>About 1404 Amadeus VIII, (the first Duke of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>), extended his provinces. The territory over which he later reigned extended from the Lake of Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the River Saone (in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>) to the River Sesia in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>. The Duchy of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> also included Nice. This section remained almost continually in the possession of the house of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> until 1860.</p>
               <p>It is said that <persName corresp="#viaf_88934487">Napoleon III</persName> had a secret treaty with Count Cavour, the Italian statesman, before the French army went to assist the Sardinians to drive the Austrians from <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q4345530">Northern Italy</placeName>. At the Peace table, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>, the cradle of the house of that name, as well as Nice, was given to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>.

               <p>ORDER OF THE MOST SACRED ANNUNCIATION. This Order is the highest in rank and most important of all the Italian Decorations. It ranks with the Golden Fleece of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and the Garter of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. Authorities differ as to its origin, though many of them give the year 1362 as the date of its foundation. In that year, the Order of the Neck Chain of Order of the Collar of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> was founded by Amadeus VI, Count Verde of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> (1333-1383). His grandfather, Amadeus V, called the Great, assisted the Knights of the Order of <persName>Saint John</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName> at <placeName corresp="#geonames_400665">Rhodes</placeName>, and compelled the Turks, under Mahomet II, to abandon their siege of that island in 1310 or, as some state, in 1315. For this service Amadeus V was presented with a collar, bearing the letters <hi rend="italic">F.E.R.T. Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit</hi> (By his bravery <placeName corresp="#geonames_400665">Rhodes</placeName> was held). He

was also granted for his Arms, the use of the white cross of the Crusaders, which later became the Cross of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> (H. W. Fincham's "Order of <persName>St. John</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>"). Although authorities differ as to the exact meaning of these letters F.E.R.T., the above is the more generally accepted explanation, and is that given by Bernardo Giustinian, the Italian authority, in 1692. In 1518, new statutes were formulated for the Order by <persName>Charles III</persName>, Count of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>. At that time the name was changed to the Order of the Most Sacred Annunciation. Several changes in the Order have been made by various Counts of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> since that time, among whom were <persName corresp="#viaf_95301792">Victor Emmanuel II</persName> in 1869 and <persName>Humbert I</persName> in 1889. There is but one class of Members—Chevaliers or Knights, whose number, exclusive of the Sovereign and Church Dignitaries and Princes, is limited. They must also be of the Roman Catholic faith.

The Order took its name from the patron saint of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>. Amadeus VIII conferred this Order on ten of his courtiers when they accompanied him to his retreat at the priory of Ripaille. He was elected Pope in 1439, taking the name of Felix V, but he resigned in 1448 and retired to the solitude of Ripaille, where he died in 1450.

1572 by Duke Emmanuel Philibert of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>, to encourage the Catholics to resist the Calvinistic reforms attempted in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>. The Dukes of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> were Grand Masters.</p>
               <p>The Order of <persName>Saint Lazarus</persName> was generally supposed to have been founded about the year 1060, during the earlier crusades, although there was a Fraternity of Ecclesiastical Knights who as early as 366 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> founded a hospital at <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName> to care for the lepers. These were known as the Knights of <persName>St. Lazarus</persName>. <persName corresp="#viaf_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName>, in his "History of the most noble Order of the Garter," London, 1715, writes—"At length, through the incursion of the Barbarians, and Injury of Time, it (the order) lay extinguished, but was revived when the Latin Princes joyned in a Holy League to recover the Holy Land. … For in that Time the Monks of this Order added Martial Discipline to their Skill in Physick; and for their Services against the Infidels, begat great Esteem from Baldwin II, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName>, and some of his Successors." The Order was inactive for a long period.
<pb n="33"/>
In 1490 it was united with the Hospitallers of <persName>St. John</persName> at <placeName corresp="#geonames_400665">Rhodes</placeName>, but in 1565 Pope Pius IV restored it and granted additional privileges. In September, 1572, Pope <persName corresp="#viaf_49209402">Gregory XIII</persName>, at the request of Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>, restored the Order of <persName>Saint Maurice</persName> and united it with that of <persName>St. Lazarus</persName>, under the title of the ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q7100541">SAINT MAURICE</orgName> AND <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q830796">SAINT LAZARUS</orgName>. Pope <persName corresp="#viaf_49209402">Gregory XIII</persName> also appointed the Dukes of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> Hereditaries and Masters, and as Ashmole writes—"oblig'd them to furnish out two Gallies for the Service of the Papal See, to be employ'd against Pyrates."</p>
               <p>There have been many changes in the Order by the various sovereigns, but at present there are five grades: Knights of the Grand Cross, Grand Officers, Commanders, Officers and Chevaliers. The number of the last grade is unlimited. Many foreigners have been decorated with this grade. The present form of decoration was established by Duke <persName>Charles Emmanuel I</persName> (1562-1630). The badge consists of a white-enamelled cross, treflée, of <persName>St. Maurice</persName>, conjoined at the
<pb n="34"/>
angles with the green Maltese cross of <persName>St. Lazarus</persName>, which is ball-tipped at the points. The badges of the four higher grades are surmounted by a Royal crown, the size of the cross and of the crown indicating the particular grade. It is suspended by a bright green watered ribbon. The eight-rayed star of the Order is silver. In the centre is a reproduction of the badge or cross, without the crown.</p>

The cross, which is white-enamelled with curvilinear tips, is edged with gold. It rests upon a wreath of laurel leaves.

This is sometimes called the Order of the Iron Crown. Doubtless the origin of the name arose from the fact that at the coronation of Agilif, King of the Lombards (592–615), a crown was used, composed of gold and precious stones, inset with a band of iron which was said to have been forged from a nail of the true Cross. Tradition says that this crown was kept in the Cathedral of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6537122">Monza</placeName> and removed to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3174051">Mantua</placeName> in 1859.

Cordons, Grand Officers, Commanders, Officers and Knights. The grade of Knight or Chevalier is frequently conferred on foreigners. The insignia is a white-enamelled cross-pattée edged with gold, and convex, with knots of gold cord connecting the arms. In the blue-enamelled medallion is a gold crown. On the reverse medallion is the crowned eagle of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>. On its breast is a red shield, bearing the white cross of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>. The ribbon is of red with a white stripe in the centre.

awarded to those prominent or proficient in the Industrial, Commercial or Agricultural work of the Kingdom or of its Colonies. The decoration consists of a green-enamelled <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName> cross, edged with gold. On the obverse is a white medallion, bearing the words <hi rend="italic">AL M ERITO/DEL/LAVORO/1901</hi> The reverse medallion bears the initials of the founder, <hi rend="italic">V.

               <p>COLONIAL ORDER OF THE STAR OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">ITALY</placeName>. Founded in 1911 by King <persName corresp="#viaf_13103888">Victor Emmanuel III</persName>. Its purpose was to reward those deserving of especial recognition who were prominent in the work of the Colonies. There are five classes to the Order: Knights of the Grand Cross, Grand Officers, Commanders, Officers and Chevaliers. The decoration consists of a white-enamelled star of five points, edged with gold and ball-tipped. On the obverse medallion of red, is the gold monogram (V. E.) of the founder, with crown above. A green-enamelled circle

has at the bottom of it <hi rend="italic">1911</hi>. On the reverse red medallion are the words <hi rend="italic">AL/MERITO/COLONIALE</hi> in gold letters.

The plaque, which is worn by the first and second classes only, consists of thirty-five silver rays, on which is the uncrowned star described above.</p>
               <p>MILITARY CROSS FOR SERVICE. On November 8, 1900, <persName corresp="#viaf_13103888">Victor Emmanuel III</persName> authorized a cross for long and faithful service, called the "Croce per anzianità di servizio Militare."

               <p>MILITARY MEDAL OF VALOUR. As early as 1793, during the war between Piedmont and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_69998592">Victor Amadeus III</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523228">Sardinia</placeName> (1727-1796), created a Medal of Valour. This was awarded for individual acts of bravery, and was struck in gold and in silver. <persName>Victor Emmanuel I</persName> revived the award in 1815, at the time of the downfall of <persName corresp="#viaf_106964661">Napoleon I</persName>, but abolished it in August of that year when he created the Military Order of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>. When <persName>Charles Albert</persName> was King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523228">Sardinia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>, he reinstituted the medal in 1833, for acts of valour not sufficiently important to warrant the Military Order of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>. From the time of its inception to 1887, it was always awarded in gold or silver, but in that year <persName>Humbert I</persName> decreed that a bronze medal should be given for acts of valour of a lesser degree. This medal ranks in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> almost as highly as does the Victoria Cross in Great Britain or the Medal of Honour in this country. It is frequently called the Sardinian Medal of Valour. The earliest model was 38 mm. in diameter, having on the obverse the bust of the king facing to the

The Abbey of Superga was founded by <persName corresp="#viaf_69998592">Victor Amadeus III</persName> near <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165524">Turin</placeName>.

troops serving during that campaign under General La Marmora. The medal is of silver, 35 mm. in diameter. On the obverse appears the effigy of the King, facing left, and the inscription <hi rend="italic">VITTORIO EMANUELE II</hi>. The reverse has in large letters, in relief, <hi rend="italic">CRIMEA/1855-1856</hi>. The ribbon is light blue with a narrow gold edge. Some authorities assign a ribbon of the Italian National colours—red, white and green.</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR THE LIBERATION OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>.

As a result of that insurrection, Garibaldi with his thousand troops landed at Marsala, and in three weeks was master of Messina. The medal (30 mm.) is of silver and bronze. On the obverse is the bust of the king and the words <hi rend="italic">VITTORIO EMANUELE;</hi> below the bust, the initials <hi rend="italic">S.J.</hi>, probably standing for <persName>Stephano Johnson</persName>, the maker.

               <p>STAR OF THE THOUSAND. Here might appropriately be mentioned a unique decoration. On January 9, 1861, General Turr went to the island of Caprera to carry to that great Italian patriot, General Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807–1882), the Star of Honour which his famous thousand companions had offered him. It is a gold star of seven points, loosely set with diamonds. In the centre on a blue-enamelled field in letters of gold is <hi rend="italic">ARTURO</hi> (a star which is said to protect any one with an ideal). On this is super-imposed a gold <hi rend="italic">Trinacria</hi>, the emblem of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>. This is surrounded by an enamelled band of white, green and red, inscribed in letters of gold <hi rend="italic">I MILLE AL LORO DUCE</hi> (The thousand to their chief). This was the only decoration which that great General consented to wear; and after his death at Caprera on June 2, 1882, the star was given by his sons to the Quirinal Museum in Rome where it may now be seen.</p>

               <p>MEDAL FOR THE TURKISH WAR OF <hi rend="italic">1911–1912</hi>. But a few years ago <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_298795">Turkey</placeName> were fighting desperately for the control of Tripoli, a section of <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729887">Northern Africa</placeName> which had been under Turkish rule for several centuries. It was at this time that <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName> all but precipitated a European war by insisting upon certain methods of settlement. Fortunately conflict was averted by the treaty of <placeName corresp="#geonames_7286283">Lausanne</placeName>. To commemorate the triumph over Turkey and to honor those engaged there, a silver medal of 32 mm. was authorized on November 21, 1912. The medal was issued to all men of the Army and Navy who took part in the operations against the Ottoman Empire, whether in <placeName>Africa</placeName> or in Turkish territory. On the obverse of the medal is the head of the King, facing right, and the inscription, <hi rend="italic">

               <p>MEDAL OF MERIT. Issued for the battle of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164419">Vicenza</placeName> on June 10, 1848.

               <head>THE TWO SICILIES</head>
               <p>Even more so than with <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> proper, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName> has been a battle-ground from the earliest times. And this condition, as is usually the case, has made the numismatics of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName> of great importance. Before the period of coinage, the Sikels dwelt in the land. Later the Carthaginians disputed with the Greeks for its control, both yielding ultimately to the Romans. In addition to the struggles between the Normans and the Spaniards for its possession, it had to withstand the onslaught of the Saracens.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>, especially in the mediaeval period, has shared the fate of the kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>, or, as they came to be known, the Kingdom of the two Sicilies—a title which in itself is a commentary of the relative importance of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>. After the Lombard rule in the 11th century, the Normans, under Count Roger, brought about a consolidation of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>. The conquest dates from 1130 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>, when he assumed the title
<pb n="84"/>
of King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>. There were two periods of separation—1282 to 1442 and 1458 to 1504, but after the last-named year the two kingdoms remained under one crown until the unification of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> in 1861.</p>
               <p>It is unnecessary here to dwell upon the constantly changing rule for the two kingdoms more than to mention the conflict between the House of Anjou and of Aragon through the 14th and 15th centuries. Under <persName>Charles VIII</persName> (from 1494), the French ruled, while between 1504 and 1707 the Spanish were in control. They were followed by the Austrians (until 1720). After that date Spanish Bourbons held possession.</p>
               <p>The Napoleonic rule on the mainland dates from 1805, while <persName>Ferdinand IV</persName> controlled the island of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>. The downfall of <persName corresp="#viaf_106964661">Napoleon</persName> at Waterloo saw the two kingdoms again united under the Bourbons. The wars for the independence of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, and the efforts of <persName corresp="#viaf_100192194">Garibaldi</persName> in 1859 and 1860, finally brought both sections into the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> and under the rule of the house of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>.</p>

               <p>ORDER OF THE SHIP. In 1269, <persName>St. Louis</persName> founded in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> the Order of the Ship or of the Double Crescent. Upon his death in 1270, his brother, <persName corresp="#viaf_17302763">Charles d'Anjou</persName>, established this order in the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>. Owing to the design of the collar, this order is sometimes given a third name—The Order of the Sea Shell. The insignia was a gold collar of scallop shells, alternating with double crescents. From this was suspended a medal with a ship as its design. The motto is <hi rend="italic">NON CREDO TEMPORI</hi>. <persName>Clark</persName>, an English writer, describes an order founded in 1382 by <persName>Charles III</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>, called the "Order of <persName>St. Nicholas</persName>," while <persName corresp="#viaf_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> styles it "The Order of the Argonauts of <persName>St. Nicholas</persName>." Both give the motto as <hi rend="italic">NON CREDO TEMPORI</hi>. Apparently, therefore, this is a survival or a later form of the Order of the Double Crescent.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE CRESCENT. Favine states that this order was founded in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3037656">Angiers</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, in 1464, by René, Duke of Anjou, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>. <persName corresp="#viaf_27215170">Ashmole</persName> quotes <persName>St. Marthes</persName> as giving 1448

as the date for its foundation. René was unable to hold his island kingdom very long. The order was not popular, and those honoured with it were afraid to wear the badge. The insignia consisted of three gold chains from which is suspended a gold crescent, bearing three letters in red, <hi rend="italic">L.O.Z.</hi>, which signify, according to Favine, <hi rend="italic">L'oz en croissant</hi> (Praise by increasing). To the crescent were attached gold tags indicating the battles and feats of honour in which the knights had been engaged.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>

               <p>Aragon controlled the Island Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName> from 1282 to 1442. In 1351 <persName>Louis I</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>, founded the ORDER OF THE STAR to replace that of the CRESCENT MOON. This insignia was a Maltese cross, in the centre of which is an eight-pointed star. This Order seems to have been discontinued in 1394. <persName>Giustinian</persName>, the Italian writer in 1692, gives a list of eighteen Grand Masters of the Order of the Crescent Moon and of the Star from 1268 to 1667. This would seem to indicate that the Orders described above were connected or continued by the several rulers under different titles.</p>

               <p>ORDER OF THE SPUR. Founded in 1266 by <persName corresp="#viaf_17302763">Charles d'Anjou</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>, to commemorate his triumph over Manfred near Benevento. The insignia is a white-enamelled cross, each of the arms having double points. A spur is attached at the base. The Order was shortlived.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE KNOT OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>. Created in 1351 by Louis of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542154">Taranto</placeName> when he married the Queen of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>. This was also termed the "Order of the Holy Spirit of the Right Desire." It ceased to exist after the death of the founder. The insignia is a knot of cord entwined with gold thread.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE REEL AND LIONESS (<placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>). This Order, of short duration, was instituted by partisans of the house of Anjou, during the troubles of 1386–1390. The insignia is a yarn reel and a lioness, the significance of which is difficult to learn. <persName>Clark</persName>, writing in 1784, states that the followers of <persName>Louis II</persName>, Duke of Anjou, were divided into two factions, one of which wore
<pb n="88"/>
on its arms an embroidered reel as a sign of contempt for <persName>Queen Margaret</persName>, widow of <persName>Charles III</persName>, who desired to hold the reins of government.

               <p>ORDER OF THE ERMINE (<placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>). Founded in 1463, by <persName>Ferdinand I</persName> (1423–1494) Aragon, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>, at the end of the war which he had been waging against <persName>John</persName> of Anjou, Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2525468">Calabria</placeName>. He was led into this war by his brother-in-law, <persName>Marinus Marcianus</persName>, Duke of Sesso, who conspired to murder <persName>Ferdinand</persName>. <persName>Marinus</persName> Was not only pardoned for his treachery but was admitted into this Order. The motto was <hi rend="italic">MALO MORI QUAM FOEDARI</hi> (Death is preferable to dishonor), and the patron was <persName corresp="#viaf_88967224">St. Basil</persName>. The badge is a gold ermine suspended from a gold chain. Authorities differ as to the exact date of both the creating and discontinuance of this Order.</p>

In 1759 he became <persName>Charles III</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, at which time he resigned his Neapolitan and Sicilian Kingdom in favor of his son, <persName>Ferdinand</persName>. <persName>Charles</persName> formed the Noble Order of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin <persName>Mary</persName>, often also called "The Order of <persName>Charles III</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>." It was he who, as King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>, joined France in sending assistance to the <placeName>American</placeName> Colonies in their war of Independence.

                  <persName>Saint Januarius</persName> (<persName>San Genaro</persName>), for whom this Order is named, was the Patron Saint of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName>.

It was revived after 1814. At the present time it is classed among the non-active Orders of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>.

               <p>ROYAL MILITARY ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q2029016">SAINT CHARLES</orgName>. Instituted by Royal Decree of October 22, 1738, by King <persName>Charles</persName>, its purpose was to reward citizens and members of the army and navy who had shown exceptional zeal and fidelity to the crown. This Order supposedly never received the Apostolic confirmation of the Pope, and according to an Italian writer, Ruo, was shortlived, all record of its existence having been lost when <persName>Charles</persName>, its founder, assumed the throne of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> in 1759.</p>

               <p>ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q2295418">SAINT FERDINAND</orgName> and OF MERIT. Founded on April 1, 1800 by <persName>Ferdinand IV</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName> (also <persName>Ferdinand III</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName> and I of the Two Sicilies). It was instituted in commemoration of his having been restored to his Kingdom after the defeat of the French by the united forces of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2017370">Russia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_298795">Turkey</placeName>. The object of the Order was to reward the Neapolitans who had remained faithful to the King and his monarchy. <persName corresp="#viaf_76324981">Lord Nelson</persName>, Duke of Bronte, was one of the first foreigners to have this Order bestowed upon him. He was made a Knight of the Grand Cross. Like the Order of <persName>Saint Januarius</persName>, this was suppressed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3172395">Naples</placeName> when the French under <persName>Joseph Bonaparte</persName> controlled that country. It was continued in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName> until 1814 but is said to have been definitely abolished in 1860.

There were three classes: Knights of the Grand Cross, Commanders and Chevaliers. The cross of this Order is a gold star of six branches, in the form of rays. In the angles are Bourbon lilies. The whole is surmounted by a crown of gold. The gold-centred medallion bears a figure of <persName>St. Ferdinand</persName> in Royal robes and crowned, holding a laurel wreath in the left and a sword in his right hand. The encircling blue-enamelled band is inscribed <hi rend="italic">FIDEI ET MERITO</hi>. The reverse centre of gold is inscribed <hi rend="italic">

               <p>MEDAL OF HONOUR. By a decree of July 25, 1810, <persName>Ferdinand IV</persName> added a gold and silver Medal of Honour. This was 33 mm. in diameter, with the obverse similar to the cross. The reverse was inscribed <hi rend="italic">FIDEI ET MERITO</hi>. This was worn with a similar ribbon.

               <p>Another MEDAL OF CIVIL MERIT was issued, 44 mm. in size. On the obverse are busts of <persName>Francis I</persName> and <persName>Queen Maria Isabella</persName>, facing to right, surrounded by branches of laurel. On the reverse is a Bourbon lily, crowned.</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR MESSINA. <persName>Francis I</persName> was succeeded in 1830 by his son, <persName>Ferdinand II</persName>, who died in 1859. <persName>Ferdinand II</persName> instituted the <hi rend="italic">Medal for Messina</hi> for troops faithful to him, in that city, during the Revolution

               <p>LONG SERVICE MEDAL. <persName>Ferdinand II</persName> also created a bronze medal for Long Service.

               <p>MEDAL FOR THE SIEGE OF MESSINA. After the long siege of the citadel of Messina in 1848 by <persName>Ferdinand II</persName> which resulted in his reconquest of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">Sicily</placeName>, a commemorative medal was authorized by the king. This was to reward the troops who

had taken part in the campaign. The medal for the senior officers was of gold and enamel, 35 mm. in diameter. On the obverse within a green-enamelled laurel wreath, is a pentagonal fort; in the corners are five bombs, the flames of which rest upon the wreath. In the centre is the fleur-de-lis of the Bourbons, in relief. The reverse is similar, except that in the centre of the pentagon is the legend, <hi rend="italic">ASSEDIO / DELLA / CITTADELLA / DI MESSINA / 1848</hi>. The ribbon is red. For the junior officers and soldiers the medal was of bronze and of the same size, without enamel. Obverse and reverse are identical, and the medal was worn with a red ribbon. A variant of this medal has a plain reverse, no fort, or bombs, but with the same inscription in relief.</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR <placeName corresp="#geonames_2523119">SICILY</placeName>. Created for the troops who, under the leadership of Filangieri, suppressed the Insurrection of 1848–1849.

               <p>It is silver, 35 mm., and bears on the obverse the jugated busts of the King and Queen, facing to left (similar to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542094">Gaeta</placeName> Medal), and the titles, <hi rend="italic">

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName>, the ancient <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q206730">Etruria</placeName>, lies south of the Apennines. On the east it was bounded by the districts of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165048">Umbria</placeName> and the Marches, while to the south lay the section known in Classical times as Latium, but which later, with the rise of the Church, was usually known as the Papal States. None of these provinces had boundaries that were fixed for any great length of time, and their geographical history is very complicated.</p>
               <p>Between the 10th and 16th Centuries, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName> was composed of several self-governed communes or Republics, the most important of which were <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542121">Lucca</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542122">Pisa</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6541466">Siena</placeName>. The Medici family was a dominant factor in the government for a long period. In 1735 the country came under <placeName>Austrian</placeName> rule. <persName>Francis</persName>, Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2997551">Lorraine</placeName> and afterwards Emperor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> (1708–1765), became Grand Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName>. He succeeded <persName>John Gaston</persName>, the last of his line, and thus the Duchy passed
<pb n="119"/>
from the control of the Medici and into that of the Hapsburg family. This had been arranged by treaty.</p>
               <p>The Hapsburgs continued in control until the entrance of the French in 1799 under <persName corresp="#viaf_106964661">Napoleon I</persName>, though the battle of Waterloo in 1815 brought back once more their rule in the domain. <persName>Ferdinand III</persName> (1769–1824) was succeeded by his son, <persName>Leopold II</persName>, who lost the Duchy of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName> when the constituent Assembly voted for its inclusion in the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> on August 16, 1860. From that time all the Orders of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName> have been discontinued.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q426575">SAINT STEPHEN</orgName>. This Order was founded at <placeName corresp="#geonames_6542122">Pisa</placeName> in 1561 or 1562, by Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName>, afterwards the first duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName>, to commemorate his victory over the French at <placeName corresp="#geonames_6541466">Siena</placeName>. The battle took place on <persName>St. Stephen's</persName> day, August 2, 1554 (or August 6 according to some historians). The inhabitants of the city and the troops under <persName>Henry II</persName>, after withstanding a siege of fifteen months, finally capitulated. In 1567, <persName>Pope Pius V</persName>
                  <pb n="120"/>
granted Cosimo the title of the first Grand Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName>. The Order was named in honour of <persName>Stephen IX</persName>, Pope and martyr, once bishop of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName>, on whose festival Cosimo de' Medici gained his victory. It is said to have been discontinued in 1565, but <persName corresp="#viaf_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> states that new statutes were approved in 1590. He also lists it as one of the Orders extant in 1715; though <persName corresp="#viaf_272677247">Hugh Clark</persName> informs us that the Order was "revived in 1764 and put on a respectable footing." Whatever its status in the interval may have been, the Order was reorganized in 1817 by <persName>Ferdinand III</persName>, Grand Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName> (1769–1824), and its regulations were altered by him at that time. The insignia is a red-enamelled, gold-edged cross, similar to that of the Knights of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2562770">Malta</placeName>. In the angles are golden fleurs-de-lis and above the cross is a ducal crown of gold. The ribbon is bright red.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q177889">SAINT JOSEPH</orgName>. Founded by <persName>Ferdinand III</persName> on March 19, 1807, when as Grand Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2805615">Wurtzburg</placeName> he was admitted to the Confederation of the Rhine.

Upon the downfall of the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q78994">Napoleonic</ref> control of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName> in 1814, Ferdinand restored the Order in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName> when he again assumed control of the Duchy. The Order was for meritorious service and was awarded to civilians, ecclesiastics and the military, whether native or foreign. Generally the honour was confined to those of the Roman Catholic faith. There are three classes: Grand Cross, Commanders and Knights. The Decoration of the first class is silver, a double-pointed, six-armed cross, with rays between the arms. An oval medallion in the centre bears the figure of <persName>St. Joseph</persName>; around this on the band, likewise of silver, is the motto <hi rend="italic">UBIQUE SIMILIS</hi> (Everywhere the same), with a branch of laurel and oak. In the lower centre of the band is the letter <hi rend="italic">F</hi>. The cross of the second class is gold, and similar to the star of the first class, though smaller. It has white-enamelled arms, and the rays and the medallion band are of red enamel. It is surmounted by a gold crown and a suspension ring for the ribbon, which is bright red, with a white stripe at each edge. The reverse medallion

               <head>VENICE</head>
               <p>At the time of <persName>Augustus</persName>, there was no city of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3171728">Padua</placeName> was the chief city of the district which has since come to be known as Venetia. This district occupied the Northeastern section of that country from the Alps on the North and East to the Adriatic Sea, and to the River Po on the West. From the Sixth and Seventh Centuries, after the foundation and the growth of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>, it developed a considerable commerce with its island domains and became a great maritime power. For many centuries an independent Republic was maintained, governed by a Senate and a Doge, elected by the people; his authority, however, was limited. Constant wars with neighboring peoples and with the Turks did not exhaust the wealth of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>; and until the Eighteenth Century <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName> wielded great influence in European politics. The Republic was unable to withstand the French army, however, and on October 17, 1797, was divided—one half of the territory going to
<pb n="131"/>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> and the other half to the Cisalpine Republic; the Ionian Islands went to France. For a thousand years the Venetian Republic maintained its independence, and exhibited a form of government which commanded universal admiration.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF <persName>SAINT MARK</persName>. Probably founded early in the Eighth Century. Giustinian, writing in 1692, states that Domenico Leoni was the first Grand Master of the <hi rend="italic">Ordine di San Marco</hi> in the year 737. He also lists a number of the Grand Masters from that date to 1688, and gives several authorities. Other writers fix the date of its origin as 828, when the remains of <persName>Saint Mark</persName> were taken from <placeName corresp="#geonames_361058">Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>. No exact information is obtainable as to the discontinuance of the Order, though Ashmole indicates its existence in 1672, as does Clark in 1784.</p>
               <p>The insignia is a gold chain to be worn around the neck. From this a gold medallion is suspended. On the obverse is the Arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>—the winged lion of <persName>St. Mark</persName>, seated with a sword in the right paw,
<pb n="132"/>
and with the left paw resting on an open book, on which is the motto <hi rend="italic">PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEUS</hi> (Peace to thee, Mark, my Evangelist). The reverse is believed to have been plain, although Ashmole asserts that it had the name of the Doge then living as well as a portrait—if that is what may be understood by his words "a particular impress." This Order was conferred by the Senate or by the Doge, and later was called the Order of the Doge of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>. On late forms, the insignia was changed to a blue-enamelled cross, on the centre of which was a medallion with the above described Arms. The reverse bore the effigy of the reigning Doge, sometimes represented as on his knees receiving a standard from the hands of <persName>St. Mark</persName>. All recipients of this Order had to show records of noble birth and were known as the Knights of <persName>Saint Mark</persName>.</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR THE DEFENCE OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">VENICE</placeName> OF 1848. This medal was issued in 1849, during the second year of the short-lived Republic of <persName>Saint Mark</persName>—as <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>
                  <pb n="133"/>
was at that time called. It was of silver and bronze, 27 mm., bearing on the obverse the Arms of the Republic. Around this are the words <hi rend="italic">INDIPENDENZA ITALIANA.</hi> On the reverse is the cross of <persName>St. Maurice</persName> surrounded by <hi rend="italic">VESSILLO DI VITTORIA 1848</hi>. The ribbon is crimson with a narrow gold stripe at each side. (PI. XXXIII.)</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR BRAVERY. Also issued in 1849. It was of silver and bronze, but 32 mm. in diameter. The obverse has the lion of <persName>St. Mark</persName> and <hi rend="italic">GOVERNO PROVISORIO 1848-49</hi>.</p>
               <p>On the reverse, within an oak wreath, are the words <hi rend="italic">DIFENSORE DI <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">VENEZIA</placeName>
                  </hi>. The ribbon is red with gold stripes at the sides.</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR THE CIVIL GUARD. Authorized in 1849. It was silver and bronze gilt, oval in. form, 40 mm. by 34 mm. On the obverse appear two crossed flags and the words <hi rend="italic">GUARDIA CIVICA VENETA</hi>. The reverse reads <hi rend="italic">VV/L'ITALIA</hi>. The ribbon is yellow.</p>

The purpose of its foundation was to quell the discords which arose
<pb n="135"/>
between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines and also to defend and support the Roman Catholic religion. It was approved by Pope <persName>Martin IV</persName>, who placed the knights under the protection of <persName corresp="#viaf_66806872">St. Augustin</persName>. It was called by some the "Order of the Brothers of the Jubilation," later the "Order of <persName>St. Mary</persName> of the Tower," and the "Order of the Chevaliers of the Mother of God."<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> Archer states that this later Order was founded in 1737.

It was to reward the Genoese for the reception he received during his journey to Rome, where he received the Imperial Crown. The Order was short-lived. The badge is a plain red cross suspended from a gold chain. This Order is not to be confused with the Order of <persName>St. George</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName>, founded in 1468 by the Emperor <persName>Frederick III</persName>.</p>

An attempt was made to revive it in 1847 but without success. The insignia was an oval medallion, in the centre of which were
