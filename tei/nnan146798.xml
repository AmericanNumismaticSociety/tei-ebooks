               <hi rend="italic">The Athenian Decadrachm</hi> is the first monograph in over 35 years in any language to study the coinage of classical <persName>Athens</persName>. It collects for the first time the evidence for the largest denomination ever produced by the Athenian state, the ten-drachma piece, and situates the coinage within its social, political, and economic background. A die-study of forty genuine Athenian decadrachms in public and private collections is provided, together with a catalogue of more than ninety modern forgeries. Almost all are illustrated.</p>

            <p>The final Persian attempt to invade Balkan <placeName>Greece</placeName> was defeated at the Battle of Plataea in 479 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc</hi>, but the war against <placeName>Persia</placeName> was not yet over. <persName>Athens</persName> had played a prominent part in the great victories at Marathon in 490 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc,</hi> Salamis in 480 and at Plataea. Now, under the leadership of Aristeides, the Athenians joined an alliance of free Greeks. From its foundation this alliance was dedicated to the ravaging of the Great King's land, and to the liberation of those Greeks still subject to Persian control.</p>
            <q>And it was then that the Athenians established the <hi rend="italic">Hellenotamiai,</hi> the treasurers of the Greeks, who received the <hi rend="italic">phoros</hi> (for it was thus that the contribution of money was known). The first <hi rend="italic">phoros</hi> was assessed at 460 <hi rend="italic">talents</hi>, and the treasury was established at Delos, where the meetings of allies also took place.<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            </q>
            <p>The history of the League's early campaigns is poorly recorded in the surviving sources, but there was clearly considerable success. In 476, northern <placeName>Greece</placeName> was freed following the capture of the Persian stronghold at Eion. During the later 470s and the 460s the battle moved into <placeName>Asia Minor</placeName> and culminated in the double victory—on land and sea—of the Athenian general Cimon over the <placeName>Persians</placeName> at the River Eurymedon in what is today southern <placeName>Turkey</placeName>.</p>
            <q>After a considerable struggle, the Athenians routed the <placeName>Persians</placeName> and massacred them. They then captured the survivors along with their camp
<pb n="2"/>
which was stuffed with all kinds of treasure.<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>
            </q>
            <p>This victory occurred some time between 469 and 465 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc.</hi> By this point the <placeName>Persians</placeName> had been firmly driven back out of the Aegean region, and some cities had begun to question the continued need for the League, or at least their continued contribution to it. <persName>Athens</persName>, with effective command of the Allied fleet, was becoming the enforcer of commitment to the League. In the 470s the Athenians had led a force to Carystus in Euboea to compel the city to join the League. Shortly thereafter the large island of Naxos attempted to secede from the League and was, in Thucydides' words, "the first allied city to be enslaved contrary to the established aims of the League."<ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Following the battle of the Eurymedon the major and wealthy island state of <placeName>Thasos</placeName>, which controlled a mainland <hi rend="italic">peraea</hi> rich in mineral resources (including silver), also rebelled. The Athenians were quick to respond militarily, by laying siege to the island, but also acquisitively, by sending a force of some 10,000 settlers to establish a colony at Nine Ways (<hi rend="italic">Ennea hodoi</hi>), later the site of Amphipolis. This brazen attempt to appropriate the resources of Thasos hinterland failed when the settlers were defeated in battle by the local Thracian peoples. Thasos, however, succumbed after a three-year siege, and in <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 463/2 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc</hi> the islanders</p>
            <q>pulled down their walls, handed over their ships and agreed with the Athenians to pay as much money as was necessary immediately and to pay tribute in the future, and to surrender their mainland <hi rend="italic">peraea</hi> and mines.<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref>
            </q>
            <p>Fragmentary though our knowledge of the 460s <hi rend="smallcaps">bc</hi> is, there can be little doubt that this decade saw major military activity on the part of the Athenian state, significant expenditure on the fast growing fleet, but also a substantial influx in wealth from allied contributions to the treasury, booty won from the <placeName>Persians</placeName>, punitive reparations from the Thasians, and newly won silver sources in Thrace.</p>
            <p>This, as we shall see, is the historical background against which we must place the Athenian decision to strike the decadrachm. Given the importance of <persName>Athens</persName>, and the fascinating historical circumstances of their issue, it must be considered odd that the Athenian decadrachms have received so little scholarly attention. While the discussion about the date and the occasion of the early classical decadrachms of Syracuse (Pl. 1.B) is invariably vivid, there has been
<pb n="3"/>
almost complete silence concerning their Athenian counterparts. At first sight, this is a paradox. The number of specimens of the Syracusan issue is not much larger today than in the days when Erich Boehringer wrote his seminal study of the Syracusan coinage, whereas the number of Athenian decadrachms has grown from twelve to some forty specimens within the past 25 years. However, the new specimens have often caused problems. First, the massive Elmali Hoard of 1984 (<hi rend="italic">CH VIII</hi> 48) from which thirteen specimens derive became the object of a lawsuit finally leading to the transfer of the hoard to Turkish authorities before a definitive publication of its contents could be achieved; the majority of the decadrachms from that hoard remain unpublished. Secondly, several specimens appearing on the market thereafter raised suspicion. Although experts have done a good job in separating forgeries from genuine specimens, uneasiness has grown among dealers, collectors, and scholars.</p>
            <p>The crisis became clear when a new specimen was discussed some years ago at a meeting of the International Bureau for the Suppression of Counterfeited Coins that I attended. Though the participants of the meeting had both the Prokesch-Osten coin and the huge collection of decadrachm casts kept by the Berlin Cabinet at their disposal, they did not come to a firm conclusion. Opinions differed as to the minutiae of both style and technique. The question was left open, but at least it was agreed that a die-study might solve the problem. It is true, the coin in question had but little in common with the specimens listed in Seltman's and <persName>Starr's</persName> die-studies of the Athenian coinage, but it must be said that the samples of decadrachms known to these authors (nine specimens and twelve respectively) display a wide range of varieties and have frustratingly few die-links (both authors were aware of one only, and even this die-link was to turn out in the course of the present investigation not to exist). In fact, some newcomers to the corpus have peculiarities. Sometimes there is a certain flatness to the reverse imprint that is far from the deep relief exhibited by longer-known specimens. Sometimes the figures of both sides, the head of Athena as well as the owl, appear to have strange proportions.</p>
            <p>So it became clear that once again all specimens would have to be compared side by side, no matter if deemed genuine or counterfeit, in order to develop the criteria for distinguishing the ancient coins from modern forgeries. Arranging the series would be the second step, reconsidering the dating of it the third, and questioning the purpose of this extravagant issue the last one. Fortunately enough, a complete documentation of the thirteen specimens from the Elmali Hoard was found soon after the meeting among the papers of the late Martin Price. Thanks to Price's far-sighted efforts, this study contains all Athenian decadrachms ever recorded.</p>

               <p>The designs of the Athenian decadrachms differ in several respects from those of the contemporary tetradrachms. <persName>Chester Starr</persName>, whose study of the Athenian coinage is the standard reference, describes them as follows:
<q>The decadrachms have entirely new designs. On the obverse the helmet of Athena has three olive leaves and a very heavy spiral, which breaks into a unique palmette; the hanging earring is also unparalleled in Athenian coinage. The head of Athena is simply but strongly portrayed; the lips are full with limited modelling on the cheek. Generally the eye is oval, but on Nos. 55 and 59 it is composed of two lines with complex, unequal curves</q>
                  <q>The design of the reverse of the decadrachms is even more remarkable. The owl stands facing with outstretched wings; the alpha is to the right of the head, the theta and epsilon are on either side of the legs. The olive twig is in the upper left corner...; often its leaves are separated more than 90°. In a somewhat later group (Nos. 57 ff.), which is still within the same basic pattern, the leaves on the crest are not graduated, and the spiral and palmette come to point more at the first olive leaf. There is no moon.<ref target="#CH2-n1">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>While Starr's internal arrangement of the series is no longer valid, his description is to the point. Due to the large size of the decadrachms, the engravers had to make some changes to the design of the tetradrachm images. The most obvious change is the frontal presentation of the owl; the position of the wings has lead to some sweeping interpretations. It should be said, however, that a strong pictorial difference between the two highest denominations of the Athenian
<pb n="6"/>
coinage was necessary for obvious reasons. The decadrachm owl is standing on the ground like that of the tetradrachms, with all six claws touching the ground-line. It is hard to say whether the owl is spreading its wings in order to start flying or flapping them while waking up or preening. Although ancient coin-engravers could be excellent in observing animal behavior, we should not expect too much characterization where a high degree of recognizability was as important as representational veracity. In any case, the rendering of the details is almost the same as with the tetradrachms. The short feathers over the owl's body are represented as small dots, those at the middle breast being a little bit larger than those on the flanks; only the "short trousers" around the hips have stripes instead of dots. The wings are divided into three sections: a) the mantle, the pennaceous feathers of which are represented as dots like those over the body, b) an upper row of short covert feathers, shown as short stripes, and c) a lower row of long covert feathers shown as long stripes. The two rows of covert feathers display different patterns: in some cases all the stripes point to the outside, in other cases only the upper row points to the outside while the lower row has a complex, fan-shaped pattern pointing inwards. There is much variation here. The proportions of both body and wings can also vary in several ways. The head of the decadrachm owl is similar to that of the tetradrachm owls, but it has some features of its own. First, the position is different. The tetradrachm owl is rendered in profile and has the head turned around; in many cases the head is thrown back somewhat and the owl is looking at a point above the observer. The head of the decadrachm owl, however, is in a strictly frontal position, the eyes focusing on the observer. The circular eyes are divided into pupil and iris, the pupil covering about 80% of the eye. The eyes of the decadrachm owl appear to be larger than those of the tetradrachm owls, although there is no difference insofar that just one framing row of feathers forms the outline of the head. The feet of the owl are rendered in the same manner as those of the tetradrachm owls, except that they are placed side by side instead of one after another. The legs have two parallel muscles, the feet have three claws each.</p>
               <p>Due to the posture of the owl there is not much room on either denomination for symbols and letters. The contemporary tetradrachms have an olive sprig and a crescent in the upper left corner from which the owl is turning away, and a line of three letters running down at the right-hand side. The decadrachms display a different arrangement of these elements. The olive sprig is in the same place but more spread out, the leaves often separated more than 90°. The fruit is hanging at 45°, pointing to the shoulder of the owl. There is no moon, perhaps because the crescent would have become too small. On the other hand, the relations of the figures are balanced with such care that the engraver might have considered the crescent troubling to the harmony of the design. The placing of the three letters of the legend clearly results from the rearrangement of the owl and the olive. While the alpha keeps the position at the
<pb n="7"/>
upper right corner, thus corresponding to the angle of the olive sprig (hence often placed diagonally), the theta and the epsilon are put at the bottom in the center, flanking the legs of the owl. There is a subtle symmetry to the reverse image resulting from these changes.</p>
               <p>Turning to the obverse image, the difference between decadrachms and tetradrachms is less easy to see. There is Athena's head in the form known from all the contemporary Athenian coins; she is wearing a crested helmet of the Attic type with all the details at their usual places. Even the split of the plume is depicted on the decadrachms as it is on the tetradrachms. Only the ornamental embellishment of the bowl of the decadrachms has an addition: the palmette has a "tendril" spreading downwards and sometimes touching the ear. The three olive leaves above the visor are exactly as with the tetradrachm Athena Heads, the foremost leaf reaching to the top line of the bowl and sometimes beyond towards the plume. The coiffure is the same as well: the hair sweeps in long waves across the brow, with a large lock beside the ear. This "ear-lock" is sometimes rounded, as is the pattern of its inner strands. More often, however, it has a rectangular shape; in such cases the strands are arranged to form a V-shaped pattern. Sometimes it is clear that the hair waves above the forehead disappear behind the "ear-lock" (O 10); sometimes there is a small <hi rend="italic">taenia</hi> holding waves and lock in place (O 3). Usually there is a single slim "cowlick" at the forehead. Athena is wearing her hair in an open fashion, that is to say, the hair is falling down behind the neckguard. Following archaic sculptural tradition, the hair is characterized in different ways according to its position. Around the face, the hair is shown in wavy, continuous strands, whereas the hair beside and beneath the neckguard is shown as small dots forming strands. The single strand beside the neckguard is just a line of dots joining the dotted strands beneath the neckguard. The bow-shaped pattern of these strands reveals that the hair is knotted at the back of the head, although concealed by the helmet. This is, in fact, no archaic coiffure but an early classical one.<ref target="#CH2-n2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> Archaic taste, however, is reflected in the opulence of the jewels Athena is wearing. The double border of the neck truncation—a string above a dotted line—looks like a pearl necklace. The round ear-clip of the tetradrachm Athena has now changed into a tearshaped pendant. Curiously enough, the pendant does not fall vertically but is swinging forward, thus accentuating the line of the chin.<ref target="#CH2-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, there is the face. The archaic character of the Athena head on fifth-century Athenian coins has often been noted. It is an archaism without a certain
<pb n="8"/>
archaic model. The Athena Heads of late sixth- and early fifth-century Athenian coins look entirely different in both typology and style. In fact, the Athena Heads of <persName>Starr's</persName> Group II.A and beyond (the decadrachms belong to Group II.C) are modelled according to early classical taste rather than on archaic predecessors. Upon closer examination, there are three features only which may be called archaizing: the twofold pattern of the hair already mentioned, the frontal eye within a profile face, and the so-called archaic smile.<ref target="#CH2-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> The proportions of the face, however, are early classical rather than archaic, though there are some long faces that look more archaizing than others.</p>
               <p>As <persName>Starr</persName> has pointed out, the eye is always oval, but there is considerable variation. A few dies only have a perfectly oval eye. Much more often the eye is almond-shaped, that is to say, it has an asymmetrical curvature both above and below, arching above towards the front and below towards the back. These almond-shaped eyes generally have a clearly separated <hi rend="italic">caruncula lacrimalis</hi> (an area in the corner of the eye containing accessory lacrimal glands), or a pointed inner tip at least. There is no pupil, but due to the facial expression the look is always attentive and never blind. The facial expression is, of course, dominated by the smile. Smiling is a complex interaction of movements all over the face. The corner of the mouth rises, thus pushing up the flesh of the cheek. As a result, the area behind the lips deepens, producing a vertical fold in the cheek that joins the nasolabial fold. The brow rises, the eye opens widely. All these features are to be seen here. It should be mentioned that, although the conventionalized archaic smile may be intended, both the delicacy of the surface transitions and the understanding of muscular interactions are classical style through and through. In fact, some engravers ignored their instructions and created Heads of Athena that are almost avant-garde. Among the surviving specimens we find one die (O 13) that allows comparison with contemporary works of art; it will be argued that this die was made <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 460 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc</hi> (see below).</p>

                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> This, however, is incorrect;
<pb n="9"/>
the two coins share neither obverse nor reverse die.<ref target="#CH2-n7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref> Both authors also missed the obverse link between the <placeName>Rhousopoulos</placeName> and Morgan coins (<hi rend="bold">11</hi>a and <hi rend="bold">13</hi>b), and <persName>Starr</persName> overlooked that the specimen from the <placeName>Malayer Hoard</placeName> (<hi rend="bold">8</hi>b) shares the obverse die with the Burgon coin in the British Museum (<hi rend="bold">7</hi>a).</p>
               <p>Yet it would be arrogant to blame the two scholars for blunders. The decadrachms known to them were in many cases quite worn, and the Burgon coin is defaced by a deep test-stroke through Athena's forehead. It is always easier to make a die-study dealing with a great many specimens (particularly if the majority of them are in good condition) than with a few ones. The Elmali Hoard of 1984 (<hi rend="italic">CH VIII</hi> 48) has improved the situation considerably.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the decadrachms pose special problems due to their size. Plaster casts of the same piece prove to be different as to surface curvature and exactness of details. Photographs have a problem of their own: coins of so large a size and so high a relief cannot be photographed like smaller coins: the distance between camera and object has to be much greater than usual. Comparing pictures of the same piece reveals distortions varying according to the lenses used and to the distances applied. In one case, for example, the comparison of specimens is particularly troublesome because one coin was photographed from an angle that differed slightly from 90°, with the effect that Athena's face looked longer, her eye bigger, and the facial expression somehow different (<hi rend="bold">30</hi>a). Fortunately, a distinctive die-break helped to attribute specimens to the die (O 17).</p>
               <p>Forty decadrachms known to me may be regarded as genuine and valid for inclusion in a die-study. In addition, there are two lead trial pieces and two ancient forgeries (one of the latter is lost) which cannot be part of the die-study, even though one lead piece might stem from a die attested by valid specimens. The irregular specimens (trial pieces and forgeries) can be ignored without serious detriment to the study, for the relation between the numbers of specimens and dies is promising without them. Seltman knew nine specimens and he could have known one link between two specimens; <persName>Starr</persName> knew twelve specimens and could have known two links among four specimens, that is to say, Seltman had 22% of specimens interlinked, <persName>Starr</persName> had 33%. The new specimens have changed the figure entirely. The decadrachms included in the current die-study show more than 40 links among 35 specimens; that is to say, 87% of the 40 known specimens are interlinked. While the picture is clearer, there are still gaps. The sequence breaks into thirteen sections; just six die-combinations are attested by more than one specimen, and only one is attested by more than two specimens. We are still far from having the whole picture. In the future we may expect not only new die-links but new dies as well. Therefore we shall resist the temptation to go too far in interpreting the sequence that is proposed below.</p>
               <pb n="10"/>
               <p>The thirteen sections of the series are of varying lengths. There is one section including as many as twelve die-combinations, but the other ones are much shorter than that, seven including just one die-combination. Arranging them into a sequence relies on interpretation of differences in pictorial typology, technique and style, as small as they may be. Since the whole series might cover a short time-span—less than a decade seems reasonable—we cannot expect a stylistic change in the true sense of the word, particularly since the coinage in question disclaims the mainstream style of its age. Yet there is a technical feature that leads to a provisional arrangement where each section falls into one of a few groups.</p>
               <p>The specimens of the biggest section (<hi rend="bold">22–33</hi>) display a feature that was only noticed when a new specimen recently appeared on the market: the reverse imprint is very flat, the edge of the coin barely rising above the background of the <hi rend="italic">quadratum incusum.</hi> Though the flatness was never conspicuous, each coin of the section does show it in one way or another. A close examination of all 40 specimens revealed no clear point at which a change occurred; rather, there is a gradual transition. There are specimens with a reverse imprint which looks extremely deep because at least one side of the edge raises exuberantly (<hi rend="bold">1</hi>a, <hi rend="bold">3</hi>a, <hi rend="bold">6</hi>a, <hi rend="bold">14</hi>a). When compared with other specimens of their respective sections it turns out that "deepness" is a relative value and dependent on innumerable accidents of the minting procedure. In fact, there is a clear cause of imprints of so variable a deepness: the size of the reverse die. Of course, we must not expect that the power of the minting strokes was always the same. From the statistical point of view, however, the rule holds true that the larger the die the flatter the imprint. The measurements of reverse dies known to me are as follows:</p>
               <p>1a 2.21 × 2.19 cm</p>
               <p>5a 2.19 × 2.18 cm</p>
               <p>21a 2.49 × 2.39 cm</p>
               <p>23a 2.51 × 2.55 cm</p>
               <p>29a 2.53 × &gt;2.31 cm</p>
               <p>The fact of a slight alteration does not by itself indicate whether the dies increased in size or shrank. Among late archaic and early classical coinages there is a general tendency for the size of the reverse image to increase, but there are exceptions and counter-movements as well. We have to look for another clue. On the one hand, one could argue that some obverse dies are more advanced in style than others insofar as the palmette on Athena's helmet approaches the first olive leaf, sometimes even touching its middle part. The tetradrachms of <persName>Starr's</persName> Group III (i.e., following the decadrachms) have the palmette already pointing downward along the leaf.<ref target="#CH2-n8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> Obverse dies with "progressive" palmettes occur more often within sections with deep reverse imprints (O 3, O 4, O 7,
<pb n="11"/>
O 8, O 10, O 11), while the big section with flat reverses contains obverses with "conservative" palmettes only (O 13–O 17). On the other hand, this typological trend is contradicted by another stylistic point. The one die mentioned above that is almost avant-garde (O 13) belongs to the big section with flat reverses. Since this die seems to have been made at the end of the series rather than at the starting point, the whole section has to be put near the end. Therefore it seems likely that the decadrachm reverse dies tended to increase in size. The need that the increasing die size would meet is not entirely clear. On the one hand, the deep reverse imprints corresponded with the traditional appearance of Athenian coins. On the other, decadrachms with flat reverses might have been introduced as easier to handle and more sturdy, too. Interestingly, the specimen from the Jordan Hoard (<hi rend="bold">17</hi>a) was cut into halves diagonally, the cut running from one corner of the reverse imprint to the opposite. It may well be the Athenian mint-masters thought that deep reverses made coins of that large size too breakable and increased the die size accordingly.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Unfortunately, there is no hoard evidence to suggest any arrangement of the series. The Elmali Hoard contained specimens from both ends of the series (<hi rend="bold">3</hi>a as well as <hi rend="bold">32</hi>a), and the relevant coins do not show wear of different grades. The other hoards are too late to be conclusive.</p>
               <p>As a result, various details of the arrangement must remain hypothetical, particularly in the case of the smaller sections. It is not possible to say whether the Berlin coin (<hi rend="bold">1</hi>a) or the recut Brussels specimen (<hi rend="bold">2</hi>a) comes first, and the same is true with the Berry and Garrett coins (<hi rend="bold">9</hi>a and <hi rend="bold">10</hi>a). It is a pity that Seltman and <persName>Starr</persName> did not discuss the reasons for their respective arrangements, for
<pb n="12"/>
both are similar in some ways to the one proposed here. If we disregard those specimens which have appeared after <persName>Starr's</persName> book the sequences are as follows:</p>

               <p>There is some clear agreement. All authors concur that the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> and the <placeName>Brussels</placeName> coins are among the first ones and that the <placeName>Paris</placeName> coin has to be put near the end. The relative placings of the <placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName> and <placeName>Rhousopoulos</placeName> specimens are also similar to each other. Perhaps the disagreement as to some specimens—the <placeName>London</placeName> coin in particular—is even more interesting. At least in some cases the die-study has solved the problem; the <placeName>London</placeName> coin cannot be separated from the <placeName>Frankfurt</placeName> coin.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I should again stress that the intrinsic structure of the series is by no means known. It would be hazardous to draw conclusions from forty specimens. The long die-chain at the very end of the series is more likely to be the result of accidents of discovery than indicative of a different pattern of production.</p>

               <p>Large denominations require a much more sophisticated minting technique than the more common small ones. The Athenians took bigger risks than the other mints producing large silver denominations: the relief of the Athenian decadrachms is a good deal higher than those of the three Syracusan and the Akragantine decadrachm issues.<ref target="#CH2-n9">
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </ref> Hence the minting gaps which can be seen on several reverses, among them a remarkably big one (<hi rend="bold">23</hi>a).<ref target="#CH2-n10">
                     <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                  </ref> The slight change in the size of the reverse die over the course of the decadrachm series shows that the masters of the mint were experimenting.<ref target="#CH2-n11">
                     <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                  </ref> Nonetheless, the high quality of all the decadrachms preserved is astonishing. The dies are always well centered on the flans. Granted, there are asymmetrical flans (for instance, 5 a

and <hi rend="bold">19</hi>b), irregularities at the edge (the protuberance with <hi rend="bold">6</hi>b), edge cracks (<hi rend="bold">1</hi>a, <hi rend="bold">6</hi>b, <hi rend="bold">7</hi>a, <hi rend="bold">32</hi>a) and doublestrikes (<hi rend="bold">18</hi>a? <hi rend="bold">23</hi>a). The overall appearance is nevertheless excellent.</p>
               <p>The rarity of both edge cracks and doublestrikes shows that the flans were red-hot when struck. Otherwise, no craftsman would have been able to deal with them. A minting device such as recently suggested for the Ptolemaic bronze coinage which would have produced standardized, circle-round coins is not likely to have been used.<ref target="#CH2-n12">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref> There is too much variation of the flan shapes.</p>
               <p>The high quality of mint practice applies to the weights, too. Eight specimens are heavier than 43 g, and sixteen more are heavier than 42 g. The halved specimen at 21.11 g (<hi rend="bold">17</hi>a) might join them. Interestingly, the well-preserved specimens from the Elmali Hoard have raised the peak. This is minting <hi rend="italic">al marco</hi>. The flans were not meticulously adjusted, as is usual with gold coins (minting <hi rend="italic">al pezzo</hi>), but the Athenians set great store in the reliability of their coinage, so much the more with large denominations.<ref target="#CH2-n13">

               <p>Some of the old decadrachm specimens have stories preserved about their findspots, but such stories are often part of the commercial marketing of high-value coins and should not be trusted unquestioningly. Yet there may be some truth in them. Conspicuously, the first decadrachms to appear on the market were said to have been found in or near Attica. The majority, however, derive from hoards found in the Near East: <placeName>Lycia</placeName>, the <placeName>Levant</placeName>, <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and <placeName>Persia</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The first specimen to appear was the <placeName>Paris</placeName> coin from the Duc de Luynes and Lord Strangford collections (<hi rend="bold">29</hi>a). Peter Oluf Brøndsted, who was, like Lord Strangford, a diplomat with an enthusiasm for ancient coins, makes the following claim of the coins origin:</p>
               <q>La...grande médaille d'argent, est de la collection de Lord <persName>Strangford</persName>..., trouvée vers l'an 1817 auprès Mégare avec quelques autres semblables.<ref target="#CH3-n1">

               <p>The last point is of interest here. Whether or not the description of Megara as findspot is true, what can the remark "avec quelques autres semblables" tell us? Were more decadrachms offered to Lord <persName>Strangford</persName>? It is doubtful that false rumors would have circulated before the coin's sale, since these would have hurt the price. However, if the story was told to Lord <persName>Strangford</persName> only after he had bought the coin it could have been a trick in order to prepare the market for counterfeits still to be made. <persName>Strangford</persName> himself had another decadrachm which disappeared from the record in the course of the nineteenth century, presumably because it was highly dubious (<hi rend="bold">F13</hi>). We learn from Count Prokesch-Osten's notes that the <persName>Athens</persName> market of the 1840s offered several decadrachms that he regarded as forgeries.<ref target="#CH3-n2">

               <p>But if Brøndsteds story is true, where have the "autres semblables" gone? The <placeName>Berlin</placeName> coin (<hi rend="bold">1</hi>a) was seen by Count Prokesch-Osten in 1833 when the then owner settled at Nauplia. Soon thereafter, the <placeName>London</placeName> coin (<hi rend="bold">7</hi>a) was bought somewhere in <placeName>Greece</placeName> (at that period, "<placeName>Greece</placeName>" meant the territories south of Thessaly) by the British consul at Patras. Another specimen that was said to have been found near Megara is the Lisbon coin from the <placeName>Gulbenkian</placeName> and Jameson collections (<hi rend="bold">31</hi>a). This coin was published for the first time only in 1924. According to Sir <persName>George Hill</persName>, the Megarian provenance was a mistake, and the coin is said to have been found near Daphni instead, that is to say, halfway between <persName>Athens</persName> and Eleusis.<ref target="#CH3-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> Intriguingly, Attic provenances recur. The <placeName>Garrett</placeName> coin, once in the Delbeke collection (<hi rend="bold">10</hi>a), is said to have been found at Laurion before 1890. The Hunt coin from the Gillet, Seltman, and Kambanis collections (<hi rend="bold">5</hi>a) is said to have been found near Spata, a town in Central Attica, in 1920. Lastly, there is the <placeName>Rhousopoulos</placeName> coin (<hi rend="bold">11</hi>a) which does not have a findspot story, but is first heard of in an Athenian collection.<ref target="#CH3-n5">

               <p>The list of Attic findspots of single specimens is overshadowed by the much longer list of specimens from Near Eastern hoards.

               <p>Turning back to the specimens found in <placeName>Attica</placeName> or in nearby <placeName>Megaris</placeName>, the problem is now obvious. On the one hand we have stories about findspots scattered all over the Attic countryside, and the relevant specimens appeared within a time-span of some hundred years. On the other hand the lion's share of specimens available today was found in Near Eastern hoards. Of course, we cannot say how much of the whole decadrachm issue was exported. A part at least may have remained in the treasure chests of Athenian citizens to be concealed in savings hoards and discovered during the nineteenth century. Yet it is strange that we do not learn of recent decadrachm discoveries in the countryside of Attica, although both archaeological and building activities have been intensified during the second half of the twentieth century. Perhaps, then, there is some truth in the story told by Brøndsted about a decadrachm hoard found near <placeName>Megara</placeName>

                  <hi rend="bold">DATING THE SERIES</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Although there is now, as we shall see, a general consensus concerning the absolute chronology of the Athenian decadrachm series which can be subject to minor modifications at most, it is instructive to review the former proposals for the date of the Athenian decadrachms. It is not now fashionable to regard decadrachms as "medallions", but the temptation to date them by historical considerations rather than by numismatic evidence is still fairly strong. On the one hand it is clear that an issue of large denominations must have met a financial need. On the other hand the Greek state was at war often and in the case of <persName>Athens</persName> it is not hard to find one or another appropriate historical background as soon as we have arrived at a dating to a certain decade.</p>
               <p>Before we turn to earlier theories it should be said that the issues of didrachms and drachms<ref target="#CH3-n13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref> that accompanied the decadrachms do not suggest any specific circumstance of production, but rather are to be explained as a reaction within the denominational structure of the coinage to the production of the decadrachms. It would have been strange if the decadrachms had not been accompanied by didrachms that enabled the people to convert the large denomination into smaller ones. Without the supply of medium denominations the citizen would have needed two decadrachms in order to get tetradrachms. Small change—hemidrachms, obols and even smaller denominations—might not have been accepted by an owner of decadrachms because small denominations tend to be underweight due to the increased relative costs of production.<ref target="#CH3-n14">

               </p>
               <p>When the first specimen of the Athenian decadrachms was found in 1817—the Lord <persName>Strangford</persName> coin that was to end up in the <placeName>Paris</placeName> Cabinet (<hi rend="bold">29</hi>a) — it stirred up a debate about the authenticity of such coins. Mionnet's mistaken description of the coin as an octodrachm, and the immediate production of counterfeits along with the appearance of other (genuine) specimens occupied collectors and scholars for several decades. The first to raise the chronological question was <persName>Ernest Beulé</persName> in 1858.<ref target="#CH3-n15">
                     <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                  </ref> His discussion of the matter is still worth reading, since he described almost all the points and considerations that have been taken into account in subsequent scholarship: <persName>Herodotus'</persName> account of a debate in the Athenian council about how to realize the revenues from the mines at Laurion where Themistocles succeeded in passing a bill to build up a fleet;<ref target="#CH3-n16">

at all before; and the question of whether the term δεκάδραχμον occurs in ancient writings. Although Beulé was aware that dating the decadrachms to the time of Themistocles fitted several facts, he was not seduced by the superficially attractive historical circumstances. In a time when a reliable chronology of classical Greek coins was very much in the future, Beulé had more confidence in his eye than in ancient writings:</p>
               <q>Cependant les décadrachmes qui ont été découverts jusqu'à ce jour ne remontent point jusqu'à Thémistocle; ils sont de ce grand style qui a voulu retenir les beautés propres à l'archaïsme, et qui me semble appartenir par excellence à l'art monétaire sous Périclès.<ref target="#CH3-n17">

               </q>
               <p>The age of Pericles is the latest period to which the decadrachms have ever been dated.

However, instead of taking seriously <persName>Gardner's</persName> idea which would have led to a date soon after the battle of Salamis (480 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc</hi>) he denied, to a limited extent at least, the commemorative character of the decadrachms: "There is reason to believe that the Athenians had no time immediately after Salamis to plan commemorative medallic issues."<ref target="#CH3-n22">

inconsistent and might derive from Herodotus anyway, the story appeared to be sufficiently corroborated to confirm a numismatic hypothesis. From <persName>Seltman's</persName> point of view, the amount of the dividend paid to the Athenians was crucial: ten drachms each. <persName>Seltman</persName> claimed that the Athenians had started distributing the dividend among the citizens some years before Themistocles persuaded the council to use the revenues for financing a ship building program. <persName>Seltman's</persName> argument was simple and circular: the existence of the decadrachms proved the dividend to have been distributed. The accompanying didrachm issue would show that the amount was sometimes paid in smaller denominations. His calculation of the total number of decadrachms issued was equally fantastic: estimating that "for some three or four years before that date [when Themistocles passed his bill] each fortunate citizen of <persName>Athens</persName> had, instead of paying income-tax, received the bonus of ten drachmae once a year" he multiplied the three year term by the number of Athenian citizens (30,000), thus suggesting the figure of <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 900,000 drachms minted in addition to the ordinary tetradrachm issues, the decadrachms accounting for the lion's share of the sum.<ref target="#CH3-n24">

Reconsidering the historical sources, Mainzer contested <persName>Seltman's</persName> view that the Athenians ever distributed their revenues among the citizens; Themistocles, he argued, would have dismissed the first petition to do so in 483 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc.</hi> Furthermore, Mainzer argued that the olive leaves at Athena's visor were not a victory wreath (actually, not a wreath at all) but just another element of embellishment. A certain series of hemidrachms from Arcadia would show exactly the same feature without refering to any historical event, much less to a victory on the battlefield. This hemidrachm issue of Cleitor was to become an important piece of evidence, although scholars agree today that the hemidrachms copy the Athenian model

               <p>Others were less willing to abandon the search for a specific historical reference. If it was not Marathon, the next step was to consider the battle of Salamis instead. Soon after <persName>Gardner's</persName> publication, <persName>Kurt Regling</persName> had proposed to interpret the decadrachms as "Siegesmünze[n] von Salamis und Plataiai".<ref target="#CH3-n28">

               <p>Thus far, the debate about the chronology of the decadrachms was obviously lacking a firm numismatic basis. When Colin Kraay eventually wrote his pioneering study on the early Athenian coinage it inevitably had repercussions for the dating of the decadrachms.

Though considering occasions with commemorative aspects, he was inclined to turn to an economic explanation:</p>
               <q>Possible occasions seem to be (1) 479, after Plataea (parallel to the Syracusan Demareteion), (2) 478/7, the first payment of tribute and the victories at <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> and Byzantium... and (3) the Eurymedon campaign of <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 467.<ref target="#CH3-n35">

               <p>Economic aspects had been neglected in the debate before this point. When discussing the matter again and again with sceptics, Kraay reminded them of very simple facts of distribution and output: decadrachms would not have been appropriate to pay out a ten-drachms dole; a currency mainly of tetradrachms would have needed to have been supplemented not by decadrachms but only by a supply of drachms.<ref target="#CH3-n36">

               <p>For in 1970 <persName>Starr</persName> had published his study of early classical Athenian coinage. Like <persName>Kraay</persName>, <persName>Starr</persName> based his chronology on hoards.

                  <persName>Starr</persName> was able to arrange the Athenian coins minted within this bracket into five groups, the decadrachms making up his Group II.C. <persName>Starr</persName> did not provide a corpus—and only a few die links were observed by him—but a mere typology that nevertheless convinced many of his reviewers.<ref target="#CH3-n40">

               <p>A close look at O13 suggests a final point of the series deep in the second half of the 460s. It has already been mentioned that the die is not archaizing but strictly avant-garde. There is a touch of smile left around Athena's lips, and both hair and profile eye do submit to the archaizing tendency, but as a whole this is a Severe Style composition. Therefore it should be possible to come to a better dating by stylistic comparisons.</p>
               <p>It must be said at the outset that none of the works of art to be compared can be dated exactly. They are all dated to "c. 460" by common opinion. The backbone of the chronology is the complex of sculptures from the temple of Zeus at Olympia which was built from 472 onwards and dedicated in 457 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc.</hi> It is not hard to say whether a work of art of the Severe Style (c. 480–c. 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc</hi>) was created before rather than after the Olympia sculptures. However difficult in details, the overall style chronology in the decades 480–450 is far from being controversial.<ref target="#CH3-n58">

                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Athena head on O13 with its compact proportions, notably the arched forehead, the heavy chin and the fleshy cheek, evidently belongs with the sculptures made "after" the Olympia complex, that is to say, c. 460 <hi rend="smallcaps">bc.</hi> The best comparisons are the Heads of the seated woman on the relief from the island Ikaria (Pl. 3.F) and of the female flute-player on the side of the Ludovisi Throne (Pl. 4.G).<ref target="#CH3-n59">
                     <hi rend="sup">59</hi>
                  </ref> The Ikaria stele in particular shares the overall proportions of the Heads, the flat features of the relief and the relaxed facial expression with O13. The girls' Heads on the stele fragment from Pharsalos look more conservative, but this might be due to the provincial style of Thessaly.<ref target="#CH3-n60">

               <p>It is easy to specify comparanda from the decade 460/50 the stylistic level of which can be distinguished from the Athena head of O13: the female head on the Melos Disc (Pl. 5.H), the girl's head on the Giustiniani Stele (Pl. 6.I), the "Mourning Athena" (Pl. 7.K) and the head of the seated woman on the banquet relief from Thasos (Pl. 8.L) all have different proportions. The lower part of the face has lost some volume, the chin is no longer heavy, the jawbone no longer protrudes.<ref target="#CH3-n61">
                     <hi rend="sup">61</hi>
                  </ref> Furthermore, the facial elements—eye, nose, mouth—are rendered in the right perspective, that is to say, they are shifted to the front of the head.</p>
               <p>To sum up, the die O 13 must have been cut during the second half of the decade 470/60 and should actually be dated "c. 460". The same must be true for the die-chain <hi rend="bold">22–33</hi>, however archaizing Athena looks on O 14 and the following obverse dies. This is not to say that the decadrachm issue continued during the early 450s. If the battle at the river Eurymedon was its starting point (some date between 469 and 465), then the decadrachm issue did not conclude after one or two years, but lasted until the end of the decade.</p>
               <p>Recently Hélène Nicolet-Pierre has pointed out that we do not yet know which one of the two decadrachm issues of Syracuse and <persName>Athens</persName> started first.<ref target="#CH3-n62">
                     <hi rend="sup">62</hi>
                  </ref> It is still controversial whether the Syracusan issue was the last display of tyranny or rather the celebration of liberty. At <persName>Athens</persName>, the political discrepancies were less harsh, but there was some turmoil as well. In 463/2 the Areopagus was deprived of its power; Ephialtes and his aspiring partisan Pericles introduced radical democracy to Athenian politics. A year later Cimon was ostracized and left <persName>Athens</persName>. It is hard to say whether the conclusion of the decadrachms has anything to do with the changes on the political stage. The decadrachm issue is likely, however, to have been a project of an "ancien regime".</p>

"Prior to that, Themistocles was successful with another bill. When the Athenians, having in the treasury much money that they got from the mines of Laurion, were about to share it, each man receiving ten drachms, then Themistocles persuaded them to give up this distribution and to build up two hundred ships with the money for the war, meaning the war against the Aeginetans". The story is repeated in Diod. 11.43.3: ἔπεισε δὲ τὸν δῆμον καθ' ἕκαστον ἐνιαυτὸν πρὸς ταῖς ὑπαρχούσαις ναυσὶν εἴκοσι τριήρεις προσκατασκευάζειν.... "[Themistocles] persuaded the people each year to construct and add twenty triremes to the fleet they already possessed". Cf. Plut. <hi rend="italic">Them.</hi> 4.1: Kαὶ πρῶτον μὲν τὴν Λαυρεωτικὴν πρόσοδον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀργυρεῖων μετάλλων ἔθος ἐχόντων Ἀθηναίων διανέμεσθαι, μόνος εἰπεῖν ἐτόλμησε παρελθὼν εἰς τὸν δῆμον, ὡς χρὴ τὴν διανομὴν ἐάσαντας ἐκ τῶν χρημάτων τούτων κατασκευάσασθαι τριήρεις ἐπὶ τὸν πρὸς Αἰγινήτας πόλημον. "When the Athenians were about to divide up among themselves the revenue from the silver mines of Laurion, he was the only one to dare to come before the people with the proposal that the distribution should be given up, and that triremes be constructed with the money for the war against the Aeginetans" Aristot. <hi rend="italic">Ath.

"In the third year afterwards, in the archonship of Nicodemos, the veins of ore at Maroneia were discovered and the state had a profit of 100 talents from the mining, while some persons gave the advice to distribute the revenues among the people, Themistocles prevented them from doing so, not saying what use he would make of the money. He recommended that it should be lent to the hundred wealthiest Athenians, each thus receiving a talent, so that if they should spend it in a satisfactory manner, the state would have the profit, and if they did not, the state should call in the money from the borrowers. On these terms the money was put at his disposal, and he used it to build up a fleet of hundred triremes, each of the borrowers having one ship built, and with these they fought the naval battle at Salamis against the barbarians".</p>

               </head>
               <p>A last question remains: the purpose of the decadrachm issue. Although we do not know the exact size of the issue we may suppose that it was much too large to have any other purpose than an economic one. The idea that large denominations were issued to celebrate victories on the battlefield stems from the
<pb n="30"/>
modern habit of issuing large-size medals on such occasions. Medals, however, are usually either produced of cheap material or issued in quite small numbers, and medals are not legal tender. Decadrachms must be compared with the highest banknote available rather than with prestigious but non-monetary medals.</p>
               <p>Although it is now commonly held that the issue of decadrachms served a monetary purpose, the comparison with high-value banknotes has to be qualified. While the modern state cares about a permanent supply of high-value banknotes, the ancient state issued the high denominations quite sporadically. For that reason numismatists keep looking for the special need that such an issue could have met, a consideration that appears to shift the problem from one field of history to another. In the end, it is the same field, since economic history has always been a part of the history of power. In fact, the decadrachms have often been thought to have been issued for payments of the state, that is to say, for arms expenditure. The Near Eastern findspots have fueled the idea that the decadrachms were issued for buying timber for the Athenian fleet.<ref target="#CH3-n63">
                     <hi rend="sup">63</hi>
                  </ref> This is an explanation worth considering, but the pedigrees of some specimens reveal that a certain amount of the decadrachm issue remained in <placeName>Greece</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n64">
                     <hi rend="sup">64</hi>
                  </ref> The didrachm series that accompagnied the decadrachms clearly shows that the decadrachms were expected to enter circulation. Obviously the high denominations met a need in the market: Athenian society of the 460s must have been monetized already at a fairly high level. The booty from the battles of Marathon, Salamis, Plataea, and Eurymedon was at least partly sold at <persName>Athens</persName>, thus leading to the repeated influx of sums rarely seen before. While fifth-century gold coins are often a symptom of crisis, the silver decadrachms are the symptom of a flourishing market.<ref target="#CH3-n65">
                     <hi rend="sup">65</hi>
                  </ref> From this point of view, the issue's drift to the East that is revealed in the Near Eastern provenances of the majority of the extant specimens might result from the lasting demand in the <placeName>Levant</placeName> for good silver, rather than from a sudden need of the Athenian state to import Oriental merchandise.<ref target="#CH3-n66">

               <pb n="31"/>
               <p>Nevertheless, we must wonder why <persName>Athens</persName> never again minted decadrachms. The output of the Athenian mint grew rather than shrank after 460. Although the conventionalized style of the Athenian tetradrachms minted during the second half of the fifth century makes a die-count difficult, it is beyond doubt that there was a real mass striking during the years of Pericles' prime, and perhaps still during the early years of the Peloponnesian War (431–404). But no decadrachms.</p>
               <p>From the economic point of view, more decadrachm issues would have made sense. Before the Peloponnesian War the Athenian economy flourished, the properties of both citizens and metics grew, and the export of Attic silver continued. The absence of the high denomination in the period of Pericles is in fact a problem. Since a strictly economic explanation is not obvious, a sociological one may be appropriate, particularly since it is valid for later times too. The renunciation of the opportunity to supplement the vast tetradrachm coinage with decadrachms could in fact be due to a change of mentality in Athenian society. The power of Pericles and his successors was based on the assembly and on the council. While the poor, especially those located in the countryside, could not afford to attend the assembly regularly, each citizen was enabled to join the council by a daily wage of five obols that was instigated soon after the introduction of radical democracy (463/2).<ref target="#CH3-n67">
                     <hi rend="sup">67</hi>
                  </ref> As a result, notable families which did not adapt to the new situation soon lost their leading position in Athenian politics. Wealth, of course, did not lose its political power, but it was no longer regarded without mixed feelings. Wealthy citizens were forced to contribute to both theater performances and armament expenses.<ref target="#CH3-n68">

democracy placed a taboo on all symbols of individual superiority, and so it may well be that the concomitant change of mentality prevented further issues of denominations that only a few people would be able to use. In the second half of the fifth century an average day's wage was a drachm.<ref target="#CH3-n71">
                     <hi rend="sup">71</hi>
                  </ref> Paying for something with decadrachms or even storing them up must have been beyond the imagination of the majority of the Athenian citizens. Politicians like Pericles and his partisans might have avoided the resumption of decadrachm issues so as not to be charged with adherence to oligarchic ideas.</p>

               <p>The various notes about the owners deserve some explanation: a) The owner at <persName>Athens</persName>, where Noe took the ANS cast, might have been M. L.

However, he did so in 1904, i.e. 20 years before <persName>Seltman's</persName> book appeared, where the coin is still said to be in <persName>Seltman's</persName> collection. <persName>Warren</persName> died in 1928.<ref target="#CH4-n2">

This specimen poses some questions. After having performed autopsy two times, I believe that it is genuine and derives from the same dies as the preceding specimen. However, this coin has been treated very badly.</p>
               <pb n="46"/>
               <p>The comparison reveals that all of the dots on the body of the owl are due to a recent recutting of the coin. There exist pictures of the coin with a dark brown patina, the coin must have been repatinated at some stage. Thereafter, it was cleaned a second time before being offered for sale at auction. Traces of recutting can be observed elsewhere as well: on the obverse the right olive leaf is like a sculpture projecting in front of a background, i.e., some material "behind" the leaf has been removed. A feature to be seen on the reverse is even more bewildering. The die-break running from the tip of the hanging olive leaf into the left wing of the owl is not an ordinary crack: it forms something like a step instead of an edge. If this is due to the die (which might have been damaged by a blow from a hammer, thus producing a step in the background of the image), the specimen must be the latest minted among those extant having this reverse die; if so, the wave-like die-breaks at the right wing of the owl must have been removed completely from the coin.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Like their modern counterparts, ancient trial pieces are in most cases made of lead. They had no value and no monetary function either. However, in those cases where pieces are coined on both sides, it can be difficult to distinguish them from emergency coinages. As a rule of thumb, the existence of any coinage must be ascertained by a sample of remnants. On the other hand, we know several ancient coinages from but a single specimen.<ref target="#CH4-n9">
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </ref> Thus the question is sometimes a matter of discretion.<ref target="#CH4-n10">
                     <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                  </ref> If the lead piece has an irregular flan which is coined on one side only, there can be no doubt about interpreting it as a trial piece that was made for checking the die before or during the minting process. This holds true for the first piece below, now in the <placeName>Boston</placeName> Museum. The second piece, once in private hands, has a round flan and is coined on both sides. The small size of the second piece and its blurred images lead to the assumption that we should regard it as a forger's <hi rend="italic">anima</hi> rather than as a trial piece. The
<pb n="51"/>
present whereabouts of the second piece are unknown and I have not been able to examine it or to judge whether it is ancient or not.</p>
               <p>The Bostonian piece has another problem. In the <placeName>Boston</placeName> catalogue the piece was said to share its obverse die with the <placeName>Brussels</placeName> coin (<hi rend="bold">2</hi>a), but this is not the case. Having compared the relevant casts side by side, I am sure that it has the same obverse die as the <placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName> specimen (<hi rend="bold">5</hi>a), that is to say O 3. Unfortunately, there is a series of modern forgeries the dies of which were taken from the coin in question (see the "Ars Classica" fake below). Due to the somewhat blurred features of the <placeName>Boston</placeName> piece (unusual in ancient lead strikes), it is difficult to say whether the die used was the ancient one or its modern copy. As far as the condition of the die can be established, there is nothing that would lead to a firm conclusion. There is no break at Athena's eye, but it is impossible to say whether this is due to the fresh state of the original die or the redone copy. The minor cracks exhibited by O 3 in its later stage would not necessarily be visible anyway. There are minting-gaps at the bowl and the crest of the helmet, but this does not help. Even the strange "collar" around the circle of the die finds a parallel in the raised border of another test-piece.<ref target="#CH4-n11">
                     <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                  </ref> Potentially, a metallurgical analysis of the <placeName>Boston</placeName> piece would prove its authenticity.</p>
               <p>Provided that the <placeName>Boston</placeName> piece is genuine, its purported findspot is intriguing. The piece is said to have been found on the Acropolis of <persName>Athens</persName>. This may be just another story told in order to force up the value, but it could be true. If so, the piece is not likely to have been stored like the dies used for the gold issue at the end of the Peloponnesian War which are attested among the treasures kept in the Parthenon.<ref target="#CH4-n12">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref> Being almost valueless in intrinsic terms and useless for coin production, the trial piece might rather have been dedicated. Trial pieces could be used not only for intermediary checks of the dies during the minting process but also as models for other dies and as master copies of the engraver's work when he was seeking his next employment. Thus the trial pieces might have been regarded as tools like hammer and tongs rather than as works of art, and in ancient times tools were certainly worth dedicating.<ref target="#CH4-n13">

There is a vast series of plated Athenian tetradrachms and drachms that is usually dated to the last years of the Peloponnesian War (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 406–404); based on a joke made by Aristophanes, this series is thought to have been minted as an emergency coinage by the Athenian authorities.<ref target="#CH5-n2">

               </head>
               <p>Modern forgeries of the decadrachms started to appear very early, soon after the first genuine specimen, the <persName>Strangford</persName> coin (<hi rend="bold">29</hi>a), became known. Due to the fact that Athenian decadrachms are extremely rare and accordingly much sought-after to the present day, decadrachm forgeries have appeared on a regular basis. Fortunately, the majority of them are easy to recognize, although some of them were dangerous when they were new. The only one that might remain dangerous is the "Ars Classica fake" (below, pp. 68 ff). Thus far, the most sophisticated counterfeiters of ancient coins, who are located in <placeName>Greece</placeName> and <placeName>Italy</placeName>, seem not to have tried to create a forgery of the Athenian decadrachms. It should be said that the controversial Gemini coin (<hi rend="bold">26</hi>b) does not correspond to the oeuvre of any known master counterfeiter.</p>

                  <p>A renowned antiquarian at Offenburg, Geheimrat Karl Wilhelm Becker (1772–1832) was one of the most notorious counterfeiters of the early nineteenth century. Although he claimed to have made and distributed imitations just for educational reasons, many people were deceived by his products, whether it was he himself who sold them as genuine, or other dealers. Since his decadrachm fake was produced on 2 October 1827 by a certain <persName>W. Zindel</persName>, a seal-engraver who was Becker's collaborator only from 1826, it may well be that the dies of this fake are among the latest of Becker's works.<ref target="#CH5-n3">

                  </p>
                  <p>From today's point of view, the style of Becker's fake is poor and the details are crude. The absence of the olive sprig strikes the eye in particular. According to Hill, Becker and Zindel worked after a model which failed to show the olive sprig.<ref target="#CH5-n4">

                  <p>The majority of the Becker fakes are not made of silver and will not have been deceptive at any time. Perhaps some of them were not even sold by Becker himself. They could well derive from the parcel which Count Piccolomini bought from Becker's widow.<ref target="#CH5-n6">

                  <p>We know from various sources that Lord <persName>Strangford's</persName> collection contained two decadrachms. The first one, which was erroneously called an octodrachm by Mionnet, came into the possession of the Duc de Luynes and eventually the <placeName>Paris</placeName> Cabinet (<hi rend="bold">29</hi>a). The other one was said to be a modern forgery, and so it soon disappeared. It is by mere chance that we have a drawing of it, or at least a drawing of its obverse.</p>

                  <p>In 1828 Domenico Sestini published a drawing composed of two different coins, both of which were then in the <persName>Strangford</persName> collection. Though possessing embellishments typical of the epoque, the drawing obviously depicts the reverse of the piece that later entered the de Luynes Collection. The coin obverse is less easy to judge. In Sestini's own words,</p>
                  <q>il disegno di questa medaglia che pesa 10 dramme mi fu rimesso da Trieste levato da due medaglie, perchè la parte dove è la testa di Pallade non corrisponde alla parte dove è la civetta. Lord Strangfort <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> porto due medaglioni simili, uno del peso di 10. dramme, e l'altro d'otto, onde il rovescio della nostra appartiene a quello d'btto dramme. Io non posso giudicare di questi due medaglioni, per non averli veduti, e che la fortuna dovesse, dopo tanti secoli, favorire il genio di detto personaggio: dirò peraltro, che essendo egli a Pietroburgo, furono da uomini ben conoscitori, creduti genuini. Ma noi li crediamo opera dei falsificatori di Smirne, non essendo possibile, che Atene avesse voluto fare coniare due medaglioni uno di 10. dramme, e l'altro di otto.<ref target="#CH5-n9">

                  <p>It is clear that the drawing does not depend on the drawing sent by Brøndsted to Mionnet some years earlier (see Figure 3, p. 47). Interestingly, Sestini was able to identify the coin that was called an octodrachm by Mionnet. Either Sestini had seen Brøndsted's drawing, or the correspondent from Trieste who was himself baffled by the discrepancy had told him.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">d. "De Luynes", before 1891</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The three following specimens in Washington, Moscow, and once in the von Molthein Collection are obviously copies of the de Luynes coin (<hi rend="bold">29</hi>a). The reverse with all its peculiarities is the same; note the small dent in the left wing of the owl and the hollow in the right edge. While the von Molthein and Moscow specimens just repeat the reverse of the de Luynes coin, the Smithsonian specimen (<hi rend="bold">F31</hi>) has been altered by the addition of the upper left corner, and the whole outline is different from the <hi rend="italic">madre.</hi> The result appears not to have been convincing to the forger, and so he concealed his addition with a test cut. This turned out to be even worse; the cut looks as if it was made by the anxious use of a bread knife. The small dent in the owl's left wing was filled up with no better success.</p>
                  <p>The obverses have been altered in various ways. The von Molthein coin (<hi rend="bold">F33</hi>) has the de Luynes obverse in a bloated version, thus giving the impression of extreme wear. The Moscow coin (<hi rend="bold">F32</hi>) has the same obverse in a version both refined and blundered. The big die-break between chin and throat has been removed, but several details have become coarser. The obverse of the Smithsonian coin (<hi rend="bold">F31</hi>) is worn in the extreme (more precisely, it is ground off, while the reverse shows much less wear), and one can say only that it seems to be derived from a different die than the Moscow specimen.</p>
                  <p>The style of the Moscow obverse is reminiscent of the "Hoffmann" fakes above. However, both specimens were recorded only during the early 1890s, and perhaps were made not much earlier. If so, the "Hoffmann" counterfeiter, who was apparently active earlier than 1860, is not very likely to be responsible for the "de Luynes" copies as well.</p>
                  <p>Two more sources must also be taken into account. The first one is a ticket without a coin. Beneath the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> cast of the Weight forgery (<hi rend="bold">F43</hi>) there is a sheet of paper with a notice in Friedländer's hand-writing:
<q>AR 42.2 Grm. Von Louis Naudmann aus Perth mit mehreren anderen falschen Münzen 17 Dec. 1866 vorgelegt. Das Stück hatte eine BleiPatina, halb bräunlich halb schwarz, abspringend. Es ist nicht von Becker, die vorhandene von Prokesch weicht ab.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obviously the sheet does not belong to the cast: the Weight coin was produced by Christodoulou at least thirty years later than 1866. The original fake kept by the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> Cabinet, the von Gansauge coin (<hi rend="bold">F20</hi>), is no better candidate, because it has a ticket of its own, and is much heavier than 42 g. Nonetheless, the notice cannot have been written before the von Gansauge forgery entered the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> Cabinet in 1873, since the Prokesch-Osten coin mentioned by the sheet notice (<hi rend="bold">1</hi>a) was acquired two years later, in 1875.<ref target="#CH5-n15">

                     </ref> According to a third
<pb n="61"/>
source, however, the forgery described by this sheet cannot have been owned by the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> Cabinet at any time, for the notice matches a fake that was "seen" by Julius Friedländer, and mentioned by him some years later:
<q>Das Dekadrachmon hat Becker gemacht, aber außerdem auch ein anderer Fälscher. Ein Exemplar von richtigem Gewicht (42,3 Gramm) habe ich gesehen, es ist vortrefflich gemacht, dem bei Beulé abgebildeten sehr ähnlich, es hatte einen halb bräunlichen, halb schwarzen Oxyd-Überzug, der theilweise abgesprungen war. Der Mann, der es verkaufen wollte, führte eine Anzahl Falschmünzen aus der Smyrnaer Fabrik.<ref target="#CH5-n16">
                           <hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The other decadrachm forgeries documented by casts, paper, and silver foil imprints in the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> Cabinet are products of the twentieth century. Neither the coin described by both Friedländer and the misplaced sheet of paper nor a cast of it are now in the <placeName>Berlin</placeName> Cabinet. So we must ask whether we are able to identify the forgery among the fakes known to us. We have a date (before 1866), a weight (42.3 g), a description (oxidized), and a comparison (similar to the coin figured by Beulé). The description resembles von Renner's of the von Molthein coin (<hi rend="bold">F33</hi>): "lavers a souffert par une forte oxydation", but the comparison is truly bewildering, because the specimen illustrated by Beulé is the Prokesch-Osten coin.<ref target="#CH5-n17">
                        <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                     </ref> Since Friedländer himself wrote the notice on the sheet, how could he fail to observe that Beulé's drawing shows the Prokesch-Osten coin? On the other hand, since the specimen was shown to him in 1866, and he did not keep it nor take a cast or an silver foil imprint of it, how could he make the comparison to the Prokesch-Osten coin which was not yet "vorhanden" (present) in the museum?<ref target="#CH5-n18">
                        <hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                     </ref> This notice remains a mystery.</p>
                  <p>A few words about Friedländer's remark on the Smyrna forgeries are necessary. When the first decadrachms came to light, collectors were afraid of being deceived by the products of the notorious Smyrna counterfeiters. In fact, the genuine de Luynes specimen was initially suspected.<ref target="#CH5-n19">
                        <hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                     </ref> Some years later,
<pb n="62"/>
when four or five other decadrachms appeared on the <persName>Athens</persName> market, it was Henry Borrell, a Smyrna resident for many years and thus familiar with the Smyrna forgeries, who condemned them and confirmed the authenticity of the Prokesch-Osten coin.<ref target="#CH5-n20">

                     </ref> Unfortunately, there is no way to determine whether the decadrachm forgeries exposed by him had anything to do with the Smyrna workshops. It is a pity that Friedländer does not tell whether the forgery he saw was in any way similar to the Smyrna forgeries offered to him at the same time. So we can only speculate. With the exception of Caprara who started his career in Smyrna, the Smyrna forgers have not yet caught the attention they deserve.<ref target="#CH5-n21">

The outline of the flan, the position, and the axis of the dies are the same, as well as the details of both the owl and Athena's head (note the shape of the bunch of hair in front of the ear). The weights, however, are clearly wrong. The forgeries are casts, two of them showing signs of cold work. It is not clear whether the forger had a plaster cast of the Prokesch-Osten coin at his disposal. In any case, he made a worse job than his rival of the "de Luynes" fake. One of the forgeries can be traced back to late nineteenth-century Alexandria. According to Dutilh's research, the piece "found" near Alexandria is the work of a local who also made copies of Hellenistic (i.e., Seleucid and Ptolemaic) coins. Another specimen was included in Jacob Hirsch's archive of forgeries. Unfortunately, the famous dealer left not a single line about where and when he obtained it.</p>

                  <p>Though <persName>Christodoulou's</persName> oeuvre is well known, his life and career is still shrouded in mystery. Svoronos in his first article on the subject announced a second and more extensive report, but his untimely death soon afterwards prevented him from fulfilling his promise. All that could be gleaned from his notes was the second part of the list of Christodoulou's forgeries, based on the dies confiscated by the Greek authorities (Pl. 2.E).<ref target="#CH5-n27">

dies are still to be found in the back rooms of Athenian workshops. If rumors are correct, even some of the confiscated dies could have been in use again. As Admiral <persName>O. H.

                  <p>The case of <persName>Christodoulou's</persName> decadrachm forgeries is a special one. In an article listing the decadrachm forgeries shown to him and to his predecessors, Martin Price mentioned a specimen from the collection of Grigorios Empedokles; Price thought that this specimen shared dies with both the <persName>Christodoulou</persName> fake in the British Museum and another fake that was shown to him in 1976 (<hi rend="bold">F75</hi>). He did not illustrate the Empedokles specimen, but the cast he relied on is preserved in the collection of the British Museum, and can thus be identified (<hi rend="bold">F45</hi>).<ref target="#CH5-n32">
                        <hi rend="sup">32</hi>
                     </ref> Price was right insofar as its reverse die is that of the known <persName>Christodoulou</persName> forgery. The obverse die, however, has nothing to do with F75 and the remainder of the "Burgon" group (see below). So there is no reason to posit a link between the <persName>Christodoulou</persName> fake and a later group. According to the sequence of dies suggested here, <persName>Christodoulou</persName> is not even likely to have produced a decadrachm fake after his exposure. It is true that two obverse dies and one reverse die were not known to Svoronos, and they were never confiscated. However, all specimens but one of the <persName>Christodoulou</persName> group share the reverse die published by Svoronos.<ref target="#CH5-n33">

                     </ref> One of them (<hi rend="bold">F43</hi>) is attested as early as 1903, while the only specimen combining dies not known to Svoronos (<hi rend="bold">F46</hi>) has an obverse die which was in use before <persName>Christodoulou's</persName> exposure in 1914. The specimen was recorded for the first time in 1927, thus leaving room for speculation. We will turn to the problem again when dealing with the "Ars Classica" fake (see below).</p>

He recognized it and, because this particular specimen was not in the British Museum collection, insisted on buying it.

All evidence points to the assumption that the forgeries were made not very long before Svoronos died in 1922.

tered. Like the "de Luynes" fake above and the "Burgon" fake below, the "Ars Classica" fake can be traced back to a genuine specimen: the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" decadrachm (<hi rend="bold">5</hi>a). Unlike these other two groups of forgeries, however, the "Ars Classica" fake proved to be so dangerous as to bring its <hi rend="italic">madre</hi> under a certain suspicion, if without discussion in the literature. Before turning to details, it should be said that the suspicion was unfounded. The "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin is genuine, as the traces of horn silver (never mentioned in the sale catalogues) prove sufficiently. Furthermore, the sequence of dies reveals the artistic limits of the counterfeiter, and the step-by-step alterations of the dies clearly make his forgeries withdraw from the <hi rend="italic">madre</hi> (if it were a forgery, the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin would have had to be the final product, but never the prototype, since it exhibits several die-cracks).<ref target="#CH5-n36">
                        <hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                     </ref> Last but not least, the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin shares its obverse die with two specimens from the Elmali Hoard, all of them having exactly the same die-cracks. The authenticity of the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin is above all suspicion.</p>
                  <p>The example consigned to Ars Classica Sale 13 (<hi rend="bold">F60</hi>) was withdrawn from the auction. Its character became obvious at the latest in 1930, when Jacob Hirsch brought a second piece (<hi rend="bold">F63</hi>) to the attention of the British Museum authorities. After having dealt with other works of the same forger, Oscar Ravel condemned the Ars Classica specimen in 1946:
<q>Le décadramme d'Athènes de la vente de Lucerne 1928 présentait ces grains de sulfure sur les bords et sur la tête d'Athéna, le restant de la pièce était propre, on aurait dit qu'elle avait été nettoyée. Nous avions reconnu à première vue, qu'il s'agissait d'un faux de X, qui, pendant quelque temps, après la mort de Christodoulos [1914 (?)], a suivi les systèmes de son patron et parent. Pourtant cette pièce, d'un style remarquable, avait été vendue par un expert [Jacob Hirsch], et personne ne la suspectait, elle était passée par les experts de <placeName>Berlin</placeName> et Londres, qui la considéraient comme authentique. Très probablement le faussaire avait patiné entièrement la pièce, mais le résultat n'étant pas satisfaisant, il l'avait nettoyée, une petite partie était restée, mais elle avait suffi pour nous permettre d'en déceler l'origine.</q>
                     <q>En définitive la pièce fut retirée de la vente, mais on nous reprocha d'avoir condamné la pièce sans raisons suffisantes. Récemment à Athènes nous avions eu le plaisir d'avoir la confirmation que nous avions juste; non seulement la pièce était fausse, mais c'était bien X qui l'avait fabriquée.<ref target="#CH5-n37">

                  <p>Ravel placed weight on the spurious patina, because he did not know the evidence of the die-links. Today it is clear that six specimens reproduce the obverse die of the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin (<hi rend="bold">F60</hi>–<hi rend="bold">F65</hi>), and three of them reproduce the reverse die also (<hi rend="bold">F60</hi>–<hi rend="bold">F62</hi>). One of the six specimens, the Robinson piece kept by the ANS (<hi rend="bold">F65</hi>), is of such poor metal that the whole string of coins, including three specimens connected by an altered reverse die (<hi rend="bold">F66</hi>–<hi rend="bold">F68</hi>), must be false.</p>
                  <p>A closer look reveals that the <hi rend="italic">madre</hi> was reproduced down to small peculiarities. Of course, the forger did his best to remove troubling particulars, such as the die-break at Athena's eyebrow, the corroded surface of her neck, or the fissure to the left of, and the dent above, her ear (the Elmali die-link eventually proved that the dent was not due to damage to the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin but to the ancient die). He was more careless with the reverse: there are the fissures beneath, and to the right of, the A; there are the two thin cracks running over the right wing towards the ⊙; there is the flatness of the flan's right and lower edge. The forger interfered with the reverse only if there was no other option. He had to fill in the lower right corner of the <hi rend="italic">quadratum incusum</hi>, which is off the flan of the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName> coin"; the edge of the <hi rend="italic">madre</hi> was transformed into a worm-shaped crack beneath the tip of the right wing.</p>
                  <p>Among the specimens extant, the Ars Classica specimen (<hi rend="bold">F60</hi>) was most certainly the first one minted. Its small flan concealed some treacherous elements but did not look very convincing. The following specimens were better done: the flans' outlines now look much more persuasive. A small crack at the right edge of the <hi rend="italic">quadratum incusum</hi> had been removed, and the forger took pains in dealing with the cracks around the A and ⊙. Another reverse die, which appears to be a revised version of the first one, was soon brought into use (<hi rend="bold">F63</hi>, <hi rend="bold">F64</hi>), and then two more variants (<hi rend="bold">F65</hi>, <hi rend="bold">F68</hi>). Another obverse die, based upon both the "Jameson" and the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coins (<hi rend="bold">31</hi>a, <hi rend="bold">5</hi>a) but altered in many ways, was to follow (<hi rend="bold">F66</hi>–<hi rend="bold">F68</hi>). This die compares badly with the first obverse, thus laying bare the limited artistic skills of the counterfeiter.</p>
                  <p>The name of the counterfeiter remains a mystery. It is clear that Ravel had in mind a protégé or assistant of <persName>Christodoulou</persName>, and so his "X" could be the man <persName>Nicholas Garyphallakis</persName> mentioned above.<ref target="#CH5-n38">
                        <hi rend="sup">38</hi>
                     </ref> Unfortunately, Ravel did not tell precisely what had happened at <persName>Athens</persName> that confirmed his suspicion. The word "récemment", however, should probably be read as "shortly before the war". If so, Garyphallakis' lawsuit of 1939 to regain the tools of his uncle could have been the crucial experience.</p>
                  <p>Another witness of what was going on in the <persName>Athens</persName> scene of the 1930s was Willy Schwabacher. Being Jewish, he spent the years 1933–1938 at <persName>Athens</persName>, then joining the excavation teams at the Kerameikos and the Agora, before he took

                     </ref> Unfortunately, a proud collector would provide casts to almost everybody even after Svoronos had exposed <persName>Christodoulou</persName>. In any case, if Schwabacher himself was not the first to suspect the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin, he was to fuel such suspicions. Some time after the war, Kenneth Jenkins made a note in the British Museum copy of <persName>Seltman's</persName> book at no. 447 (i.e., the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin): "Now Boston. ? false cf. similar style N.[aville] XIII 745."</p>
                  <p>Later on, he added the following note (using another pencil): "Schwabacher says he knows the man who made it!"</p>
                  <p>If the notice was written before the <placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName> sale, <persName>Jenkins</persName> cannot have been impressed by the hard bidding for, and the staggeringly high price of, the famous coin. According to Hélène Nicolet-Pierre's recollection, he had not changed his mind ten years later:
<q>C'est de cet exemplaire [i.e. the "<placeName>Kunstfreund</placeName>" coin] que <persName>W. Schwabacher</persName> avait mauvais opinion (I know the man who did it) d'apres Jenkins en visite à <placeName>Paris</placeName>, Cab.[inet des] Méd.[ailles], avec <persName>U.

On the obverse, the whole area of forehead, eye, and hair around the upper face is redone, and the lips seem to be slightly retouched. Other parts, however, do not show any signs of a recutting, the helmet in particular. The palmette looks even more worn than on the Burgon coin, and the scratch running over the neck-guard has not been removed. On the reverse, the area around the A which is affected by the obverse test-stroke has been retouched, and both body and wings of the owl have been redone as well. An unintentional addition occurring on some specimens is a die-break running across the 3.</p>
                  <p>At first sight, the result is persuasive. The forger did not reproduce the flan edge, thus giving his products outlines of their own.

By using small flans, the forger avoided revealing the outline of the Burgon obverse, where the crest and the neck hair are partly off flan.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, these forgeries can be recognized easily without reference to the Burgon coin. The difference between the fresh and worn areas is striking, especially on the obverse, and there is the exaggerated eye with the raised eyebrow. Although <persName>Martin Price</persName> had published a condemnation in 1977, he did not realize that the Burgon coin is the <hi rend="italic">madre</hi> of the forgeries, and he would suggest a die-link to the <persName>Christodoulou</persName> Group that does not exist.<ref target="#CH5-n47">

                  <p>No specimen has ever been offered at auction. The first one was recorded in 1970, and since then there have been periodical reappearances, the last one in 2007. In four cases the people showing the coins were said to be from Sicily, in another case to be Italians. As to the use of British Museum electrotypes there is a correspondence to a notorious series of forgeries, known as the products of the "Galvano boys".<ref target="#CH5-n48">

               <q>I have met with a medal here which I think is of such rarity that it would be a great acquisition to the British Museum. It is a silver piece of ten drachmae wanting little more than 12 grains of the full weight. The ancient type of <persName>Athens</persName>.</q>

I send a cast Mr Postolakas was so good as to make for me, that you may be able to judge of its appearance and state of preservation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is in the possession of a jeweller here who has lately had more than three hundred pieces of four drachmae of the Mecedonian <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> and Roman period. He asks two thousand francs. I have made no attempt to discuss the price but only informed him that I would write to <placeName>London</placeName> to try and find a purchaser if he would keep the medal for a little more than a month.</p>
            <p>The Rt. Honbl. <persName>Thomas Wyse</persName> Her Majesty's Minister has been so kind as to consent to transmit the cast with this letter.</p>
            <p>I requested you to deliver the cast to Colonel Leake after you have examined it and adopted your decisions.</p>

            <p>Dear Sir,</p>
            <p>We are much obliged to you for securing to us the offer of the rare Athenian decadrachm and we should be very glad to possess it if it is genuine, and from the cast it has every appearance of being so. But the price at present demanded (strikes?) <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> us out of the market, being full double the fair price, and having already got one we are not disposed to give an ultra extravagant price. It is not from the same die as ours, and therefore if you could procure it for us for one thousand francs I believe the Trustees would not refuse to purchase it, but I feel sure that they would not be persuaded to exceed that amount.</p>
            <p>The cast you were good enough to send has been forwarded as you desire to Col. Leake.</p>
            <p>I remain</p>
            <p>Yours very truly</p>

Nr. 7), weil er sie nur aus einer Zeichnung kannte und Brönsted ihr Gewicht nicht angibt. In der <persName>Sammlung Thomas</persName> befand sich eine zweite, zu 810.6 Par. Gran Gewicht. Ich habe sie nicht gesehen, kann also über ihre Echtheit nicht urtheilen. In Athen sah ich eine ziemlich gut nachgebildete, aber etwas zu schwere, in der Hand eines <persName>Herrn Orlando</persName>. Ich erkannte sie für falsch und das sichere Auge meines <persName>Freundes Borrell</persName> bestätigte dieses Urtheil. Dagegen besass ein Mann aus Nauplia, <persName>Michel Jatros</persName>, eine, die durch Patina, Styl und Gewicht sich als unbezweifelbar echt auswies und die auch Borrell dafür erkannte. Ich habe sie vor kurzem an mich gebracht.<ref target="#CH6-n5">

            <p>Another, hitherto unknown account by Prokesch von Osten was recently published:
<q>In den Vierziger Jahren liefen in Athen drei oder vier atheniensische Dekadrachmen, vortrefflicher Arbeit, aber um ein Geringes zu schwer, was an ihrer Ächtheit zu zweifeln berechtigte. Der Zweifel war mir Gewißheit, da ich im J. 1833, auf meiner Rückreise von Alexandria nach Triest, in Nauplia in der Hand eines Arztes ein unbestreitbar achtes Stück dieser höchst seltenen Münze gesehen hatte. Ich wollte dieses damals an mich bringen, erhielt aber von dem Besitzer nichts weiter als die Zusage daß wenn er die Münze je verkaufen wollte, er mich davon benachrichtigen würde. Er lebte noch als ich Athen zu Anfang 1849 verließ. Der Mann war etwa gleichen Alters mit mir. Mein Verlangen nach dieser Dekadrachme gab mir den Gedanken ein, einen meiner numismatischen Zubringer dort zu ermächtigen im Falle der Arzt sterben u. sein Nachlaß
<pb n="82"/>
verkauft werden sollte, die Münze für mich zu erstehen. Im J. 1852 trat dieser Fall wirklich ein, u. diese Perle kam um den Preis von 2000 Drachmen in meine Sammlung.<ref target="#CH6-n6">

            <p>Prokesch's hand-written catalogue of his collection (Cabinet des Médailles, <placeName>Brussels</placeName>) has the entry (p. 274):
<q>Décadrachme, 42,635???/42,70 g. Tête d'Athena, à dr., à casque orné des trois feuilles &amp; de la spirale à palmette, les cheveux massés au front &amp; sechappant en tresses perlées du bout du casque, boucle d'oreilles en deux globules &amp; croissant, collier en filet &amp; en perles. (Style archaique, noble &amp; grand). Rev. ∃-⊙-A. Chouette éployée de face, soigneusement éxécutée; pousse d'olivier dans l'angle en haut du carré creux, qui renferme le tout. Num. Chr. 1853. p. 30. pl. VI ???98 108.</q>
               <q>C'est la même pièce que <persName>M. Newton</persName> a vu à Athènes &amp; dont il dit: "I never saw any coin which appeared to me more thoroughly satisfactory. The surface of the metal has that peculiar drag in places, resulting from a slight slipping of the die at the moment of striking, which I have never seen in a forgery. It was, farther, cracked at the edge, and slightly oxydized in places, in a manner which could not, I should say, be counterfeited, though, of course, I looked at it with every desire to convict it of falsity, if I could, on account of its extraordinary rarity. I think it a more satisfactory coin than Thomas's."<ref target="#CH6-n7">

               <q>J'ai rencontré cette superbe pièce la prémiere fois en 1844 ou 1845 à Nauplia. Elle était dans les mains d'un médecin grec, Mo. Michel avec le prénom de son métier Iatros. Mes efforts pour me la faire céder restèrent infructueux. Tout ce que j'ai pu obtenir de lui, ce fait [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] la promesse de ne pas le vendre sans men prévenir. Obligé de quitter Athènes en fevrier 1849, j'ai chargé un de mes clients de ne pas perdre de vue cette médaille, l'autorisant éventuellement pour le cas du décès du médecin &amp; de la vente alors probable de ses effets, &amp; à l'âcheter. En 1856 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] le cas prévu arriva—la médaille fut vendue &amp; âcheté par mon homme au prix modique de deux mille francs.</q>

            <p>Obviously, Prokesch-Osten's recollection about the date of his acquisition was blurred when he wrote the catalogue. In his 1854 publication Prokesch-Osten said he bought the coin in 1852. He must have bought the coin before 1854, however not long before that year, because <persName>W. S. W. Vaux</persName> while presenting <persName>C. T</persName>.</p>

            <p>
               <persName>Newton's</persName> report on the coin (published in 1853) mentioned it as being "at present in the hands of a jeweller at <persName>Athens</persName>".<ref target="#CH6-n8">

            <p>The three or four coins condemned by <persName>Borrell</persName> and <persName>Prokesch-Osten</persName> could have been specimens of the numerous "Hoffmann" fakes which are attested soon after the middle of the nineteenth century (see above, Chapter 5 c).</p>
