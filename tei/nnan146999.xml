            <p>The copper coins brought to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> by the Irish Quaker <persName>Mark Newby</persName> in 1682 were the subject of the twentieth Coinage of the Americas Conference, sponsored by the American Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society’s governing Council as a forum for the dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of the Americas.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the subject are invited to deliver papers and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all who have an interest in the topic. The Society also invites registrants travelling to the <placeName>New York</placeName> area to come to know the Society’s collections and library better during the days surrounding the conference.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The anonymous Irish series known simply as the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage for its prominent depiction of Ireland’s patron on the reverse has long been a source of interest to Irish and American numismatists. Not only is the coinage impressive for the quality of its manufacture and richness of its designs in comparison to other contemporary Irish tokens, but it is also remarkable for the number of questions that have arisen regarding the authority for its production, its method of manufacture, and the true identity of its denomination(s). Within only a few decades of its issue all clear memory of its origin seems to have disappeared, leaving later numismatists to indulge in much speculation about this enigmatic coinage.</p>
            <p>Mystery also surrounds the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage with respect to its importation to the British colony of <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> and its importer, <persName>Mark Newby</persName>. The precise manner in which he obtained the coins in Ireland is unknown as is the mechanism through which they entered into general circulation in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>. There has even been dispute over the proper spelling of the <persName>Newby</persName> surname.</p>
            <p>Although a much narrower topic than those discussed in previous years, the renewed popular interest in the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series among American numismatists, spurred in part by several recent articles by Brian <persName>J. Danforth</persName>, made the coinage seem an attractive subject for the twentieth Coinage of the Americas Conference. We are grateful to the Stack Family for their support of COAC 2006.</p>
            <p>Readers expecting to find definitive answers to the problems of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage in the following pages are doomed to disappointment for the most part as the sketchy state of the evidence makes it very difficult to arrive at absolute conclusions. Instead, the primary purpose of the conference and the publication of these proceedings was to present the state of the question(s) in the hope of establishing a solid basis for future study.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>To this end, specialists in particular aspects of the coinage were invited to offer their views on specific themes.</p>
            <p>The first paper presented at the conference was given by <persName>Robert Heslip</persName> and dealt with the seventeenth-century Irish circulating environment to which the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage belonged. Unfortunately, circumstances have made it impossible to publish this paper here.</p>
            <p>The problems of metrology and denomination are treated in exhaustive detail by <persName>Philip L. Mossman</persName>, who greatly expanded on the initial study produced for <hi rend="italic">Money of the American Colonies and Confederation</hi> (<placeName>New York</placeName>, 1993).</p>
            <p>Difficulties also exist with respect to iconography due to the fancies of modern commentators rather than the enigmatic nature of the coins themselves. As an example of the several iconographic issues that relate to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage, I address the question of whether the kneeling harpist on the obverse of all <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins should be interpreted as King David or King Charles II, as some have suggested.</p>
            <p>Following the various metrological, denominational, and iconographic problems posed by the coinage, the papers by <persName>William Nipper</persName> and <persName>Brian Danforth</persName> address the thorny question of its origin. After an overview of the several early and recent theories on the dating of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage, <persName>Nipper</persName> makes a tentative case for identifying <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName> as its potential initiator. <persName>Danforth</persName> elaborates further on his identification of <persName>James Butler</persName>, Duke of Ormond and Lord-Lieutenant of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, as the political authority and Peter Blondeau as the technological mastermind behind the coinage.</p>
            <p>Having touched on the numerous questions and problems associated with the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage in its country of origin, we cross the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> to look at its situation in <placeName>America</placeName>. In order to contextualize the money brought by <persName>Newby</persName> to his new home, <persName>Louis E. Jordan</persName> gives a sweeping overview of coin circulation and the use of money substitutes in the British colonies of <placeName>North America</placeName> up to the mid-seventeenth century. This paper is particularly noteworthy for its extensive discussion of archaeological finds, most of which are likely to be unknown to those outside of the archeological community.</p>

            <p>The final paper, by <persName>Roger S. Siboni</persName> and <persName>Vicken Yegparian</persName>, takes a close look at the evidence for the life and career of <persName>Mark Newby</persName> (and settles the question of orthography for his last name). Based on their findings they break with traditional opinion and offer new conclusions regarding <persName>Newby’s</persName> financial status and the redemption of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage upon his death. An important appendix to this paper illustrates the original inventory documents of the <persName>Newby</persName> estate (1684).</p>
            <p>In order to familiarize specialists with the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins in the collection of the <placeName>America</placeName>n Numismatic Society, a fully illustrated appendix has also been prepared by <persName>Robert W. Hoge</persName>, the Society’s Curator of North American Coins and Currency.</p>

               <p>Of all the early currency of British <placeName>North America</placeName>, I know of none more shrouded in obscurity than the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. I am not much further along in unraveling the mysteries of this fascinating Irish coinage with its <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> connection than I was when I began 25 years ago. To help direct my thinking, I have developed a brief topical outline of the multiple unknowns about this series that have perplexed me. I only address one of them in this paper—namely their intended denominations when first minted—a subject I have pondered for years because of my interest in the circulation patterns of early coinages.</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1." rend="hang">Why is it that there is no definitive paper trail or oral tradition about the origin of this series? We have only a string of frequently contradictory speculations that have attempted to answer the "when," "where," "how," and "by whom" they were minted. The only firm dates are 1675, the year when two small coppers were lost in a shipwreck, and 1679, when the coins were demonetized on the Isle of Man.</item>

               <p>For over 300 years, students of the coinage have been searching for any concrete facts that would establish an official, semi-official, commercial, or ecclesiastical context for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. Although the large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> copper "incorporates the arms of Dublin as part of the design... it may therefore be a token issue, but whether authorised or not must remain an open question in the absence of documentary evidence."<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> If
<pb n="7"/>
the coins were officially or regally sponsored, one would anticipate some enduring paper trail or oral history. Whenever token coinages were private or semi-official substitutes for money, they were generally promissory in nature or clearly identified as merchant tokens with some provision for conversion into specie by their issuer. To further obfuscate their original purpose, the inscriptions on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> money provide no guarantee for redemption, indication of sponsor, or mark of value. In the absence of any documentation regarding the intended denominations of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, one must take a tangential approach and examine the coins themselves for what they can teach us; in other words, heed the advice of <persName>Hamlet’s</persName>
                  <persName>Lord Chamberlain</persName> and "By indirections find directions out."</p>
               <p>To start a very important factor must be kept in mind: all base copper coinages of that century were minted at a profit to someone, be it the king, a merchant, or a royal patent holder. As a first step in determining their proposed denominations, it is important to recall that in that era, the market value of official copper coinages equaled the combined cost of the metal, all mint charges, plus a substantial profit for the Crown and/ or patent holder. They were never emitted as an altruistic gesture for the benefit of the public, except perhaps for those few instances during an acute small change shortage, such as siege money, or where tokens issued as promissory notes declared they were redeemable in specie.</p>

               <p>To mint coins and place them in circulation involves a significant capital outlay that can include the following: [1] the expense of metal planchets; [2] the fixed production costs—die preparation, minting, fees, etc.; [3] storage, transportation, emission, and distribution costs; [4] profit to the issuers; [5] other fees, payments and bribes; and [6] the added expense of currency exchange rates between England and <placeName>Ireland</placeName> (if made in <placeName>England</placeName> for Irish use). Considering the above disbursements, one can predict the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> market rate at which the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series was originally intended to pass, a value that may never be less than the sum of the itemized list above since the coinage would never be generated at a financial loss. The word "originally" makes an important distinction since the intended market value of the coinage, when first emitted, may have changed over time as a result of economic factors. One must bear in mind that since these were tokens,
<pb n="8"/>
their size (diameter) and weight relationships do not necessarily determine value in the marketplace.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> While the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> fixed production costs for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series can be estimated from the contemporary records of the Tower Mint for similar coinages, we cannot know with certainty the many hidden expenses, such as transportation, profit commissions/bribes, and the cost of entering the tokens into circulation. In summary, the minimum intended denominations for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinages can be expressed by the following word equation into which I shall attempt to insert the appropriate numbers:</p>
               <p>minimum intended denomination ≥ planchet cost + fixed mint costs + distribution + profit + hidden fees and exchange</p>

                     <hi rend="bold">1. Estimating Planchet Costs</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>The initial step in calculating production costs is to find the cost of the planchet stock, which is determined by multiplying the prevailing market price of refined copper by the average mint weight of the struck coppers:</p>
                  <p>planchet cost = weight of planchet x cost of metal</p>
                  <p>The first requirement in solving this equation is to determine the mint weight of coins fresh from the presses, which, in the absence of both records and sufficient uncirculated examples, can be a rather complex exercise. There was variation in the weight of newly struck coppers from the Tower Mint in that era; we find for example that <persName>George III</persName> halfpence had a 6.4% disparity as made or ± 4.83 grains.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> English coppers were authorized to be minted at a specific number of coins per pound and were not weighed as individual planchets. Hence, there can be a great variation between the measured weights of individual regal coins; this disparity in weight is especially evident in copper tokens and other unofficial emissions for which there were no published standards. On the other hand, silver and gold blanks were individually weighed and, if necessary, were manually
<pb n="9"/>
adjusted prior to striking. With specie coins, any overweight members entering circulation would be immediately culled out for the melting pot and converted into bullion at a profit. Mint officials did not expend the same effort on lowly coppers whose market value included not only the expense of the metal but also the entire production cost plus a hefty profit for the issuer.</p>

                  <p>Returning to the above equation, we have no records of the planchet weights for uncirculated <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers and therefore these values must be derived by measuring existing survivors. In my previous study of the subject, I proceeded on the hypothesis that one could average higher grade coins to arrive at a close approximation of the actual mint weight of the total population of a series.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> This premise was based on a project I did comparing numismatic grade versus weight for two American copper series, Machin’s Mills imitation halfpence and Massachusetts cents. I found no appreciable difference in the average weights among the various collectable grades. Whatever variation there might have been was probably hidden by the wide range of planchet weights as indicated by the first standard deviation or error.</p>

                  <p>The study of weight loss from planchet wear, as it reflects on grade, was amplified by <persName>Charles W Smith</persName> (Table 1) in his study of Lincoln cents that recently appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Colonial Newsletter.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref>
                     </hi> In this article, he presented the weights of 50 pre-1942 Lincoln cents from each of seven grades, ranging from Uncirculated to those labeled About Good. Within the collectable range of numismatic examples, <persName>Smith</persName> found that the weight loss from wear of Lincoln cents was negligible.</p>
                  <p>In the same paper, <persName>Smith</persName> interpreted a table of measurements originally compiled by Damon Douglas, who did a similar study with 130 <placeName>U.S.</placeName> large cents by first sorting according to technical grade and then recording the average weight of each group.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> Compared to the modern small cents, <persName>Douglas’s</persName> large cents had a greater percentage weight loss as the grades decreased with increasing wear (Table 2).

                     <persName>Smith</persName> attributed the difference in the weight loss with diminishing condition between <persName>Lincoln</persName> cents and large cents to the fact that the much finer surface detail of small cents accounts for a small percentage
<pb n="11"/>
of their gross weight and proportionally a smaller amount of metal is lost to abrasion. There is relatively less loss of substance for the small coins as the grade diminishes when compared to the large cents, which involve a greater quantity of metal in raised features like thick lettering and complex rims; these large and thicker elements, representing a greater percentage of the coins’ mass, must be worn away before grade is adversely influenced. Also we do not have the details of <persName>Douglas’s</persName> large cent population. The use of older production technology for large cents may have led to a greater variation in original planchet weight than that observed for small cents manufactured in a modern mint.</p>
                  <p>Encouraged by <persName>Smith’s</persName> work, which supported my hypothesis, I revisited my 1986 and 1992 data for <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and Machin’s Mills coppers and expanded the census by adding more data points from recent auctions (see Tables 3 and 4, respectively). These two coinages had been originally selected because of their positions at the opposite ends of the Confederation coppers spectrum in that Machin’s Mills had no known standards and the Massachusetts mint conformed to the Federal weight of 157.5 grains.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref>

                  <p>*The average for the 25 uncirculated examples at 153.6 grains was taken as the norm, although 2.48% below the authorized standard of 157.5.</p>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <p>The average weights of the About Uncirculated, Extremely Fine, Very Fine, and Fine groups of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> cents were examined by the Student T-test whereby each of these grades was compared to the mean weight of the 25 Uncirculated examples to determine whether any statistically significant differences existed in their average weights. A <hi rend="italic">p</hi> (probability) value of 0.05 or greater indicates there is no significant difference between the two compared groups whereas a value below 0.05 is statistically significant and the calculated differences are real and cannot be explained by a mere chance occurrence. There was no statistical difference between the About Uncirculated, Extremely Fine, and Very Fine groups and their average weights can be considered uniform and viewed the same as uncirculated specimens. There should be caution in interpreting the potentially meaningful <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = 0.0383 for the Fine group because the small sample size may be a cause for error.</p>
                  <p>The weight to grade ratio for <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> cents was unchanged from my previous study and both sets of results are in keeping with <persName>Douglas’s</persName> large cent data. Certainly coins graded from Fine to Uncirculated would give a close approximation of mint weight, a value that could be made more accurate by adding the correction factors as prescribed by <persName>Douglas</persName>. All weight data are compared in Table 8.</p>
                  <p>The census of the Machin’s Mills coppers was expanded from the 133 coins tabulated in the 1992 tables to a new total of 227 examples with the addition of recent auction material. While there was no significant difference in weights, the new larger sample size increases precision.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> If there was any mention of porosity, microscopic granularity or roughness in its catalogue description, its weight was recorded separately. I found that 91 out of 227 specimens (40%) had some minimal planchet problems, but that the presence of these minor surface irregularities was inconsequential in influencing the average weights for the group within any grade.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> This comparison could not be not done for the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> cents, since there was no porosity noted in their descriptions.</p>

                  <p>It is notable that the Very Fine examples seem to have better weight retention (-1.0%) than the other higher grade specimens. A possible explanation is that although collectors view these imitation halfpence as a single series, they may have been minted in a number of locations where standards were inconsistent. Another feature is that many were struck from very shallowly engraved dies, therefore a major loss of grade may occur with relatively little loss of mass. However as a group, they seem to behave as a single entity, showing minimal weight loss until they reach a grade of Very Good.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>To summarize up to this point, a weight study of large <placeName>U.S.</placeName> cents, Machin’s Mills imitation halfpence, and <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> cents shows that when these coinages were worn to a numismatic grade of Fine, no more than 2.9% of their mass was lost (see Table 8). Using Douglas’s analysis of large cents (Table 2), one can extrapolate a percentage value that can be added to the weight of a lesser grade coin to obtain a reliable indication of what the full mint weight is likely to have been. <persName>Smith’s</persName>
                     <persName>Lincoln</persName> cent study for coins graded as Fine reveals only a 0.49% loss for which a reasonable explanation is offered. <hi rend="italic">Since there is no recorded mint weight standard for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, these studies were quoted here in order to estimate their unworn planchet mass in an attempt to arrive at a weight from which to estimate production costs.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>Seventy-one examples of large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins (Fig. 1; Table 5) were examined: their technical grades compared to their respective weights as was done for the Machin’s Mills coppers and <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> cents. I found that examples above the grade of Fine behaved in similar fashion to the other large coppers.<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> Only four within the sample were noted as having porosity in catalogue descriptions. With the availability of 31 high-grade coppers of consistent weight, I averaged the Extremely Fine and Very Fine groups to which was added the correction of 1.1% recommended by <persName>Douglas</persName> in order to compensate for modest wear. This correction factor was proportional to the numbers of the two combined grades, suggesting a mint weight of 143.5 grains. <persName>Aquilla Smith</persName> in his 1854 paper noted that the weights of his four well-preserved large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers ranged from 142 to 148 grains, averaging 144.75 grains. Similarly, <persName>Crosby’s</persName> heaviest example weighed 144 grains.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> The above historic values are consistent even considering potential sampling errors. From these measurements, I have concluded that full weight large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins were intended to weigh about 143.5 grains and their production costs, to be figured later, will be based on this figure. This average is more than I used in my previous work (135.7 ± 9.5 grains) of 21 specimens.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> With the increase of the number of specimens to 71, the new figure is considered more reliable.</p>

                  <p>Moving on to the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers (Fig. 2), I had derived a putative mint weight of 92.3 ± 9.2 for the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins in my 1986 and 1992 calculations by measuring only 46 mixed grade examples recorded from a few private collections and auction catalogues. I have now identified a significant sampling error within my prior study. With the increasing popularity of this series and more auction experience, the census of small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers in the present study has been increased to 251 undamaged examples. Although I accepted minor porosity, granularity and roughness as described in their auction lot descriptions (those coins with surface irregularities are noted in the Porous column of Table 6) any specimen with significant and disfiguring porosity (although counted in the last row of the table) were excluded from any computations. The new sample included the majority of the material used for the 1986 and 1992 tabulations. Not only are there over five times more coins in the current data base, but also there are significant qualitative differences. Twenty years ago most of the recorded coins were from pristine collections where 59% were graded at Very Fine or better.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> In the current sample, just 39% fall into this category. The most significant difference within the present census of 251 coins is that 20% are Very Good while in the 1986 and 1992 studies, only 6% were in that lower grade. The reason for this major sampling error is that the older auctions of the 1980s specialized in prime numismatic material, whereas more recently there has been an increase in research oriented collections, where all grades and conditions have been examined and nothing rejected in order to do a comprehensive study of die varieties. These newer numbers more accurately

reflect the entire spectrum of survivors; because of the availability of 24 high-grade examples, I selected their average as the closest representative value of the weight of freshly minted coins. Because of the slight wear as indicated by their About Uncirculated/Extremely Fine status, I added the 0.59% correction factor endorsed by <persName>Douglas</persName> to compensate for their reduction from full mint weight. The average mint weight that I now assign to small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers is 95.3 grains. <persName>Aquilla Smith’s</persName> collection of 10 high quality examples ranged from 77 to 102 grains.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref>
                     <persName>Crosby’s</persName> heaviest small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> copper was 98 grains.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>I became aware of the increasing frequency of porous planchets (Porous column), especially in the lower grade examples—a feature shared by the Machin’s Mills coppers (Table 5)—while recording the updated census of 251 coppers. (It is to be recalled that my 1992 data contained a greater proportion of higher grade small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, which masked this finding of porosity in worn coppers.) Within each group, if any example had microscopic or minor porosity, granularity, or roughness noted in its catalogue description, the coin was also listed in the Porous column. For example, 26 out of 51 Very Good graded coins showed some minor planchet problems. The average weight within each grade of coppers with problem-free planchets was compared to the average weight of those in the same numismatic grade of preservation with planchet irregularities (enumerated in the Porous column) to ascertain whether or not this minor porosity had any significant impact on the average weight of the entire sample. For example, the 25 Very Good coppers with normal planchets had an average weight of 82.7 ± 9.6 while the remaining 26 from the total sample of 51

weighed 81.9 ± 11.4. The <hi rend="italic">p</hi> value for these results was 0.7706 indicating no difference between these two groups. The <hi rend="italic">p</hi> values for the blemished versus the unblemished within the Very Fine and Fine groups were 0.3733, and 0.4165, respectively. In all cases, as with the Machin’s Mills coppers, the average values within each grade for the porous and non-porous surfaces were not significantly different.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Fine through Good conditions were compared to the About Uncirculated/Extremely Fine group, it is noted from the <hi rend="italic">p</hi> value of their weight differences attains extreme significance as compared to the marginal difference for the Massachusetts, Machin’s Mills, and large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers in the previous tables. As these small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers decrease in numismatic grade, there is an unexplained weight loss not seen in the other coppers examined.</p>

literal "gold-digger" to pry loose the brass splasher. These brass splashers are a mystery unto themselves but have no influence on weight since the specific gravity of brass is 8.4 to 8.7, very close to that of copper (8.8 to 8.95).<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> This suggests that the presence or absence of a splasher does little to alter a coin’s weight.</p>
                  <p>To summarize Table 6, the weight analysis of the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers looked like a rather straightforward exercise similar to the previous tables, but there were some unexpected findings:</p>

                     <item n="2." rend="hang">Although examples with significant porosity were excluded from calculations, the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers had no more minor porosity or planchet problems than the Machin’s Mills coppers (Table 5), as noted in their catalogue descriptions.<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref>

                     <item n="3." rend="hang">Within any single grade, those coins with minor porosity have an average comparable weight to those of the same grade with trouble-free planchets; the minor porosity does not seem to be a factor in the reduced weight.</item>

                  <p>The reasons for these observations, if valid, may be:</p>

the second with minor microporosity—were calculated at 8.89 and 8.73, respectively. These values were all within the range of copper at 8.8–8.95, but prove nothing because they could represent the average of metals in a complex bronze. In a further study of the observation that lower numismatic grade small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> tokens are proportionately lighter than other coppers of equal grade, the surfaces of two undamaged examples were cleaned with a solvent and examined with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to learn their composition.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> The weights of both specimens were representative of their respective Very Good and Very Fine condition grades as noted in Table 6. The first coin had the appearance of a rich brass while the second looked like leaded bronze; considering their high copper content, they, no doubt, would have passed for pure copper by seventeenth-century standards.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> The results are recorded in Table 7.</p>

                  <p>In my effort to arrive at an average mint weight for freshly struck small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, I discovered that as their numismatic grade decreases, there is a greater proportional weight loss than is seen with other copper coinages. Consequently, it is no longer valid to estimate the weight of freshly struck specimens by averaging a cross-section of circulated examples unless a correction factor is applied. There is the possibility that within this census there were hidden several planchet emissions of different metals, alloys or weights. Therefore, only Extremely Fine or better small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins can be reliably used for accurate metrological data concerning newly minted coins. We have certainly come all around "<persName>Robin Hood’s</persName> barn" to find this figure to fit into the simple formula that answers the question, "What were the denominations of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinages?"</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>It is instructive to digress for a moment to consider why coins lose weight. The normal decrease in grade of the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers—or any coin for that matter—may be due to genuine wear, which consists of two factors: surface abrasion of metal in which micro-fragments are sloughed into the environment and the peening effect in which the copper in the elevated design is hammered into the surface so that the dulling of identifying devices occurs without an accompanying loss of weight. The combination of wear and peening in <persName>Smith’s</persName> study accounted for a 2.82 % weight loss for <persName>Lincoln</persName> cents graded Good and 4.43% for those considered barely identifiable. Smith’s controlled study shows that the decreasing grade of circulated <persName>Lincoln</persName> cents is primarily the result of surface peening rather than the loss of abraded metal. However, there may be another more significant factor at work with low grade small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, namely porosity. From both Tables 4 and 6, we have seen that minor porosity did not adversely affect weight in either the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> or Machin’s Mills series, but the observation that significant numbers of small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins in lower grades have some degree of porosity leads one to think about the nature of porosity and how it might adversely affect this particular coinage in very low grades (36 examples in Table 6).</p>
                  <p>Copper is soft and relatively chemically reactive; "Thus the state of preservation of a coin can be thought of as the integrated effects of its entire physical and chemical history, from the time of its production to its current local situation."<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> These irreversible changes can be induced when a copper coin is subjected to an acidic environment—such as being buried in a coniferous region, a field treated with fertilizers, or stored in a tanned leather purse, rather than residing peacefully for years in dry neutral sand. The chemical influence of an acidic milieu may produce water soluble copper salts that leach out causing macroscopic surface granularity and discoloration from complex copper oxides in a process we identify as porosity.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> Cast planchets, with their natural micro fissuring created by escaping gas during the supercooling of the metal, are more susceptible
<pb n="22"/>
to porosity, since these minute clefts become conduits for the entrance of environmental contaminants beneath the surface of the coin with subsequent acceleration of chemical deterioration. "These voids remain available over time as host locations for weight-loss chemical activity."<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> Additionally, as cast planchets cool, small gas bubbles accumulate beneath the surface causing microscopic "pock marks" and as porosity progresses, the "pock marks" extend to the surface. Perhaps the extensive porosity that appears with this series is the result of being struck on several populations of cast planchets of mixed metals that were not detected in the small sample that underwent elemental analysis.</p>
                  <p>Another situation, unrelated to casting, may also add to premature porosity. When metals are worked and subjected to stress, their internal crystalline configuration is altered making their structure harder and less malleable (so-called "work-hardening"). If such a metal is stressed again, it may crack unless, prior to reworking, it is annealed in a procedure that consists of heating the metal to a precise temperature and cooling it slowly according to a formula specific to each metal or alloy. Thus, if coins were struck from non-annealed work-hardened planchets, they would be brittle and less ductile with surfaces more prone to invasion by environmental contaminants promoting porosity. In the seventeenth century, planchets were annealed between all phases of the minting process, namely the repeated rolling of the refined metal stock into desired planchet stock thickness, planchet cutting, and planchet flattening. Adequately annealed planchet material greatly added to the longevity of the embossing dies.</p>
                  <p>One can observe the positive effects of annealing by examining the surfaces of a state copper that has been overstruck on an existing coin such as in the <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> Maris 56-n variety. If the host planchet were well annealed and softened, very little residual host coin detail would be evident on the parasitic 56-n, perhaps only some ghost letters around the periphery. Whereas if struck on a work-hardened, host copper that has not been annealed, there will be lighter impressions from the 56-n dies and even the central devices of host coin will remain visible. However, because the 56-n die pair was so long-lived, it is apparent that the host planchet stock was generally well annealed before receiving a <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> identity.</p>
                  <pb n="23"/>
                  <p>The occurrence of porosity in buried coins has been mentioned; there is at least one uncontrolled experience that speaks to this question. In 1731, some 50 immigrant families from Londonderry, <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, settled at Pemaquid, Maine. This fledging colony, which disbanded two years later, has been the site of intense archeological activity and revealed 17 Wood’s Hibernia coppers among the site finds.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref>
                     <persName>Charles W Smith</persName> and I had the opportunity to examine these numismatic recoveries and found that most were significantly porous, but judging from the retained surface detail, they were obviously in excellent condition when they were lost, buried, or discarded. Here is a natural experiment in which new high-grade coins were subjected only to the deteriorative effects of environmentally induced porosity. The three porous farthings averaged 46.4 grains (a 20% reduction from mint weight); the 14 halfpence without physical damage averaged 103.1 grains.<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> When three well-preserved halfpence with minimal or no porosity were excluded, the average of the eleven remaining was 101.9 grains. In nature’s laboratory, where several eight-year-old coppers of known weight had been discarded and developing porosity for 270 years, the average weight loss was from 11.6% to 12.2%. Even though the numbers here are few and subject to sampling error, we are still left with another indication that the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> tokens do not behave like other coins since even the 36 highly-porous small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers lost 19.5% of their estimated mint weight. Again we must be aware of sampling errors and realize that we are describing a trend.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Having made some estimation of the average weights of the coppers as they left the mint, I now return to the question of the denomination of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinages. The small planchets do not seem to show the typical degradation pattern with wear as evidenced by the large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> pieces, or any other pure copper coin. What is urgently needed is a non-destructive planchet analysis of a large sample of high-grade specimens before any surface degradation has occurred. We must be cautious because there
<pb n="24"/>
may have been several populations of planchets: some of pure copper that behaved accordingly, and others of an alloy that was subject to a more rapid weight loss. Lacking this definite information, I have used the cost of pure copper for both coinages. These data are subject to modification as more information becomes available regarding typical planchet composition.</p>
                  <p>From his work on Lord Baltimore <hi rend="italic">denaria</hi> from the Tower Mint, <persName>Louis Jordan</persName> has investigated his lordship’s potential profit from his copper coinage during the same period that interests us.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> Since <placeName>Ireland</placeName> did not have a copper industry at this time and relied on outside sources,<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> finished planchet preparation would most likely have been done elsewhere—<placeName>England</placeName> in this case—and the costs presented in pounds sterling. Although Peck listed the 1672 price at 12d per pound, Challis adds an additional 4.5d for the price of finished planchets and another 2.5d for charges related to coining and distribution.<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> An earlier estimate of costs by Thomas Violet places the cost of copper at 12d<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref>—but to this, the cost of planchet manufacture and minting must be added. Considering all these variables, a reasonable estimate of the sterling cost to mint one pound of copper would be:</p>
                  <p>Copper per pound avdp. = 12d,</p>
                  <p>Planchet manufacture = 4.5d,</p>
                  <p>[Total finished planchets = 16.5d]</p>
                  <p>Cost of minting, dies, and distribution 2.5d per pound avdp. = 19d.</p>
                  <p>We may never be certain about the total production cost for <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers, which could have been less than 19d, because that overall fee at the Tower Mint included a number of salaries of mint officials who were not involved in token production. Furthermore, the 19d are taken as a maximum total cost, but it could have been less if there was a less expensive source for some of the small planchets. These ameliorating reductions in planchet cost could have been offset by the additional expenses incurred for transportation to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> and local distribution, and also by the added expenditure for the 140 or more hand-engraved die pairs which is an
<pb n="25"/>
excessive number for such a small output. We also have no idea if the placement of the splashers required special handling at an added expense. For ease of computation, the maximum cost will be taken at 19.0d per pound of copper.</p>

                  <p>**Based on the period exchange rate of 1.00:105.56, English to <placeName>Irish</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>From these data, it would appear that the sponsor(s) of the large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> copper realized a 21.4% profit if it passed as a halfpenny. Assuming that the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers had the same author(s), this issue would have incurred an 8.5% loss if marketed as farthings. There would also be a significant profit if they were emitted as a lighter version of a halfpenny, but, of course, the sponsor(s) would have no control over the future business climate that could easily readjust their value downwards, since neither token carried an indication of value, the identification of the issuer, or any promise of future redemption.</p>
                  <p>In <hi rend="italic">Money of the American Colonies and Confederation,</hi> I presented the evidence for why both coins were originally intended to pass as halfpence. The major premise was that they were not minted in the 1:2 weight ratio that one would expect if their sponsor(s) adhered to a farthing/halfpenny relationship. Also, because these coppers were only tokens representing real money issued for somebody’s personal gain, there was insufficient profit if the small token passed as a farthing.<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> On this point, <persName>Robert Heslip</persName>

In 1992, using a smaller and less representative sample with a less accurate mint weight, I calculated a mere profit of 9.8% for the small copper if it were to pass as a farthing and a profit of 49.1% for the larger piece when it passed as a halfpenny.</p>

               <p>Regarding small change, what other minor coins were the Irish people accustomed to receive and spend in the late seventeenth century? In order to study the relationship between the two <persName>St. Patrick</persName> issues and other contemporaneous Irish coinages, it is important to recall the weights of other Irish coppers of the period (see Table 10), <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of which are significantly lighter. The Armstrong patent farthing is about one-quarter the weight of the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coin, also called a farthing by many.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> One should bear in mind that for any coin to circulate, it must be acceptable in commerce based on either its intrinsic worth or its acceptable token value as a promissory note with the prospect for redemption. Typically such tokens were minted at a considerable profit to the authors. Numismatic history is replete with examples of rejected coinages that the citizenry considered lightweight and overvalued. The unpopular copper farthings of the Harington, Lennox, Richmond and Maltravers patents are good examples.</p>
               <p>In comparing the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinages (Table 9) with other coppers of the era in Table 10, it is instructive to see how much heavier they are. In estimating potential profit from each of the coinages (Table 11), many of the earlier patent coinages returned significant profits to their sponsors. This table gives us a rough idea of the minimum expected profit for patent halfpenny tokens in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> during that period. I suspect that since the large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins did not offer a great potential for profit (21.4%) the whole operation was redesigned with a small sized halfpenny intended to capture an 83.1% profit.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Since both varieties of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins are mute as to their proposed denominations, I will concentrate on the historical documentation that may assist us in learning about the rate at which they were entered into commerce (Table 12). It is unclear which of the opinions summarized in Table 12 are supported by evidence, which are just parroting previous colleagues, and which are unsubstantiated personal biases. Based undoubtedly on the ecclesiastical symbolism, early writers linked the coinage to the 1642 General Assembly of Kilkenny.<ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref> Although this time frame is not generally supported by other considerations, an anonymous account, appearing in 1832, described the <hi rend="italic">small</hi> coin as having been minted in the 1640s by the Catholic Confederation, "who in the Castle of Lea coined some of that brass money, known by the name of <persName>St. Patrick</persName>’s Halfpence, and which are of the value of a four-thirteenth of a penny sterling; but which in that period, bore a currency of one shilling." They enjoyed only a brief circulation as token shillings and then as the report infers, were reduced in value to
<pb n="30"/>
become current as "<persName>St. Patrick</persName>’s Halfpence."<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref> In reference to Table 9, using a sterling value scale, such a "<persName>St. Patrick</persName>’s Halfpenny," passing at four-thirteenths of a penny, sterling (0.31d), would have cost about 0.26d to mint in 1675 funds, providing about a 20% profit. Originally provided out of necessity as shillings, not unlike the Irish gun money of a later period, there was a period when indeed this commentary confirmed that these small coins were once valued as halfpence. No mention is made of the large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coin. Granted that this 1642 scenario may lack other historic substantiation, in terms of this current paper, the monetary considerations are logical.</p>
               <p>Considering that more observers date these coins to the mid- to late-1670s, it has always amazed me that there were not some earlier contemporaneous comments as to their existence and appearance, let alone monetary value, particularly if some royal patronage were involved. It is certain that some of the small coppers were minted prior to 1675, since two were recovered from the <persName>yacht <hi rend="italic">Mary,</hi>
                  </persName> which sank that year in a storm.<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref> The only other firm piece of evidence for their early history is cited by <persName>Charles Clay</persName> in his 1869 review of Manx coinages, in which he stated that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins arrived there from <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in about the year 1670 and were among a number of tokens tolerated on the island because of a severe shortage of small change.<ref target="#CH1-n45">45</ref> The large piece "was generally called a penny," but <persName>Clay</persName> did not comment on the value of the small coin. We have no idea how, when, or why the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinages arrived on the English-controlled Isle of Man, but we learn that a 1679 Act of Tynwald officially demonetized the widely counterfeited "Butchers Halfpence,"<ref target="#CH1-n46">46</ref> the "<persName>Patrick Halfpence</persName>, and copper farthings or any other of that nature." The same legislation specifically endorsed the currency of regal coppers and "the brass money called Jno. [<persName>John</persName>] <persName>Murrey’s</persName> pence." The probable motive for this repudiation of anonymous coppers was that the "<persName>Butcher</persName>" and "<persName>Patrick</persName>" tokens and plentiful forgeries were suppressing the circulation of
<pb n="31"/>
English coinage. The 1668 Murrey piece was favorably received because it was issued by a politically well-connected local tradesman who financially secured the circulation of his tokens.</p>
               <p>In his classic article, <persName>Aquilla Smith</persName> summarized the opinions expressed by several numismatists from the early eighteenth century.<ref target="#CH1-n47">47</ref> From the data in Table 12, based on opinions expressed between 1679 and 1869, it is evident that at least in the first quarter of the 1700s, the large and small <persName>St. Patrick</persName>’s coppers were passing as halfpence and farthings, respectively. However, those authors, writing fifty years after the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers were presumed to have been minted, admitted that no clear consensus as to their origins and denominations existed, although others inferred they were both halfpence. In fact, so little was known about the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> issues, that Evelyn, the first numismatist to write about them stated in 1697, "I think" they are "Irish."<ref target="#CH1-n48">48</ref> There cannot be much less incertitude than that for an issue that may have been no more than 25 years old! <persName>Simon</persName> felt they were halfpence and farthings whereas <persName>Batty</persName>, <persName>Lindsay</persName> and "other distinguished Numismatists" considered them pennies and halfpence.<ref target="#CH1-n49">49</ref> More recently, <persName>Michael Dolley</persName> noted,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>What is still not known for certain is how the two denominations were valued at the time of their first utterance. It is irrelevant that later generations of students have assumed them to be halfpence and farthings, or perhaps pence and halfpence...What concerns us is the value put on them at the time of their striking, and <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> there appears to be no compelling reason they should not have been accepted as half-groats and pence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Later, he concluded, the large pieces may have been retariffed as halfpence.<ref target="#CH1-n50">50</ref>

               <p>The review of these comments by earlier numismatists regarding the intended value of the two copper tokens indicates that they all make the assumption that the two different sized issues represented two separate denominations that were minted and circulated simultaneously. It appears to me that prior writers were so completely mesmerized by the putative size correlation of farthing to halfpenny that they completely overlooked the implication of the cost/profit relationship in their manufacture. The large planchet coppers probably came first and were then replaced by the small planchets to increase minting profits. Both were intended as halfpence but the small tokens were subsequently retariffed as farthings.</p>
               <p>This is precisely what <persName>Swift</persName> wrote in 1724. In <persName>George Faulkner’s</persName> 1735 edition of <hi rend="italic">The <persName>Drapier’s</persName> Letters,</hi> which included <persName>Swift’s</persName> revisions,<ref target="#CH1-n54">54</ref> we read
<pb n="34"/>
his comparison of <persName>William Wood’s</persName> halfpence to the halfpence of earlier periods:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>... Butchers Half-Pence, Black Dogs and the Like, or perhaps the Small <persName>St. Patrick</persName>’s Coyn which passeth now for a farthing<ref target="#CH1-n55">55</ref>...For I have now by me some Half-Pence coyned in the Year 1680 by vertue of the Patent granted to my <persName>Lord Dartmouth</persName>, which was renewed to Knox, and they are heavier by a ninth Part than those of Woods, and in much better Metal.<ref target="#CH1-n56">56</ref> And the great <persName>St. Patrick</persName>’s Half-penny is yet large than either.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Since this remark appears during a discussion of halfpence, it seems that Swift’s intention was to convey the impression that the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> copper—once a halfpenny—was now passing, some 55 years later, as a farthing. <persName>Harris</persName>, writing in 1745, further supports this same position by stating:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In this Reign [i.e., <persName>Charles II</persName>: 1660–1685] were two or three Kinds of Copper Half-pence coined...

               <p>Following the Manx rejection, these unwanted tokens somehow came into the possession of <persName>Mark Newby</persName>, an English Quaker who was established as a merchant in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> where he suffered religious persecution. In 1681, at age 43, <persName>Newby</persName> and his family emigrated from <placeName>Dublin</placeName> to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> and settled in a Quaker community established by <persName>William Penn</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n58">58</ref>
                  <persName>Newby</persName> brought with him an unknown quantity of <persName>St. Patrick’s</persName> tokens. When he was elected to the <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> Assembly in May 1682, legislation was
<pb n="35"/>
soon enacted authorizing his <persName>St Patrick</persName> coppers to "pass for halfe pence Current pay of this Province" which would be a rate of 24 to the <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> shilling, money of account.<ref target="#CH1-n59">59</ref> For his tokens to circulate as legal tender, he was obliged to post "sufficient surety" which parenthetically was the same financial arrangement required of <persName>John Murrey</persName> for his coppers to circulate on the Isle of Man. Being an astute business man, one can speculate that <persName>Newby</persName> acquired his tokens, probably the small variety, both in bulk and at a considerable discount, which he quickly arranged to circulate in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> as halfpence.<ref target="#CH1-n60">60</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Crosby</persName> cited a reference indicating that many "Patrick half-pence have been ploughed up" on <persName>Newby’s</persName> original farm.<ref target="#CH1-n61">61</ref> Indeed any recovered coppers were halfpence because that was their legal <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> rating. Unfortunately the author of this statement failed to note whether the coins were of the large or small variety. None of the large variety traditionally known as "halfpence" have been reported, but to date I have compiled a census of nine small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers recovered by metal detectors and a single silver coin found in an archeological site in Playwicki, PA. Nothing more is known about the latter.<ref target="#CH1-n62">62</ref> Of the small coppers, four were found in <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>, and one each in Laurel, MD; New Bern, NC; Greene, NY; <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>; and one near the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>/Connecticut state line. The Laurel, MD, coin appeared in the Colonial Coin Collectors’ Club Convention auction (November 8, 1997), as lot 309. I agree with the cataloguer’s statement that "No conclusions of any sort can be drawn from an isolated discovery, but it becomes one small piece in the jig saw puzzle of which denomination[s], Halfpence or Farthings, actually circulated in <placeName>North America</placeName>."</p>

               <p>The Playwicki find provides a natural segue for discussion of the silver <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins popularly described as "shillings" (Fig. 9). While little is known about their copper cousins and even less is known about the silver varieties. They were first mentioned in 1697, when Evelyn placed them among the medals of <persName>Charles II</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n63">63</ref>
                  <persName>Thornsby</persName>, 18 years later, likewise considered them medals rather than a circulating currency, an opinion shared by both <persName>Leake</persName> and <persName>Harris</persName>. This conclusion may have been supported by the fact that they were all minted with a medal turn, although I am not aware of any that have been pierced for suspension.<ref target="#CH1-n64">64</ref>
                  <persName>Dr. Robert Cane</persName> and later <persName>James Simon</persName> in his 1749 essay considered them shillings struck at the same time as the small copper coins by the Kilkenny Assembly in 1643.<ref target="#CH1-n65">65</ref> Currently there are 14 known silver varieties, of which nine were struck from die pairs also used for the small copper tokens.<ref target="#CH1-n66">66</ref> Two silver coins are known in both early and intermediate die states, indicating that minting
<pb n="37"/>
occurred over time.<ref target="#CH1-n67">67</ref>
                  <persName>Aquilla Smith</persName> reported owning three small-sized silver pieces and a "somewhat worn" large silver <persName>St. Patrick</persName> piece of 176.5 grains that was struck from a pair of dies identical to a pair used for the large copper series. These dies have since been identified as Vlack 1-B.<ref target="#CH1-n68">68</ref>
                  <persName>Smith</persName> concluded that if the small silver coins were shillings, the large one must have been intended as a higher denomination. However, it was his final opinion that all the silver specimens were "model" or proof pieces from the same dies as the copper series. He supported this statement with the fact that he also had a lead proof from a pair of small dies.<ref target="#CH1-n69">69</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Currently there are four opinions as to the origins of the two species of silver <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins: they were either 1) medals, 2) currency coins (shillings), 3) models or proofs of the two copper varieties, or 4) struck much later from original dies, replicating a practice that is well known for Irish gunmoney. To further complicate matters, there are two small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> specimens struck in gold from different sets of dies. The first, weighing 184.4 grains, struck at an unknown time from genuine dies, recently appeared in the Ford Sale;<ref target="#CH1-n70">70</ref> the second is the controversial Norweb plain-edged piece of 125.1 grains struck from 0.917 fine gold using a pair of new and otherwise unknown dies (Fig. 10).<ref target="#CH1-n71">71</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In returning our attention to the silver <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, I do not know what they represented—but I do know that they were not Irish shillings. Again in the absence of any documentary evidence, we are obliged to turn to the coins themselves to find our answers. I have been able to trace 37 examples ranging from 77.8 to 123.0 with a median of 102.2 grains and an average of 101.5 ± 11.7. Since many of the silver coins were in high grades, it would appear that the intended weight was about 102.0 grains. I do not have a metal analysis to determine silver content, but a single specific gravity of 10.495 is indicative of a high silver content.<ref target="#CH1-n72">72</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="38"/>
               <p>Note that the standard deviation of ±11.7 of the silver <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins confirms their wide range of planchet weights. In comparing these coins with other silver coins of the period, it is evident that these planchets did not have the same weight tolerance as those from the royal mints. An analysis of 50 high grade English shillings of <persName>Charles I</persName> revealed an average weight of 88.7 ± 4.0 grains (range 84.7 to 92.7) for a coinage authorized at 92.9 grains of sterling silver, although some of the sample could have been subtly clipped.<ref target="#CH1-n73">73</ref> Even <persName>John Hull’s</persName>
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> silver shillings of the same period had much less variation in weight than did these silver <persName>St. Patrick</persName> pieces, suggesting that they were not made in a quality controlled environment such as the Tower Mint. The supposed "Irish" <persName>St. Patrick</persName> "shillings" at 102.0 grains are 9.1 grains or 9.8% heavier than the English.</p>
               <p>Considering that the contemporary English to Irish exchange rate was 100.00:105.56, an Irish shilling should contain 88.0 grains of silver. The average of the 37 examples in this data is 14 grains or 15.9% too heavy. If any shilling of this weight ever hit the Irish shores, its first and only stop would have been the melting pot for reduction into bullion at a handsome profit for the silversmith. As they stand, these "Irish" shillings are actually Irish 14d pieces, a situation that never would have existed.</p>
               <p>88 grains ÷12d = 7.33 grains per penny</p>
               <p>102 ÷ 7.33 = 13.9–14d Irish</p>
               <p>If the coins were below sterling grade they might not be worth as much, but we know how actively the English government resisted any coins that were not 0.925 fine. The best guess is that the silver <persName>St. Patrick</persName> issues were presentation pieces struck contemporaneously from small copper dies, but were never meant to circulate as currency. Indeed, all this is a guess, since no supporting evidence has accompanied any of the preceding opinions.</p>

               <p>In conclusion, I do not think that I have provided any definite answers regarding the intended denominations of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. However, the following clarifications clearly contribute to our knowledge of the denominations of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series.</p>
               <p>For the large <persName>St. Patrick</persName> copper we can say:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1." rend="hang">There is presently no existing documentation for its sponsor(s) or its initial denomination; historically it has been considered a halfpenny, a penny, and even a twopence—fully recognizing that its trading value may not have been consistent over the years.</item>
                  <item n="2." rend="hang">We have no firm evidence linking the emission of the large and small coins except a common iconographic theme and a brass splasher, presumably inserted as an anti-counterfeiting measure (like the brass plug in "rose" patent farthings). It would appear that the farthing/ halfpenny relationship has been traditionally assumed based only on their weights.</item>
                  <item n="3." rend="hang">Lacking any justification to call this pair of tokens the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> halfpenny and farthing, I would advocate referring to them as the "large" and "small" <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers.</item>
                  <item n="4." rend="hang">A full weight coin is assumed at 143.5 grains—but this does not preclude the possibility of several populations of planchets of varying weight since there is no known authorized weight.</item>
                  <item n="5.">There is at least one known silver example struck from genuine dies.</item>
                  <item n="6." rend="hang">The copper issues behave like all other coppers in their wear/weight loss behavior.</item>
                  <item n="7." rend="hang">It was minted at a fair profit—but certainly nothing comparable to other copper tokens of the period.</item>
                  <item n="8." rend="hang">There is no archaeological or metal detection evidence that it ever circulated in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>.</item>
               </list>
               <pb n="40"/>
               <p>For the small <persName>St. Patrick</persName> copper:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1." rend="hang">There is presently no existing documentation for its sponsor(s) or initial denomination; historically it has been usually considered a farthing probably based on its approximate size relationship with the large coin. It is recognized that the value received in the market place may have changed with time due to economic forces.</item>
                  <item n="2." rend="hang">We have no firm evidence linking the emission of the large and small coins except for a common iconographic theme and splashers.</item>
                  <item n="3." rend="hang">With wear and decreasing grade, these pieces lose more weight than the large sort and do not behave like other typical coppers. The reason for this is unclear. This may be artifact or statistical quirk. A large sample should be examined by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence to settle the issue. Two recently examined examples are seen to be copper. There may have been several populations of planchets, including those without splashers, or some may be a bronze alloy, yet to be defined by further studies.</item>
                  <item n="4." rend="hang">If initially issued as farthings, these would have been minted at a loss. It is entirely possible that they were originally issued as another variety of halfpenny minted at a lighter weight for an improved profit. At a later period, the small copper may have been received as a farthing as indicated by <persName>Dean Swift</persName> and <persName>Harris</persName>. A single reference suggests that in the 1640s it was minted as a token shilling which, after a short time was devalued as a halfpenny.</item>
                  <item n="5." rend="hang">These have been the only variety recovered in <placeName>North America</placeName> suggesting they were the ones made current in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> and authorized as halfpence.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the off-metal examples:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1." rend="hang">Of the fourteen identified silver varieties, nine are known to have been struck from original small token dies, probably during the same period.</item>
                  <item n="2." rend="hang">The small silver examples were not shillings since they were too heavy to have successfully circulated as such.</item>
                  <pb n="41"/>
                  <item n="3.">The silver pieces could well have been presentation pieces.</item>
                  <item n="4." rend="hang">One gold coin is reported to have been struck from original small coin dies and the other is a copy, possibly struck in a later period.</item>
                  <item n="5." rend="hang">There is at least one lead proof trial piece struck from small coin dies.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If I have failed to answer the question of what the intended denominations of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinages were, at least I am in good company. <persName>Dr. Aquilla Smith</persName>, another physician, closed his 1854 paper "On the Copper Coins Commonly Called <persName>St. Patrick</persName>’s" with the statement, "I now leave the subject open for further investigation." And so do I.</p>

            <p>Although the iconography of the seventeenth-century <persName>St. Patrick</persName> “farthings" and “halfpence" is very rich (Pl. 1–2), it has rarely garnered serious attention from numismatists, and on the few occasions when it has, the results have tended to be mixed. Because of this situation, a number of peculiar iconographic interpretations have evolved in the modern literature as well as within the general lore of the series passed on by collectors. The present paper deals with the interpretive problems of the iconography of the king who appears on the obverse of both series of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage. Discussion of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> reverse types as symbols of the Protestant Ascendancy appropriated from Catholic sources will appear elsewhere.</p>
            <p>It is not infrequently claimed that the obverse type of King <persName>David</persName> playing the crowned harp on both denominations of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage was intended as a portrait of King <persName>Charles I</persName>, and that, therefore, the series must be dated to the 1640s, or if a Restoration date is accepted, that the coinage was produced under <persName>Charles II</persName> to commemorate his deposed father. However, a close review of the iconography reveals very little that is distinctly Caroline in the King David type, suggesting that it was really intended to depict David as himself, rather than <persName>Charles I</persName> as <persName>David</persName>. This being said, there can be little doubt that the type was intended as an allusion to contemporary English divine-right kingship.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that while many of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century students of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage speculated that the coins were issued or at least used by the Confederate Catholics of Kilkenny in the context of the Irish Revolt of 1641–1652,<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> none of them seem to have suggested that the <persName>David</persName> type was actually a portrait of <persName>Charles I</persName> prior to <persName>Edward Maris’</persName> publication <hi rend="italic">of A Historic Sketch of the Coins of <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>

               <ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> But is it true? Was the face of <persName>Charles I</persName> actually used for King <persName>David</persName> on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage?</p>
            <p>The king’s head, which is only about 5mm from beard tip to crown on the "halfpence" and 3mm on the "farthings," is far too small to distinguish the facial features of <persName>Charles I</persName> (Pl. 1, 3–4). Thus it seems most likely that the features recognized by <persName>Maris</persName> in the <persName>David</persName> type were the pointed beard and shoulder-length hair, rather than the details of the face. There can be little question that the hair and beard of the <persName>David</persName> figure on the "halfpenny" are reminiscent of some numismatic portraits of <persName>Charles I</persName> (Pl. 1, 5), but these same features also appear on the portraits of the king’s European contemporaries, such as the Holy Roman Emperor <persName>Ferdinand III</persName> (Pl. 1, 6), <persName>Georg Wilhelm</persName>, the Elector of <placeName>Brandenberg</placeName> (Pl. 1, 7), and others. More importantly, a similar style of hair and beard is worn by a harp-playing <persName>David</persName> on a Nuremberg 10-ducat portugaloser of 1641 (Pl. 2, 8). Since a portrait of <persName>Charles I</persName> is no more likely to appear on a gold multiple of Nuremberg than that of <persName>Ferdinand III</persName> is to be found on Irish coppers, it seems clear that the beard and hairstyle cannot be taken as personal identifiers of <persName>Charles I</persName>, and should be understood instead as generic elements of royal fashion in the first half of the seventeenth century.</p>
            <p>Also problematic for the portrait theory is the fact that the figure of King <persName>David</persName> on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> "farthing" appears to have a different and fuller style of beard and lacks the shoulder-length hair worn by the king on the "halfpenny." The "farthing" type seems to represent King <persName>David</persName> in old age, with thinning hair and long beard. A similar image of <persName>David</persName> appears later on the eighteenth-century psalmenpfennige of the Swiss city of Brugg (Pl. 2, 9) and probably derives from earlier artistic depictions, such as "<persName>David</persName> Playing the Harp" (Fig. 1) by <persName>Peter Paul Rubens</persName> (1577–1640).</p>
            <p>Breen attempted to support <persName>Maris’</persName> dubious portrait identification by citing a remarkable halfpenny pattern made by <persName>Nicholas Briot</persName> for <persName>Charles I</persName>

(Pl. 2, 10).<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> The shorter hairstyle and goatee treatment of the beard actually serve to undercut the portrait argument. King <persName>David</persName> appears to have longer hair on the "halfpenny" and a full beard on both denominations of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage. The main interest here must be the radiate crown, which is indeed very similar to that worn by <persName>David</persName> on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage. However, despite this similarity, there is no evidence that portrait coins depicting <persName>Charles I</persName> wearing this form of crown ever saw circulation and therefore could have served as a model for <persName>David</persName> on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage. In any case, the radiate crown (also known as the eastern or antique crown in heraldic terminology), like the beard and hairstyle, was not an attribute specific to <persName>Charles I</persName>, and therefore cannot be taken as proof that <persName>David</persName> was a representation of <persName>Charles I</persName>.

               <persName>Charles</persName>’ contemporaries King <persName>Felipe IV</persName> of <placeName>Spain</placeName> (Pl. 2, 11) and Cnosimo II de’ Medici, the Grand Duke of <placeName>Tuscany</placeName> (Pl. 2, 12) were depicted wearing radiate crowns on coins struck in their Italian possessions as indicators of their classical erudition.<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref> This form of crown was generally associated with antiquity because it frequently appeared on

            </p>
            <p>In the Roman Empire, imperial portraits wearing radiate crowns were regularly used to indicate double value, as on the brass dupondius (worth 2 copper asses) (Pl. 2, 13) and the silver antoninianus (worth 2 denarii) (Pl. 2, 14), but also became associated with debasement.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> The antoninianus, introduced by the Emperor <persName>Caracalla</persName> in 213, was rated at 2 denarii and yet it contained only 80% of the silver needed for this intrinsic value. Over the course of the third century, the silver content was increasingly reduced until the antoninianus became a billon coin.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> The fact that <persName>Charles I</persName> wears not only the radiate crown, but also the draped cloak <hi rend="italic">(paludamentum)</hi> of a Roman general clearly signals a Roman model—probably the antoninianus—for this representation. All of his other numismatic portraits depict him in contemporary costume; often involving plate armor with a ruff or lace collar.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> In the case of the Briot pattern, the radiate crown may have been intended to signal the use of debased silver for the proposed halfpenny, lest unscrupulous individuals try to pass it as good sterling. The pattern specimens cited by <persName>Peck</persName> all have the appearance of silver, but specific gravities that point to the use of impure silver or a base metal core.<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> Perhaps most telling against the association between the radiate crowned portrait type of the Briot pattern and King <persName>David</persName> of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage is the fact that this crown form was often connected not only with Roman antiquity, but with ancient times in general. As such, it was not uncommon for the kings of the Biblical age to be depicted wearing a form of the radiate crown in seventeenth century art (Figs. 2–5). As <persName>David</persName> was one of the greatest of these kings, it is not surprising that he appears wearing this crown in

painting (Figs. 2 and 5) and medallic art (Pl. 3, 15), as well as on several series European coins that also depict him with a harp and in a suspiciously similar pose to that found on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage. These include the psalmenpfennig of the <placeName>Swiss</placeName> city of <placeName>Bern</placeName>, struck in the period 1659–1680 (Pl. 3, 16), the quadrupla scudo d’oro of Pope <persName>Clement X</persName>, issued in 1673 and 1674 (Pl. 3, 17), and the psalmenpfennig of <placeName>Brugg</placeName>, produced from 1750 to 1775 (Pl. 2, 9).<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> In short, the radiate crown is an expected attribute of <persName>David</persName> in the seventeenth century and therefore cannot be taken to signal an intended portrait of <persName>Charles I</persName> on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage.</p>
            <p>More recently, a variant of the crown form argument has been resurrected by <persName>Michael Sharp</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> He suggests that the crown worn by <persName>David</persName> is actually a type known as a celestial, or martyr’s, crown and that it therefore identifies him as <persName>Charles I</persName>, whose execution by Parliament in 1649 gave him holy

martyr status among Royalists. Shortly after his death, a handkerchief soaked in his blood was said to miraculously cure disease, and following the Restoration in 1660 <persName>Charles</persName> was officially canonized as a saint by the Church of <placeName>England</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>While this is an interesting idea, it founders on the fact that David’s crown appears to be the radiate antique type that we have already mentioned rather than the celestial type. Depictions of the celestial crown of <persName>Charles I</persName> in posthumous engravings (Fig. 6) and on a commemorative medal (c. 1695) by John and Norbert Roettier (Pl. 4, 18) clearly show that the rays of this crown type were regularly tipped with shining stars, a feature that is completely absent from David’s crown on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins.<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> Indeed, we should not really expect a celestial crown here.

            <p>send a peculiar message, since the wearer seems to look admiringly at the temporal crown that hovers above the harp. This would be an inversion of the usual martyr iconography for <persName>Charles I</persName>, typified by <persName>William Marshall’s</persName> frontispiece for the first edition (1649) of the anonymous <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</hi> (Fig. 7), a work of royalist propaganda casting the king as a saintly—almost Christ-like—figure suffering at the hands of his own people.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref>
               <persName>Marshall’s</persName> allegorical masterpiece shows the king, having discarded his temporal crown on the ground, holding a crown of thorns while setting his gaze upon a <persName>martyr’s</persName> crown that hovers before him. It would be highly improper for a saint, upon attaining his heavenly reward, to set his gaze upon the trappings of earthly power.</p>
            <p>In 1987, <persName>Michael Hodder</persName> already cast serious doubt on the theory of <persName>Charles I</persName> as <persName>David</persName> by noting the close similarity of the depictions of <persName>David</persName> on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage to images of the Biblical king on the Nuremberg portugaloser and the Brugg psalmenpfennige that we have already seen

(Pl. 2, 8–9).<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> He further suggested that all of the images probably derived from a common prototype, but this seems implausible since the details of <persName>David</persName> even on the two <persName>St. Patrick</persName> denominations differ. We have already mentioned the differences of the beard and hairstyle between the "farthing" and the "halfpenny."</p>
            <p>The general arrangement of the King <persName>David</persName> type for both denominations seems to be roughly modeled after the portugaloser on which <persName>David</persName> kneels playing the harp while gazing heavenward. On the Nuremberg piece, the object of his gaze is the <hi rend="italic">Tetragrammaton</hi> of God’s name surrounded by rays of glory, but on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage this feature is replaced by a temporal crown, not entirely unlike the one that <persName>David</persName> wears on the portugaloser. It may be that the decision to apply the brass splasher to the temporal crown on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage was made in emulation of the shining glory of God depicted on the Nuremberg multiple, as the splasher makes the crown shine in its own way.</p>
            <pb n="55"/>
            <p>The checkerboard floor below <persName>David</persName> on the halfpenny appears to be taken directly from the Nuremberg medal, as Hodder has already pointed out, but the form of the king’s clothing closely follows that of <persName>David</persName> on a Bern psalmenpfennig that was not mentioned by Hodder.<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> On both coins the king wears a cape with a noticeable upturning at the end and a fringe of ermine at the shoulder and along the edge. <persName>David</persName> also wears a distinctive short tunic that reveals his lower leg and the pillow on which he kneels. Also visible on the halfpenny and the Bern psalmenpfennig is a calf-length boot worn by the king.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> "farthings" omit almost all of these details. Here the king still retains his cape, but the ermine has disappeared from the edge and the shoulder. <persName>David</persName> does not wear the short tunic of the "halfpence," but rather a long flowing robe that covers his lower extremities down to his ankle. This form of clothing is somewhat closer in style to that of the king on the Nuremberg portugaloser and the Papal quadrupla scudo, but neither can be said to be a precise match to the farthing. On the Nuremberg piece David’s feet are covered and there is an ermine fringe at the shoulder. On the Papal coin the feet are visible and there is no ermine, as on the farthing, but the folds of the cape and robe are much more animated and the king faces to the right. As an aside we would add that the superior engraving technique and skilful Baroque treatment of <persName>David</persName> on the quadrupla scudi should put to rest the old belief that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage might have been produced by the <placeName>Vatican</placeName> as a means of subventing the Irish Rebellion of 1641–1653.</p>
            <p>It seems improbable that the various Swiss, German, and Papal coins that appear to have provided design elements for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName>s’ <persName>David</persName> type all could have been physically available to the designer of the farthings and halfpence. While it is true that the silver starved Irish economy relied heavily on foreign coins, there is no evidence that Swiss psalmenpfennige, which were actually struck as school prizes rather than as regular coinage, circulated in the kingdom in any kind of quantity. It also seems unlikely that the rare10-ducat portugaloser of Nuremberg could have been easily pulled from circulation to provide a model for Irish coppers. Assuming that the "farthing" was produced as late as the 1670s, it is similarly improbable that quadrupla scudi of Pope <persName>Clement X</persName> would have been immediately at hand. Although his predecessors, <persName>Gregory XIII</persName> and <persName>Innocent X</persName> had financially supported Irish resistance to <placeName>England</placeName> during the Second Desmond

Rebellion (1579–1583) and the Irish Rebellion (1641–1653), respectively, there is no hint that <persName>Clement X</persName> ever attempted to meddle directly in Anglo-Irish affairs during his brief pontificate and therefore there is little reason to expect his silver multiples in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. Indeed, interventions there in the period 1673–1674 would have been politically counterproductive since, in 1673, <persName>James Stuart</persName>, brother of <persName>Charles II</persName> and his probable successor had openly revealed his adherence to the Catholic faith.</p>
            <p>In short, actual coins should be ruled out as the sources for the design elements used to construct the images of <persName>David</persName> for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> "farthings" and "halfpence". Thus, it seems most likely that the designer of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins had access to some sort of model book or books that included engraved images of the several European coin types or other artworks from which they were derived. Almost all of the iconographic elements found on the German, Swiss, and Papal coins, as well as the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series appear in earlier works of art. <persName>David</persName> dressed in the ermine fringed robes of a contemporary medieval or early modern monarch and gazing heavenward can be traced back through the medium of manuscript illumination into the fifteenth century (Fig. 8), if not earlier, indicating an iconographic tradition that was at least 200 years old by the time of the various <persName>David</persName> coin issues of the mid- to late 1600s. It must be stressed, however, that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage is unique, if not daring, in its replacement of the glory of God or an angel that <persName>David</persName> traditionally looks up to with the temporal crown that serves to transform his harp into the badge of the Kingdom of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>David’s</persName> kneeling pose can also be dated to the fifteenth century, when it appears to have been developed as a conflation of two distinct iconographic

types—that of the king playing the harp and the king at prayer. In earlier depictions, <persName>David</persName> usually plays his instrument in a seated rather than a kneeling position.</p>
            <p>Even the decoration of <persName>David’s</persName> harp with a semi-nude winged female figure on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage was ultimately inspired by an artistic tradition in which the harp was given a face and sometimes wings. This sort of embellishment was added to symbolize the music that came from the harp and had the power to drive out the demons that plagued King <persName>Saul</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref> The head appears in painting and engravings of the seventeenth century and continued to be in vogue during the eighteenth century (Figs. 9–10).

The <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage charts a slightly different course by employing a full female figure, but its connection to contemporary models is unmistakable.</p>
            <p>Having now reviewed the several theories claiming that the image of <persName>David</persName> on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage is actually that of King <persName>Charles I</persName> and

having looked at the contemporary artistic and numismatic evidence, it seems that there is no iconographic indication that the harper-king is anyone other than King <persName>David</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">as himself.</hi> Whether contemporary coinusers may have interpreted the type as depicting <persName>Charles I</persName> is entirely another matter and cannot be addressed in the absence of documentary evidence.

            <p>It is hoped that in some small way, like the great Irish saint, whose most celebrated miracle was the driving of the snakes out of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, the discussion presented here has at last managed to drive out an interpretive fallacy that has now bedevilled the coinage that bears his name for over a century.</p>

            <p>Remarkably, even the most basic facts about the so-called <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings and halfpence (Figs. 1–2)<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> have eluded numismatists for more than three centuries. When and how were they made? Where, by whom and at whose command? How were they distributed, used and valued? Given the turbulent environment out of which the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage emerged, it is possible that a definitive solution to any one of these basic questions might quickly lead to the solution of them all. Thus, anyone working to solve the mysteries runs the risk of instantly having his or her work quickly become obsolete.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, with the objective of stimulating new research and discussion, this two-part paper begins with an overview of theories about the dating and origins of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins. It concludes with an introduction to <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName>, a seventeenth century inventor-knight who may or may not have had a hand in producing the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage, but whose actions are at least worthy of further study.</p>

               <p>Queen <persName>Elizabeth’s</persName> conquest of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> at the turn of the sixteenth century left scars that never have healed. Under <persName>James I</persName>, large numbers of Englishmen and Scots began emigrating to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, to seek a better life. The English Crown made it easy for the colonists to displace Irish landholders, in much the same way that North American Indians were later removed from their ancestral lands. Discrimination against the native Irish increased as the colonial government in Dublin gained power. Old Irish traditions and powerful clans were losing their influence. <placeName>Ireland</placeName> became increasingly divided along ethnic and religious lines.</p>
               <p>The situation exploded with the Ulster Rebellion of 1641, which began as a popular uprising by Irish Catholic peasants, spurred by the local aristocracy. It was met with harsh reprisals from the colonial government in Dublin. To regain control, in 1642, the Catholic aristocracy formed an alternative confederation government that existed for six years. This Catholic Confederation held Kilkenny as its seat of government.</p>

               <p>Meanwhile, <persName>Charles I</persName> was embroiled in the English Civil War and was forced to soften his anti-Catholic views. He began courting the Confederation for its military resources. Throughout the 1640s, <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was a seething, violent mix of discontented factions: Royalists, rebelling Puritans, Catholics and the old Irish who clung to their traditions and wanted to rid the country of foreign interlopers. During this period, the Vatican supported its Irish flock by periodically sending emissaries and aid in various forms.</p>
               <p>Finally, in 1650, the year after <persName>Charles I’s</persName> beheading, <persName>Oliver Cromwell</persName> pacified <placeName>Ireland</placeName> with a crushing invasion. Before the long conflict, two-thirds of good Irish land was owned by Catholics. By 1660 and the Restoration of <persName>Charles II</persName>, land ownership was two-thirds Protestant.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref>
                  <persName>Charles II</persName> knew that the ruinous state of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> presented an untenable situation and began efforts to rebuild the country.</p>

               <p>By almost every account, the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage was conceived and produced during the reign of one of these two Kings <persName>Charles</persName>. The tasks at hand are to discover when and under what specific circumstances the coins originated and how they came into the hands of the man who brought them to <placeName>America</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Regardless of the controversial date of manufacture, it is generally agreed that <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins first came to <placeName>America</placeName> through the agency of <persName>Mark Newby</persName> (or <persName>Newbie</persName>) late in 1681. <persName>Newby</persName> was born to Quaker parents in <placeName>Earsdon</placeName>, <placeName>Northumberland</placeName>, <placeName>England</placeName>. In 1662, at about twenty-four years of age, he moved to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> with his parents in order to escape religious persecution in their native <placeName>England</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Within a year, <persName>Mark Newby</persName> had married <persName>Elizabeth Bridge Wilbre</persName>, a widow of County <persName>Kilkenny</persName>. By 1672, she, her three children by her first marriage, and two by <persName>Newby</persName>, were all dead. <persName>Newby</persName> waited two years, and then married <persName>Hannah Holmes</persName>, who bore him four children. The new family settled first in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, but then moved to nearby County <placeName>Wicklow</placeName>. <persName>Mark Newby</persName> was a tallow chandler by trade, and a broker of the waste and surplus fat produced by butchers for makers of soap, candles, and the like.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref>
               </p>
               <p>On September 19, 1681, <persName>Mark</persName>, <persName>Hannah</persName>, and their children left County <persName>Wicklow</persName> for <placeName>America</placeName>’s <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> aboard a pink (a type of narrow-sterned sailing ship) called the <hi rend="italic">Owners Adventure.</hi> With them were a number of Quaker Friends, including <persName>William Bates</persName>, <persName>Thomas Thackara</persName>, <persName>George Goldsmith</persName>, and <persName>Thomas Sharp</persName>. <persName>Newby</persName> and his companions arrived at the Capes of <placeName>Delaware</placeName> on November 18, 1681. They landed at <placeName>Elsinburg</placeName> and there waited out the winter. When the weather improved, they bought a boat and used it to search the Third Tenth (an area that had been reserved by West
<pb n="69"/>
Jersey’s commissioners for proprietors coming from <placeName>Ireland</placeName>) for a favorable place to settle. They found and purchased a tract on <placeName>Newton Creek</placeName>, near what is now <placeName>Camden</placeName>, <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>. In time, the settlement grew to become the town of <placeName>Newton</placeName> as birds of Newby’s feather, small merchants, merchant craftsmen, and shopkeepers, flocked to the area.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As an early arrival, land-holder, and associate of <persName>Anthony Sharp</persName>, <persName>Thomas Sharp’s</persName> powerful Quaker uncle from <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, <persName>Newby</persName> quickly became an influential citizen of <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>. Early in 1682, he was chosen to serve in the General Assembly. However, his roles as pioneer and civic leader are not nearly as interesting as the cargo that he carried on the <hi rend="italic">Owners Adventure.</hi> A May 8, 1682, Act of the <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> General Assembly reveals the contents of <persName>Newby’s</persName> stash,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <persName>Mark Newby’s</persName> halfpence, called <persName>Patrick’s</persName> halfpence, shall from and after the said eighteenth instant pass for halfpence current pay of this province, provided he the said Mark give sufficient security to the speaker of this house, for the use of the General Assembly, from time to time being that he the said Mark, his executors and administrators, shall and will change the said halfpence for pay equivalent upon demand and provided also that no person or persons be hereby obligated to take more than five shillings in one payment.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The legislation established several firsts: It gave <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> its first coinage, gave <placeName>America</placeName> its first official copper coinage, and made <persName>Mark Newby</persName> one of the first bankers in the region.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> To ensure that he lived up to his end of the bargain, <persName>Newby</persName> was required to post three hundred acres of land as security.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>Newby</persName> was selected to serve another term on the General Assembly in May 1683. However, <persName>Thomas Thackara</persName> replaced him on September 8, 1683, apparently because <persName>Newby</persName> had died. An inventory of <persName>Newby’s</persName> estate is dated September 4, 1684. In all likelihood, a period of one year from the day of <persName>Newby</persName> death was allowed for redemption of the remaining coins from circulation.<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref> Among other articles, <persName>Newby</persName> estate contained a small iron furnace, some brass and pewter, a pair of scales with weights, three sieves, and some silver plate. These were all instruments that could have been part of a mint operation.<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref> The sheer numbers of farthing dies, however, point to a substantial enterprise. <persName>Newby</persName> small accumulation of hardware and supplies would have constituted only a small portion of the required equipment. Thus, it is unlikely that <persName>Newby</persName> was actually running a mint in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>. Even so, he could have been associated in some way with a mint in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. Indeed, such a direct association is one possible explanation for <persName>Newby</persName> acquisition of the coppers.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>John Lorenzo</persName> has suggested that <persName>Anthony Sharp</persName>, the prominent <placeName>Dublin</placeName> wool merchant and Quaker, helped engineer the <hi rend="italic">Owners Adventure</hi> journey and that <persName>Newby</persName> was only a pawn. He further argued that <persName>Sharp</persName> had access to important figures whom <persName>Newby</persName> would not have known and that these same men might have provided the opportunity to acquire the coppers.<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref>
                  <persName>Sharp</persName> also made numerous attempts at programs to help Dublin’s poor.<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> Could the coppers have been part of one of his plans? <persName>Sharp</persName> was a shareholder in the <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> colony, but never made the journey to the New World. Instead, he sent his nephew, <persName>Thomas Sharp</persName>, who came with <persName>Newby</persName>, to attend to his affairs. It also appears that <persName>Newby</persName> appointment to the General Assembly might have been as <persName>Anthony Sharp’s</persName> personal representative. Barring some new revelation, however, no real reason to doubt <persName>Newby</persName> having acted on his own is known. Perhaps some long forgotten family papers will someday be discovered and the puzzle of his involvement
<pb n="71"/>
will be solved. Records of Quaker meetings held in <persName>Newby</persName> home or at those of his neighbors, might also hold clues.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>St. Patrick</persName> halfpence are several times as scarce as the farthings. Accordingly, halfpence die varieties number about thirty, while farthing varieties exceed two-hundred and fifty, from more than four hundred dies.<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> Oddly, many of these varieties are known by only one or two survivors. Why so many varieties exist and why many of them are so rare are unknown. Farthing mintages must have been much higher than those of the halfpence. Again, why? Were the halfpence part of a small, early production run made before their weights were reduced, when it became clear that profits were too low? If this were true, then both sizes of coins should be regarded as halfpence.<ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> Even the smaller <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers are at least ten times as heavy as the patent farthings of the 1613 to 1644 period and <persName>Sir Thomas Armstrong’s</persName> farthings of 1660 and 1661. At 80 to 112.8 grains, <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings are even heavier than regal farthings that debuted in 1672.<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref> Such heavy weight tends to suggest an official coinage rather than a token issue.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, <persName>St. Patrick</persName> halfpence weights vary between 120 and 176½ grains.<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref> Most fall within the 130 to 140 grain range, which is not out of line with what one would expect from a later regal Irish halfpenny. These weight variances seem great for coins produced under any sort of royal auspices and might imply that a degree of experimentation took place. The variances might also indicate limited official sanction and, hence, no strenuously enforced weight standards. Given that the farthings are generally made on poorer quality planchets, two completely different copper sources might have been used.<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref>
                  <placeName>Sweden</placeName> supplied much of the copper used in Europe during the latter part of the seventeenth century, while the English copper industry struggled. If Swedish copper was used for some of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, then the differences in size may be due to a change in the availability of planchets or raw copper. It might be that halfpence were
<pb n="72"/>
made from Swedish or other high grade copper while farthings were from domestic sources of lesser quality.</p>

                  <persName>Sylvester Crosby</persName>, <persName>Edward Maris</persName> and <persName>Aquilla Smith</persName>, the dean of nineteenth century Irish numismatists, all offered similar litanies of early sources that assign the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins to various periods. The earliest source of which any of them were aware was John Evelyn’s <hi rend="italic">Numismata: A Discourse of Medals, Antient and Modern. Together with some Account of Heads and Effigies of Illustrious, and Famous Persons, in Sculps, and Taille-Douce, of Whom we have no Medals extant and Of the Use to be derived from them. To which is added A Digression concerning Physiognomy</hi> (<placeName>London</placeName>, 1697). In this work, Evelyn categorized the silver pieces as medals and associated them with the reign of <persName>Charles II</persName> (1660–1685).<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref> Another 1697 reference, of which <persName>Crosby</persName>, <persName>Maris</persName>, and <persName>Smith</persName> were probably unaware, comes from <persName>John Sharp</persName>, the Archbishop of <placeName>York</placeName>. <persName>Sharp</persName> described the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins as money rather than as medals, but expressed uncertainty as to the time of their issue.<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref>
                  <persName>Ralph Thoresby</persName>, an antiquarian who inherited a substantial coin cabinet and then built it up even more, may have been the first writer to assume original circulation as halfpence and farthings when he described the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage in 1715. <persName>Thoresby</persName> also concurred with the <persName>Charles II</persName> dating.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>Walter Harris</persName>, in his 1745 publication of <persName>James Ware’s</persName> works, assigned the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins to the <persName>Charles II</persName> period. He also may have been the first to call out the fact that the Arms of <placeName>Dublin</placeName> appears on the halfpence. He
<pb n="73"/>
agrees with Evelyn that the silver pieces are medals, aided in his conviction by the observation that two silver examples he had seen, from the same dies as the copper pieces, were milled. Since copper coins were never milled, he concluded that all must represent medals.<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Other circumstances point to circulation in the 1670s and to a possible origin in the same period. <persName>Michael Dolley</persName> concluded that <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers were minted in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> as part of a movement away from underweight tokens and toward larger coins with metal content that approximated their respective face values in the late eighteenth century.<ref target="#CH3-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins circulated on the Isle of Man at least until 1679 when the Manx legislature demonetized them. <persName>Brian Danforth</persName> provided a possible explanation for Manx circulation by noting the connection between <persName>James Butler</persName>, <persName>Lord Ormond</persName>, who served as <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName> of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, and the Earls of <placeName>Derby</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>Michael Hodder</persName> cited the arms of <placeName>Dublin</placeName> on halfpence reverses as an indication of co-existence with tokens issued around 1675. Moreover, at least one <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthing was found in the wreck of the yacht <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Mary</persName>
                  </hi> that sank in March 1675, confirming existence of the coppers by the mid–1670s.<ref target="#CH3-n24">24</ref> By then, early regal halfpence and farthings were circulating in <placeName>England</placeName> and could have provided a basic weight model for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Aquilla Smith</persName> was also in the <persName>Charles II</persName> camp. He examined the relative weights of the copper specimens and noted that the weights specified by the Confederation for its copper coinage do not line up with those of the <persName>St. Patrick coppers</persName>. By <persName>Smith’s</persName> calculations, a Confederation halfpenny was to be minted at ninety grains, or sixty-four to the Troy pound (5,760 grains). It is worth noting that the specifications of the Confederation do not work within the 7,000 grain avoirdupois pound standard either. Based
<pb n="74"/>
on this standard, a Confederation halfpenny would have to weigh 109.375 grains.</p>
               <p>Ninety grains fits within the ninety to ninety-six grain range that Leake observed for <persName>St. Patrick</persName> halfpence, but is outside the 130 to 135 grain range that he cited for <persName>St. Patrick</persName> halfpence. <persName>Smith</persName> used these findings, the pronounced differences in style between the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers and those known to have been made by the Confederation, and the apparent suspension of private tokens in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> between 1659 and 1663 as evidence to conclude that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers were produced as private tokens at some time between 1660 and 1680.<ref target="#CH3-n25">25</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As for the differences between Confederation issues and <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, with their brass splashers and edge markings, seem to have been made with the intent of vexing counterfeiters. No such features are found on specie of the Catholic Confederation. Why would the same authority go to the trouble of making a predominantly copper issue difficult to counterfeit and not do so for its specie?</p>
               <p>The fact that <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings typically weigh about two-thirds as much as the halfpence led <persName>J. Earl Massey</persName> to call the halfpence three-farthings pieces and <persName>Sylvester Crosby</persName> to suggest a use other than as coinage.<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref>
                  <persName>Philip Mossman</persName> noted that, since profit was an ever-present concern and heavier coins meant less profit, it is unlikely that deliberately overweight farthings were produced. It is quite possible, therefore, that a relationship other than halfpenny to farthing was intended.<ref target="#CH3-n27">27</ref> If the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings are treated as halfpence, then their weights roughly align with the Confederation’s standards. In this case, <persName>Massey</persName> could be correct in calling the larger <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins three-farthing pieces. However, the Confederation called only for halfpence and farthings. Thus, the direct production of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins by the Confederation seems unlikely.</p>
               <p>It is worth noting that <placeName>West Jersey’s</placeName> act of authorization offers no clarification of this issue since it names the coins as halfpence, but fails to say which of the two sizes were to be used. Since any coins were welcome
<pb n="75"/>
in <placeName>America</placeName>, the cask might have contained both sizes and any distinction between them might have been an accidental and irrelevant omission.<ref target="#CH3-n28">28</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Until December 2002, the foregoing described most of what was known about the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers as artifacts of the Restoration. Then <persName>Brian Danforth</persName> introduced a significant body of new research that, while not universally accepted, dramatically challenged the numismatic world’s view of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage. <persName>Danforth’s</persName> theory is discussed below, in another context.</p>

               <p>In 1726 <persName>Stephen Leake</persName> narrowed the period of issue down to around 1641 and argued that the coins were struck by, "Papists, when they rebelled in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> and massacred the Protestants, pretending to act under the King’s authority." <persName>Leake</persName> may have been the first to note the relative weights of the two sizes of coppers as well as the first to suggest that they were coins authorized by the Catholic Confederation.<ref target="#CH3-n30">30</ref> Other writers, such as <persName>Simon</persName> and <persName>Humphrey</persName>, joined <persName>Leake</persName> and <persName>Nicholson</persName> in asserting a date of 1641 or 1642 and an association with the Confederation.<ref target="#CH3-n31">31</ref>

                  <persName>Maris</persName> sided with the <persName>Charles I</persName> camp. <persName>Maris</persName> reports that he became convinced of this dating when he viewed uncirculated specimens whose kings, in his opinion, indisputably depicted <persName>Charles I</persName>. He further argued that, being unauthorized, the coins would have been slow to enter circulation and, consequently, large numbers of them could have survived for the four decades between the rebellion and <persName>Newby</persName> arrival in <placeName>America</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n33">33</ref> Always the diplomat, <persName>Sylvester Crosby</persName> chose to give his opinion indirectly, rather than to "decide where doctors disagree," by saying that the quantities that <persName>Newby</persName> had brought with him were sufficiently large to imply that <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers were minted not long before he brought them to <placeName>America</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n34">34</ref> Thus, <persName>Crosby</persName> used some of <persName>Maris’</persName> evidence, but to support an opposing view.</p>
               <p>Over a century later, <persName>Walter Breen</persName> followed <persName>Maris’</persName> lead in associating the coins with <persName>Charles I</persName>, but added the nuance that the coins were made at the Tower Mint, at the hands of <persName>Nicholas Briot</persName>, an engraver most active in the 1640s. This attribution was based on stylistic similarities and punch links between the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers and other Briot efforts. <persName>Breen</persName> associated the coins with the courting of Irish Confederation mercenaries from the Ulster Rebellion to fight against Cromwell and his Parliamentary allies. <persName>Charles</persName> needed a way to pay his hired troops. If this were the case, then possession of such coins would have been an act of treason during the Commonwealth period and they would almost certainly have disappeared from circulation, at least until 1660, when the monarchy was restored.</p>

<pb n="77"/>
considerable attention in recent discussion groups and may prove to be the key to unraveling the mystery. <persName>Cane</persName> concluded that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage was minted on the continent of <placeName>Europe</placeName> and then shipped to <placeName>Kilkenny</placeName> for use by the Confederation. He proposed to call the coins "Rinuccini Confederate money," after <persName>Giovanni Battista Rinuccini</persName>, the former Archbishop of <placeName>Fermo</placeName>, who was sent as papal nuncio to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in 1645. It is known that <persName>Rinuccini</persName> brought arms, ammunition, and money. Though the money needed most was specie, Cane believed that <persName>Rinuccini</persName> brought the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers for use by the army of the Catholic Confederation.</p>
               <p>A number of research avenues have opened based on the ideas that <persName>Cane</persName> espoused. Among these are the possibilities that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins were minted at the Vatican or in a country sympathetic to the Catholic cause and the possibility that skilled coiners could have been brought to <persName>Kilkenny</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n36">36</ref>

               <p>The obverse legend FLOREAT: REX: ("May the King Prosper") is shared by both <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coin types and is also somewhat ambiguous as to its subject. If the coins were sent from the <placeName>Vatican</placeName> or made by the Irish Catholic Confederation, then the meanings of the devices and legend might be somewhat different from the obvious. That is, they could mean "May the king prosper [only if he submits to the authority of the church in <placeName>Rome</placeName>]." Some analogy to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins may be seen in the seal of the Confederation, which includes depictions of a crown, a harp, and a dove. The seal’s dominant features, a cross and a flaming heart, however, never appear on known coins of the Irish Confederation.</p>
               <p>If Swedish copper were indeed used to make the halfpence, then the existence of two sizes might also imply two entirely different production dates since <placeName>Sweden’s</placeName> dominance of the European copper industry came after 1670.</p>

               <p>Recent work by <persName>Oliver Hoover</persName> has added significantly to the numismatic community’s understanding of the coins’ iconography. No attempt will be made here to interpret the meaning of the symbols on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins.</p>
               <pb n="78"/>
               <p>However, in the hope that contemporary appearances of similar motifs may aid in dating the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, some such examples are presented.</p>
               <p>Smith and others alluded to a 1619 engraving by <persName>Leonard Gaultier</persName> (Fig. 3) with many symbols analogous to those on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings as a possible inspiration for the motif of the "farthing." <persName>Gaultier’s</persName> engraving appears in <persName>Thomas Messingham’s</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Florilegium Insulae Sanctorum</hi> (<placeName>Paris</placeName>, 1624). Both the engraving and the "farthings" feature <persName>St. Patrick</persName> in the foreground, driving out a small dragon and a host of "serpents." A church appears in the distance, behind <persName>St. Patrick</persName> and to his right. In the engraving, he is surrounded by a flock of praying followers. The eight to the saint’s right are men, while the five to his left are women. They appear not as peasants, but as well-dressed citizens. The robed and haloed saint raises his right hand in an expression of blessing. He wears a double-peaked bishop’s mitre and carries a staff that is topped with a double-beamed, metropolitan or Lorraine cross. An angel flies above, carrying a scroll bearing the Latin legend, <hi rend="italic">Haec est vox Hibernigenarium</hi> ("Here [in <persName>St. Patrick</persName>] is the voice of the Irish"). Another scroll, above, reads, <hi rend="italic">Veni adiuua nos</hi> ("Come [and] help us").</p>
               <p>Although neither type used for the coppers is exactly like the engraving, only one other known, contemporary depiction of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> is as similar. That reference appeared on merchant tokens made for Richard Grenwood, of <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, around 1660. Such tokens were usually denominated as farthings and were in common use between 1653 and 1672. The devices on one side of <persName>Grenwood’s</persName> token depict the saint almost exactly as he appears on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings, raising the question of which came first. If <persName>Grenwood’s</persName> token imitated circulating <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins in the manner that hard times and Civil War tokens imitated <persName>U.S.</persName> cents in the nineteenth century, then <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers must have existed prior to the Restoration. In the other scenario, <persName>Grenwood’s</persName> tokens were made first, then <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers were made after the Restoration. In either case, it is likely that the <persName>Gaultier</persName> engraving either was influential in the design of both <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers and <persName>Grenwood tokens</persName>, or that all three shared a common inspiration.</p>
               <p>On the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings, the church appears to the saint’s left and his right hand is extended outward, palm-up. The church is absent from the halfpence, having been replaced by a shield that bears the arms of

                  <placeName>Dublin</placeName>. Behind the shield is a group of followers, again segregated by gender. More followers watch <persName>St. Patrick</persName> from his right side. Their numbers vary, with six to eight men and three or four women. The legend above <persName>St. Patrick</persName> and his followers reads ECCE GREX ("Behold the Flock"). The followers are missing from the farthings and the legend is changed to QVIESCAT PLEBS ("Let the People be at Peace") an appropriate mantra for the besieged <persName>Charles I</persName>, but one that could also refer to Restoration era attempts to pacify and rebuild <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.</p>
               <p>On the farthings, the <persName>saint’s</persName> staff is topped by a double-beamed cross, as in the engraving. On the halfpence, however, the staff ends in a <persName>shepherd’s</persName>
                  <pb n="80"/>
crook and the <persName>saint’s</persName> right hand holds a shamrock or trefoil such as that with which <persName>St. Patrick</persName> allegedly taught his followers about the Trinity. On rare farthing varieties, <persName>St. Patrick</persName> is depicted with a nimbus, or halo, as in the engraving.</p>
               <p>The church depicted on the engraving and on the farthings may be the one that stood at <placeName>Armagh</placeName> and was built on or near the site of <persName>Patrick’s</persName> original church. <persName>St. Patrick</persName> is said to have been given the crozier of Christ and to have kept it in the church at <placeName>Armagh</placeName>. Even earlier, <placeName>Armagh</placeName> was an important regional capital of Celtic <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. The church in <persName>Gaultier’s</persName> engraving is surrounded by a wall and has a bell tower in front of it. Its surroundings are rural, the landscape rolling and wooded. Whether these features were literal or merely intended to convey pastoral calm is uncertain. Contemporary images of Irish churches might help to reveal the identity of the structure depicted by <persName>Gaultier</persName>. That halfpence refer to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> and farthings to a possible other location could support the theory of two distinct issues.</p>
               <p>Even if the serpents, lizards, and dragons on the farthings can be explained away as beasts driven from <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, two creatures remain to vex our understanding. The first is a four-winged bird that flies ahead of the saint. Such a creature appears to have been rare or non-existent in Irish lore. However, the <hi rend="italic">Book of Armagh,</hi> a very early illuminated version of the Gospels, depicts <persName>St. Mark</persName> as a four-winged eagle.</p>
               <p>For centuries, <placeName>Dublin</placeName> was represented by three flaming watch towers that punctuated a city wall. The flames symbolized zeal for the defense of the city. In time, the three towers evolved into three full castles, with towers at each of their ends. These symbols appear in an oval shield on <persName>St. Patrick</persName> halfpence.</p>
               <p>The king depicted as both coins’ central obverse device is by many accounts, the Biblical King <persName>David</persName>, kneeling while he plays an Irish harp and gazes up at a crown that floats in the heavens. On some halfpence varieties, the king kneels on a tiled or checkerboard floor. When this feature is represented on farthings, the coins’ reduced size causes the tiles’ shapes to be distended. <persName>Breen</persName> mistook these odd shapes for creatures, calling them

               <p>A figure very like the obverse king appears in a booklet associated with <persName>Charles I</persName>. <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</hi> ("The Royal Image") is apparently a combination of <persName>Charles’s</persName> own attempts to justify his actions and efforts by others to pay him tribute. Its frontispiece depicts a kneeling king without a harp, gazing upward at a glowing heavenly crown. His earthly crown lays forsaken on the floor beside him (Fig. 5). The engraving was done by <persName>William Marshal</persName>, an artist at the court of <persName>Charles I</persName>, and is believed to have been inspired by <persName>Titian’s</persName> painting of <persName>St. Catherine</persName> in prayer before a crucified Christ (Fig. 6). <persName>Titian’s</persName> painting was part of <persName>Charles I’s</persName> personal collection. If <persName>Marshal’s</persName> engraving were the only image of a kneeling king from the period, one might conclude, as did Breen and others, that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers depict <persName>Charles I</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n41">41</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="84"/>
               <p>However, the truth may be more complex. The floating heavenly crown in the <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</hi> frontispiece is an eastern, or Jerusalem crown that has a Star of <persName>David</persName> at each of its points. The cast-aside crown is that of an earthly king. On the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers, however, the crown types are reversed. This led <persName>Oliver Hoover</persName> to propose that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers depict <persName>David</persName> and that their association with <persName>Charles I</persName> is at best unsupported and at worst simply a wrong conclusion.<ref target="#CH3-n42">42</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Old Testament King <persName>David</persName> is depicted playing his harp on countless images that date back many centuries (e.g., in the ninth century Utrecht Psalter). In <persName>George Withers’s</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Collection of Emblems: Ancient and Modern</hi> (<placeName>London</placeName>, 1635) (Fig. 7), and elsewhere, <persName>David</persName> plays a harp and gazes at God’s glory from the same position as the king on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins. The text below Withers’ emblem describes the Lord’s love of music and harmony.</p>
               <p>Legend punctuation varies significantly on the farthings. In some cases, nothing or a simple colon follows REX. On other varieties, the end punctuation is a group of three periods arranged in a triangular pattern (∴) that is called "Masonic" by <persName>Breen</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n43">43</ref> Other varieties have as their end punctuation a string of four stars (two large followed by two small) or three or more stars in order of descending size.</p>
               <p>Nor is the obverse side without interesting symbols. On many farthing varieties, nothing appears below the king, but at least three have what looks like an "8" or a pair of annulets in that position. Others depict a small bird or martlet below the king. A rare variety even places a bird above the king. These mysterious symbols may be akin to mintmarks or <hi rend="italic">differents</hi> used to identify multiple mints or die makers. The large number of farthing die varieties certainly supports this idea. Alternatively, the multitude of varieties may be the result of local mintages for use as communion tokens or parish membership "cards."</p>

               </head>
               <p>With so much uncertainty, any new piece of information, however unlikely it is to contain the absolute answers, is worthy of exploration. Such is the
<pb n="85"/>
case with information surrounding the Englishman, <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName>, whose attempts to gain the coining privilege present a curious set of circumstances. At the present time it is impossible to be certain that <persName>Ford’s</persName> petitions can be directly related to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers, but the possibility is introduced here in the hope of inspiring further research on his coining activities.</p>
               <p>Although summarizing or paraphrasing <persName>Danforth’s</persName> very thorough and well-reasoned work cannot do justice to its details, the crux of it is that he believes the probable period of issue to have been from 1667 to 1669, when <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was being rebuilt after the ravages of the Commonwealth era and the violence that preceded it. He asserts that <persName>James Butler</persName>, <persName>Lord Ormond</persName>, as <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName> over the government in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, sought to create a stable coinage for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> and was supported in this endeavor by <persName>Charles I</persName>, to whom Ormond had remained loyal. <persName>Danforth</persName> further asserts that, to accomplish this, Ormond turned to an innovative Royal Mint engineer, <persName>Peter</persName> (<persName>Pierre</persName>) <persName>Blondeau</persName> for help. <persName>Blondeau</persName>, a Frenchman, followed in the footsteps of his countryman, <persName>Eloye Mestrelle</persName>. (<persName>Mestrelle</persName> had tried unsuccessfully to convert the Royal Mint from hammering to milling in the 1560s.) <persName>Blondeau</persName>, who had worked with <persName>Nicholas Briot</persName>, came to <placeName>England</placeName> a century after <persName>Mestrelle</persName> with a new anti-counterfeiting technology of which only he had knowledge. <persName>Blondeau</persName> found that he could use an oversized screw press to impart reeding or other edge designs in one step, a dramatic improvement over methods that used a separate edging process.<ref target="#CH3-n44">44</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In <placeName>England</placeName>, the absence of small change necessitated the use of private merchant tokens, municipal tokens, counterfeits and cut pieces to fill the void. These surrogate coinages were lightweight and were typically devalued when it came time to redeem them. Many people, especially the poor, were badly shorted in these exchanges. Moreover, a token’s acceptance was limited to the specific area in which it was produced and was, therefore, a poor substitute for officially sanctioned coinage.</p>
               <p>If the problem was serious in <placeName>England</placeName>, it was catastrophic in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, where many of the tokens in circulation were English rejects. The proposed solution for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was another round of patent farthings such as those introduced under <persName>James I</persName> and <persName>Charles I</persName>. The patent was given to <persName>Sir Thomas</persName>
                  <pb n="86"/>
                  <persName>Armstrong</persName> in 1660. <persName>Ormond</persName> and others were very much opposed to this approach and ultimately succeeded in bringing about its demise. He knew that something better was needed to reduce Irish dependency on light weight tokens and English whims. <persName>Danforth</persName> asserts that <persName>Blondeau</persName> held the answer, partly because he was the only person who possessed the technology to economically coin counterfeit-resistant coppers, such as the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage.<ref target="#CH3-n45">45</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Many of the details of this theory are convincing. However, in the natural course of critical review, others have begun to raise doubts about some of <persName>Danforth’s</persName> findings. In a search of further evidence that would either support or refute his theory, the present author discovered an often overlooked knight-engineer who, during the same rough time period, sought to create a counterfeit-resistant copper coinage for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. The surviving information about the knight, <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName>, that might potentially connect him to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers is far from conclusive. Nevertheless, his story deserves further research even if it ultimately fails to offer the "smoking gun" for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers.</p>
               <p>Although many entries in the journals of Parliament refer to the affairs of the Royal Mint and <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, mentions of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins are conspicuously absent. Moreover, <persName>Samuel Pepys</persName>, a prominent civil servant under <persName>Charles II</persName>, was associated with <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName>, <persName>Pierre Blondeau</persName> and the machinations of the Royal Mint. <persName>Pepys</persName> kept a very detailed diary that dwells at length on money and mints. Yet, he too made no note of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage. It is unlikely that an operation capable of producing large numbers of dies and coins, using a revolutionary new process, would have escaped <persName>Pepys’s</persName> curiosity and pen.</p>
               <p>For this author, the new adventure began innocently with <persName>Thomas Coonan’s</persName> 1954 work, <hi rend="italic">The Irish Catholic Confederacy and the Puritan Revolution.</hi> Coonan wrote that the Confederation government, to relieve the scarcity of coin and as a show of "concord between <persName>Charles I</persName> and the Irish people," established a mint for half-crowns and coppers, specifically the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers.<ref target="#CH3-n46">46</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="87"/>
               <p>At first glance, Coonan appears to confirm the 1641 to 1642 mintage period and the Catholic Confederation as the origin for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers, though the subject does not seem to be mentioned elsewhere in his book. It might be easier to accept <persName>Coonan’s</persName> "obvious" conclusion were it not for the fact that coins known to have been made by the Kilkenny government are so different from the <persName>St. Patrick</persName>s. Moreover, as noted by <persName>Smith</persName>, the weights of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins do not match up with those authorized by the Kilkenny government.<ref target="#CH3-n47">47</ref> Could <persName>Coonan</persName> have seen references to the Catholic Confederation’s mint, examined examples of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers and, possessing no other information, erroneously assumed that the two were the same?</p>
               <p>As contemporary sources, <persName>Coonan</persName> quotes <persName>Thomas Carte</persName> and <persName>Richard Bellings</persName>. This author obtained an electronic copy of one Coonan source, <persName>Carte’s</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">History of the Life of <persName>James</persName>, Duke of <placeName>Ormonde</placeName>; containing an account of the most remarkable affairs of his time, and particularly of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> under his government: With an appendix and a Collection of Letters,</hi> in which the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins receive no mention. The Carte papers, which Coonan also quotes, are accessible electronically, in calendar form, at the website for the Access to Archives (A2A) program and Oxford University’s Bodleian Library, Special Collections and Western Manuscripts Department (Access to Archives). So far, no undeniable reference to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers has been found in the Carte papers. If <persName>Coonan’s</persName> conclusions about <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins were actually based on early source material then that material must be contained in <persName>Bellings’</persName> work, which is itself rare and has thus far eluded this author.</p>
               <p>Perhaps another explanation for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins exists. The Carte Papers contain a very interesting 1664 petition by <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName>:</p>

               <p>Several aspects of <persName>Ford’s</persName> petition are worth noting:</p>
               <list type="bulleted">
                  <item rend="hang">His tokens are differentiated from <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> "comon" or "ordonary" farthings in three ways: 1) They are made through a newly invented process. Might the new process refer to the use of splashers or to the edge-reeding of base metal coinage? 2) The new method prevents counterfeiting. 3) The new proposal has a formal mechanism for redeeming the tokens, thereby making them superior both to <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> farthings and to "unlycensed" tradesmen tokens.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">His tokens are to include both three- and two-farthing denominations. Given that the relative weights of the two sizes of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> copper coins hover around the ratio of 3:2, it is conceivable that they could represent the three- and two-farthing denominations that are mentioned in <persName>Ford’s</persName> proposal. Even if not, the proposal suggests that a three-farthing was being considered at the time.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">His tokens are made of copper "or" brass. Unfortunately, the petition does not say "copper with a brass splasher." Nor does it say "copper and brass." Both metals were used to describe tokens and coinage of the period.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">The "<persName>Lord Liutenat</persName>," presumably referring to Ormond, is satisfied with at least the anti-counterfeiting qualities of <persName>Ford’s</persName> proposal.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">
                     <persName>Ford</persName> asks for the same terms as were given to <persName>Sir Thomas Armstrong</persName> in 1660. Although <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> patent was supposed to have a term of twenty years, his farthings, which were similar in form to earlier <persName>Harrington</persName>, <persName>Lennox</persName>, <persName>Richmond</persName>, <persName>Maltravers</persName> and "rose" pieces, were apparently never minted in large quantities.
<pb n="90"/>
Their light weights, alone, bred rejection and could have opened the door for a new, more substantial issue.</item>
                  <item rend="hang">
                     <persName>Ford’s</persName> proposal promises to give the Irish "extraordinary content." Could this be the peace alluded to by <persName>St. Patrick</persName> "farthings" with the motto QVIESCAT PLEBS?</item>

               <p>
                  <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName>, the first son of <persName>Sir William</persName> and <persName>Anna Ford</persName>, was born around 1605 at <placeName>Up Park</placeName>, <placeName>Harting Parish</placeName>, <placeName>West Sussex</placeName> (Fig. 9). The Fords were an old Devonshire family that had grown prosperous in the wool trade and, by 1546, had begun building their estate at <placeName>Up Park</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n49">49</ref> For the next century and a half, they were involved in countless real estate transactions in and around Harting.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Sir William Ford</persName> was known as the "soape projector."<ref target="#CH3-n50">50</ref> That is, he promoted soap. <persName>Mark Newby</persName>, the tallow chandler who brought <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins to <placeName>America</placeName>, was only about eight years old when <persName>Sir William</persName> died in 1646. Nevertheless, the tallow and soap trades might have afforded them shared acquaintances.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Sir Edward’s</persName> mother was the daughter of <persName>Sir Edward Caryll</persName>, of <placeName>West Harting</placeName>. The <persName>Carylls</persName> were an old Catholic family who retained their faith throughout the tumultuous Commonwealth period. Later, members of the <persName>Caryll</persName> family took the side of the Jacobites.<ref target="#CH3-n51">51</ref> No evidence confirming <persName>Sir Edward</persName> as a Catholic has been found. Nevertheless, both the <persName>Carylls</persName> and the <persName>Fords</persName>, including <persName>Sir Edward</persName>, were heavily involved in business of <persName>Harting’s</persName> once Catholic church, the Church of St. Mary the <placeName>Virgin</placeName>. Memorials and monuments to members of both families occupied various spots throughout the building. For example, a silver

paten, given to the church in 1671 by <persName>Ford’s</persName> daughter, bears the family arms. Beside an old ruined chancel from the early seventeenth century sits a tomb house, reserved for <persName>Caryll</persName> family monuments.<ref target="#CH3-n52">52</ref> The church later became known as the Church of St. Mary’s and St. Gabriel’s and is now <placeName>Anglican</placeName>. It dates to the fourteenth century and, as do many churches from the period, resembles some of the ones depicted on <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings (Fig. 10). One piece of the church’s architecture that is of particular interest is a stone carving that depicts a saint, complete with mitre, nimbus, cross, crozier, and followers.</p>
               <p>A search for Ford family symbols that might be connected to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers produced only disappointment. The <persName>Ford</persName> escutcheon is described as "azure three crowned lions or." Its three crowned golden lions on a blue background appear to have no parallel to the coppers. However, the Caryll escutcheon, described as "argent three bars and in chief three martlets sable" ("three silver/white bars topped by three black martlets,")

Probably by coincidence, the escutcheon of the Husses, another prominent Harting family bears ermine that, as depicted, closely resemble "creatures" observed on some <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings (Fig. 11).</p>
               <p>After entering Oxford’s Trinity College in 1621 as a gentleman commoner, <persName>Edward Ford</persName> left without receiving a degree. Nevertheless, by 1629 he was named a virtuoso student in Oxford’s Inner Temple. Engineering appears to have been <persName>Ford’s</persName> first love. In 1641, at his own expense, he attempted to build a navigable canal to alleviate London’s water shortage.</p>
               <p>When Civil War erupted, <persName>Ford</persName> remained fiercely loyal to <persName>Charles I</persName>. He was an officer in the king’s army from the beginning of the conflict and in 1642, <persName>Charles</persName> made him High Sheriff of Sussex. <persName>Ford</persName> was captured after the siege of Chichester and was sent to London, where his release probably was secured by his brother-in-law, Henry Ireton, a Cromwell stalwart and future Commissary-General of the New Model Army. By June 1643, <persName>Ford</persName> was threatening Southampton with an army of Royalists. On October 4, he was knighted at Oxford and two months later, he captured Arundel and its castle. He was made governor, but could not hold the town. The remainder

For several years afterward, <persName>Ford</persName> was looked upon with great suspicion. In 1649, just after <persName>Charles I</persName> lost his head, <persName>Ford</persName> was listed by parliament as delinquent. In 1656, however, Oliver Cromwell spared <persName>Ford</persName> the indignity of the decimation tax that was levied against Royalists. Instead, he encouraged <persName>Ford</persName> to work on a successful project in which water from the Thames was raised ninety-three feet to London's highest streets. The same technology was used elsewhere in the country to drain mines and flooded lands.<ref target="#CH3-n54">54</ref>

               <p>Though he never quite rose to the level of the Royal Society, <persName>Ford</persName> was a philosopher and economist. In 1666, he wrote the pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Experimental Proposals how the King may have Money to pay and maintain his Fleets, with Ease to the People; <placeName>London</placeName> may be rebuilt, and all Proprietors satisfied; Money may be lent at 61. per cent.

                  <persName>Ford’s</persName> exploits did not escape the pen of the legendary diarist, <persName>Samuel Pepys</persName>. <persName>Pepys</persName> was little more than a clerk with delusions of grandeur. Yet, he floated among the most influential denizens of Restoration <placeName>England</placeName>. Among the many famous diaries that survive from the period, his stands alone for its flighty, moody, self-aggrandizing style and the sheer breadth of its subjects. <persName>Pepys</persName>’ incessant toadying acquainted him with mints and minters, subjects about which he often wrote. <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName>, Master or Co-Master of the Mint from 1662 to 1680, for example, appears many times in <persName>Pepys</persName>’ diary. <persName>Pepys</persName>’ refers to <persName>Sir Edward</persName>
                  <persName>Ford</persName> in an entry of September 13, 1664:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>and after dinner to the Fishmongers hall, where we met the first time upon the Fishery committee—and many good things discoursed of concerning making of Farthings, which was proposed as a way of raising money for this business.<ref target="#CH3-n57">57</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Another, non-numismatic reference comes on September 22, 1663, in connection with an invention for curing smoky chimnies:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This day my wife showed me bills printed, wherein her father, with <persName>Sir John Collidon</persName> and <persName>Sir Edwd</persName>. <persName>Ford</persName>, hath got a patent for curing of smoking chimnys.<ref target="#CH3-n58">58</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The next reference by <persName>Pepys</persName>, recorded on November 6, 1663, alludes again to <persName>Ford’s</persName> desire to make farthings and have them used to help fund the Committee of the Fisheries:</p>
               <pb n="95"/>
               <p>
                  <q>And then, <persName>Sir G[eorge]</persName> Carteret being gone, I took my Lord [probably the Earl of Sandwich] aside, who doth give me the best advice he can; and telling me how there are some projectors, by name <persName>Sir Edwd Ford</persName>, who would have the making of Farthings, and out of that give so much to the King for the maintenance of the Fishery; but my Lord doth not like that, but would have it go as they offered the last year; and so upon my desire, he promises me when it is seasonable to bring me into the commission with others, if any of them take. And I perceive he and Mr. [<persName>William</persName>] Coventry are resolved to follow it hard.<ref target="#CH3-n59">59</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The footnote to <persName>Pepys</persName>’ diary entry states that <persName>Ford</persName> proposed to make his farthings from Swedish copper. The footnote goes on to say that the Fishery Company, Under <persName>James</persName>, Duke of <placeName>York</placeName>, and later King <persName>James II</persName>, supported the proposal, as did the Queen Mother. The footnote also says that the proposal was once more approved in a 1664 meeting [of the Fishery Company?].<ref target="#CH3-n60">60</ref> The present author is currently searching for documents that might support these details.</p>
               <p>Ford’s proposal was ultimately rejected because of the protests of Prince <persName>Rupert</persName>, the well-liked cousin of <persName>Charles II</persName> who wanted his own coinage patent. Dispute also arose about payments to the king. <persName>Ford</persName> offered 6s 8d on the pound, a plan to which the officials of the mint were opposed. This plan was revived in 1667 and 1668, but the mint officials remained hostile. Instead, according to <persName>Pepys</persName>’ editors, <persName>Ford</persName> was allowed to make farthings for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n61">61</ref>
               </p>
               <p>On January 4, 1667, the following entry is recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Calendar of State Papers Domestic</hi> for <persName>Charles II</persName>:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Order at a general meeting of the Fishing Company, approving the proposal of <persName>Sir Edw. Ford</persName> and the petition grounded thereon, and appointing a committee to present the same to the King, and to prepare arguments in its favour, and attend the Council to speak in its defence. Annexing,</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="96"/>
               <p>
                  <q>I. Petition of the Governor and Company of the Royal Fishing to the King, for a grant of the sole power of coining and issuing farthings, not to be counterfeited, according to a proposition made by <persName>Sir Edw. Ford</persName>, he giving security to prevent the export of gold and silver, by importation of counterfeit farthings; to hinder prejudice to the people by taking back farthings at the same rate; to give 21s. worth of farthings for 20s. silver, and 5s. out of every 20s. to the fishing company.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>II. Statement of the inconveniences and losses resulting from the issue of tradesmen’s tokens, especially in the late contagion and fire, and yet that the profits of them are such that they are made, in spite of an order to the contrary.<ref target="#CH3-n62">62</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The next reference to <persName>Ford</persName> came on December 3, 1664. <persName>Pepys</persName> displays a quaint bit of either genuine excitement or sarcastic displeasure at seeing the proposal again:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Up, and at the office all the morning, and at noon to Mr. <persName>Cutler’s</persName>, and there dined with <persName>Sir W Rider</persName> and him, and thence <persName>Sir W. Rider</persName> and I by coach to White-hall to a committee of the Fishery—there only to hear <persName>Sir Edward</persName>
                     <persName>Ford’s</persName> proposal about Farthing’s [sic]; wherein, O God, to see almost every body interested for him, only my Lord Annesly, who is a grave, serious man. My <persName>Lord Barkely</persName> [<persName>Berkeley</persName>] was there, but is the most hot, fiery man in discourse, without any cause, that ever I saw, even to breach of civility to my <persName>Lord Anglesy</persName>, in his discourse opposing to my Lord’s. At last, though without much satisfaction to me, it was voted that it should be requested of the King, and that <persName>Sir Edw</persName>. <persName>Fords</persName> [sic] proposal is the best yet made. Thence by coach home.<ref target="#CH3-n63">63</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is worth noting that both <persName>John Berkeley</persName> and <persName>George Carteret</persName> were present for different presentations of <persName>Ford’s</persName> proposal. Both men were key figures in the founding of <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> and Berkeley eventually replaced Ormond as <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> Lord Lieutenant.</p>
               <pb n="97"/>
               <p>Of <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName>, the Oxford alumni chronicler, <persName>Anthony Wood</persName> (1632–1695) wrote:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Some time after his majesty’s restoration he invented a new way of farthings, of which he made demonstration to the king and council so plainly, that they were satisfied that they could not possibly be counterfeited, and that one farthing could not be like another, but that they should differ in some little thing. And having then a design to get a patent for the making of them for <placeName>England</placeName>, was put aside by prince <persName>Rupert</persName>, and at length was content with one only for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>: To which place taking journey soon after, he died there before he could effect his design.<ref target="#CH3-n64">64</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Might the "little" differences between <persName>Ford’s</persName> farthings correspond to the many varieties of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings?</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName> died in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> on September 3, 1670. His remains are interred in the family burial area at Harting’s principal church, the Church of St. Mary and St. Gabriel. Given that the <placeName>Up Park</placeName> estate sits atop a high hill, one can imagine that for his entire life at home, <persName>Ford</persName> had looked out at a view similar to that on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings. The burial took place on October 15, 1670. His wife had died earlier. Their only surviving daughter, <persName>Catherine</persName>, married <persName>Ralph</persName>
                  <persName>Lord Grey</persName> of Warke. By his will, through <persName>Grey</persName>, <persName>Ford’s</persName> home, <placeName>Up Park</placeName>, became the property of the Earls of Tankerville until its sale in 1745.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ford</persName> appears to have died before his plan could be carried out. However, <persName>Ford</persName> was in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> for some time before his death, preparing for the operation.<ref target="#CH3-n65">65</ref> Unfortunately, his will makes no mention of coinage or mint equipment.<ref target="#CH3-n66">66</ref> What, then, became of the work that he had done over the six years between his 1664 proposal and his death? Might the Irish have made use of it?</p>

               <p>In recent years, research into the possibility of a continental connection by <persName>Brian Danforth</persName>, dramatically improved cataloging of varieties by <persName>Stanley Stephens</persName> and <persName>John Griffee</persName>, weight studies by <persName>Philip Mossman</persName>, iconographic studies by <persName>Oliver Hoover</persName>, and diligent research by others have done more to increase the chances of solving the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> mysteries than the work of the previous three centuries. The chances of success seem better than ever. Still, definitive answers remain to be found.</p>
               <p>It cannot be said with certainty that <persName>Sir Edward Ford</persName> made or provided the means for making the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers. Neither can it be said with certainty that he did not. Regardless, his activities are worthy of additional study.</p>

            <p>The <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series exhibits the best available technology for producing copper coins economically with a reeded edge in the mid-seventeenth century. Historical evidence, I will suggest, points to the involvement of <persName>Peter (Pierre) Blondeau</persName>, a French engineer associated with technological advances developed at the Louvre Medal Mint and the Paris Mint in the 1630s and 1640s. Having failed in his attempts to modernize the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint in the 1650s, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was invited to return to <placeName>England</placeName>, undertaking the production of milled money for <persName>Charles II</persName>. There are three hallmarks of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> work: First, rounder coins with finely detailed impressions that were achieved through the use of a modified screw press. Second, a new method was employed to grain and inscribe the edges of coins, an important minting process that protected the integrity of money. Third, these tasks could be accomplished economically on thin planchets. By the mid–1600s, the destructive activities of clippers who filed and cut the edges of hammer-struck coins had significantly altered the weight of most circulating money in the British Isles. At the same time, hammer-struck coins were easily counterfeited. These problems led to the modernization of the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint in 1662 under the direction of <persName>Blondeau</persName>, who introduced new minting techniques.</p>
            <p>The mid–1600s were also a critical period in Irish history, as the kingdom had been laid waste by <persName>Oliver Cromwell</persName> during the Civil War of the 1640s. <persName>James Butler</persName>, Earl of Ormond (Ormonde) who was later created Duke of Ormond, commanded the king’s Irish army during the conflict. After the defeat of the king’s forces, he joined the royal family in exile. Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, serving as the king’s chief representative in the kingdom between late 1661 and 1669. Assuming his position in Dublin, he faced almost insurmountable problems as <placeName>Ireland</placeName> lay in ruins. Saddled with an army consisting of many soldiers held over from <persName>Cromwell’s</persName> rule, its loyalty was questionable. The situation was made worse by insufficient funds to pay the soldiers, which threatened the country’s political stability. Out of the need to generate funds that were not forthcoming from <placeName>London</placeName>, it is here argued, Ormond authorized the production of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage.</p>
            <p>In the past, numismatists speculatively proposed that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series was minted between either 1641–1642 or 1672–1678. The first date rested on a 1642 decree by the General Assembly of Kilkenny that authorized
<pb n="105"/>
the coining of money along with the creation of "an institution and order of knighthood, concerning the honour of <persName>St. Patrick</persName>, and the glory of this kingdom."<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> The latter date was subsequently modified by the discovery of the yacht <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Mary</persName>,</hi> which sank while crossing the Irish Sea in 1675. In the wreck’s debris, two <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers (farthings) were discovered, proving the series was minted prior to the late 1670s. The earliest contemporary mention of the series dates from <persName>John Evelyn’s</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Discourse of Medals, Ancient and Modern</hi> (1697), wherein a specimen was listed among <persName>Charles II</persName> silver medals. Two years later, numismatist Archbishop John Sharpe commented on the coppers as money minted in the 1660s. In a recent study on the typology of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, the various depictions and messages conveyed on the coins support a similar time frame for the mintage. This is typified by the legends, FLOREAT REX and QVIESCAT PLEBS. Taken together, the phrase "If the King should prosper, the people will be at peace" denotes the peace longed for by the Irish after a destructive Civil War and the difficulties during the Commonwealth era. Current research by the present author narrows the date of the mintage to 1667–1669.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Early attempts to date the series rested on each interpreter viewing similar historical events differently due to the lack of sufficient written records to resolve the matter conclusively. As an alternative, the current premise is based on an examination of the available technology needed to mint the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series as presented herein. There is only one method that could technologically produce coppers with a reeded edge in an affordable manner, a technique invented by <persName>Blondeau</persName>. In ascertaining the mint date for the series, historical events converge into the period between 1667 and 1669, during the closing years of <persName>Ormond’s</persName> administration as <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName> of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. It is within this time frame that Ormond authorized

                  <placeName>England</placeName> had a longstanding problem with clippers and counterfeiters of its hammer-struck money who took advantage of its irregular shape and inconsistent weight. This was highlighted in a 1637 trial in which a defendant was accused of employing his servants "to cull and sort out...the heavies shillings and sixpences by the ounce.it being usual to find fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen pounds, or more, heavy in one hundred pounds."<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> These were melted and sold for profit. <placeName>Ireland</placeName> faced the additional problem of an unfavorable exchange rate that drained the kingdom of its silver and gold, creating a shortage in the supply of money. In response, Irish officials in 1635 requested permission to reestablish a mint in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> to produce coins "of the same standard of those of <placeName>England</placeName>, for weight and allay [alloy]...of an impression clearly distinguishable from the monies of <placeName>England</placeName>."<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref> During the next two years, additional requests were sent to <placeName>London</placeName> until the project was approved although it was never implemented. Subsequently, the king authorized <persName>Henry Howard</persName>, <persName>Lord Maltravers</persName>, to strike "rose" farthings for both <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Ireland</placeName> (Fig. 1).</p>
               <p>Except for the Aberystwyth Mint in Wales, the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint opposed the establishment of auxiliary mints. Unlike in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, where only a limited quantity of silver was mined, the Welsh facility had access to a much greater silver supply from "those hopeful mountains, where doubtless a mass of treasure lies."<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> In spite of this limitation, the Irish Parliament pressed for the
<pb n="107"/>
reestablishment of the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint. In 1641, <persName>Charles I</persName> consented, but the outbreak of the Civil War prevented any further consideration of the project. In 1648, the topic resurfaced and the king granted <persName>Edward Somerset</persName>, Earl of <placeName>Glamorgan</placeName>, the right to strike money for the kingdom. The grant was made in consideration of His Lordship’s father having advanced large sums to the king at the start of the Civil War and in light of the Earl’s service to his majesty as special envoy to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to secure military assistance from the Catholic Confederates.<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> Somerset, however, was banished the following year upon the establishment of the Commonwealth, leaving <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to discern the value of clipped and counterfeit coins along with the various pieces issued by either the king or Parliament along with their respective supporters during the Civil War. Of particular concern was the multiplicity of mints created by <persName>Charles I</persName>. As one contemporary noted:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The late King went squirting up and down with his mints at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, <placeName>Shrewsbury</placeName>, <placeName>York</placeName>, <placeName>Oxford</placeName>, <placeName>Carlisle</placeName>, and many other places; and when these garrisons were surrendered, the irons were carelessly neglected, and came into the hands of knaves, who fell first to coining of a great quantity of money in Lancashire, and the materials they wrought on was the clipping of English silver.. .some of them were executed, but to this day the State does not know the hundredth man in that county that are clippers and counterfeiters, and the like is still done in <placeName>London</placeName> and elsewhere.<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the 1650s, problems with clippers became acute after the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint set the price for its purchase of bullion below market rate. As a result, the heaviest coins in circulation were melted for profit. <persName>Thomas Violet</persName>, a goldsmith and frequent critic of the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint, wrote an exposé in 1651 subtitled, <hi rend="italic">How the people of this Nation are, and have been abused by Light and Clipped English Monie,</hi> giving insight into the problem that threatened the nation’s supply of money:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>there are many...Merchants, Gold-smiths, and others, that have transported Gold and Silver out of the Nation, that have sold Gold and Silver at above the price of the Mint, that have furnished much light Gold, English and Forrain [Foreign], and great quantities of Gold and

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In an attempt to curtail the activities of clippers, <placeName>England</placeName> enacted a law in 1654 that declared their actions a treasonable offense. The proclamation outlined the various methods employed in lessening the bullion content of money:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>if any person or persons shall Impair, Dimish [Diminish], Falsifie, Clip, Wash [a process of removing metal from the surface of a coin], Round, File, Scale or lighten for wicked...gains sake any the proper moneys of this Commonwealth...Then all and every the Offences abovementioned shall be and are hereby deemed, ordained and adjudged to bee high Treason...and adjudged to be Traytors against this Commonwealth, and shall suffer and have such pains of death, and incur such forfeitures, as in case of high Treason is used and ordained.<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, concern with lightweight and counterfeit money was more severe as the kingdom became a dumping ground for <placeName>England’s</placeName> castoffs, a problem made worse by its unfavorable exchange rate and trade deficit. By the early 1650s, it was estimated that only 10 percent of all silver and gold coins in circulation were of good English money with the weight of the average piece reduced by 20 percent. As a result, officials in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> in 1652 renewed their call for a mint:</p>
               <pb n="109"/>
               <p>
                  <q>persons in <placeName>London</placeName>, sent over great quantities of counterfeit and clipped English money and base Peru-pieces [coins from Spanish colonial mints circulated widely in the British Isles], which by their agents they imposed on the merchants here: for which villainy some of the guilty were taken and executed...The most part of this counterfeit money, sent...to <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, <placeName>Waterford</placeName>, and other places of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, were Half-crowns, which were so bad that the one half of them were not worth two pence in silver; and the Peru-pieces, which were then current here for four shillings and six pence, were not worth above two shillings and four pence...This occasioned several representative from the council here. To the Council of State, the committee of Irish-affairs...and to the lord protector [<persName>Cromwell</persName>], in <placeName>England</placeName>, to shew them the necessity of erecting a mint here, as the only expedient left to retrieve the affairs and the trade of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>England’s</placeName> failure to address the deteriorating state of money in the British Isles due to its poor financial condition after the Civil War led Violet to publish another memorial wherein he attacked the activities of persons who melted heavy coins for export: "if formerly they deserved to bee punished in the purs [purse]...they much more deserv to die for it now, for it is undermining of the whole State "<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref> In <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, the situation was dire as outlined in a report by <placeName>Dublin</placeName> officials to the Lord Protector:</p>
               <p>

               <p>Compounding the problem was the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint’s reduced output of silver and gold coins. The average annual production in the mid–1630s had been about £198,000 in silver and £90,000 in gold coins, it dropped to £68,400 and £8,800, respectively during the Commonwealth era. This coincided with a drastic drop in production of silver halfpence along with a failure to issue any threepence or fourpence. This deficiency in the supply of money was severely felt in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> where its scarcity not only interfered with trade but also hindered the collection of taxes, thereby adding to the fiscal crisis confronting the kingdom.<ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Part of the blame for the <placeName>London</placeName>
                  <persName>Mint’s</persName> poor performance rested with its chief administrator, <persName>Aaron Guerdain</persName>, who was an inexperienced moneyer. In 1649, <persName>Guerdain</persName> was chosen over <persName>John Wollaston</persName>, a better candidate who was a knowledgeable mint melter. <persName>Guerdain</persName> was a long time supporter of the Parliamentary cause, while Wollaston was a convicted exporter of the nation’s bullion in the 1640s, an offense for which he received a pardon due to his position as a <placeName>London</placeName> Alderman. By 1651, realizing there was a problem at the mint, Commonwealth officials hired Violet to propose new regulations for the facility. In his report, Violet informed the Council of State that <persName>Guerdain</persName> and his assistants lacked the proper expertise to operate the facility. This resulted in the failure to secure an adequate supply of bullion which led to an insufficient supply of money. As a solution, Violet unsuccessfully offered himself for the position of chief administrator. As an inducement, he proposed to accept a reduced salary and promised to produce coins cheaply at a savings to the Commonwealth.<ref target="#CH4-n14">14</ref>

               <pb n="111"/>
               <p>While Violet was justified in attacking <persName>Guerdain</persName>, he failed to address the pressing problem caused by clippers and counterfeiters. The success of their endeavors stemmed from the method of producing hammer-struck money:</p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1." rend="hang">Ingots of silver and gold were cast in iron moulds of the thickness of a finger that measured 10 inches wide by 15 inches long;</item>
                  <item n="2." rend="hang">The resulting bars were beaten into strips narrower and thicker than the future planchets;</item>
                  <item n="3." rend="hang">The elongated strips were then cut in half and beaten further, approximating the thickness of coins;</item>
                  <item n="4." rend="hang">The smaller strips were cut into rough squares, using large shears;</item>
                  <item n="5." rend="hang">The squares were cut again, starting at each corner, into planchets, as workers weighed each piece and shaped it further to obtain the desired weight; and</item>
                  <item n="6." rend="hang">Final trimming with shears and filing of rough edges was done to ready the planchets for striking.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This process produced coins with rough edges, making them susceptible to filing and clipping at a later time. As for weight, scales of the 1600s made accuracy difficult, a situation made worse by the need to shape each planchet as quickly as possible. This limited the number of times pieces were weighed and resulted in the production of coins of varying weights.<ref target="#CH4-n15">15</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Noticeable in the shortage of money that gripped <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was the deficiency in the supply of small change due to the failure to authorize coppers since the termination of Maltravers’ patent in 1644. Although sanctioned by the Crown, these farthings along with those authorized by <persName>James</persName> I were more like tokens than money of intrinsic value. As noted by one <placeName>London</placeName> moneyer: "The farthing token is of excessive lightness...and is of an ugly and deformed stamp, easily counterfeited. Suggests that the weight ought to be increased by two-thirds."<ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref> After the</p>
               <pb n="112"/>
               <p>Civil War, it was obvious a copper coinage would be beneficial, as noted by one pamphleteer:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>it is clear as the sun...the Poor’s misery, and the Commons discontent, are all foulded [folded] up in the non-allowance of State Farthings; the Poor crying out for mercy, the Commons for redress; and this insufuffable [insufferable] abuse cannot easily be corrected, until it shall please...to pass an Order for the allowance of State Farthings.<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>During the Commonwealth era, officials contemplated the production of farthings and numerous pattern pieces were prepared for consideration. While several private contenders vied for a potential contract, the government’s anti-monopolistic stance precluded their success. More promising was the possibility that the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint would strike official farthings. Toward this end, several moneyers prepared specimens with various religious or political legends such as, GOD DIRECT OVR CORSE or THVS VNITED INVINCIBLE. Some of these pattern pieces were made in sufficient quantity that they circulated as money. In spite of this activity, the public had to rely on numerous tokens uttered by tradesmen and towns that constituted small change. While most were circular in shape, some were cut into squares, diamonds, and hearts. They were made by local artisans or skilled moneyers in <placeName>London</placeName> who specialized in making tokens. Such pieces were deemed money of necessity, facilitating exchanges in local marketplaces. More than 12,000 different varieties were produced with <placeName>England</placeName> accounting for over 90 percent followed by <placeName>Ireland</placeName> for about 8 percent with the balance attributed to Scotland and Wales.<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref> At times cumbersome to use and of little intrinsic value, the typical English token had an inflated value ascribed by its maker as a halfpenny or penny while its Irish counterpart was usually deemed a penny. Comparatively few farthings were made, which would have been closer to what the metal content of many tokens were worth. Overall, tokens were problematic as noted by <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> Lords Justices: "many of those that caused such tokens to be so stamped and issued, kept out of the way, and so avoided the accepting or exchanging

               </p>
               <p>After the restoration of the monarchy, there was a renewed effort to issue official farthings. The production of halfpence was added to this standard request since the minting of silver halfpence ended during the Commonwealth era. Among the various petitioners were employees of the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint and Maltravers’ son who claimed entitlement because of the unfair termination of his father’s grant to make farthings.<ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref> In a break with tradition, <placeName>London</placeName> officials gave serious consideration to striking regal coppers, which led to the preparation of several pattern pieces. While a decision to issue coppers for <placeName>England</placeName> was delayed until 1672, the Crown granted <persName>Sir Thomas Armstrong</persName> the right to make farthings for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> (Fig. 2), allowing him space at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint for the project, which became known as the Irish Mint. <persName>Charles II</persName> deemed the new farthings a "benefit to our people...as well as amongst tradesmen for exchange of moneys" and demonetized all outstanding Irish tokens.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref> While <placeName>Dublin</placeName> officials accepted the king’s decree, they preferred the reestablishment of the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint, which accentuated the general dissatisfaction with the patentee’s lightweight farthings. <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> tenure at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint ended in 1662, coinciding with his death and the reallocation of his space to accomodate the new equipment used to produce the king’s milled money.<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Throughout this period, the underlying problem of English money was its outdated method of production. An early attempt to address this problem occurred during the reign of <persName>Queen Elizabeth</persName> (1558–1603) when
<pb n="114"/>
                  <persName>Eloy Mestrell</persName>, a former employee at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> established a small operation within the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint to produce milled coins. Unfortunately, he was unable to overcome opposition from English moneyers who felt threatened by the prospect of machines replacing manual labor. Later, he was hanged as a counterfeiter, which discredited his activities. Nicholas Briot (1579–1646), Engraver-General at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName>, came to <placeName>England</placeName> in 1625, proposing to modernize operations by pressing "money into a more perfect roundness, weight, figure, and impression, and with less charge, than by the ordinary way of hammering."<ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref> As with Mestrell before him, <persName>Briot</persName> experienced opposition from English moneyers in spite of the improved appearance of his coins.<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref> A further hindrance to <persName>Briot’s</persName> prospects was his damaged reputation. In <placeName>France</placeName>, he had been accused of bribing the Cour des Monnaies (the moneyers at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName>) in an attempt to overcome opposition to the adoption of his mechanical methods for cutting and stamping planchets.<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref> Given his talents as an engraver, as well as his introduction to the king by Théodore de Mayerne, His Majesty’s personal physician, Briot had limited success in <placeName>England</placeName>. He was assigned to the <placeName>Edinburgh Mint</placeName> on two different occasions. First was in 1631 when he struck Scottish coppers with results so disappointing that the Master of the <placeName>Edinburgh Mint</placeName> considered his efforts a shameful failure.<ref target="#CH4-n26">26</ref> The second time, he made milled coins contrary to a request by Scottish officials that he not introduce any "novelties" to existing manual practices.<ref target="#CH4-n27">27</ref> At two different intervals in the 1630s, he successfully produced a limited quantity of English milled coins. In 1649, when <persName>Blondeau</persName> arrived in <placeName>England</placeName>, the engineer also received little enthusiasm from mint employees. It was not until the early 1660s when the integrity of English money had deteriorated to a critical
<pb n="115"/>
point that <persName>Blondeau</persName> was asked to return to <placeName>London</placeName> and modernize the mint through the introduction of modified screw presses that inscribed and grained the edges on the nation’s money. As <persName>Charles II</persName> announced, the new process would curtail the activities of clippers and counterfeiters:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Having resolved to prevent clipping and counterfeiting money, by coining money for the future by mill and press, with letters and groinings [graining] about the edges...Warrants for a grant to <persName>Peter Blondeau</persName>, a Frenchman, inventor of mill money, of a pension of 100£. a year, as engineer of the Mint, to enable him better to carry on the new way of coining.<ref target="#CH4-n28">28</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Against this backdrop of difficulties associated with the quality and quantity of English and Irish money, there arose a particular need for small change in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in the mid–1660s. In addressing the kingdom’s monetary failings, the abilities of several distinguished men united in creating the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. It is my contention that together, they made a new coinage with finely crafted features that stood out from a host of less than desirable pieces of metal that people out of necessity called money.</p>

               <p>His Lordship was the head of a distinguished Anglo-Irish family dating from the arrival in 1185 of <persName>Theobald Le Butler</persName> who accompanied Prince <persName>John</persName> (the future King <persName>John</persName> [1199–1216]) and his army across the Irish Sea to suppress rebellious feudal lords. In recognition of his service, <persName>Theobald</persName> was proclaimed Chief Butler and granted lands in Tipperary. His descendents increased their position in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, which became formidable when <persName>James</persName> (c. 1307–1338), son of the Fifth Chief <persName>Butler</persName>, married <persName>Eleanor de Bohun</persName>, the grand-daughter of King <persName>Edward I</persName> (1272–1307). As a result of this marriage, <persName>King Edward III</persName> (1327–1377) created <persName>James</persName> Earl of Ormond in 1328 and granted him the regalities and liberties of a county palatine for Tipperary. This privilege gave him exceptional powers to exercise many royal rights, including the minting of money, while owing homage and fealty to the king. Although such rights were periodically granted to ecclesiastical jurisdictions, it was infrequently conferred on the nobility.</p>
               <pb n="116"/>
               <p>In <placeName>England</placeName>, the rights of county palatine status were basically restricted to the lands of those earls whose domains bordered <placeName>Scotland</placeName> or <placeName>Wales</placeName> in recognition of the important role they played in defending English territory. Among such grantees, the Earl of <placeName>Northumberland</placeName> was the only noble to establish an independent mint. This only took place during the chaotic civil war years that engulfed the reign of King <persName>Stephen</persName> in the twelfth century. Another, the Earl of Chester, collected a fee from the royal mint created in his jurisdiction. In <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, several members of the nobility had enjoyed palatine rights since the time of King <persName>Henry II</persName> (1154–1189) as part of establishing English rule, although only one, the Earl of Ulster, exercised the privilege to coin money at the end of the twelfth century.<ref target="#CH4-n29">29</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The conveyance of minting rights to the Ormonds occurred at a time when King <persName>Edward III</persName> was reorganizing <placeName>England’s</placeName> monetary affairs and augmenting the limited capacity of existing facilities to accommodate the nation’s expanding trade with <placeName>Europe</placeName>. While there had been nearly 70 mints in <placeName>England</placeName> under <persName>William I</persName> (1066–1087), operations by the early 1300s were restricted to <placeName>London</placeName>, Canterbury, and two ecclesiastical mints, <placeName>Durham</placeName> and Bury St. Edmunds, which were allowed to operate as part of their palatine privileges. In addition, there was a local mint at Berwick on Tweed that struck crude debased coins to meet the needs of the army stationed along the troubled Scottish border. This contraction resulted primarily from the desire of <persName>Henry III</persName> (1216–1272) to centralize minting under royal control. In an expansive manner, <placeName>Edward III</placeName> authorized two new ecclesiastical mints, Reading and York, along with a large royal facility at newly acquired Calais in <placeName>France</placeName> to assist cross-channel commerce. The king’s commitment to facilitating trade is underscored by the output of gold coins at Calais, totaling £27,968 during its first decade of operations, while output of the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint, which was the nation’s primary facility, was £17,498. For <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, in addition to granting palatine rights to Ormond, the king authorized the Irish Treasurer to issue silver farthings and halfpence in 1336 and two years later reestablished the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint. Although the intent was to produce a large quantity of coins (24 pairs of dies were prepared at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint and sent to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> to strike

farthings, halfpence and pence), the facility operated for less then three years because of an insufficient supply of silver. Continuing his initiative to assist mercantile enterprises, <persName>Edward III</persName> issued <placeName>England’s</placeName> first successful series of gold coins: the noble valued at 80 pence (Fig. 3); the half-noble valued at three shillings and six pence; and the quarter-noble valued at a shilling and eight pence. He also minted the unsuccessful florin series of gold coins intended for international commerce. To facilitate domestic trade, the king increased the number of denominations, introducing the silver twopence and threepence along with a reconstituted groat or fourpence that answered objections raised to its initial issuance by <persName>Edward I</persName>. The mint at <placeName>Durham</placeName> was particularly active, reaching its highest output level in the mid–1300s. In spite of all the activity undertaken by <persName>Edward III</persName>, the newly created Earl of Ormond did not exercise his palatine coining rights. Perhaps the newness of his title or his youth and short life hindered his production of money. More probably, the shortage of locally mined silver was the major obstacle. This same problem sealed the fate of the short-lived <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint.<ref target="#CH4-n30">30</ref>
               </p>
               <p>While mints operating under palatine rights added to the supply of small change, their overall contribution was limited and intermittent. Their output was restricted by a variety of factors, such as the shortage of silver or the limitations on the number of dies the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint sent them for striking coins. This last factor stemmed from the control that the <placeName>London</placeName>

Mint exerted over monetary affairs. As a result, these lesser mints were at times barely active and periodically closed, which made their profitability questionable. The mint at <placeName>Durham</placeName> exemplifies this point when its annual output dropped to a mere £100 prior to its closure in 1394. Although reopened, annual output generally ranged between £100 and £500 for most of the 1400s because the mint was allowed to use only three sets of dies to strike coins. In the early 1500s, production slipped to less than £200 a year. Because of its low performance, the mint thereafter was rented to others to operate at a nominal fee. Under such circumstances, although the right to coin money was an important palatine privilege, it was not necessarily a worthwhile venture.<ref target="#CH4-n31">31</ref>
               </p>
               <p>With these events as background, <persName>James Butler</persName> (1610–1688), 12th Earl of Ormond, entered Irish affairs. He was raised in <placeName>England</placeName> and after the death of his father in 1619, he was made a ward of King <persName>James I</persName> and placed under the tutorship of the Archbishop of Canterbury, thereby distancing him from his Roman Catholic family. Like many of his ancestors, he undertook a military career. A staunch supporter of the Stuarts during the Civil War, he commanded the Irish forces in the king’s fight against the Parliamentary army. After Cromwell’s victory, he joined the future King <persName>Charles II</persName> in exile, residing in <placeName>France</placeName> during the early 1650s. In contrast to the chaotic monetary conditions gripping <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, which saw the kingdom awash with coins of
<pb n="119"/>
questionable value, <placeName>France</placeName> had made vast improvements with its newly mechanized minting operations. Of special note are the activities of the Medal Mint that operated within the Louvre Palace, where <persName>Charles</persName> resided while in <placeName>Paris</placeName>. This facility was the center of French expertise in using screw presses to produce finely executed medals. Work there formed the basis for modernizing the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> and its provincial facilities in the 1640s.</p>
               <p>Ormond returned to <placeName>England</placeName> upon the restoration of the monarchy and received the title of Duke from a grateful <persName>Charles II</persName> in 1661. In 1662, he arrived in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> as the newly appointed <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>, the king’s chief representative in the kingdom. The problems he confronted were almost overwhelming. The nation’s economy lay in ruins; suffering was everywhere as over 600,000 had died in the war; persons who had benefited from Cromwell’s victory stood to loose lands they had been granted—a factor that involved an initial estimate of 1,800,000 acres, but which was subsequently raised to 5,473,000 acres as more claims were submitted to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> in the mid–660s;<ref target="#CH4-n32">32</ref> displaced Royalists on returning home wanted to assert their former property rights or receive just compensation; over half of the lands owned by Irish Catholics had been confiscated by Cromwell and many poor farmers had been forced to migrate to less desirable western lands; tensions between Catholics and Protestants were on the rise after a brief reprieve due to the Declaration of Breda (1660), wherein the king declared his personal desire for religious freedom; and the army that was responsible for maintaining the fragile peace was not dependable, since many had served on behalf of Parliament in its conflict with <persName>Charles I</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n33">33</ref>
                  <persName>Ormond’s</persName> greatest concern was a less than loyal army, especially one that was disaffected due to the scarcity of money that caused excessive arrears in pay. As a partial solution, he disbanded those soldiers deemed most disloyal to the king. This "new-modeling" or reforming of the troops was limited by his inability to pay arrears. With unpaid troops "notoriously known to be disaffected" Ormond advanced personal funds to meet the financial requirements of the military during the first part of his tenure in office and assessed the situation as desperate:</p>
               <pb n="120"/>
               <p>
                  <q>The fanatics in <placeName>England</placeName> had ever been adverse to the restoration of the royal family, and depending upon their interest in the soldiery which had been lately disbanded, and on the affections of great numbers that still continued in the army, meditated an insurrection. To know the whole strength of their party, they had sent persons into <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to sound the disposition of the forces there, and such encouraging accounts were brought back from thence, that they ragged [raged]...that they had eight thousand of the old soldiers in that kingdom ready to join in the design, which was to make away his majesty, and then to publish a manifesto, declaring the duke of York a papist [this religious issue led to the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the overthrow of <persName>James II</persName> and a renewed Civil War in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>], in order to set up a [Protestant] commonwealth.<ref target="#CH4-n34">34</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>England</placeName> also faced financial restraints stemming from the Civil War and was unable to offer much assistance to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. A notable exception occurred in the aftermath of the 1663 insurrection that endangered <persName>Ormond’s</persName> life and London's control of <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Castle, the seat of English government in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. To stabilize <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, Ormond requested £60,000 in English coin, which <placeName>London</placeName> was unable to supply. Given the seriousness of the situation, <persName>Charles II</persName> forwarded the necessary funds in French crowns taken from his personal stock of money at the <placeName>London</placeName> Tower.<ref target="#CH4-n35">35</ref> Realizing that <placeName>Ireland</placeName> needed to become more self-reliant, Ormond attempted to increase local revenues by focusing on farm production and commerce. This was imperative since part of the kingdom’s monetary problems stemmed from a trade deficit that drained the nation of its money. Unfortunately, <placeName>London</placeName> harmed Irish exports when it passed the 1667 Cattle Act that prohibited sending cattle to <placeName>England</placeName>. This not only lessened the Irish government’s ability to generate revenues to pay soldiers, but also increased sentiments for insurrection. As Ormond noted, such restrictive actions by <placeName>England’s</placeName> House of Commons were fraught with danger given the destabilizing events of the mid–1660s.<ref target="#CH4-n36">36</ref> Another development that drained funds from <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was the war with the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> and <placeName>French</placeName> in the mid–1660s. In spite of these

obstacles, <persName>Ormond</persName> was able to reduce the annual deficit from £60,645 to £31,136 between 1662 and 1668, although the accumulated national debt totaled £175,902 by the latter date, a staggering amount considering the kingdom’s limited budget.<ref target="#CH4-n37">37</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Approaching <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> monetary concerns more directly, Ormond was associated with several minting ventures. The first was <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> 1660 patent for farthings, which His Lordship initially favored as providing assistance to domestic trade. Thereafter, the historical record is contradictory regarding his position on the matter. Some report that Ormond continued to support the patent, which was certainly better than the attempt to revive Maltravers’ grant that produced farthings about half the weight of Armstrong’s. In 1680, <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> son, however, espoused a different opinion in justifying authorization for the Armstrong (Jr.)/Legge Patent (Fig. 5), stating his father’s project had failed because of opposition from officials at <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Castle. Although Ormond is inferred to have been the opposition, a more likely opponent was <persName>George Monck</persName>, absentee <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>, who was seeking a royal license to make tradesmen tokens as an alternative to <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> farthings.<ref target="#CH4-n38">38</ref> The second venture that Ormond endorsed was the unsuccessful Viner Patent that proposed to establish a mint in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> to issue silver coins ranging from halfpence to fourpence. This project was initiated by the <placeName>London</placeName> financiers, <persName>Robert</persName> and <persName>Thomas Viner</persName>, in partnership with <persName>Daniel Bellingham</persName>, a <placeName>Dublin</placeName> goldsmith and Alderman. The <persName>Viners</persName> lent large sums to the king personally and to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>
                  <pb n="122"/>
on His Majesty’s behalf. For example, in 1662 they advanced £30,000 to assist Ormond when he assumed the office of <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>. This was a crucial loan as news from <placeName>Ireland</placeName> raised fears that there would be great difficulty with unpaid soldiers if money was not soon forthcoming from <placeName>London</placeName>. At the time, arrears totaled £125,689, a sum subsequently reduced as some soldiers accepted partial payment in order to meet their pressing personal obligations and some were purged from the army as a result of the 1663 insurrection.<ref target="#CH4-n39">39</ref> Ormond lent his support to the venture prior to his arrival in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> and continued to support it thereafter until the patent was surrendered. Another proposal that Ormond initially encouraged was <persName>Sir Edward</persName>
                  <persName>Ford’s</persName> 1664 plan to mint farthings, halfpence and three-farthings. <persName>Ford’s</persName> timing was fortuitous, coming after the recent suppression of a conspiracy to inundate <placeName>Ireland</placeName> with counterfeit pieces-of-eight and base coins.<ref target="#CH4-n40">40</ref> An appealing aspect of <persName>Ford’s</persName> presentation was its use of privy marks and intricate designs as anti-counterfeiting devices.<ref target="#CH4-n41">41</ref> The project, however, was repeatedly deferred because of insufficient support from <placeName>London</placeName> in spite of its endorsement by the Governor and Company of the Royal Fishing, who were to share in any profits generated by the venture. The plan resurfaced in 1667 only to be delayed further without any noted support from Ormond. When the proposal was again discussed at a meeting of the Royal Fishing in 1668, the hopelessness of the situation was noted: "The King has often declared against private persons having liberty to coin, and if any should obtain it, the great labours of the company would be frustrated."<ref target="#CH4-n42">42</ref> Also in 1664, Ormond considered a little-known plan by Athenry Parliamentarian, <persName>Henry Whalley</persName>, to strike pence modeled after Scottish money.<ref target="#CH4-n43">43</ref> These failed attempts were followed
<pb n="123"/>
by the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, which satisfied two of <persName>Ormond’s</persName> main objectives. Primary was the necessity to pay soldiers at a time of crisis when troops were needed to quell mounting unrest in the countryside as well as to protect the kingdom from a potential invasion by <placeName>England’s</placeName>
                  <placeName>Europe</placeName>an enemies. Of secondary importance was <persName>Ormond’s</persName> desire to reestablish the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint (historically, mints had operated in several cities such as <placeName>Drogheda</placeName>, <placeName>Kilkenny</placeName>, and <placeName>Trim</placeName>) in order to give the kingdom better control of its finances. The convergence of these two objectives on <persName>Ormond’s</persName> agenda between 1667 and 1669 fostered the creation of a semi-official coinage that later contributed to <placeName>New Jersey’s</placeName> supply of small change.<ref target="#CH4-n44">44</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There were several precedents for <persName>Ormond’s</persName> undertaking the production of money of necessity. During the chaotic Wars of the Roses that marred the reign of King <persName>Edward IV</persName> (1461–1483) a nationalistic Irish Parliament issued money. Included in this series were copper farthings and half farthings (Fig. 6) that depicted and/or named <persName>St. Patrick</persName> in the legend. In 1536, King <persName>Henry VIII</persName> (1509–1547) issued a series of halfgroats and groats known as "coins of the harp" (Fig. 7). These were minted in <placeName>London</placeName> and shipped to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to finance the king’s suppression of the growing independence of the Earl of Kildare. The coins depicted a crowned shield on the obverse and a crowned harp on the reverse. While the harp had been an Irish heraldic symbol since the 1300s, this was the first time it appeared as a quasi-national symbol on Irish money. Between 1601 and 1602, Queen <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> minted a series of copper and billon pieces to support the suppression of rebels against the Plantation System, which gave Irish land to English immigrants (Fig. 8). In 1643, as the Civil War raged, the king ordered the people to bring their plate to officials who were to strike a series of coins that became known as Ormonde Money with various denominations up to five shillings (Fig. 9). The intent was to provide relief

for "our good subjects there are reduced to that extreme penurie" for want of money. Obviously, this new supply of money was meant to assist the king in meeting his military obligations that were hindered by insufficient funds. At the time, there was also a desire to reestablish the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint but "the quantity of plate or bullion there so to be melted down, and coined, is of so small and inconsiderable value, that it is not worth the charges of erecting a mint."<ref target="#CH4-n45">45</ref> During the Civil War, Ormond as <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName> exercised the right to mint money on two occasions. Between 1642 and 1646, out of necessity to pay the army, he along with the Lords Justices authorized a new coinage —commonly called Inchiquin Money— mentioned in <persName>Ormond’s</persName> warrant as "pledges" that ranged in value from threepence to double pistoles (Fig. 10). Later, in 1649, Ormond ordered the minting of halfcrowns and crowns to proclaim <persName>Charles II</persName> as king.<ref target="#CH4-n46">46</ref>

               <p>Adding to <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> monetary problems were numerous lightweight tradesmen tokens that appeared in the 1650s due to the shortage of small change. While comparable pieces were uttered in <placeName>England</placeName> as farthings and halfpence, Irish tokens were much overvalued and primarily vented as pence. A similar problem pertained to town tokens. Unlike in <placeName>England</placeName>, where various towns authorized tokens that had some semblance of intrinsic value, Irish town tokens were generally lightweight. Bandon’s and Kinsale’s coppers weighed 30 and 35 grains respectively while Cork’s weighed as little as 14 grains.<ref target="#CH4-n47">47</ref> In contrast to the finely executed tokens of <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, many Irish pieces were ill-struck while some of Cork’s were over-struck on outdated <persName>Louis XIII</persName> double tournois and Kerry’s on square flans.<ref target="#CH4-n48">48</ref> The adverse effect of Irish tokens was outlined at a meeting of <placeName>Dublin</placeName>’s Council in 1661:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whereas among many other grievances under which his majesties subjects in this kingdom have laboured for several years past...that several persons, in all the cities corporate and market-towns throughout this kingdom, took a liberty, without any restraint to make a kind of brass or copper tokens, with such stamps as they pleased, in very great proportions, and
<pb n="126"/>
vented them to the people for a penny each peece...to the great loss and disappointment of many poor people, and they or others having, by exchange of those tokens, possessed themselves of considerable sums of pure silver, have (as is supposed) exported the same out of the kingdom.<ref target="#CH4-n49">49</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To address these problems, <persName>Ormond lobbied</persName> for the reestablishment of the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint. The goal was to lessen the kingdom’s monetary dependence on <placeName>London</placeName>, which was unable to offer any significant financial assistance in the 1660s. The reopening of the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint had been contemplated in the mid–1650s by Commonwealth officials. In spite of subsidizing <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> extended stay in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, adequate funds were never provided to ensure the venture’s success. The Irish Privy Council revived the proposal for a mint in 1661, which gained momentum with the passage of the Viner Patent in 1662. Unfortunately, the patentees were soon forced to surrender their grant after objections were raised to their plan to lower the silver content of their money to reflect the exchange rate between <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. These failed initiatives were missed opportunities to establish an Irish coinage and strengthen <placeName>Ireland</placeName> financially, thereby restoring its national identity and removing the stigma of the 1637 Proclamation that ordered the "name of Irish money or harps...be abolished, and that all Accounts. made in English money."<ref target="#CH4-n50">50</ref> Still without a new coinage or a mint, the Irish House of Commons in 1666 established a committee to investigate the means of obtaining a coinage. The adjournment of the Irish Parliament shortly thereafter prevented any further action on the matter as its members did not reconvene until after Ormond left office.<ref target="#CH4-n51">51</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The scarcity of small change also affected the general populace, making it difficult for landlords to pay farm laborers their meager wages and for the laborers to pay their modest rents. The situation was so serious that at times these payments had to be made with money substitutes.<ref target="#CH4-n52">52</ref> This problem
<pb n="127"/>
was exacerbated by a drought and compounded by the reappearance of the plague in 1666, which further reduced the flow of money into <placeName>Dublin</placeName>’s coffers. In assessing the kingdom’s fiscal health, Ormond stated that poverty had increased to a level higher than that which had existed during the Civil War.<ref target="#CH4-n53">53</ref> His Lordship’s concern with this deplorable state mounted as signs appeared that some were ready to rebel against officials at <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Castle. The threat of rebellion was twofold. The lack of funds to pay the troops made their loyalty doubtful and raised fears that they might mutiny or support invading French forces. Likewise, tension was created by former soldiers who had fought for the Parliamentary cause in the 1640s and had been paid with confiscated lands. As <placeName>Dublin</placeName> mounted a campaign to disallow titles to farms taken by force, threats were uttered "by persons who had served in the Army of the late Usurper [Cromwell], and to whom lands in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> had been given as a reward for their service to defend those possessions by insurrection if needful, rather than yield them to other claimants."<ref target="#CH4-n54">54</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The potential disloyalty of the army was a grave concern that became intolerable in late 1666 when Ormond was forced to quarter soldiers in private homes due to lack of money. This policy was so controversial that His Lordship was threatened with impeachment by his opponents. In public, Ormond defended his actions as an "ancient practice" and necessary for the safety of the kingdom, consulting with lawyers who justified his stance. However, he privately considered it unlawful.<ref target="#CH4-n55">55</ref> From <persName>Ormond’s</persName> perspective, this decision was necessary because he lacked the means to do otherwise as noted in a letter to his son in 1667: "either the king must by raising the pay of the soldiers to enable them to pay for lodgeings; or they must haue [house] them free; or there must be noe army."<ref target="#CH4-n56">56</ref> Obviously, the army could not be disbanded "as the tymes weare, and still are, most dangerous"<ref target="#CH4-n57">57</ref> and a "hot alarm" had been raised that <placeName>France</placeName>, with the support of <placeName>Holland</placeName>,
<pb n="128"/>
was amassing a force at Brest to invade <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n58">58</ref> Lacking an immediate alternative, Ormond installed spies among the troops in an attempt to avert rebellion:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>to gain an honest sergeant or corporal in every company [especially those stationed in Cork and Limerick where the threat was thought most serious] that were deemed more to serve as a spy over the rest, in order to get notice and to seize such persons as should come to corrupt the soldiers; promising in those cases a considerable reward.<ref target="#CH4-n59">59</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Adding to these problems were mounting disturbances in the countryside as rioters burnt houses and carried out other destructive acts in response to disputes over land titles. In matters such as this, officials normally depended on the military, but the soldiers had not been paid in many months. Furthermore, the local militia was weakened by the refusal of Catholics, who dominated the rural communities, to take the Oath of Supremacy. Ormond was well acquainted with what happens when soldiers were not paid. In 1666, he had to put down a mutiny in northern <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, where dissatisfied and unpaid troops called on others to revolt. He also experienced similar problems during the Civil War when Royalist troops became unreliable again due to insufficient funds. Aware of the dire consequences generated by financial constraints, he wanted to ensure the army was paid. He was especially concerned about troops who were holdovers from the days of Cromwell for they were deemed to be dangerous:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All precautions were no more than necessary at this time when the soldiers of the army, being of the old republican leaven, were ready to join in any seditious design or attempt to disturb and subvert the government.<ref target="#CH4-n60">60</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The problems Ormond faced were not easy to solve since the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint in 1667 was just starting to recover from the damaging effects of the plague and a citywide fire that had all but brought a stop to production at the facility. Given the shortage of money in <placeName>England</placeName>, it would be years before <placeName>Ireland</placeName> would see a meaningful inflow of regal money. As to the desire to reopen the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint, that feat was virtually unachievable.</p>
               <pb n="129"/>
               <p>In the meantime, the lack of payments to the army had to be addressed as arrears amounted to slightly over £80,000, equivalent to the pay and support of the troops for a year.<ref target="#CH4-n61">61</ref> In correspondence with <placeName>London</placeName> officials, Ormond considered it imperative to pay at least six months of the back pay in order to avert trouble. In addressing this problem, the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series would play an important role in computing the estimated £40,000 was required to satisfy the army.<ref target="#CH4-n62">62</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Officials on both sides of the Irish Sea acknowledged the mounting problem, declaring: "We are so poor here [<placeName>Ireland</placeName>] that I do not think we can advert difficulty and dangers for long."<ref target="#CH4-n63">63</ref> A report to <placeName>London</placeName> authorities assessing the allegiance of the troops recounted the answer given by a soldier when asked which side he would fight for should a rebellion erupt. His response was telling: "that which pays the best."<ref target="#CH4-n64">64</ref> The situation was deteriorating as the lack of pay turned soldiers into criminals, who stole from citizens in nearby communities. In order to meet their personal obligations, some officers took money that was intended for their subordinates. A few soldiers even became false coiners.<ref target="#CH4-n65">65</ref> By 1667, illegal activity was spreading because</p>
               <p>
                  <q>there is money due to them...and violently armed men break into the cottages of poor people and other inhabitants of the said city [<placeName>Dublin</placeName>] and suburbs, and there spoil their goods and terrify the said inhabitants, and many times take and carry away plate and other valuable goods of great value without warrant or order.<ref target="#CH4-n66">66</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>These events led to an alternate solution to <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> shortage of money. In 1667, when Ormond received support in the form of a "King’s letter" from <persName>Charles II</persName>, granting him sole authority to suppress all tokens in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> that did not have his approval. Unlike in <placeName>England</placeName>, where the use of tokens generally went unmolested, Ormond took the unusual step of repressing base money, as he reported to <placeName>England’s</placeName> Secretary of State for 
<pb n="130"/>
                  <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. Such action normally preceded the authorization of a new coinage. A contemporary letter interpreted the <persName>Lord-Lieutenant’s</persName> warrant from the king as a receipt of permission to issue official tokens and small change.<ref target="#CH4-n67">67</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ormond’s</persName> receipt of his royal authority is significant since it constituted the same permission that <persName>Armstrong</persName> had initially received for minting his farthings. In <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> case, however, he could not proceed until he had obtained consent from <persName>Lord Robartes</persName>, <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> newly appointed Deputy <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>. Since His Lordship had not yet assumed his post in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, <persName>Robartes</persName> refused to endorse the project until his arrival in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, which would not occur for several months. Frustrated by the delay, <persName>Armstrong</persName> successfully circumvented this obstacle by requesting a royal patent, which he received. This was a strong precedent for Ormond. Having secured the "King’s letter," he had in effect obtained approval to issue money. This interpretation is confirmed by later correspondence with his son, Lord Ossory.<ref target="#CH4-n68">68</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ormond’s</persName> receipt of the "King’s letter" coincided with his request in July of 1667 that <placeName>London</placeName> provide £40,000 to pay soldiers during the depth of the fiscal crisis. This amount was reduced several weeks later to £30,000 as peace in <placeName>Europe</placeName> appeared to be at hand and part of the army could be disbanded.<ref target="#CH4-n69">69</ref> It was during this period that Ormond proposed to mint farthings in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Council have been working diligently here for a week at the revenue. The result is that though we find that the King is in greater debt to the army than he can soon pay...I am to propose [Ormond later specified that he would submit his proposal directly to the king.<ref target="#CH4-n70">70</ref>] that we have £30,000 in mild [milled] and brass or copper farthings sent us, or the metal sent and workmen tools to coin them here, then to be made current by proclamation at such proportion in the pound as shall be held fit. This will make a gain to the King of all except the cost of coinage and great convenience...But if it meet with no rub on that side [i.e., from <placeName>London</placeName>
                     <pb n="131"/>
officials], on notice I shall have it more particularly proposed and reduced to method and practice.<ref target="#CH4-n71">71</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From <persName>Ormond’s</persName> perspective, the shortage of money in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was so problematic that "we must take what we can get rather that hazard the suffering of the Regiment to be longer without money."<ref target="#CH4-n72">72</ref> As noted in his reduced request for £30,000, His Lordship was prepared to mint coins as part of his vice-regal prerogative.<ref target="#CH4-n73">73</ref> As a contemporary political observer pointed out, "small money is a private one, which the <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName> might order by his instructions."<ref target="#CH4-n74">74</ref>
                  <persName>Ormond’s</persName> decision to undertake a mintage became a necessity when <placeName>London</placeName> informed <placeName>Dublin</placeName> officials that it would no longer subsidize <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> government. Calling for fiscal retrenchment, <placeName>England</placeName> now expected <placeName>Dublin</placeName> to generate surplus revenues to help reduce the burdensome national debt caused by the recent war.<ref target="#CH4-n75">75</ref> This excluded any possibility of receiving funds from <placeName>England</placeName> to buy equipment and other materials needed to build a mint in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ormond</persName> was not the only person to sense the desperate state of Irish monetary affairs and to consider minting money as its solution. <persName>Richard Stephens</persName> proposed an expansive plan to produce £300,000 in tin pence, which later would be devalued to halfpence. This coinage was promoted as a means to settle the arrears owed to the army and to pay the national debt with the balance applied to buying supplies for the navy.<ref target="#CH4-n76">76</ref> This proposal was never given serious consideration for several reasons. One factor was undoubtedly the petitioner’s former service as a colonel in Cromwell’s army, which would not have inspired the favor of royal officials in <placeName>London</placeName> and <placeName>Dublin</placeName>. Another key obstacle was the proposed use of tin, a metal the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint deemed unsuitable for small change since it could be easily mixed with lead to make counterfeit coins. Fitting into this time frame was <persName>Ford’s</persName> proposal to mint farthings, halfpence, and three-farthings.<ref target="#CH4-n77">77</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="132"/>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ormond’s</persName> hereditary palatine rights as granted by King <persName>Edward III</persName> undoubtedly influenced his exploration of means to obtain money. This ancient right was important to the family, as evidenced by the desire to have it reaffirmed in 1625, after a dispute between <persName>Ormond’s</persName> grandfather and King <persName>James I</persName>; and again, after the restoration of the monarchy, to rectify punitive confiscations undertaken by Cromwell. In the 1662 letter of reaffirmation, <persName>Charles II</persName> returned to <persName>Ormond</persName> his ancient paternal property and the "royalties, franchises, liberties, powers and jurisdictions...within the co. [county] Palatine."<ref target="#CH4-n78">78</ref> By this act, <persName>Ormond</persName> became the last of the great Irish earls to enjoy palatine privileges.<ref target="#CH4-n79">79</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Up to this point, there is no record of the <persName>Ormonds</persName> issuing coins under their palatine rights. In fact, the only Irish earl to exercise this privilege was John de Courci (at times spelled Courcy), Earl of Ulster, who minted a series of silver farthings and halfpence in the late twelfth century that often displayed PATRIC or PATRICIVS as a legend. In <placeName>England</placeName>, several ecclesiastical mints in counties palatine minted coins. The Bishops of <placeName>Durham</placeName> issued silver halfpence and pence and the Archbishops of Canterbury and York struck pence and a limited number of twopence and groats. This activity came to an end when King <persName>Henry VIII</persName> revoked their privileges during his dispute with <placeName>Rome</placeName>. Among the English lay nobility who enjoyed palatine rights, only brief endeavors were undertaken, such as those of the Earl of Northumberland and the Earl of Chester. While the output of palatine mints was limited, they made a significant contribution to the supply of small change since moneyers at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint and other royal facilities focused on producing coins of greater value due to incentives in their indentures that based compensation on value rather than quantity produced.<ref target="#CH4-n80">80</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Another event that may have affected <persName>Ormond’s</persName> decision to strike coins was the action taken by <persName>Cecil Calvert</persName>, Second <persName>Lord Baltimore</persName> (1605— 1675), who held title in the Irish peerage. Calvert assumed the right of

coinage based on <placeName>Maryland’s</placeName> charter that gave him all the privileges of any Bishop of <placeName>Durham</placeName> within the Bishopric or County Palatine of <placeName>
                     <placeName>Durham</placeName>
                  </placeName>. Calvert had dies made in <placeName>London</placeName>, and specimens produced in 1659 that were most likely made under contract with workers at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint. Calvert’s intent was to issue money as a means to further the development of Maryland. The obverse legend on the coins illustrates his palatine rights by identifying the issuing authority as CAECILIVS D(omi)N(u)S TERRAE MARIAE, or "Cecil, Lord of Mary’s Land." This theme is carried onto the reverse where above the shield that represents the Barony of Baltimore is a coronet with an orb and cross that closely resembles the coronet of a <placeName>Europe</placeName>an count palatine. Calvert shipped £2,500 to Maryland in groats, sixpences, and shillings. Although <persName>Calvert’s</persName> coining activities raised concerns in <placeName>England</placeName> because officials wished to retain bullion for domestic use as the nation approached insolvency, the proprietor’s coins circulated freely during the remainder of the century.<ref target="#CH4-n81">81</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Unspoken in this controversy is the design of <placeName>Maryland’s</placeName> coins wherein Calvert placed his bust on the obverse. This was contrary to tradition among issuers of palatine coins. Except for the Civil War years during the reign of King <persName>Stephen</persName> (1135–1154), when coins at times depicted political or
<pb n="134"/>
religious leaders, coins struck at ecclesiastical mints prominently displayed the bust of the reigning monarch. The similarity between regal coins and those issued under palatine privileges stemmed from the control exerted by the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint that prepared dies for auxiliary mints. The display of a non-regal bust, therefore, was a noticeable break with an ancient tradition.<ref target="#CH4-n82">82</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ormond</persName> was aware of events in <placeName>Maryland</placeName> since, as a courtier in the 1660s, he had participated in numerous meetings with the king and his advisors. In regard to Maryland, he is noted in American colonial records for his involvement in two significant events. One pertained to Virginia’s attempt to control the price of tobacco, which was the mainstay of <placeName>Maryland’s</placeName> economy. In 1664, royal advisors discussed a petition sent to <persName>Charles II</persName> to restrict the planting of tobacco in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> and <placeName>Maryland</placeName>. It was decided not to impose any limitations so as not to adversely affect custom revenues. This was a key decision as the price of tobacco declined during the seventeenth century because of excessive production. While Virginia sought to stabilize prices by controlling cultivation, Maryland adopted a policy of encouraging production as a means to overcome declining income. Virginians considered <placeName>Maryland’s</placeName> actions counterproductive and, in frustration, commented: "Marylanders though earnestly solicited to comply...to lessen the quantity of tobacco have never offered the least proposall of the abatement...in consideration of their soe certaine a gain by the advancement of a price."<ref target="#CH4-n83">83</ref> Four years later, <persName>Ormond</persName> participated in another royally convened conference to delineate <placeName>Maryland’s</placeName> boundaries with <placeName>Virginia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n84">84</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There was also the matter of coins authorized by <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, starting in 1652 and continuing until 1682. The <placeName>Boston Mint</placeName> was established during an expansionist period for the Bay Colony as it annexed towns in Maine and New Hampshire, abrogating any rights original grantees may have had to these regions. By striking coins, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> offered another example of an assumption of the right to issue money at a time of fiscal

need. In fact, the legends on the coins naming the issuing authority as MASATHVSETS IN NEW <placeName>England</placeName> gave the impression of an act of sovereignty. This interpretation was presented to the English Council of Foreign Plantations against <placeName>Massachusetts’</placeName> officials by the former Governor of Maine—an obviously biased witness—and others who questioned the colony’s loyalty to the monarchy. Bay Colony officials defended themselves by arguing that their actions were based on the need to address the activities of counterfeiters as well as create money for economic development. While the initial output was limited, as production continued, the quantity of coins mounted and became sizeable by the 1660s. With denominations ranging from twopences to shillings, the coins made a valuable contribution during a period when money was scarce in the American colonies. Like Calvert’s pieces, <placeName>Massachusetts’</placeName> silver did not replicate official money, but used three different obverse designs: NE for <placeName>New England</placeName>; a willow tree; and an oak tree (Fig. 12). During the Commonwealth era, the coins generated no controversy. After the restoration of the monarchy and the reestablishment of a regal coinage, the Bay Colony’s minting activities could have proven problematic. In 1662, however, when the matter was brought to the king’s attention, he did not take colonial officials to task. It was not until the 1670s that the Crown adopted an adverse stance toward the <placeName>Boston Mint</placeName>. While <persName>Ormond’s</persName> reaction to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> money is unknown, he was certainly aware of it due to his appointment in 1661 to a royal committee charged with "framing letters, proclamations, or orders [pertaining to the American colonies] for the king’s signature."<ref target="#CH4-n85">85</ref> Enhancing his awareness, <persName>Ormond</persName> was appointed in 1662 to the Company for Propagation of the Gospel in <placeName>New England</placeName>. This institution, which received an annual subsidy of £1,000
<pb n="136"/>
from the king, was charged with "educating, clothing, and civilizing the poor natives and supporting the ministers [and], schoolmasters" in the region. This engendered involvement in <placeName>New England’s</placeName> religious affairs, which were at the center of its political life since the region’s government functioned as a Puritan theocracy.<ref target="#CH4-n86">86</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, as much a dependency of <placeName>England</placeName> as the colonies, had to find a means in the mid–1600s to address its short supply of small change. In assessing the matter, a 1652 petition to <placeName>London</placeName> authorities gives insight into contemporary thinking when it stated the shortage at £20,000 in coppers. <persName>Ormond’s</persName> request for £30,000 in farthings could have been filled by <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> five screw presses, which combined were able to produce £250 in coppers per week. Since <persName>Ormond</persName> would have desired receipt of the new money as quickly as possible, it is likely that <persName>Blondeau</persName> employed additional equipment to increase production in the opening months of operations. Between 1667 when <persName>Ormond</persName> received his "King’s letter" and the closing year of his administration as <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName> in 1669, there was sufficient time for His Lordship to have produced the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series with the aid of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> inventiveness.<ref target="#CH4-n87">87</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ormond’s</persName> solution carried the stipulation that the coins should be milled. Although there is no record outlining a relationship between <persName>Ormond</persName> and <persName>Blondeau</persName>, if the project were to succeed, <persName>Ormond</persName> had to turn to <placeName>London</placeName> to secure a skilled engineer to produce his desired milled coins. Fortunately, <persName>Ormond</persName> was acquainted with Henry <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> who had assumed full responsibility for operations at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint in late 1666 after the death of <persName>Ralph Freeman</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n88">88</ref>
                  <persName>Ormond’s</persName> connection to <persName>Henry Slingsby Is</persName> highlighted on two different occasions. The first was in 1662, when <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> worked in tandem with <persName>Ormond</persName> in an attempt to justify lowering the silver content of the money to be issued under the Viner Patent. The second occurred in 1666, when <persName>Ormond</persName> was informed of <persName>Slingsby’s</persName> interest in Fr. <persName>Peter Walsh’s</persName> Remonstrance that provided justification for Catholics
<pb n="137"/>
to support a Protestant king. <persName>Ormond</persName> saw the Remonstrance as a means to lessen tensions between Catholics and Protestants under the restored monarchy.<ref target="#CH4-n89">89</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Through such connections, if he were not otherwise aware, <persName>Ormond</persName> knew the important steps taken to modernize the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint and the key role <persName>Blondeau</persName> played in that development. Further, the Frenchman’s anti-counterfeiting methods would have appealed to anyone who wanted to avoid the abuses that had accompanied the farthings of <persName>James I</persName> and <persName>Charles I</persName>. With respect to these, the Irish had complained that there "was scarce any man, but was a loser by those farthings."<ref target="#CH4-n90">90</ref> More significantly, <persName>Ormond</persName> would have had to involve <persName>Blondeau</persName> in order to produce coins with a reeded edge—a process protected by a royal patent. Fortunately, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was known to Irish officials. Earlier, he had been retained by Cromwell’s government to explore the feasibility of reestablishing the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint in the mid–1650s. To this end <persName>Blondeau</persName> had lived in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> for almost two years and was well acquainted with the condition of the kingdom’s circulating money. As detailed in a report to the English Committee for Irish Affairs:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>the pressing necessities of a mint to be appointed in this country, by reason of the great want of the small English money; for finding it adviseable, as the only means appearing to us, to prevent the abuse of English coyne... proving bad and clipped, small payments could not easily be made either to souldiers [soldiers], or unto others, where by much distraction was occasioned.<ref target="#CH4-n91">91</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Between 1667 and 1669, the convergence of events created an optimal time for minting the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. <persName>Ormond’s</persName> desire to create a coinage for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> as a component of his drive to place <placeName>Ireland</placeName> on a firmer financial footing coupled with the necessity to provide funds to the army forced him to turn to professional moneyers in <placeName>London</placeName> to produce his milled coins. The first stage at this juncture would have been to make petitioning tokens. Such pieces were commonly issued under the endorsement of influential
<pb n="138"/>
sponsors and were at times produced in sufficient quantity to circulate widely with the expectation that they would be sanctioned eventually by a royal patent. Since <persName>Ormond</persName> already had the "King’s letter" of endorsement, it is reasonable to assume that <persName>Ormond</persName> authorized the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series as petitioning tokens while he awaited final approval to establish a <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint. In the meantime, the fiscal crisis he faced with the army could be averted. Another fortuitous event in 1667 was the adjournment of the Irish Parliament, which had become particularly contentious in the aftermath of the Act of Settlement that restored some semblance of power to Catholic members. This gave <persName>Ormond</persName> greater latitude in addressing the monetary crisis he faced.<ref target="#CH4-n92">92</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Confirming interaction between <persName>Ormond</persName> and <persName>Blondeau</persName>, which correlates to the conception date of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series is His Lordship’s receipt of several letters from <placeName>London</placeName> in 1667. The first letter stated that there existed a proposal to address the scarcity of money for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. This undoubtedly was good news in light of London's limited funds.<ref target="#CH4-n93">93</ref> Subsequently, all hope of English assistance was lost when Lord Clarendon, Chancellor of <placeName>England</placeName>, informed <persName>Ormond</persName> that not only was foreign money unavailable in any useful quantity but also that English silver and gold coins would not be sent to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n94">94</ref> Intimating that an alternative solution had been found, a third letter mentioned the enclosure of trial-pieces for a new Irish coinage. This correspondence is significant in light of a fourth letter that proposed minting between £10,000 and £12,000 in milled coins with lettered or grained edges, which implied the use of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> technology for <placeName>England’s</placeName> regal coins.<ref target="#CH4-n95">95</ref>
               </p>
               <p>While £10,000 or £12,000 was less than <persName>Ormond’s</persName> requested £30,000 to pay the army, the difference had been reduced by London's belated agreement to one of His Lordship’s demands. In September of 1667, after months of fruitless negotiation, an allocation of £20,000 was finally granted for the benefit of the army out of the prize money expected from the sale of goods seized from <placeName>Dutch</placeName> ships during the preceding months of conflict
<pb n="139"/>
between <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Holland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n96">96</ref> Shortly thereafter, <persName>Ormond</persName> received a letter regarding a new Irish coinage. <persName>Lord Arlington</persName>, a personal friend and <placeName>England’s</placeName> Secretary of State, informed him of London's concern with the pending private minting of coppers for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. Notable is the opinion expressed by the Commissioners of the Treasury that the new coins should be of intrinsic value in order to deter counterfeiters.<ref target="#CH4-n97">97</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Among these letters crossing the Irish Sea was one that <persName>Ormond</persName> forwarded to <persName>Lord Anglesey</persName> in <placeName>London</placeName> on November 20, 1667. Therein, <persName>Ormond</persName> spoke of the pending passage of a patent and expressed his wish that he could have bought-out the interest of those involved for the benefit of the king. It had been <persName>Ormond’s</persName> desire that the king would benefit from the issuance of a new Irish coinage as indicated in his initial request for £30,000 in farthings. Unfortunately, there is no record of <persName>Ormond</persName> receiving a patent to mint the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. <persName>Ormond’s</persName> failure to pursue a patent resulted from the controversy that engulfed him over the quartering of soldiers in private homes during the winter months. This action was considered an illegal act by some in <placeName>England's</placeName> House of Commons, and they called for the <persName>Lord-Lieutenant’s</persName> impeachment, which was opposed by <persName>Charles II</persName>. By this time, <persName>Ormond</persName> had undoubtedly followed the advice given by the Commissioners of the Treasury since the weight and size of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers greatly exceeds that of tokens issued by merchants, town officials, and more importantly those minted by <persName>Armstrong</persName> under his royally sanctioned patent.<ref target="#CH4-n98">98</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The premise that <persName>Ormond</persName> authorized the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series is illustrated by the differences between these coins and typical tradesmen tokens of the era, which normally carried a merchant’s name as a pledge for redemption and a legend written in English. In instances where petitioning tokens used English, their legends often referred to the king, such as one contender’s obverse that proclaimed THE KINGS GRACE, which is comparable to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> legend of FLOREAT REX. Such a regal reference would have been pretentious for tradesmen tokens. A common practice among petitioning tokens was to give their legends in Latin as does the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. This form was generally reserved for officially sanctioned money and
<pb n="140"/>
gave a clear indication that a coinage enjoyed significant approval. Another noticeable feature of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers is their size, which greatly exceeded that of common tokens of the period. Farthings authorized by <persName>James I</persName> and <persName>Charles I</persName> were exceedingly small while <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> were not much bigger. Petitioning tokens (farthings) of the 1660s were larger, having a standard size of about 24 mm. This is consistent with the smaller <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers. Just as noticeable is the weight of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers. The smaller pieces weigh about 90 grains (numismatists note common weights between 77 and 113 grains) while Maltravers’ farthings weigh a mere 13 to 15 grains and <persName>Armstrong’s</persName> were authorized at 20 grains. There is also the matter of anti-counterfeiting features, which is significant since it was unreasonable in the 1660s to entertain seriously any coinage proposal that did not have a feature to hinder false coiners. Whereas common tokens of the era did not have any means to protect their integrity, petitioning tokens generally included a plug insert or had their edges reeded (often crudely). Regal money as produced by <persName>Blondeau</persName> exhibited either a reeded or an inscribed edge as the best means available to protect money. The <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series with its reeded edge had all the hallmarks of a coinage intended to garner official support and meet with acceptance by an Irish populace.<ref target="#CH4-n99">99</ref> This is precisely what <persName>Ormond</persName> required when he requested £30,000 in milled farthings.</p>
               <p>Further evidence for associating the coinage with <persName>Ormond</persName> is the display of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> as a central device on the coins. In contrast to the oppression the Irish endured during the Civil War and the repressive years under <persName>Cromwell</persName>, the 1660s represented a difficult but comparatively peaceful decade for Catholics. The basis for this relative security was the adoption of a more conciliatory approach toward Irish Catholics by <persName>Charles II</persName>. This policy was endorsed by officials in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> as a means to gain support for the restored monarchy although the Protestant dominated Irish House of Commons was less conciliatory. In furthering this sentiment, <persName>Ormond</persName> became involved in Catholic politics, supporting the Irish Remonstrance of Fr. Walsh and Catholic loyalty to the Crown. The display of <persName>St. Patrick</persName>
                  <pb n="141"/>
in episcopal attire on the coins is consistent with <persName>Ormond’s</persName> policy of permitting Irish Catholics to retain their faith if they were loyal to the Protestant king.<ref target="#CH4-n100">100</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Another prominent symbol on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins is the crown on the obverse. This is not an ordinary crown. It is stylistically similar to the royal or imperial crown that appeared on regal money. The main feature of the double-arched royal crown is the orb and cross at its top with fleurs-de-lis below and small pellets along the outer rim. This composition is called a "jeweled" crown by <persName>C. Wilson Peck</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n101">101</ref> It was approved by <persName>Ormond</persName> for a series of halfcrowns and crowns, known as <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Money, minted in 1649 to proclaim <persName>Charles II</persName> as king. It also appeared atop the Irish harp on farthings produced under the king’s 1660 grant to <persName>Armstrong</persName>. The Viner Patent also called for the royal crown to be placed as a central device on the halfpence and atop a harp on the twopence, threepence and fourpence. This was the royal crown that appeared on the regal money of <persName>Charles II</persName>. It adorned the king on the obverse and appeared in a smaller format atop the shields of <placeName>England</placeName>, <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, <placeName>Scotland</placeName> and <placeName>France</placeName> on the reverse.<ref target="#CH4-n102">102</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The display of the royal crown on <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins held great significance as the anti-token provision in the <persName>Armstrong</persName> Patent posed a hindrance to anyone who made coppers for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> without official endorsement. In particular, the patent forbade "all other persons whatsoever to make... any other pieces of copper, upon pain of forfeiture of. ..engines used in making thereof." This anti-token sentiment was reinforced in 1661 by a proclamation of <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> Lords Justices "forbidding any person...to make, or cause to be made, any brass or copper money or tokens, without special licence from his majesty." Although <persName>Armstrong</persName> had died by 1662 along with any chance of success for his patent, the clause against token makers and the proclamation of the Lords Justices were used by officials in an attempt to stem the abuses associated with tradesmen and town tokens. It is unlikely, therefore, that <persName>Blondeau</persName> would have risked forfeiting his screw presses without some assurance that <persName>Ormond</persName> had permission to issue semi-official
<pb n="142"/>
money. The placement of the royal crown on <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, enhanced by a brass splasher, is a clear indication of <persName>Ormond’s</persName> authority.<ref target="#CH4-n103">103</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The semi-official nature of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins stands in sharp contrast to all other tokens produced in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in the seventeenth century. The display of regal emblems on a coin could only occur with official approval, and this was what <persName>Ormond</persName> had in the form of his position as the king’s representative in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> and his receipt of a "King’s letter" in regard to money. <persName>Ormond’s</persName> plans for a mint in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> had to be deferred. In the interim, <persName>Ormond</persName> brought about a coinage that evoked its semi-official status through the quality of its craftsmanship, its legends, the display of the royal crown, and its distinctive anti-counterfeiting reeded edge. By this means, he was able to address the financial needs of the army at a critical time in Irish history.</p>

               <p>Peter <persName>Blondeau</persName> (d. 1672) was an engineer involved in minting coins and medals using the improved technology of the mid–1600s. He had a distinguished career in <placeName>Italy</placeName> where his skills came to the attention of <persName>Cardinal Richelieu</persName> (Armand Jean du Plessis, Duke <persName>Richelieu</persName> [1585–1642]), supporter of the arts and chief minister to King <persName>Louis XIII</persName>. <persName>Blondeau</persName> arrived in <placeName>Paris</placeName> at a time when innovative approaches were underway to find an alternative to the manual process of producing money because French coins were heavily clipped and counterfeited. An early attempt to address this problem was advocated by <persName>Briot</persName>. In his 1617 demonstration before other moneyers, he promoted the advantages of mechanizing the process of making planchets and striking coins using a modified rocker-press. Unfortunately, this process was unable to produce coins as quickly as by hammer, and it had the noticeable disadvantage of tending to flatten the ends of planchets. In spite of these drawbacks, <persName>Briot</persName> promoted his rocker-press primarily as a means to differentiate himself from medalists who at times used screw presses. While <persName>Briot</persName> was inventive, he was most well-known for his artistry, enjoying the title of Engraver-General at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> until his forced departure for <placeName>England</placeName> in 1625. Opposed by moneyers at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint, <persName>Briot</persName> struggled to gain acceptance for a more modern method to strike English money. In addition to preparing medals, he was
<pb n="143"/>
eventually authorized to produce a limited quantity of English milled coins during two periods, 1631–1632 and 1638–1639. He also worked briefly at the Scottish Mint on two different occasions in the 1630s. Abandoning his focus on the rocker-press, <persName>Briot</persName> used screw presses to affect fine designs on his coins. In addition to these mechanical methods, <persName>Briot</persName> employed a two-step process for edge marking through the use of parallel bars and was acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">virole brisée</hi> technique. Although he was associated with the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint during the Civil War, he assisted the king in establishing an alternative mint at York. He died in <placeName>London</placeName> in 1646 and in the following year his wife sold his equipment to the government.<ref target="#CH4-n104">104</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>Briot’s</persName> career between 1642 and his death is clouded by the chaos of the Civil War years. His whereabouts during this period is important as some writers assert that <persName>Briot</persName> had a direct impact on <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> methodology. They claim that the engraver returned to <placeName>France</placeName> in 1642 after assisting <persName>Charles I</persName> at <placeName>York</placeName>. This assertion is countered by his receipt of a mint salary through December 25, 1645. There is a record of <persName>Briot</persName> briefly visiting <placeName>Paris</placeName> in 1644 where his brother, Isaac, was employed as an engraver at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName>. This may account for some of the confusion. Although <persName>Briot</persName> was briefly in <placeName>Paris</placeName> when <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> techniques were evolving, there is no record of the former renewing his employment at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> after his departure for <placeName>England</placeName> in 1625. At most, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was aware of <persName>Briot’s</persName> innovations, but the more direct influences on his evolving techniques lay elsewhere.<ref target="#CH4-n105">105</ref>
               </p>
               <p>At the time of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> arrival in <placeName>Paris</placeName>, it is important to note the division of functions within the French minting system. In the early 1600s, preparation of medals took place at the <placeName>Louvre</placeName> in a comparatively modern facility that at times used screw presses. Coins were made at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> on the Quai de Conti, employing the traditional manual process. After <persName>Briot’s</persName> departure for <placeName>England</placeName>, his former protégé, <persName>Jean Warin</persName> (1604–1672), slowly emerged as an innovative engraver. <persName>Warin’s</persName> experiments with medal making won favor with <persName>Richelieu</persName>. In an expression of his appreciation, <persName>Warin</persName> made several flattering medals of the Cardinal, including one casting

him as the genius who directs the revolution of the planets. In 1639, due to the activities of clippers and counterfeiters, the decision was made to modernize operations at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName>. New equipment was imported from Germany and <persName>Warin’s</persName> designs for a new coinage won the approval of <persName>Louis XIII</persName>. The following year, the medalist was assigned to oversee the production of <placeName>France</placeName>’s new milled money.<ref target="#CH4-n106">106</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In 1640, when <placeName>France</placeName> began to strike its coins mechanically, the task was given to the Medal Mint at the Louvre, where <persName>Blondeau</persName> was employed as an engineer. The initial focus was on producing milled gold coins followed by the production of silver money in 1641. Slowly, all 22 provincial mints were modernized with the cessation of the hammer-struck process at the Bayonne Mint in 1649. The <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> was fully modernized by 1645, whereupon operations at the Louvre returned to its traditional focus on medals. Throughout the 1640s, however, the division between the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> and the <persName>Louvre’s</persName> Medal Mint was blurred under <persName>Warin</persName> who was administrator at both facilities. It was during this creative period ushered in by <persName>Warin</persName> in the 1630s and 1640s that <persName>Blondeau</persName> arrived in <placeName>France</placeName> under the patronage of <persName>Richelieu</persName>, who was also <persName>Warin’s</persName> patron. The exact date of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> arrival in <placeName>Paris</placeName> is currently unknown although it was prior to the death of <persName>Richelieu</persName> in 1642. <persName>Blondeau</persName> was housed at the Medal Mint and undoubtedly used <persName>Warin’s</persName> new methods of striking medals, which involved a screw press adapted to raise a planchet’s rim as an alternative to pearled borders. <persName>Warin’s</persName> medals were considered exceptionally well struck with high relief, an appearance achieved through the use of more powerful screw presses. He also employed the <hi rend="italic">virole brisée</hi> technique for graining or lettering edges. <persName>Warin</persName> practiced this one-stroke method rather than casting his medals as was generally done by his predecessors. <persName>Blondeau</persName> was also involved in the use of these various technologies, becoming a noted minting engineer by the mid–1640s.<ref target="#CH4-n107">107</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="145"/>
               <p>In 1649, due to the establishment of the Commonwealth, <placeName>England</placeName> undertook a mintage in the name of the new government. At the same time, the nation faced mounting problems from coins that had been clipped, filed, and otherwise defaced to reduce their weight and create a profit for those who chose to violate English law. Worse, hammer-struck coins were easily counterfeited, threatening the integrity of the nation’s money in the same manner as had occurred in <placeName>France</placeName> a decade earlier. Sensing an opportunity to participate in the need to protect English coins, <persName>Blondeau</persName> submitted a proposal to <placeName>England's</placeName> Council of State, offering to undertake the minting of the Commonwealth’s money using a new technology he had invented. In a letter, sent to the Speaker of the House of Commons, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was described as an honest and inventive man.<ref target="#CH4-n108">108</ref> In a more expansive recommendation, his abilities were outlined as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>respecting some models for coins of a curious and new form, the invention of <persName>Peter Blondeau</persName>, a Frenchman, who presented himself to me, and offered his service to the commonwealth. I had formerly heard a fair report of his ability...and was well assured, by several men well experienced in the [<placeName>Paris] Mint</placeName>, that he is one of the ablest of his age in the art, and the only man that can do it, whereof he has made several proofs, both in gold, silver, and copper, with as much diligence and facility as is done by the ordinary mill...<persName>Cardinal Richelieu</persName>...who drew him from <placeName>Italy</placeName>, and gave him his dwelling here in the gallery of the Louvre, where his family yet remain, and where none but men of extraordinary art and skill are lodged,—he had certainly had the direction of all the coining of <placeName>France</placeName>. As for his life and carriage, he is a very honest and ingenious man, to whom all trust can be given in anything he undertakes...I can see no cause why any difficulty should be made in using him...nor can there happen to the State but a great and glorious advantage by his propositions.<ref target="#CH4-n109">109</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The hallmark of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> inventiveness was his acclaimed ability to economically stamp, inscribe, and edge coins in a one-stroke process
<pb n="146"/>
even on thin planchets. At the time, there were two basic techniques for inscribing or graining the edges on coins. The most common was the two-step method of running planchets between two parallel bars, a more costly process than leaving a plain edge on a coin. The other was the older <hi rend="italic">virole brisée,</hi> or segmented collar, method. Here, the inscribed or grained design was placed on the inner wall of a collar that surrounded the planchet (in an eighteenth-century illustration, this collar appears to be thick and is placed inside a larger collar). At the time of striking, the force of the screw press expanded the blank, which was inscribed or grained along the inside of the inner collar. Since this technology was applicable only for thick planchets and had a tendency to destroy dies rapidly, it suited the limited production of medals rather than large mintages of coins.<ref target="#CH4-n110">110</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Dissatisfied with the manual process at the <placeName>London Mint</placeName>, officials invited <persName>Blondeau</persName> to <placeName>England</placeName> in 1649 in anticipation that the "famous artist" would be able to make coins "rounder &amp; neater...after a new invention of his."<ref target="#CH4-n111">111</ref>
                  <persName>Blondeau</persName> proclaimed his new technology as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>a new Invention, not yet practiced in any State of the World; the which will prevent counterfeiting, casting, washing and clipping...and will cost no more than the ordinarie unequal Coyn, which is used...As to the way of remedying those inconveniences...by the way propounded by the said <persName>Blondeau</persName>, by marking the coyn, not only on both the flat sides, but also Upon the thickness of the edges...that it cannot bee so counterfeited.

               </p>
               <p>The foundation of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> invention was an enlargement of <persName>Warin’s</persName> screw presses to create coins with a pleasing appearance that some described as having a polished surface. His technology also produced the anticounterfeiting reeded or inscribed edge that false coiners were basically unable to duplicate because they commonly made their pieces using molds. To deter such activity, <persName>Blondeau</persName> claimed:</p>
               <pb n="147"/>
               <p>
                  <q>The ordinaire coyn marked onely on both the flat sides (can be) moulded, as the experience do shew by the great quantites of false coyn moulded, which is current now but when it is marked on the thickness or edges, the marks across the said edges can no way be moulded...where it hath been cast, to take away the superflous metal; which filing cannot be done without spoiling and taking away the said markes about the edges; and consequently make easily known not to be current.<ref target="#CH4-n113">113</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>While his detractors claimed his methods entailed the use of older techniques, <persName>Blondeau</persName> asserted he had created a new methodology: a one-stroke instead of a two-step process for marking coins that could be employed on thick as well as thin planchets and accomplish the task economically. His technology was undoubtedly a by-product of his experience in making medals at the Louvre along with his work as an engineer at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName>. In order not to divulge fully his technique, he outlined his invention in the following vague terms:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>the Engines wherewith the brims are marked, may be kept secret among few men, who shall be sworn to keep it, and not to reveal it to anie [any]...the Engines that are used therein are so big and heavie, being between 1 and 2000 l. weight...they were put to mark all the pieces at one stroke, as in the said <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> invention...it is impossible to doe it without strong and heavie Engines...The monie coined merely at the Mill can bee made with very small Engines, but that which is proposed by the said <persName>Blondeau</persName>, cannot bee coined without a great many big and heavie Engines.<ref target="#CH4-n114">114</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Blondeau</persName> made a clear distinction between his invention and techniques employed by others to mark coin edges. In discussing the differences between the various methods, the inventor proclaimed:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I could two several ways make the new extraordinary coin, marked with letters [as well as graining] at the circumference, upon the thickness of the brim; the first way is ancient, and may be known to several, but it is
<pb n="148"/>
long in doing, and can not be used upon the ordinary coin that is thin. I can do it in another manner, which is my particular invention, and no man but I can do it...I hear that some would persuade you that they can do it as well...but their pieces are made by the first way. They cannot [economically] coin your money that way, though you give them 10s. [shillings] for each pound of silver [the standard rate at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint was a shilling per pound of silver]. I offer myself to be committed to prison for two months, and if within that time you can find any man that knows my invention, not only in <placeName>England</placeName>, but all the world over, and that might coin that way I have propounded...and as cheap as I offer, I am content to lose my life, and shall acknowledge myself guilty of informing falsely...the Parliament and the Council of State.<ref target="#CH4-n115">115</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> arrival in <placeName>England</placeName> was not welcomed by officials at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint or its employees. Their opposition stemmed primarily from fear that jobs would be lost. This was an old concern dating back to the time when <persName>Briot</persName> arrived with his labor-saving innovations. There was also resentment that the proposal to modernize the mint was offered by a Frenchman rather than by an English moneyer. <persName>Blondeau</persName> attempted to alleviate fears, stating:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I intend not to remove any workmen if possible, as, for a full Mint [production at the time was at a low ebb and the Mint Committee stated that there were "hardly 30" masters currently employed and others, when there was additional work, were hired by the day and paid between 12 and 18 pence for their labor while the moneyers claimed that 200 families were maintained by the mint—an obvious exaggeration], I should need 200 or 300, and had rather employ those already there than new men, and I am willing to teach them my way...but I beg leave to turn out such as are lazy or stubborn.<ref target="#CH4-n116">116</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Although instructed to assist the Frenchman, the mint’s technologically inexperienced chief administrator, <persName>Guerdain</persName>, wanted <persName>Blondeau</persName> merely to show the moneyers his new techniques and thereafter return to <placeName>Paris</placeName>. <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> assessment of their interaction was expressed in his letter to Parliament in 1650:</p>
               <pb n="149"/>
               <p>
                  <q>having applied myself several times unto the said Doctor, he told me plainly, that if I was to come to be an officer of the mint, they were already too many, and that the workmen were more than they had need for the coyning of their moneys, which they would do so well...The said Doctor hath told me himself in plain tearms, that he would doe his utmost to hinder my proposition.<ref target="#CH4-n117">117</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>While unstated, there undoubtedly was resentment among moneyers regarding <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> salary request. For the most part, salaries at the facility were outdated with many left unchanged since the end of the Elizabethan era. Aside from <persName>Guerdain</persName>, whose annual compensation was set at £400, the next highest paid official and second in charge, the mint warden, received only £100, while the mint’s comptroller and assay masters received slightly more than £66. The mint’s noted engraver, <persName>Thomas Simon</persName> (1618–1665), was paid a mere £30 although he received additional compensation for engraving medals and seals. This was in contrast to <persName>Blondeau</persName>, who received £100 plus additional fees for the use of his technology when he was finally assigned to striking Commonwealth coins. It is possible, given the lack of pay <persName>Blondeau</persName> received during his initial stay in <placeName>London</placeName>, that he was a man of some private means, especially considering he paid for the preparation of his own specimens during his trial with <persName>David</persName> Ramage who spent over £107 of the mint’s money to produce a limited edition of coins. Another indication of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> financial wellbeing was the honorary title of "Gentleman" used by Cromwell in authorizing the inventor’s £100 stipend in 1656.<ref target="#CH4-n118">118</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Attempting to discredit <persName>Blondeau</persName>, English moneyers argued that the Frenchman’s invention was not new, insisting that it was a mere modification of existing technology. To prove their point, employees requested a trial between them and <persName>Blondeau</persName>. The contestants were instructed to mark the edges of their specimens with various terms such as TRUTH AND PEACE on the halfcrown, to which <persName>Blondeau</persName> added PETRVS BLONDAEVS INVENTOR FECIT. With the equipment available at the mint, which is
<pb n="150"/>
believed to have included <persName>Briot’s</persName> machinery, Ramage, a former assistant to <persName>Briot</persName> and now Mint Provost, acted on behalf of the moneyers and submitted a dozen pieces while <persName>Blondeau</persName> prepared 300 specimens to promote his new innovation. The Mint Committee, on examining the coins, declared: "the coin offered by the Frenchman...is a better fashion of money than the present fashion of money of <placeName>England</placeName>, and is for the honour and advantage of the Commonwealth" and worthy of further consideration.<ref target="#CH4-n119">119</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Unknown to Ramage was the assistance that <persName>Thomas Simon</persName> had given to <persName>Blondeau</persName>. <persName>Simon</persName>, as chief engraver at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint, was instructed to supply Ramage with "Puncheons of the State’s Arms, and tools" to enable the moneyer to make his specimens. Apparently, <persName>Simon</persName> delayed in complying with this request, forcing mint officials to appoint Violet to secure the equipment, if <persName>Simon</persName> continued his obstruction. Meanwhile, <persName>Simon</persName> secretly engraved <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> dies, which greatly aided <persName>Blondeau</persName> in producing his finely executed specimens. While Ramage accused <persName>Blondeau</persName> of receiving unauthorized assistance during their trial, <persName>Simon’s</persName> involvement remained a secret.<ref target="#CH4-n120">120</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As an inducement to gain acceptance of his technology, <persName>Blondeau</persName> argued that it would generate a profit for the Commonwealth, an attractive offer given the government’s limited resources:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>profits of the State will be 7s. [shillings] per lb. on gold and 5Ud. [pence] on silver; so that if 30,000£. sterling, that is 10,000 lbs. troy, be coined weekly, as formerly [mint production at the time was substantially below this amount], the profit will be 12,000£. yearly, and 91,000£. yearly if 5,000 lbs. of gold be coined weekly...The instruments will cost 1,000£. and the buildings 400£. I undertake...to employ no men but those approved by the Mint Committee. I will use the new way, known only to myself, of marking the coins on the edge, the old way spoiling many stamps and engines, and being impracticable on thin money. The
<pb n="151"/>
cost hitherto of coining by the hammer has been greater than that now propounded.<ref target="#CH4-n121">121</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Exerting their influence, the mint employees requested additional time to prove their ability to match <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> workmanship—a request that was granted although it produced no better results. The main obstacle facing Ramage was his limited skills at edge making and his reliance on outdated methods, including the use of the <hi rend="italic">virole brisée</hi> technique. In an attempt to achieve acceptable results, Ramage increased the thickness of some of his planchets beyond normal specifications. In spite of such efforts, the edges of his specimens were described as being crudely constructed.<ref target="#CH4-n122">122</ref> In frustration, the moneyers threatened <persName>Blondeau</persName>, calling him a counterfeiter for replicating official money, and stated, "what became of the Coyner [<persName>Mestrell</persName>, who was hanged] that made mill-monie in Queen <persName>Elizabeth’s</persName> time" would be his fate.<ref target="#CH4-n123">123</ref>
                  <persName>Blondeau</persName> also indulged in threatening tones when he accused Ramage of being "a man ill-affected to the present Government" and accused his detractors of culling the heavier coins made at the facility for personal gain.<ref target="#CH4-n124">124</ref> In defense of their actions, the moneyers proclaimed:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>we are an antient [ancient] Corporation and Company, setted by charter for many hundred yeares, and in all ages faithfully discharged our trust, and never any blot lay upon us...We do humbly hope to have so much Justice that wee shall still bee imployed in the service of the State, in regard it is the livelihood and subsistence of above two hundred Families, when the Mint is full of work, and in regard wee undertake to do it as exactly as any French-man in the world...and you may be assured that we shall discharge all and any trust that shall be put into our hands, by the just dealing you have in all ages received from us...&amp; therefore humbly hope our fidelitie and sufficiencie to doe what we undertake, shall not be put into the scale with a French-man.<ref target="#CH4-n125">125</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="152"/>
               <p>Ironically, <persName>Violet</persName>, an outspoken critic of the mint and of <persName>Guerdain’s</persName> inexperience as a moneyer, used the arrival of <persName>Blondeau</persName> as another reason to attack officials. From his misguided perspective, <persName>Violet</persName> claimed <persName>Guerdain</persName> turned to <persName>Blondeau</persName> to solve production problems, stating: "moneyers of the Mint, finding a Frenchmen coming to work by a new way, seeing the Mint daily decay...arising for want of skilful officers."<ref target="#CH4-n126">126</ref> Of course, <persName>Violet</persName> had his own reasons for opposing <persName>Blondeau</persName>, including his desire to replace <persName>Guerdain</persName> as chief administrator.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately for the Frenchman, the Council of State continued to allow the nation’s money to be hammer-struck. In an attempt to gain a contract to produce <placeName>England's</placeName> money, <persName>Blondeau</persName> proposed to "coin money marked on both sides and the edge at...extremely low terms" with the additional proviso that his brother, a fellow worker at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName>, be allowed to join him. He also requested an "Act of naturalization" and "a grant of coin to myself and children...[and]...I will teach any man selected my secret, till my children can manage it."<ref target="#CH4-n127">127</ref> Still, the Council of State continued to delay its approval since the expense of modernizing the mint, which was estimated by <persName>Blondeau</persName> at £1,400, was deemed too costly by the cash strapped government. The lack of funds was especially felt at the mint, which had historically operated at a profit. Between 1649 and 1654, however, the facility generated an overall loss that would have hindered <persName>Guerdain’s</persName> support for any modernization effort even if he had approved of it. In 1654, a frustrated <persName>Blondeau</persName> requested that he either be made an employee of the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint or be allowed to return to <placeName>Paris</placeName> with indemnification for his efforts as promised in his earlier agreement with the Council of State. Fortunately, the Frenchman’s talents had attracted the attention of <persName>Cromwell</persName>, who instructed the Council of State to address <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> concerns "speedily," whereupon the engineer was offered an opportunity to establish a mint in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> to address <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> inadequate
<pb n="153"/>
supply of money. Since the kingdom was being inundated with large quantities of counterfeit money, the establishment of a mint was deemed by <placeName>Dublin</placeName> officials as "the only expedient left to retrieve the affairs and the trade of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>."<ref target="#CH4-n128">128</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Sent to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> in 1654 with the meager sum of £50 to cover expenses, <persName>Blondeau</persName> explored the feasibility of establishing a mint. Although this initial amount was later supplemented, he was never given sufficient funds to accomplish the task. In spite of this obstacle, he undertook the assignment because he was promised "if he punctually performs his agreement, he might then be admitted to the charge [employment] of the Mint in <placeName>England</placeName>,"<ref target="#CH4-n129">129</ref> which was his prerequisite for remaining in <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
               <p>One of the key obstacles <persName>Blondeau</persName> faced in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was posed by the arrival in 1655 of <persName>Henry Cromwell</persName> (1628–1674), the Lord Protector’s son. Appointed Acting Commander of the Commonwealth’s Irish forces, the young and inexperienced officer actually governed the kingdom, although the titular head of government was <persName>Charles</persName> Fleetwood, who had returned to England. The main fiscal problem <persName>Henry</persName> faced was <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> inability to raise sufficient revenues to cover its expenses. This necessitated a subsidy from <placeName>England</placeName>, creating a debt of £1,566,848 by 1656. <placeName>England</placeName>, having its own financial troubles, resented sending scarce funds across the Irish Sea, and in 1655, the monthly subsidy was reduced from £24,000 to £17,000. By 1657, it was reduced further to £8,000 per month. As a result, the kingdom was unable to pay the expenses of government and its debt mounted. <placeName>England</placeName> was less than sympathetic to <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> financial condition and reacted with hostility to requests for additional funds, going so far as to threaten to imprison Irish representatives to the English House of Commons, if they persisted with their demands for more money. Supporting <placeName>England's</placeName> policy of retrenchment, <persName>Henry</persName> called on Irish officials to reduce expenses. During this period, <persName>Henry</persName> developed a close relationship with the mathematician Robert Wood, who arrived in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in 1656. Wood proposed a scheme for a decimal coinage entitled "Ten to One" that probably became an additional obstacle to <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> efforts. Taking a post in <persName>Henry’s</persName> household, Wood’s

interest in the nation’s monetary affairs elevated him to the important position of Receiver-General of Revenues for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in 1658. Into this austere fiscal environment, <persName>Blondeau</persName> arrived with the mission to establish a mint that would require the expenditure of funds not readily available.<ref target="#CH4-n130">130</ref>
               </p>
               <p>While <persName>Blondeau</persName> spent almost two years in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, the limited financial support he received prevented him from accomplishing his task. In spite of the project’s merit, <placeName>England</placeName> in the 1650s was unable to commit the needed funds for the same reason it was unable to finance the modernization of the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint. Again frustrated, <persName>Blondeau</persName> left <placeName>Dublin</placeName>. Not wishing to see their talented engineer return to <placeName>France</placeName>, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was granted a yearly pension of £100 plus an additional fee to strike £2,000 in silver coins "after his new invention."<ref target="#CH4-n131">131</ref> This was a limited project compared to the £100,000 production undertaken by the mint employees. Initially, <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> operations were to be carried out at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint. Ill feelings between him and the moneyers ran so high, however, that the Lieutenant of the Tower had to be called to protect the engineer and his assistants. Fearing for his safety, officials granted <persName>Blondeau</persName> the use of Worcester House, which was shortly thereafter exchanged for Drury House, a government workplace beyond the walls of the <placeName>London</placeName> Tower. Unfortunately, production was hindered because some of the rooms at the new site were being pulled down and his request for £1,440 for equipment was only partially satisfied, adding further to his general frustration with the mint.<ref target="#CH4-n132">132</ref>

               <p>Overcoming obstructions, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was able to please Commonwealth officials with his work, leading to authorization to increase his role in producing the nation’s money. The assigned task was the creation of a new Commonwealth series that depicted the bust of <persName>Cromwell</persName> on the obverse, replacing the shield as a symbol of official money (Figs. 13–14). The intent was to generate a weekly output of £10,000 in milled coins. In December of 1657, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was granted £1,000 to begin retooling the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint. Limited production was achieved in the following spring. <persName>Simon</persName>, who had worked with <persName>Blondeau</persName> on previous occasions, was selected as the engraver for the project. The new coinage was to have inscribed or grained edges, employing the engineer’s technology. The Latin edge inscription warned, "Let no one remove these [letters] from me under penalty of death." Unfortunately, production was cut short due to <persName>Cromwell’s</persName> death on September 3, 1658, which led to <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> departure for <placeName>France</placeName> in late 1658 or early 1659.<ref target="#CH4-n133">133</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Contributing to <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> decision to return to <placeName>France</placeName> was the volatile political environment in England. Although succeeded by his son, <persName>Richard Cromwell</persName> (1628–1712), there was a mounting call for the restoration of the monarchy. The resulting chaos created an uncertain future for the Frenchman who had served the interests of the Commonwealth. In addition, the production of silver and gold coins, which constituted a significant portion of his income, had all but ceased. Most disheartening was the Commonwealth’s failure to reimburse properly its Chief Engraver, <persName>Simon</persName>, which foretold <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> fate. The extent of <persName>Simon’s</persName> difficulties
<pb n="156"/>
in receiving payment is outlined in the engraver’s letter to the Council of State:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A year ago, I presented you [Council of State] my account for coins, public seals for <placeName>England</placeName>, <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, and <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, divers medals and chains of gold, silver and gilt boxes and presses for the seals which I have made for the present Government... I beg you to consider that I and my servants have wrought 5 years without recompense, and that the interest I have to pay for gold and silver eats up my profits. I beg payment of 1,028£. 15s. 8d. due...that I may pay my creditors [six months later, <persName>Simon</persName> was paid only for the medals, receiving £171 17s].<ref target="#CH4-n134">134</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In 1660, the monarchy was restored in England. <persName>Charles III</persName> inaugurated a new mintage to replace the despised Commonwealth coins as well as to promote his reign. In the rush to make as many coins as possible, the outdated hammer-struck method was initially retained. In assessing the appearance of the new money, <persName>Samuel Pepys</persName>, noted diarist of the 1660s, stated, "how good they are in the stamp and bad in the money, for lack of skill to make them."<ref target="#CH4-n135">135</ref> Soon, it became evident that clippers and counterfeiters had resumed their prior activity of threatening the integrity of the nation’s money. In response, Slingsby, who befriended <persName>Blondeau</persName> in the 1650s and was now Deputy Master-Worker at the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint, secured permission for <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> return to <placeName>England</placeName>, noting the engineer’s ability to make vast improvements in striking the new money. While <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> desired <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> speedy return, the Frenchman was in Warsaw in the service of King <persName>John II Casimir</persName>. Noting that his tenure in <placeName>Poland</placeName> would be brief, <persName>Blondeau</persName> designated <persName>Charles</persName> Ranvile as his representative to negotiate terms for his return to England. By late 1661, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was in <placeName>Paris</placeName> and <persName>Simon</persName>, who had prepared the Frenchman’s dies in the 1650s, went to <placeName>France</placeName> in November of 1661 to persuade a reluctant <persName>Blondeau</persName> to come to England. The task took two months to accomplish with <persName>Blondeau</persName> arriving in <placeName>London</placeName> in early 1662.<ref target="#CH4-n136">136</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="157"/>
               <p>Not wishing to see a repeat of the difficulties he endured during the prior decade, <persName>Blondeau</persName> set as a precondition for undertaking the modernization of the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint his receipt of a patent to protect his techniques and a guaranteed income. In 1662, the Crown awarded him an exclusive patent for 21 years, protecting his technology to inscribe and grain the edges of the nation’s silver and gold coins valued at sixpence or more. Shortly thereafter, he was given a patent for a term of 14 years, which pertained to the minting of coppers. Further, he was authorized to modernize the <placeName>London Mint</placeName>, a project he undertook with <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> who was promoted to Joint Master-Worker in 1662. The cost of placing the mint on a modern footing exceeded his earlier estimate from the 1650s, almost doubling to £2,709. As for compensation, <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> patent provided him with certain fees:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>allowance for 21 years of 3d. on every lb. of silver, and 1s. on every lb. of gold, to be coined according to his new invention...with order to all the Mint officers concerned to swear to keep the invention secret, unless it fail; and with prohibition to any others to use the same tools for 14 years. If moneys are made by press and mill, without marking the edges, he is only to have 2d. in the lb. on silver, and 8d. on gold; and if [with] hammer, 1d. for silver, and 4d. for gold. He is also to have the use of certain buildings in the Tower, the title of Engineer to the Mint, the privileges of Mint officers, and an annuity of 100£. a year for 21 years.<ref target="#CH4-n137">137</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It was during the period between 1662 and 1664 that <persName>Blondeau</persName> focused on producing the regal shillings, halfcrowns, crowns, guineas and two guineas that <persName>Charles II</persName> wanted as a replacement for Commonwealth money. This was an impressive start for a newly installed operation. In 1663, a warrant was issued for minting silver pence to ease the shortage of small change. Their production began between 1664 and 1665.<ref target="#CH4-n138">138</ref> Later, <persName>Blondeau</persName> produced the five guinea in 1668 and the half guinea in 1669, thereby completing the regal series of silver and gold coins of the 1660s. Although never placed into production, <persName>Blondeau</persName> prepared various pattern specimens during the decade in anticipation of the Crown undertaking a mintage of copper farthings and halfpence. While other contenders
<pb n="158"/>
presented specimens with plain edges that offered no protection against counterfeiters who had busily replicated farthings authorized by <persName>James I</persName> and <persName>Charles I</persName>, <persName>Blondeau</persName> submitted the first known English copper with an inscribed edge. On one of his 1662 pattern farthings, he inscribed MONETAE • INSTAVRATOR •' 1662 • X • and on another ISTA • FAMA • PER • AETHERA • VOLAT • ' ' • X •, which translate as, "the initiator of the coinage" and "its fame flies through the air," respectively.<ref target="#CH4-n139">139</ref> In addition, <persName>Blondeau</persName> prepared specimens with grained and plain edges. In 1665, he produced more pattern farthings with the elaborate edges mentioned above, as well as with grained and plain edges. Intended as presentation pieces, specimens were also struck in silver and gold.<ref target="#CH4-n140">140</ref> In the year that he received the patent to protect his invention, <persName>Blondeau</persName> obtained a "warrant appointing him a free denizen, in order to enable him better to govern his workmen" along with permission "to exercise any trade within the kingdom," which gave him license to undertake private ventures.<ref target="#CH4-n141">141</ref> This enabled <persName>Blondeau</persName> to participate in the common practice among mint employees of striking tokens for various tradesmen and towns in the British Isles and laid the groundwork for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series.</p>
               <p>Token making reappeared on a large scale in 1648 due to a deficiency in the supply of small change that people used to transact daily business. Although many tokens were minted locally, some merchants and many town officials turned to professional moneyers in <placeName>London</placeName> for the production of their pieces. Ramage of the <persName>Blondeau</persName> trials of the 1650s was a prolific producer of tokens. <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> involvement in this enterprise can be seen from the inventory of his estate at the time of his death in 1672. His ownership of five screw presses that he had imported from <placeName>Poland</placeName> suggests that <persName>Blondeau</persName> played a significant role in token production. Since <persName>Blondeau</persName> probably acquired one or more of these presses as early as 1664, when he was granted a "Pass" to visit Poland, it can be assumed that he was in the token manufacturing business by the time <persName>Ormond</persName> was looking for an engineer to manufacture money for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n142">142</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="159"/>
               <p>The hardships of the mid–1660s contrasted with the prosperity <persName>Blondeau</persName> achieved after returning to <placeName>England</placeName>. The plague reappeared in 1665, which at its height killed 10,000 persons weekly, forcing people to flee the city. This disaster was followed the next year by the Great <placeName>London</placeName> Fire that raged for a week, destroying large sections of the capital. These two catastrophes forced the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint to reduce its output, while people hoarded money as was common in troubled times. Exasperated by the difficulty of obtaining bullion, the king levied an import tax on wines, vinegar, cider, and beer and assumed the cost of mintage, announcing that, "all persons who shall bring bullion, etc. to the mint...should have the same there assayed, melted down, and coined...without any charge.and should receive in return an equal weight of the current coins of the kingdom."<ref target="#CH4-n143">143</ref> These events led to a decline in <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> income since payments to him were based on coin production at the rate of three pence per pound for silver and 12 pence per pound for gold coins. In such times, his possession of five screw presses served as an alternative means to earn money and made him available for <persName>Ormond’s</persName> coining venture.<ref target="#CH4-n144">144</ref>
               </p>
               <p>A return to better times started in 1667. In that year, <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> endeavors to modernize the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint were fully realized when staff positions were reorganized. <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> friend, <persName>Slingsby</persName>, was appointed Master-Worker or chief administrator; and the Frenchman gained new status upon assignment to the department of the Master-Worker. In addition, several positions that reflected the time when coins were hammer-struck were either eliminated or destined to be phased out upon termination of existing contracts. Finally, many employees received pay increases in recognition of the new skills required to operate a modern facility. With this restructuring of operations, a century-old conflict that dated to the time Mestrell first introduced the screw press for coining under Elizabeth came to an end.<ref target="#CH4-n145">145</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Until his death in 1672, <persName>Blondeau</persName> produced an array of coins that reflected his technology. On visiting the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> in 1663, the diarist <persName>Pepys</persName> marveled at the new technological advances and anti-counterfeiting

methods in use and was informed that the Frenchman diligently protected his methodology as a secret.<ref target="#CH4-n146">146</ref> It was not until 1679 that <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> methods were discovered by outsiders, as revealed in correspondence between the French Minister of Finance and <placeName>France</placeName>’s Ambassador in <placeName>London</placeName>. Shortly thereafter, the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> was in possession of his secret, which was improved upon by Jean Castaing.<ref target="#CH4-n147">147</ref>

               <p>The <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series is comprised of four types: small and large coppers (Figs. 15–16), silver pieces, and a gold specimen. To assist the reader in differentiating between the coppers, I use the common numismatic designation of farthings for the small and halfpence for the large coin. While there is no known historical document that establishes this distinction at the time of issue, this assigned value was given in 1699 by the numismatist <persName>John Sharpe</persName> in his <hi rend="italic">Archbishop <persName>Sharpe’s</persName> observations on the coinage of <placeName>England</placeName>

designation is current today although the weight discrepancy between the two types of coppers raises consideration that this assignment of values should not be taken as definitive. Philip L. <persName>Mossman</persName> drew attention to this topic in <hi rend="italic">Money of the American Colonies and Confederation.</hi> Updating his premise, <persName>Mossman</persName> presented additional evidence that both the small and large coppers may have been intended as halfpence with the replacement of the large by the small coin to ensure profitability.<ref target="#CH4-n148">148</ref>
               </p>
               <p>An alternative interpretation was offered by <persName>John Lindsay</persName>, who stated that the coppers were "considered by the Dean of <persName>St. Patrick</persName>, and other distinguished Numismatists, as pennies and halfpence, and I am inclined to agree."<ref target="#CH4-n149">149</ref> This is in keeping with the type of tradesmen and town tokens circulating in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in the mid–1600s. At the time, the prevalence of Irish tokens in descending order were pence followed by halfpence and then farthings with the last constituting an insignificant number. As noted in George C. Williamson’s <hi rend="italic">Trade Tokens: Issued in Seventeenth Century in <placeName>England</placeName>, Wales, and <placeName>Ireland</placeName>,</hi> of the 160 Irish tokens dated prior to 1670 and stamped with an identifying denomination, 153 were pence, five were halfpence, and two were farthings.<ref target="#CH4-n150">150</ref> Cork uttered a typical town token with an obverse naming the corporation, A CORK PENNY 1659, and the reverse legend, THE ARMS OF CORK (Fig. 17). A common design for tradesmen tokens included the merchant’s name on the obverse and place of utterance on the reverse. Lending further support to Lindsay’s premise is the light weight of common Irish tokens in comparison to the heavier St.

Patrick coppers. Finally, there is the 1670 reference to Irish tokens by the newly appointed <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>, who sought permission to suppress their use as money. In his correspondence with <placeName>London</placeName>, he called for an end to "making and passing of all sorts of brass pence and halfpence" without any mention of farthings.<ref target="#CH4-n151">151</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As often happened with tokens, as they fell into disfavor, their value declined. This correlates with <persName>Swift’s</persName> comment in his <hi rend="italic">Drapier Letters</hi> that <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers now pass as farthings and halfpence, indicating that they had previously been worth more. In some instances, to denote their lessened value, Irish tokens were counterstamped, as when HAPNEY was struck over 1D on <persName>Marcus Archer’s</persName> penny token and when V D was struck over HIS 1D on Andrew Robeson’s token (Fig. 18). One token, uttered in Clonakilty had farthing stamped over PENNY to indicate its greatly reduced value. Another practice was to devalue tokens officially. In 1672, Kilkenny announced that the penny pieces it authorized during the mayoralty of <persName>Thomas Adams</persName> were to pass thereafter as farthings. The refusal of merchants to redeem their tokens also negatively affected their value. In one such instance, Kilkenny threatened to officially devalue <persName>John Beavor’s</persName> pence unless he gave assurance for their future redemption.<ref target="#CH4-n152">152</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In <persName>Ormond’s</persName> time, two of the more productive counties uttering tokens were Kilkenny, where <persName>Ormond</persName> maintained his primary residence, and Tipperary, which had been held by the family as a county palatine since the fourteenth century. The Corporation of Kilkenny uttered halfpence and pence in the late 1650s with one marked, FOR THE POORE, while <persName>Thomas Davis</persName> uttered a penny referring to the Excise Office. Most common

were various merchant tokens uttered as pence in the 1650s and 1660s. <persName>Richard Inwood</persName> depicted a windmill that stood for the inn he operated; the goldsmith <persName>William Keovgh</persName> displayed a mermaid; <persName>Edward Sewall</persName>, a tallow chandler, illustrated a candle-maker; and many others engraved their family’s arms on their tokens. Tipperary uttered numerous merchant tokens. Among these, <persName>Edmond Kearney</persName> made four varieties of pence plus one type of halfpence while <persName>Robert Hutchinson</persName> made two unspecified denominations of different sizes. Notable in this assortment of tokens is that of <persName>Kearney</persName>, featuring the <persName>Kearney Crux</persName> on the reverse. This symbolically represented <persName>St. Patrick’s</persName> crozier, a relic held by the family until it was donated to the Archbishop of <placeName>Cashill</placeName> in the 1800s. Another illustrated the county’s cathedral. Of the 779 Irish tokens identified by <persName>Williamson</persName>, 163 were associated with <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, 77 with Antrim in <placeName>northern Ireland</placeName>, 65 with Cork, 50 with Galway, 38 with Tipperary, and 27 with <persName>Kilkenny</persName>. Some counties uttered very few tokens. For example, only eight were vented in Wicklow, five in Clare, three in Longford, one in Leitrim, and none in Mayo.<ref target="#CH4-n153">153</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Coppers had been a fixture in English and Irish monetary affairs since the Elizabethan era. The queen’s halfpence and pence minted between 1601 and 1602 to finance the suppression of the O’Neill Rebellion were deemed pledge pieces and were considered not much better than tokens. Under <persName>James</persName> i and <persName>Charles I</persName>, farthings were authorized under various private patents, producing controversial pieces due to their light weight. The continuing rise in the price of silver led to a sharp decline in the minting of halfpence during the reign of <persName>Charles I</persName> and an end to their issuance in the 1650s. The demise of silver farthings had occurred a century earlier. This gave rise to the potential use of an alternative metal to make small change. The Commonwealth explored the possibility of minting copper farthings. Pattern pieces were prepared, but the venture did not proceed beyond this initial stage. A major obstacle was the limited supply of domestic copper, since <placeName>England's</placeName> mining industry had collapsed during the Civil War. <persName>Violet</persName>, an old foe of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName>, proposed making farthings with copper imported from <placeName>Sweden</placeName>. The importation of foreign metal, however, was contrary to the economic principles of mercantilism, which gave rise to the idea of

using locally mined tin in 1661. Although an abundant domestic metal, the use of tin was opposed by the <placeName>London Mint</placeName>, since it could be easily mixed with lead by counterfeiters. Officials deemed "copper is the fittest metal."<ref target="#CH4-n154">154</ref> As an alternative to copper from Sweden, a former adversary whose coffers officials were not pleased to enrich, an experiment was conducted to import it from <placeName>Japan</placeName>. The Comptroller of the Mint gave an "Account of the said copper, that it is equal to the best Swedish copper in fineness and is pliant and easy to work."<ref target="#CH4-n155">155</ref> In the end, the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint decided on copper, but only pattern farthings and halfpence were made. Their detail, especially those with a reeded edge, reflect the quality of craftsmanship that could be achieved with <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> new technology. The decision to produce English regal coppers, however, was delayed until 1672. Until this date, the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint focused on making bullion coins rather than retooling its operations to accommodate the production of farthings and halfpence.<ref target="#CH4-n156">156</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The silver <persName>St. Patrick</persName> pieces with their varying weights have generated a debate among numismatists concerning their use as a circulating medium of exchange (Fig. 19). The historical record of the period clearly shows that <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was saddled with an array of heavily worn English bullion coins that were clipped, outdated, counterfeited, and otherwise lacked full value. This was a great concern to Irish officials and merchants. This deplorable situation was made worse by an array of Irish silver coins of questionable value produced during the Civil War. As a potential solution to this state of affairs, Commonwealth officials sent <persName>Blondeau</persName> to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> in the mid–1650s to explore the feasibility of reestablishing the mint.

                  <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> desire for silver coins was a proposal submitted to officials circa 1660, requesting permission to mint £100,000 in various denominations up to threepence.<ref target="#CH4-n157">157</ref> Later, when the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint began its production of new English bullion coins, it was well known that production would not be sufficient to satisfy <placeName>England's</placeName> monetary needs let alone <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName>. This problem gave rise to the contemplation of a separate Irish silver mintage by the English treasury in 1668.<ref target="#CH4-n158">158</ref> The production of bullion coins for circulation would have been in keeping with <persName>Ormond’s</persName> mission to create a new supply of money.<ref target="#CH4-n159">159</ref>

               <p>Numismatists generally refer to the silver pieces as shillings, a denomination ascribed to them by <persName>James Simon</persName>, who stated that the coins were intended "to pass for shillings" although other writers of the early 1700s described them as medals.<ref target="#CH4-n160">160</ref> Part of the dispute surrounding them is the lack of any mark to denote their denomination although <persName>Charles II</persName> shillings, halfcrowns, and crowns of the 1660s also lacked an indication of value. The size of a coin along with its metal content was deemed sufficient to indicate its denomination: the English shilling had a diameter varying between 25 mm and 26 mm while the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> silver pieces have approximately the same diameter, varying between 24 mm and 25 mm; the halfcrown measured between 33 mm and 34 mm and the crown between 38 mm and 40 mm. It was not until 1668 that silver pence started to be stamped with an indication of value.<ref target="#CH4-n161">161</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The existence of a gold coin within the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series has generated questions regarding its significance. As with silver coins of the 1660s, the specimen lacks any indication of value. Given the general consensus among numismatists that only one genuine specimen exists, any assumption regarding its contribution to the series must be guarded.</p>
               <pb n="166"/>
               <p>Absent any documentary evidence to the contrary, the existence of finely designed silver and gold coins in the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series is indicative of their execution by London's professional moneyers. As <persName>Peck</persName> stated, nonregal coins executed in bullion constitutes almost conclusive evidence of involvement by <placeName>London</placeName> Mint workers, which adds support to the argument for <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> involvement.<ref target="#CH4-n162">162</ref> Furthermore, the existence of bullion coins is an indication of <persName>Ormond’s</persName> intent to create a proper coinage for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> as well as to introduce money whose design would hinder counterfeiters.</p>
               <p>The production of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series is unique in Irish numismatics. In discerning its origins, numismatists have limited records available, which are often contradictory. In discussing the series, therefore, a different approach has been adopted herein that bases its mintage on the technology available to make coppers in the seventeenth century. From this vantage point, there are three specific hallmarks that distinguish the coins from all other English and Irish coppers made prior to 1675: first, the edge is vertically reeded by means of a mechanical process; second, the technique was applied to thin planchets; and third, the method was able to produce coins at an affordable cost.</p>
               <p>Prior to <persName>Blondeau</persName>, there were two methods of placing a reeded edge on a coin. The older <hi rend="italic">virole brisée</hi> or segmented collar method was not applicable to thin coins and had a tendency to destroy dies prematurely, which confined its use primarily to medals. In minting coins, the use of parallel bars was a common method in the 1600s although it was more suitable for thick planchets and was not feasible economically for low valued coppers. In contrast to these methods, the one-stroke process invented by <persName>Blondeau</persName> worked economically on thin planchets. Evidence that a separate edging machine was not the primary method employed in manufacturing the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series was presented by the coins. Planchets that pass through two grooved parallel bars for graining generally reveal the common side effect of an overlap or double graining at two opposite points on the coin, a feature that results from slippage as the planchet is processed. This feature is noticeable on bullion coins produced at the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> during the period when the two-step edging process was employed.<ref target="#CH4-n163">163</ref> There are some
<pb n="167"/>
                  <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings that also exhibit this feature. In addition, there are a limited number of farthings with a circumferential line that at times oscillates across the vertical graining. This feature also appeared on some of the first shillings produced by <persName>Blondeau</persName> for <persName>Charles II</persName> in 1663, and is often described as a center line, a marking of unknown meaning. It can be reasonably stated that in the production rush <persName>Blondeau</persName> encountered on becoming <persName>Ormond’s</persName> minter in 1667, he used various equipment at hand to produce as many coins as quickly as possible in order to satisfy the army. This was similar to the pressure he encountered in minting regal money in 1662 and 1663, when <persName>Charles II</persName> wanted to replace <persName>Cromwell’s</persName> "usurper’s coin" as quickly as possible. During this first stage in the production of <persName>Charles II’s</persName> milled money, equipment other than <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> was employed in a limited capacity to increase output at the <placeName>London Mint</placeName>. This decision was further necessitated by the king’s proclamation that no Commonwealth money would be accepted in payment to the Crown after May 1, 1662. By 1663, £495,653— two-thirds of the Commonwealth’s coins—had been removed from circulation. To satisfy both the king’s desire to issue his own money as well as to have an adequate supply to replace <persName>Cromwell’s</persName> money, <persName>Blondeau</persName> had to accelerate production. He accomplished this task between 1662 and 1663 by minting £801,756 in silver and £32,417 in gold coins. Such a high mintage would not be matched until the Great Recoinage at the end of the century when five auxiliary mints were used to assist the <placeName>London</placeName> Mint in the effort to upgrade the nation’s money. Once production reduced in intensity in 1664, the center line and overlap in graining disappeared on regal coins, which led to current speculation that <persName>St. Patrick</persName> farthings with such markings are among the first coppers <persName>Blondeau</persName> made for <persName>Ormond</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n164">164</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The process of producing the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series with its reeded edge was achieved by using heavier than normal screw presses to force metal to the perimeter of a planchet, where it was contained by a collar. Along the inner wall of the collar, a thin grooved metal strip was inserted. As metal flowed to the planchet’s perimeter, the insert under pressure created the grained
<pb n="168"/>
edge. This process was highlighted in <persName>Blondeau’s</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Last Will &amp; Testament</hi> wherein he stipulated that a sequence of beneficiaries had to pay the cost of engraving the rings for edge-marking.<ref target="#CH4-n165">165</ref> However, coppers exist within the series that have a plain edge. Taking into account <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> technology, plain edged coins probably resulted from a failure to place the grooved metal insert along the inner wall of the collar. Such coins are, in my opinion, minting errors since their production varied from normal practices. Coins that exhibit signs of preparation in a two-step process through the use of grooved parallel bars also represent a procedural process that differs from <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> common practice. But these coins are varieties within the series rather than errors, since they were deliberately manufactured as a means to accelerate production.</p>
               <p>In a mintage as large as the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, it is not surprising that <persName>Blondeau</persName> experienced some difficulties using the extra heavy engines or screw presses that were one of the hallmarks of his new technology. One notable problem stemmed from die misalignment. Likewise, dies were destroyed faster than normal due to excess pressure. At times, this led to the breakage of the collar and an outflow of metal. This problem is consistent with the inordinate number of die varieties associated with the farthings in the series.<ref target="#CH4-n166">166</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Although <persName>Blondeau</persName> had the necessary technology to manufacture the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, he was not able to undertake the venture alone. An outline of the key persons involved is gleaned from his <hi rend="italic">Last Will &amp; Testament</hi> of 1672 wherein he specified the following bequests: <persName>Slingsby</persName>, <persName>Isaac de Caux</persName>, and <persName>John Colborne</persName> were to share the income from the production of coins at the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> using his technology in accordance with the terms of his patent; <persName>Slingby’s</persName> share was dependent on paying the cost of engraving the rings for edge-marking; and these beneficiaries jointly were to compensate <persName>Peter La Castill</persName> £20 per year for his contribution to the edging process. Later, Colborne bequeathed one-half of his interest to his brother Robert and the other half to <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> with the stipulation that if <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> failed to perform his obligation—<persName>Slingsby’s</persName> availability was in question due to his appointment as Secretary of the Council of Trade—then his brother and <persName>Peter Johnson</persName> were to receive said share. Finally, <persName>Blondeau</persName> bequeathed his
<pb n="169"/>
five screw presses to <persName>Slingsby</persName>. Although making private tokens had all but ceased after 1672, the patent generated a sizable income and the screw presses had an estimated value of £300.<ref target="#CH4-n167">167</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It is important to note that these men were all associated with the <placeName>London Mint</placeName>. According to its roster of employees, <persName>De Caux</persName> and <persName>Colborne</persName> were engineers, <persName>La Castill</persName> was one of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> workers within the mint establishment, and <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> was the facility’s chief administrator. In addition to his position at the mint, <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> also enjoyed the patronage of influential officials, such as Lord Ashley, Chancellor of the Exchequer, which enhanced the success of any coining venture he undertook. This mix of professionals associated with manufacturing money is precisely what was required to make coins for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. <persName>Slingsby</persName>, as chief administrator of the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> and the chief advocate of its right to produce all money, had the power to curtail any private coinage. If the project were to succeed, his participation was necessary. <persName>De Caux’</persName>s and <persName>Colborne’s</persName> skills as engineers for coin manufacturing were valuable in overseeing daily operations. <persName>La Castill</persName> obviously contributed, as noted in <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> bequest. The reference to <persName>Johnson</persName> is important as <persName>Blondeau</persName> relied on his newly created hardened dies to withstand the pressure of the heavy screw presses that he used.<ref target="#CH4-n168">168</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The public acknowledgement of those who were associated with minting the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series may appear in one notable contemporary document. In 1670, <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> newly appointed <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>, <persName>Lord Berkeley</persName>, desired to suppress the use of tokens as money. At the time, <placeName>England</placeName> was contemplating the issuance of regal farthings and halfpence. As part of a warning to defer any action until a final decision had been reached on the minting regal coppers, his secretary was told that, "Mr. <persName>Slingsby’s</persName> patent, if he have one, may not include <placeName>Ireland</placeName> for small money."<ref target="#CH4-n169">169</ref> It is not surprising that among the participants in producing <persName>Ormond’s</persName> coins, <persName>Henry Slingsby</persName> rather than <persName>Blondeau</persName> should be mentioned. As the chief administrator of the <placeName>London Mint</placeName>, he was the most prominent partner involved in producing the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. Further, it was well known that he had expressed
<pb n="170"/>
a strong interest in any proposal to mint small change for the kingdom and contemplated undertaking such a venture personally. Finally, it was <persName>Slingsby</persName>, rather than <persName>Blondeau</persName>, who was personally known to <persName>Ormond</persName>. Under these circumstances, <persName>Slingsby’s</persName> involvement in minting the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series would have been significant.<ref target="#CH4-n170">170</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In examining the time frame for minting the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, it is improbable that the coins could have been produced earlier than the 1660s. Irish coinage of the Civil War years is generally described by numismatists as having "a battered and poorly struck appearance,"<ref target="#CH4-n171">171</ref> which stands in sharp contrast to the finely executed <persName>St. Patrick</persName> pieces. For the most part, the coins of this era were made of silver with a limited production using gold. As for farthings and halfpence, there are two instances when coppers were issued. Between 1642 and 1643, the Confederated Catholics produced a limited mintage known as Kilkenny Money consisting of hammer-struck pieces that were crudely made with a crown and two scepters on the obverse and a crowned harp on the reverse, bearing no resemblance to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. The other mintage was siege money struck between 1645 and 1647 in support of the Parliamentary cause in the Munster towns of <placeName>Cork</placeName> and <placeName>Youghall</placeName> (coins issued by <persName>Bandon</persName> and <persName>Kinsale</persName>, once considered part of this series, are now deemed to date to the 1650s). These hammer-struck coppers on irregularly shaped or square planchets with simplistic designs lack the quality of production associated with the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. Taking a different approach, it has been asserted that the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series was produced at the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> between 1641 and 1642 as a coinage to finance the king’s army fighting in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to suppress the Ulster Rebellion.<ref target="#CH4-n172">172</ref> However, the king already had at his disposal Maltravers’ farthings with their well-known regal obverse and Irish harp reverse. Likewise, by granting patents to various minters of farthings during his reign, the king had agreed to prohibit anyone else from striking coppers.<ref target="#CH4-n173">173</ref> Equally significant is the role of money as propaganda in the 1640s. Royalists deemed it important to promote the king in a clear manner on the money that they sanctioned. The silver coins struck at auxiliary royal mints such as those in Oxford, <placeName>Bristol</placeName>,
<pb n="171"/>
and Exeter prominently displayed images of <persName>Charles I</persName>. Such depictions along with legends that proclaimed the king’s justice were seen as a means to reinforce the Royalist cause. Under these circumstances, it would have been counterproductive to retool auxiliary royal mints—which operated only briefly due to the successes of <persName>Cromwell’s</persName> advancing army—to strike coppers that were only linked to the king on an interpretive level.<ref target="#CH4-n174">174</ref>
               </p>
               <p>With <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> method identified as the technological basis for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, these reeded-edged coins could not have been struck economically prior to the 1650s. Even then, there was a technological stumbling block that would have hindered a large mintage. During the decade, <persName>Blondeau</persName> relied on <persName>Thomas Simon</persName> for his dies, which were acceptable given <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> limited assignment to produce Commonwealth money. During the early 1660s, when <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> heavy screw presses undertook the production of <persName>Charles II’s</persName> milled money, it was discovered that such dies could not withstand the extra pressure exerted by the presses. With <persName>Johnson’s</persName> perfection of hardened dies in the early 1660s, <persName>Blondeau</persName> was able to undertake the extensive mintage authorized by <persName>Charles II</persName>. Another significant obstacle in the 1650s was posed by <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> opponents at the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> who constantly harassed the engineer in this period. In particular, he would have been opposed by influential moneyers who were also prolific token makers, such as <persName>David</persName>
                  <persName>Ramage</persName> and <persName>Thomas Rawlins</persName>. The latter is noted for producing corporation coins for Oxford. <persName>Ramage</persName> in particular coveted his role as a token maker, trying in 1661 to control token manufacture through an unsuccessful bid to outlaw all coppers not made by him. For <persName>Blondeau</persName> to have undertaken an unauthorized mintage in the 1650s would have confirmed the charge of counterfeiting leveled against him during the trials with <persName>Ramage</persName>. Most damaging in such an accusation would have been the regal legends on the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, which would have been viewed as an act of treason during the Commonwealth era. Finally, in order for his undertaking to succeed, <persName>Blondeau</persName> needed a sponsor, which he surely lacked in <persName>Henry</persName>
                  <persName>Cromwell</persName>, but later would have found in <persName>Ormond</persName>. Part of such a sponsorship probably would have involved advancing some funds for the venture. Prior to 1667, <persName>Ormond</persName> was unable to offer any assistance as his personal finances were in disarray. He was so
<pb n="172"/>
short of money in 1665 that he defaulted on a loan. To avoid forfeiture of part of his estate, he asked his creditor, Bellingham of the Viner Patent venture, to accept interest payments until His Lordship received money owed him under the Act of Settlement. Two years later, the king authorized <persName>Ormond</persName> to receive £50,000 from the Commissioners of Settlement as compensation for some of the lands he lost during the Commonwealth era. <persName>Ormond</persName> paid £25,000 to satisfy his creditors. For the first time since returning to <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, <persName>Ormond</persName> had surplus funds. These events, as well as the crisis of the unpaid army make the later 1660s the optimal time for the production of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series.<ref target="#CH4-n175">175</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Other dating evidence pointing to the later 1660s is the production curve for Irish tokens between 1660 and 1674. Local production basically ceased when <persName>Armstrong</persName> received his grant. The patent contained a strong anti-token provision that was reinforced in 1661 when the Lords Justices prohibited making tokens without a license. Unlike in <placeName>England</placeName>, where manufacturers of tokens were tolerated due to the shortage of small change, the 1661 proclamation called for the "pain of such penalties and punishments, as by laws of this kingdom could be justly inflicted."<ref target="#CH4-n176">176</ref> As it became obvious that the <persName>Armstrong</persName> Patent would not succeed, Kinsale reissued its town token farthings in 1661. This was followed in 1662 by the passage of the Viner Patent whereby <persName>Ormond</persName> was instructed to suppress unauthorized small money. After the recall of the Viner Patent, token production resumed in earnest in 1663. <placeName>London's</placeName> contemplation of striking regal coppers in 1665 caused a sharp decline in the utterance of tokens that year. London's failure to pursue the project, compounded by the negative impact that the plague and the Great <placeName>London</placeName> Fire had on output at the <placeName>London Mint</placeName>, caused an acceleration of Irish token production. This peaked in 1667–1668, at the height of <persName>Ormond’s</persName> fiscal crisis with the army. Thereafter, the number of tokens uttered declined noticeably, reflecting the appearance of a new supply of money: the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins. Since this infusion of money was modest—<persName>Ormond’s</persName> correspondence indicates a mintage between £10,000
<pb n="173"/>
and £12,000—it was not able to satisfy completely the need for small change and the manufacturing of tokens continued into the 1670s.<ref target="#CH4-n177">177</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The most significant factor that dates the conception of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series to 1667 is the crisis <persName>Ormond</persName> faced with an unpaid army where arrears amounted up to a year for many troops. In considering a copper mintage, <persName>Ormond’s</persName> goal was to satisfy six months of back pay as a means to quell discontent among the troops. By the fall of 1668, His Lordship had met this key objective. As noted in a report by <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> Treasurer, not only had six months in arrears been satisfied, but some soldiers had received additional funds.<ref target="#CH4-n178">178</ref> By this arrangement, the crisis with the army had passed with the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> mintage constituting part of the solution to maintain a loyal army during a difficult period of crisis in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. This was also a transitional period for <persName>Ormond</persName>. In 1668, he left <placeName>Ireland</placeName> at the king’s request in order to become a more effective royal advisor. At this time <persName>Charles II</persName> faced several problems with his ministers and with the House of Commons. <persName>Ormond</persName> placed the Deputy <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>, his son, Lord <persName>Ossory</persName>, in charge of a caretaker government and set aside any hope for a <placeName>Dublin</placeName> Mint.</p>
               <p>The period from 1669 onward is also important for its noted decline in the production of non-regal coppers. Lord <persName>Robartes</persName>, who replaced <persName>Ormond</persName> as <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>, took a somewhat disinterested approach to Irish affairs, remaining in <placeName>England</placeName> for part of his tenure in office. Fortunately, as the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> recovered from the damaging effects of the plague and the Great <placeName>London</placeName> Fire, it increased the availability of money. At the same time, <placeName>England</placeName> started to review the possibility of minting regal coppers, which would have had a negative effect on the production of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series. As noted in a report to the king, the contemplated regal coins would have an intrinsic value unlike circulating tokens since the king’s intent was "so there might be good money current amongst the poorest of Our Subjects."<ref target="#CH4-n179">179</ref> In 1673, the newly appointed <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>, Lord Essex, proclaimed that henceforth it would be illegal "to make or stamp, or cause to be made or
<pb n="174"/>
stamped, any brass or copper, or other tokens whatsoever."<ref target="#CH4-n180">180</ref> By that year, the mint’s production of regal farthings and halfpence exceeded £60,000. This lessened the viability of making <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins, especially in light of the king’s prior proclamation that outlawed all future production of tokens.<ref target="#CH4-n181">181</ref> The next year, Essex used various means to increase the supply of new regal coppers in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in order to address the kingdom’s shortage of small change.<ref target="#CH4-n182">182</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Overall, the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series sharply contrasts with other tokens of the era, which often lacked the craftsmanship that resulted from <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> production methods. Although town or corporation tokens were often made at a higher standard that was achieved by hiring <placeName>London</placeName> die makers to produce more professional looking money, none can compare with the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, which was produced using <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> technology under the hands of experts in the business of manufacturing money.<ref target="#CH4-n183">183</ref>

               <p>The <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series was produced during a troubled period in <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> history. As a kingdom subservient to <placeName>London's</placeName> interests, its monetary requirements were seldom considered. In a moment of desperation, <persName>Ormond</persName> turned to professional moneyers in <placeName>London</placeName> to address his fiscal woes. There, he secured the services of <persName>Blondeau</persName>, whose reeded edge technology was desired to curtail the activities of clippers and counterfeiters that degraded the value of Irish money and posed a serious threat to <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName> financial stability. Regarding the production of the coinage, the following arguments have been presented herein:</p>

                     <persName>Blondeau</persName> received authority to protect his new technology "wherewith the brims are marked, may be kept secret among few men, who shall be sworn to keep it, and not to reveal it to anie [any],"<ref target="#CH4-n184">184</ref> which would have been unnecessary if he were merely employing a process already know among English moneyers;</item>

               <p>Given the circumstances outlined above, it is inconceivable that officials at the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> and royal authorities would have granted concessions, monetary compensation, and a patent to <persName>Blondeau</persName> if he were merely using commonly known procedures.

process that was applicable to thick and thin planchets, as was required for making coppers.<ref target="#CH4-n185">185</ref> If <persName>Ormond</persName> wanted to address the inadequate supply of Irish money, he had to turn to professional moneyers in <placeName>London</placeName> to succeed. Further, if His Lordship wanted to protect his envisioned Irish coinage from clippers and counterfeiters, his only alternative was to secure <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> involvement because his invention was protected by a royal patent. Based on the convergence of historical events, the production of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series must have occurred between 1667 and 1669, during <persName>Ormond’s</persName> tenure as <placeName>Ireland’s</placeName>
                  <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName>. This coincides with <persName>Ormond’s</persName> request for £30,000 in farthings, his receipt of the "King’s letter" or warrant, his correspondence with <placeName>London</placeName> officials regarding his proposed issuance of money as a solution to the problem of the unpaid army, and additional correspondence in 1667 pertaining to minting between £10,000 and £12,000 using <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> technology.</p>
               <p>The circulation of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> lasted for several decades. While <persName>Ormond’s</persName> successor as <persName>Lord-Lieutenant</persName> requested permission to suppress the use of tokens in 1670, the king responded that His Lordship should await a final decision regarding production of official coppers.<ref target="#CH4-n186">186</ref> That decision was finalized in 1672 with the issue of the nation’s first regal coppers (Fig. 20). Within four years 246 tons in farthings and halfpence valued at £40,252 were produced.<ref target="#CH4-n187">187</ref> In support of the new coinage, all tokens were demonetized by royal proclamation:</p>

               <p>
                  <q>Whereas We...have thought fit, by the Advice of Our Privy Council, to cause certain Farthings and Half-pence of Copper to be Stamped at Our Mint...[they] shall pass and be received in all Payments...And if any Person or Persons, Bodies Politique or Corporate, shall...presume to make, vend, or utter any Pence, Half-pence, Farthings, or other pieces of Brass, Copper, or other Base Mettal...We shall hold all such Offenders utterly inexcusable, and shall cause their Contempt of Our Laws and Government to be chastised with Exemplary Severity.<ref target="#CH4-n188">188</ref>

               <p>While the regal coppers of the 1670s were intended for both <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, a separate Irish coinage was authorized in 1680, granting <persName>Sir Thomas Armstrong</persName> (Jr.) and <persName>Colonel George Legge</persName> a patent to strike halfpence (Fig. 5). This privilege was assigned in 1684 to the <placeName>Dublin</placeName> alderman <persName>John Knox</persName>. He had the patent reissued to him the following year at which time he was Lord Mayor of <placeName>Dublin</placeName>. The patent was thereafter transferred to <persName>Roger Moore</persName> who continued the venture until his mint in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> was seized to make gun-money for the deposed <persName>James II</persName> in 1689 (Fig. 21). After the defeat of the former king’s forces, Moore resumed minting halfpence until 1696. The desire for farthings was addressed by <persName>William Wood</persName> in 1722, although the controversy surrounding his money forced the patentee to surrender his grant in 1725 (Fig. 22). This eventually led to a shortage of small change and the reemergence of tradesmen tokens in the mid–1730s, which in turn led to the minting of regal farthings and halfpence between 1737 and 1755. The cessation of their production led to another shortage of small change that was addressed partially by the Voce Populi tokens of 1760 (Fig. 23). As an alternative to privately made coppers, the <placeName>London Mint</placeName> again issued regal Irish farthings and halfpence. Throughout this chaotic monetary history, the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series stands out as a unique attempt to place the kingdom on a firm financial footing by creating a distinctive coinage consisting of both copper and bullion coins.</p>

                  <p>The historiography of <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> methodology is as follows: <persName>G. F. Ansell</persName> in The Royal Mint (1870) stated that <persName>Blondeau</persName> used a thin flexible metal band to inscribe and grain his coins in a one-stroke process; in 1909, Hocking, "<persName>Simon’s</persName> Dies," restated this premise in greater detail; <persName>Peter P Gasper</persName> in "<persName>Simon’s</persName>
                     <persName>Cromwell</persName> Dies in the Royal Mint Museum and <persName>Blondeau’s</persName> Method for the Production of Lettered Edges," <hi rend="italic">British Numismatic Journal</hi> (1976) stated that the engineer used parallel bars although the focus of his paper was on coins with lettered edges made in the 1650s; in 1964, <persName>Peck</persName>, <hi rend="italic">English Copper, Tin and Bronze,</hi> stated <persName>Blondeau</persName> was conversant with several ways to affect edging and it is not possible to discern his methodology due to the secrecy of his work, although he believed a modified two-step process was used; and in 2005, Lessen, "Notes," stated it was possible that <persName>Blondeau</persName> did not use parallel bars although he supporeted <persName>Gasper’s</persName> conclusion.

               <p>The varieties and uses of coinage and coin substitutes in the English colonies of seventeenth century <placeName>North America</placeName> is a complex topic.<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> The most frequently cited reference on this subject is a 300-page monograph from 1934 by <persName>Curtis Putnam Nettels</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Money Supply of the American Colonies before 1720.</hi> However, this work is somewhat more limited in scope than the title implies. The first sentence in chapter one begins with the English acquisition of Jamaica in 1655, and by the third paragraph moves into the 1680s. The remainder of the text almost exclusively concentrates on 16801720, a seminal era in the transformation of the colonial money supply. In this paper I shall focus on the earlier period of colonial occupation up to 1660, with a few concluding comments regarding the decade of the 1660s.</p>
               <p>Evidence regarding the use of money in colonial <placeName>America</placeName> for the period before the opening of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay Mint in 1652 is sparse and it is primarily based on anecdotal descriptions of coin recoveries and occasional references in period documents. Many numismatic surveys of the colonial period overlook this material, briefly discussing the Somer Islands Hogge Money emission of 1616 along with providing a few general comments on wampum, tobacco and other commodity monies, before turning their attention to the <placeName>Boston Mint</placeName>. However, over the past quarter-century a significant number of controlled archaeological excavations of early English settlements have provided us with many newly recovered artifacts, including coins, which can help us reinterpret the fragmentary written record and thus clarify our knowledge of the earliest periods of colonization.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref> In order
<pb n="187"/>
to truly appreciate the nature and function of money in colonial <placeName>America</placeName> we must understand the economic environment of the early colonial plantations and the various roles performed by money and money substitutes in developing those economies during the formative initial decades of settlement.</p>
               <p>Early English New World settlements were private enterprises financed by either a proprietor or group of investors who had successfully obtained a charter to some land and wanted to make a profit. The investors financed an initial voyage to secure the land and establish a colony. The expedition typically included a few stockholders along with some artisans and a number of laborers. All of these settlers hoped to better their economic status, although some groups also had a religious agenda, like the Pilgrim Separatists in Plymouth, the Puritan reformers at <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay or the Maryland Catholics. Colonists were expected to transform the wilderness into farms, fisheries and fur-trading posts that would yield a profit both for them and for the investors back in <placeName>England</placeName>. The early years of colonization were always difficult. The plantation at <placeName>Jamestown</placeName>, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, founded on May 14, 1607, was almost completely decimated by starvation and disease by the end of the first year, while its sister settlement to the north, Popham Colony at Fort Saint George on the mouth of the Kennebec River in Maine, established on August 19, 1607, did not survive beyond the fall of 1608.<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref>

                  <p>This essay is limited to a discussion of the early English plantations, thus <placeName>New Netherland</placeName>, <placeName>New Sweden</placeName> and other non-English settlements along the North <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> coastline have been excluded, while French outposts are only mentioned insofar as they directly influenced English colonies. The inclusion of the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> and the French colonial economies would require far more research than I could conduct in the time available. See below at footnote 131 for a preliminary draft of a study I am writing on wampum, beaver and other money substitutes in <placeName>New Netherland</placeName>. Additionally, although <placeName>Mexico</placeName> is located in <placeName>North America</placeName>, a study of the Spanish-American coinage of <placeName>Mexico</placeName> is a separate area that is more properly treated along with coin emissions from the Spanish colonies of Central and South <placeName>America</placeName>. I have restricted my remarks in this area to the influence of Spanish-American cobs on English settlements.</p>

In an e-mail of May 30, 2006, <persName>Jeffrey Brain</persName> informed me that no coins or tokens have been recovered at the Popham Colony excavation. Updates on the excavation are available on the web see, <persName>Jeffrey P Brain</persName> and the staff of the Popham Project at http:// www.pophamcolony.org/ (last accessed November 24, 2006). Both <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> and Popham Colony were subsidiaries of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company, which was divided into two independent investor groups. One of these groups consisted of a joint stock company of <placeName>London</placeName> adventurers, often called the <placeName>London</placeName> Company, who were authorized to colonize <placeName>America</placeName> from <placeName>Cape Fear</placeName>, <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>, up to <placeName>Port Chester</placeName>, Long Island. The charter also authorized a second joint stock company of adventurers from the western county towns of <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, Exeter and Plymouth, called the Plymouth Company, to colonize the area from the mouth of the Potomac River up to Deer Island. This was expressed in the charter as giving the <placeName>London</placeName> Company from the 34th to the 41st parallel and the Plymouth Company from the 38th to the 45th parallel. There was significant overlapping territory, consisting of the area occupied by present day Maryland, Delaware, <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> and part of <placeName>New York</placeName>, which was open to either company as long as they did not encroach within 100 miles of a settlement by the other company. Clearly this was done to stimulate competition between the two companies to quickly settle these unclaimed lands. The first charter of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company, of April 10, 1606, also allowed the company, and thus allowed each of the two divisions of the company, the privilege of minting coins, stating, "And that they shall, or lawfully may, establish and cause to be made a Coin, to pass current there between the people of those several Colonies, for the more Ease of Traffick and Bargaining between and amongst them and the Natives there, of such Metal, and in such Manner and Form, as the said several Councils there shall limit and appoint." <persName>William Waller Hening</persName>, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of <placeName>Virginia</placeName> from the First Session of the Legislature in the Year 1619,</hi> (<placeName>New York</placeName>, 1823; reprint, <placeName>Charlottesville</placeName>, 1969), vol. 1, 62, article 10.</p>

               <p>A rather unusual set of circumstances occurred in <placeName>Bermuda</placeName>, then called the <placeName>Somer Islands</placeName>, during its initial colonization. The land survey of the main island was delayed for several years, which meant individual farm plots could not be assigned as quickly as was the case at other plantations. Therefore, a large portion of the population remained in <placeName>St. George’s Town</placeName>, the port of arrival, much longer than anticipated. These colonists had no farmland and thus were unable to homestead. Their situation looked bleak for they had counted on the farmland both to produce food to sustain themselves and to grow a cash crop that could be sold, affording them a means to purchase clothes, manufactured goods and other imported provisions necessary for survival in the American wilderness. Further, in addition to the problems related to the surplus population in <placeName>St. George’s Town</placeName>, the English investors wanted to attract even more settlers to Bermuda, so that there would be enough farmers to cultivate the entire "Maine" island once the survey was completed. Therefore, during this interim period, in order to retain the original colonists and to attract others, the Bermuda Company offered to supply provisions and clothing to settlers, along with some payment, in return for work on municipal projects and company ventures.<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="189"/>
               <p>According to the Bermuda Company plan, under the supervision of the governor, some colonists would spend time working on company owned communal farms growing grain and other basic foodstuffs, with the harvest distributed throughout the population. Further, other colonists would participate in company sponsored whaling and fishing expeditions, timber harvests and cash crop production, with the marketable goods from these enterprises sent to <placeName>England</placeName> and sold. Profits would be divided between the Bermuda Company shareholders and the colonists. The money from the profits that were owed to the colonists would be used to purchase supplies that would be shipped to <placeName>St. George’s Town</placeName> and then distributed to the settlers from the company storehouse, based on the number of work credits each participating settler had accumulated.</p>
               <p>Investors realized this scheme would require the colonists to wait several months for any remuneration. Marketable goods had to be shipped from Bermuda to <placeName>London</placeName> and sold, then the supplies purchased from the profits had to be shipped from <placeName>London</placeName> to <placeName>St. George’s Town</placeName> before the colonists would see any return. It was understood several colonists would prefer a weekly wage for their labor rather than the promise of future profits. Thus, it was deemed necessary that a supply of surrogate coinage be delivered to the islands for this purpose. Therefore, as authorized in their charter, the investors in <placeName>England</placeName> produced tokens for use in the colony, adapting the model of the farm tokens used throughout the English countryside, and, as we shall see below, modifying the system used in <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> about a decade earlier by their parent organization, the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company. When <persName>Daniel Tucker</persName> was appointed governor of Bermuda in 1616, the token coinage was sent to the island from <placeName>England</placeName> in the form of Somer Islands Hogge Money shillings (Pl. 1, 1), sixpences (Pl. 1, 2), threepences, and twopences. The coins had no intrinsic value and therefore were not negotiable outside the colony. They were simply a local expedient to be used to pay workers and could be redeemed at face value for merchandise in the company store. Once the land survey was completed in 1619, and the boundaries were plotted, the colonists immediately settled on the farms and planted to-

bacco, which had a negotiable value in international trade and thus quickly replaced Hogge Money as the standard of exchange.<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref>

                  <p>The first governor of the islands, <persName>Richard Moore</persName>, with a contingent of sixty settlers, arrived in St. George’s Harbour on the afternoon of July 11, 1612, under the auspices of the <placeName>London</placeName> office of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company. The <placeName>London</placeName> shareholders quickly realized it would be more efficient for the administration of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company to distinguish this subsidiary venture from the <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> Plantation. Consequently, in November of 1612, a group of 118 members of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company purchased the rights to the Somer Islands from their fellow <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company stockholders for £2,000, effectively making the new plantation a separate entity within the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company.</p>

I have not had an opportunity to read <persName>Mark A. Sportack</persName>, "Myths and Mysteries of the <placeName>Somers’ Ilands</placeName> Hoge Money," in <persName>Richard G. Doty</persName> and <persName>John M.

Sportack’s paper predates my 2003 article by several years, but was not available in print until early 2007. Almost all recoveries of Hogge Money derive from Bermuda, although it was announced in the <hi rend="italic">Spink Coin Newsletter</hi> of June 2005, that a well-preserved sixpence with some original silvering was recently located by a metal detectorist on the Isle of Wight; this issue is archived at http://www.spink.com/news/ newsletters/2005/200506coin_news.asp (last accessed December 20, 2006). Subsequently, the item was offered in the Spink auction catalogue of June 30, 2005, where it was reported the coin had been dug up as a single find in a field on the west end of the island (the Yarmouth/Totland side), Spink &amp; Son, Thursday, 30 June 2005, sale 5010, 24, lot 300 and online at http://www.spink.com/asp/fullCatalogue.asp?salelot=5010+++++300+&amp;refn o=+8077645 (last accessed December 20, 2006). There is no evidence suggesting how the sixpence ended up at that location. Possibly the coin originally arrived via Cowes Harbour at the north end of the island, the location of the English customs house used by ships that had an international destination. All outgoing and incoming vessels were required to stop at one of the customs houses (the customs offices located at <placeName>Cowes</placeName>, <placeName>Portsmouth</placeName>, and <placeName>Bristol</placeName> were the most common exit and entry inspection ports for ships heading to or returning from <placeName>America</placeName>). The Hogge Money sixpence may have been lost during a customs inspection stopover, although there is no way to know for sure how the token ended up on the island. Since the token retains some original silvering it is possible the specimen was lost while on its initial voyage to <placeName>America</placeName>, before entering circulation, or possibly, the recently minted token arrived in a pocket of a sailor or settler returning to <placeName>England</placeName> from Bermuda soon after the tokens were emitted. Also, during the 1950s a completely smooth copper disk lacking any surface impression was recovered at Fort La Tour, <placeName>New Brunswick</placeName>. In 1957, a staff member of the ANS tentatively identified this specimen as a <placeName>Somer Islands</placeName> Hogge Money shilling based solely on the diameter of the disk, see <persName>Norman Forthum Barka</persName>, "Historic Sites Archaeology at Portland Point, <placeName>New Brunswick</placeName>, <placeName>Canada</placeName>: 1631—c. 1850 A.D." (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1965), 318. This tentative and highly questionable attribution of the La Tour copper disk certainly needs further investigation and verification beyond the diameter measurement. It cannot be used as evidence that Hogge Money circulated in <placeName>Canada</placeName> and at this point should not even be taken as proof that a specimen of Hogge Money made its way to <placeName>New Brunswick</placeName>. Also, the recovery of a sixpence on the Isle of Wight does not necessarily imply the circulation Hogge Money tokens outside of <placeName>Bermuda</placeName>.</p>

               <p>During the early decades of English colonization, several plantations actually had some coinage available for local trade, although contemporary sources typically comment that the money supply was minimal. Archaeological recoveries are primarily smaller denomination coins of a shilling or less in value and indicate that half or more of the available coinage was English, with a number of foreign coins and tokens added to the mix, including a few rather exotic items from distant lands.<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref> However, it should be noted that some of the more prevalent foreign items, such as Nuremberg jetons, freely circulated in <placeName>England</placeName> at that time and are regularly recovered by metal detectorists throughout <placeName>England</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> In many ways the mix of coinage in early colonial settlements would not seem overly odd to a contemporary Englishman.</p>
               <p>In <placeName>England</placeName>, for almost 120 years, from the accession of <persName>Queen Mary</persName> in 1553 until the first regal copper issues of <persName>Charles II</persName> in 1672, small change at a farthing value was not supplied by the crown but was primarily issued by merchants, or was privately produced under a royal patent. Indeed, even
<pb n="192"/>
silver halfpence were not commonly encountered.<ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref> These denominations, particularly the farthing, were locally produced in lead and later in copper at weights that had a far lower intrinsic value than face value. Englishmen of the period regularly accepted and traded greatly overvalued tokens as their small change.</p>

                  <p>Jetons and tokens were used for a variety of purposes in the New World. Occasionally, they served for limited periods as surrogates for shillings, sixpence and other silver denominations, as we have already encountered with the Hogge Money tokens. However, in most situations it appears copper and brass jetons and tokens, and possibly even some lead specimens, were employed along with any available foreign monetary coppers, to pass as small change of a penny, halfpenny, or farthing.<ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> Copper jetons were

additionally used as Indian trade items and possibly also served as counters for illiterate tradesmen, as was the case in Elizabethan and early Stuart <placeName>England</placeName>. At the short-lived colony of Roanoke, North Carolina, founded in 1585, three Hans Schultes Nuremberg copper jetons have been recovered, of which one is holed, suggesting that it was suspended, probably on a necklace. An identical jeton was found at an Indian site forty miles away at Buxton, near Cape Hatteras.<ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref> In <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> at <persName>James</persName> Fort, which was erected in 1607 but abandoned by 1624,<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref> over one hundred copper and brass jetons have been recovered in the context of structure 165, identified as the original storehouse where, according to Captain John <persName>Smith</persName>, the Cape merchants distributed supplies during the years 1607–1610,<ref target="#CH5-n12">12</ref> several additional specimens were recovered from other locations within the

fort. It is thought that these jetons served as a token coinage, a precursor to the <placeName>Somer Islands</placeName> Hogge Money tokens of 1616 and, additionally, the jetons may have served as copper ornaments traded to the Indians. A crewman on the <hi rend="italic">Sea Venture,</hi> named <persName>R.

Since none of the unmarked lead disks was holed the Plimoth Plantation archaeological staff have segregated them from the lead cloth seals.

                     <p>The last silver small change coins were the highly debased issues of the third coinage (1550<hi rend="italic">–</hi>1553) of <persName>Edward VI</persName>, who died in July 1553. Silver farthing production was terminated following this issue, while silver halfpenny emissions were suspended for thirty years; indeed, the Edward VI halfpenny was so debased, it often passed as a farthing. The silver halfpenny was finally reintroduced in Elizabeth’s fifth (1582<hi rend="italic">–</hi>1600) and sixth (1601<hi rend="italic">–</hi>1602) issues and was continued in the three issues of <persName>James I</persName>. <persName>Charles I</persName> minted some halfpennies at the tower mint and a few at Aberystwyth with the final silver halfpenny issued during the Commonwealth.

                        <persName>Jetons</persName>, tokens, foreign monetary coppers and even medalets, although numismatically distinct genera, were often used for a variety of interrelated functions during the seventeenth century, due to the dearth of small change. To clarify the technical distinctions for archaeologists and historians reading this essay, the <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi> defines a jeton as, "a counter in casting up accounts and in card-playing;" a token as, "a stamped piece of metal, often having the general appearance of a coin, issued as a medium of exchange by a private person or company, who engage to take it back at its nominal value, giving goods or legal currency for it;" while a medalet is, "a small medal, usually one smaller than an inch or 25mm in diameter." [A medal is defined in numismatics as having obverse and reverse images that are oriented in the same direction (head to head), while on a coin or token the reverse is oriented in the opposite direction (head to tail), usually called a 180° reverse die rotation.] I use foreign monetary coppers to refer to government authorized small change coinage as opposed to private token issues. The English did not produce regal copper coins during this era, so monetary coppers were French, Spanish, Swedish, Venetian, and other government issued copper coins used by English settlers that were found at colonial sites. However, it should be noted that even the distinction between the issuing agencies for coins and tokens (i.e., government or private issues), was not fully discrete during this era. For example, the regal patent farthings of the early Stuarts were issued privately but under a patent from the crown and were to trade as authorized coinage in accordance with several royal promulgations. The distinctions in the definitions of jeton, token and copper coin are useful for understanding the primary or original purpose of a specific product, but should not be considered exclusive, since the uses of the items shifted as necessity dictated. Also, regarding the term token, all small change coppers, both private and government authorized issues are tokens in the sense that the face or nominal value is far higher than the intrinsic value of the copper (i.e., they are all lightweight issues with a token or symbolic value that does not correspond to the actual intrinsic value of the metal); this is also true for jetons used as negotiable change. In numismatic discussions, the term "coppers" frequently refers to all circulating small change in copper or brass including tokens, jetons, government issue coppers, and illegal counterfeits that circulated as money.</p>

                     <p>Structure 165, called the "longhouse," had various functions over time, probably serving as a storehouse, blockhouse, rubbish heap, workshop, and later converted into a factory. The top foot of soil in that area was plowed up as farmland at some later period, thus disturbing the chronological sequencing of the soil layers, but the foundation of the structure was below the plow zone and remained intact. The jetons were recovered both from the plow zone and were also imbedded into the clay floor of structure 165. This long rectangular structure (72 feet x 17 feet) was attached to the end of a fifty-foot palisade, thus extending the fort. At the west end, one portion of this three or four room structure is thought to have served as a storehouse because that area included a waterproof timber and clay lined cellar. Kelso has determined the cellar was used during the first three years of the colony, from 1607–1610, when it seems the walls of the structure collapsed into the cellar (a Nuremberg jeton of 1580 and an Elizabeth sixpence of 1573 were among the recovered items that had been imbedded into the cellar sub-floor). The remaining hole was used as a garbage pit, for it contains over 37,000 domestic, industrial and military artifacts dating to 1610 or earlier. Most likely the use of the cellar as a garbage pit represents an event from the summer of 1610, when Lord <persName>De La Warre</persName> brought fresh troops to <placeName>Jamestown</placeName>. In a letter of July 7, 1610, <persName>De La Warre</persName> stated that he "cleaned the town" which probably meant clearing the litter and debris throughout the settlement and repairing the buildings. While the section of the building with the cellar was at the southern end of the structure, at the northern end was a workshop with a hearth, which is where about one hundred jetons and a 1607 <persName>James</persName> i silver halfpenny were located. <placeName>Kelso</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">
                           <placeName>Jamestown</placeName>,</hi> states that the hearth shows evidence of two periods of construction, suggesting the room was originally used by the Cape merchants from 1607–1610 and later turned into a distillery. <persName>Smith</persName> mentions this structure in his <hi rend="italic">Generali Historie of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>

                        <persName>R.

Upon his return to <placeName>London</placeName>, Rich composed a poem called <hi rend="italic">News from <placeName>Virginia</placeName>
                        </hi>, which was probably the "ballad called the last news from <placeName>Virginia</placeName>" that was entered for publication at the Stationers’ Hall in <placeName>London</placeName> by John Wright on August 16, 1611.

He then went on to mention that in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> payments were made with what he called "copper coins" whose value was assured by the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Company in <placeName>London</placeName>.

                     <p>The first phoenix medal <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> recovery, found in pit 1 (JR1), is APVA item JR1P 22-JR; the second specimen, found in the site plow zone, is item JR42A, 89-JR. The obverse of the medal displays a crowned Tudor double rose with the initial E to the left and R to the right (for <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth Regina)</hi> and the rim legend REGINA BEATY (which could be "Regina Beati," Queen of the Blessed; possibly the word "Beati" was lifted from the phrase "Rex et Regina Beati," thus what was meant was "Regina Beata" or Blessed Queen). On the reverse a crowned phoenix with outspread wings and the rim legend SOLA PHENIX MVNDYE, (that is, <hi rend="italic">Sola phoenix mundi,</hi> Alone the phoenix of the world) which is adapted from Elizabeth’s accession medal motto, <hi rend="italic">Sola phoenix omnia mundi et Angliae gloria</hi> (Alone the phoenix, above all, is the glory of the world and of England). The items have been referred to as tokens, and indeed they are tokens in the sense that they are a sign or symbol of an event, but more properly they are medals or medalets; they are far superior in production quality, as well as in the intricate details of the images and legends, in comparison to Elizabethan era merchant trade tokens. An excellent summary on the phoenix token, with an illustration, is found in Straube and Luccketti, <hi rend="italic">1995 Interim Report,</hi> 43–44 and 53, endnote 12. In this discussion Straube and Luccketti suggested the medal might have been a gaming token or a memorial medal. They also suggest that the "phoenix tokens" may have arrived on the <hi rend="italic">Phoenix,</hi> the first resupply ship at <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> bringing supplies and 40 new settlers in April, 1608. One problem related to the phoenix medal regards the original date of issue. The attribution of the lead phoenix token to 1603, as a commemorative medal issued at the death of Elizabeth (who died March 24, 1602/3), is found in <persName>Michael Mitchiner</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Jetons, Medalets &amp; Tokens: Vol. 3, British Isles Circa 1558 to 1830</hi> (<placeName>London</placeName>: <placeName>Hawkins</placeName>, 1998), 1655, where he lists two varieties, differing in size, with Mitchiner variety 4744 made of tin and Mitchiner variety 4745 in pewter. This suggests the lead <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> recovery pieces, which have the same images and legends as the Mitchiner varieties, were a less expensive lead reissue. The 1603 dating for the medal is used in <persName>William M. Kelso</persName> and Bly Straube, "<placeName>Jamestown</placeName> Phoenix," <hi rend="italic">Avalon Chronicles</hi> 8 (2003): 57–58, fig. 1 (it is also illustrated in <persName>Kelso</persName>, <hi rend="italic">

However, in subsequent publications <persName>Kelso</persName> uses a different dating for the medal and typically refers to it as a token. The earliest reference to a <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> specimen of the <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> phoenix medal was in Luccketti, <persName>Kelso</persName> and <persName>Straube</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Field Report 1994:</hi> 25 where the item is tentatively identified as a token from "a series of official issues dating to the 1570s."

Bly Straube explained to me the phrase "lead tokens of the 1670s" is a reference to the two phoenix medals, previously identified in their 2003 article as datable to 1603. Further, Bly has informed me the attribution of the lead phoenix medals to the 1670s comes from <persName>Edward Hawkins</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Medallic Illustrations of the History of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to the Death of <persName>George II</persName>
                        </hi> (<placeName>London</placeName>, 1885; reprint, 1969). Currently, there is no firm evidence supporting either the 1670 dating of Hawkins or the 1603 dating by <persName>Mitchiner</persName>. At this stage in the research the <persName>Mitchiner</persName> thesis, suggesting the item was issued as a memorial medal, seems more plausible to me. Since <persName>Elizabeth</persName> had selected the phoenix as her personal device there was extensive use of phoenix imagery in her published funeral memorials (such as: <persName>Thomas Churchyard</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Sorrovvfull verses made on [the] death of our most Soueraigne <persName>Lady Queen Elizabeth</persName>, my Gracious Mistresse</hi> [<placeName>London</placeName>, 1603?] at the end of his verses; <persName>Henry</persName> Petowe, in both: H[enry] P[etowe], Elizabetha quasi viuens <persName>Eliza’s</persName> Funerall.

The phoenix was used on Elizabeth’s accession and coronation medals (see <persName>Mitchiner</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Jetons,</hi> vol. 3, 1609–1610) and, it seems, in conjunction with its use in her memorial sermons, the phoenix image would also be appropriate for her memorial medals. Furthermore, it seems far more likely that the very well-preserved specimen of the ornately designed lead medal that is illustrated by <persName>Kelso</persName> and <persName>Straube</persName> had been issued only a few years before it was lost at <placeName>Jamestown</placeName>. Lead is a fairly soft metal so that a lead medal with an intricate design produced some forty years earlier, that is, in the 1670s, would typically display far more surface wear than the specimen recovered at <placeName>Jamestown</placeName>.</p>

In addition to plating the Governor’s Land specimen Outlaw also illustrates the Flowerdew Hundred example in figure 48, it is the smaller example on the right. I would like to thank Bly <persName>Straube</persName> for questioning the identification of this copper as a touch piece; most of what follows in this footnote is based on comments she forwarded to me. The copper was identified as a touch piece, dating to the 1630s or 1640s, by staff at the British Museum during the start of the Second World War and was described as such by Alice Ferguson in 1940 (cited in footnote 21 below). Clearly the suggested dating is incorrect because these items have been recovered in an archaeological context that dates no later than 1610, thus the coppers must refer to <persName>James I</persName>. Further, touch pieces distributed by the king, like Maundy coinage, were typically silver or gold rather than copper. In light of the revised dating and the base metal composition of the token, the original intended function of the token needs to be reexamined; possibly it was produced in conjunction with the accession of <persName>James</persName> to the English throne.</p>

For Harvey’s commission of April 2, 1636, as the new governor see Sainsbury, <hi rend="italic">Calendar 1574–1660,</hi> 232. The request for farthings was made while Harvey was preparing to depart from Portsmouth, <placeName>England</placeName>, for <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. See Sainsbury, <hi rend="italic">Calendar 1574–1660,</hi> 237, for a summary of the instructions to Captain <persName>William Smythe</persName> from <placeName>Hampton</placeName> Court on June 12, 1636, about transporting Harvey to <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. A few years earlier, in 1634, <persName>Henry Frederick Howard</persName>, <persName>Lord Maltravers</persName>, received the royal patent to produce farthings, and then on March 1, 1636, was granted a 21-year privilege to mint a newer, smaller diameter farthing, which we now call the "rose" farthing. Harvey, in his request of June 1636, was probably hoping to get some of the earlier varieties that would be recalled with the emission of the new "rose" farthings. A few years later, on February 16, 1639, <persName>Lord Maltravers</persName> was given permission to supply patent farthings to all the English plantations, with the exception of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, where the crown had ceded the authority to make such decisions to <persName>Lord Baltimore</persName>, see <persName>Louis Jordan</persName>, "<persName>Lord Baltimore</persName> Coinage and Daily Exchange in Early Maryland," <hi rend="italic">The Colonial Newsletter</hi> 126 (August/ December 2004): 2656–2657. However, even <placeName>Virginia</placeName> opposed the mass importation of "rose" farthings. The members of the House of Burgesses understood these patent farthings had a very low intrinsic value in relation to their face value (i.e. they were lightweight). The Burgesses suggested that laborers would not accept such tokens and thus requested a petition be sent to the King requesting £5000 in sterling coins annually be sent to <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, but his a request that was denied; see Sainsbury, <hi rend="italic">Calendar 1574–1660,</hi> 290, also Bruce, <hi rend="italic">Economic History of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>,</hi> vol. 2, 500–501 and <persName>C.

On page 16, Kays illustrates two hammered silver pennies of <persName>Charles II</persName>, minted about 1644, (these are the Tower mint, portrait / oval shield varieties) which were the only non-copper coins in the two Yorktown hoards. These two hoards probably do not represent tokens that arrived in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> during the first decades of colonization. Certainly, they were not brought to <placeName>Virginia</placeName> in response to Harvey’s request of 1636, since most of the farthings in the hoards were not minted until 1642–1643. Possibly the hoards represent some small change that was put away in <placeName>England</placeName> in 1644, or soon thereafter, during the Civil War (hence the 1644 pennies), and was later brought over to <placeName>Virginia</placeName> following the Restoration, probably during the mid–1660s, which may be when the 1663 turner entered the grouping. See the brief discussion on the influx of small change at that time in the final section of this essay under the heading "Small change in the <placeName>Middle Atlantic</placeName> and <placeName>Chesapeake</placeName> regions after 1660."

Allerton purchased the land in 1628 and deeded it to his son-in-law, <persName>Elder Cushman</persName>, in 1646. The site is on the <persName>Jones</persName> River (at the <persName>Elder Cushman Spring</persName>), near the border of Kingston and Plymouth, along a trail used by the Pilgrims to travel from Plymouth to Duxbury. Excavations determined that there were two habitations, one related to a house constructed soon after Allerton acquired the land in 1628, while the second habitation related to a structure built about 1650, after the earlier building had been taken down. The coin recovery is discussed in <persName>Deetz</persName> and <persName>Deetz</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Times of Their Lives</hi>, 226 and it was found along with an unused lead cloth seal bearing the initials I R, probably for Jacobus Rex.

The I R seal places the farthing in the context of the original structure, which dates to between the time Allerton purchased the land in 1628 and mid-century, thus the deposit was apparently made sometime after the coin was produced (<persName>Richmond</persName> "rounds" date to 1625–1634), but not after mid-century. The farthing now resides in the Kingston, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, Public Library, where Archivist Carrie Elliot allowed me the opportunity to examine and photograph the specimen. The copper, along with a few other fragments from the excavation, was glued onto a plexiglass mount by the owner of the property, who later donated the display to the public library. The reverse of the farthing is completely obscured by the glue used to adhere it to the plexiglass. In both the book by <persName>Deetz</persName> and <persName>Deetz</persName>, and on the plexiglass mount, it states that the coin is from the reign of <persName>James I</persName>, but actually the farthing is a <persName>Charles I</persName>

A lead disk with a diameter of 17mm was also recovered at the Allerton site. It is now at Plimoth Plantation, item C21–333, and may represent a portion of a cloth seal.</p>

                     <p>These finds have not been published but brief descriptions and digital images of one side from three of the four coins were e-mailed to me in the fall of 2006 by <persName>Karin Goldstein</persName>, the chief archaeologist at Plimoth Plantation. Pipe stem fragments found at the RM site (the site, numbered C1, for Colonial 1, was later named the RM site because the initials RM were scratched into the end of a spoon handle recovered there) indicate the house was occupied ca. 1620–1680, see <persName>Deetz</persName> and <persName>Deetz</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Times of Their Lives</hi>: 236–239; <persName>Mary C.

Three of the four Plymouth farthing specimens are so corroded that the specific varieties and privy marks cannot be readily identified, although sufficient clues remain to determine the types. When I visited Plimoth Plantation on December 5, 2006, I saw the three highly corroded specimens but was unable to examine the well-preserved example, which, fortunately, had been among the three images previously sent to me. Of the three specimens I was able to examine, item C1— 628 is smaller than the other examples and is almost completely illegible, possibly a "rose" farthing; Item C1—NN is in slightly better condition, portions of the crown and some letters in the legend are visible on the obverse, and may be a <persName>Richmond</persName> "oval." Item C1–628 is listed as an Irish halfpenny of <persName>James I</persName> on the specimen bag (which also states that the item was recovered above plow zone M6) but it is a royal patent farthing of <persName>Charles I</persName>. On the obverse I could read CARO : D [illegible] BRI and on the reverse FRA : E [illegible]. The specimen may be a <persName>Richmond</persName> "round," <persName>Peck</persName> type 1 or a <persName>Richmond</persName> "oval," <persName>Peck</persName> type 4. The better preserved farthing was unavailable for my inspection, but from a digital image of the reverse (there was no image of the obverse) I could read the legend FRA : ET HIB : REX · with a six-string harp bearing an eagle’s head and a crown with nine jewels. It appears to be a <persName>Richmond</persName> "round," possibly a <persName>Peck</persName> variety 4. Inspection of the obverse would make a more precise identification of the variety possible.</p>

In his journal Winthrop gave a slightly more precise explanation, stating that the "farthings" mentioned in the legislation referred to brass farthings.

In fact, Holmes, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Coins,</hi> 54, explains, "It was not long before the French name <hi rend="italic">tournois,</hi> corrupted to "turner," was applied to the twopenny pieces." French coppers continued to circulate once the Scottish coppers were introduced. Foreign copper coins were officially banned from <placeName>Scotland</placeName> on May 20, 1613, and to fill the void, significant emissions of Scottish coppers were authorized. In 1614, an emission weighing 200 stone, later increased to 500 stone (yielding £13,335 or 1,485,900 twopence and 228,600 pennies) was produced with an additional 500 stone emission in 1624. However, foreign coppers continued to circulate and several subsequent proclamations were issued banning their import. One of these acts, of February, 1635, specifically mentioned "doubles" (doubles tournois) and "Holland doyts" (<placeName>Netherlands duits</placeName>), which were the more prevalent foreign coppers in <placeName>Scotland</placeName>.</p>

These coppers were part of <persName>Elizabeth’s</persName> third coinage for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. They were produced at the tower mint in <placeName>London</placeName> under an indenture to Richard Martin and his son, authorizing billion shillings, sixpence and threepence at 92.9 grains (with a remedy of 3 dwt. per pound, or a 91.7 grains minimum) of 0.250 fine silver per shilling and copper pennies and halfpence at 30 and 15 grains respectively; namely one pound of copper, valued at 6.5d, to be converted into 16s in Irish coppers. The Irish people and the English occupation forces shunned the highly debased silver denominations in the series, namely, the shilling, sixpence and threepence (the English standard at this time, in Elizabeth’s sixth English coinage, was 0.925 fine silver at 92.9 grains per shilling). Even after the Irish third coinage silver issues had been devalued in relation to <persName>Elizabeth’s</persName> earlier, second Irish coinage, which had been issued in 0.916 fine silver at 72 grains per shilling, the silver of the base third coinage was rejected. Subsequently, English authorities issued a proclamation threatening imprisonment for refusal to accept the silver. However, the coppers met a need for small change and were used at face value. On January 22, 1604, the third coinage silver was devalued once again to put it in line with a new coinage of <persName>James I</persName> Irish silver. The <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> silver shilling for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> had previously been devalued from 12d down to 4d and was then set at 3d! The <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> irish coppers retained their face value, but were limited to no more than four pence in coppers per transaction. <persName>James I</persName> did not mint any coppers for <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, however, starting in 1613, the Harington coppers, followed by the other patent farthing issues, were emitted in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>.

Thus, the closest match in the <hi rend="italic">Corpus</hi> has no rosettes and the nearest match in Papadopoli has two rosettes, while this specimen has only one rosette.

He further commented that finding such a coin in a New World context is interesting, but not surprising since bronze or low value billon coins were essentially interchangeable as small change throughout <placeName>Europe</placeName>. The <persName>Saint Mary’s</persName> coin was found in the archaeological context of Pope’s Fort, a palisade and ditch built around the structure that had previously been <persName>Leonard Calvert’s</persName> house. <persName>Richard Ingle</persName> and his parliamentary troops constructed the strongest and most significant portion of the palisade during the winter of 1645, following their surprise assault on the colony.

See footnote 34 above, on the history of this trading post, called Fort Pentagoet, which was controlled alternately by the English then the French. The English established the trading post but lost it to the French who constructed the fort; the English retook the area in 1654 and held it until 1670, when the French returned and remained in control until the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> destroyed the fort in 1674. The recovered copper dam was minted at <placeName>Surat</placeName> between 1658 and 1672, during the reign of the Mughal Emperor <persName>Muhayyi-ud-din Aurangzeb Alamgir</persName>. <placeName>Surat</placeName> was under Portuguese influence until the British East India Company took control in 1612. Although the dam dates to the third quarter of the century, I have included it in this discussion of coins circulating to ca. 1650, because it is an excellent example of how an exotic coin from a distant country occasionally entered into circulation in the American colonies during the colonial era. Undoubtedly this dam came to <placeName>America</placeName> via the Far East trade sometime after the variety was first minted in 1658 and possibly was lost at the fort during the English occupation that ended in 1670.</p>

About the year 1700 an English traveler examining the ruins of the fort at Roanoke mentioned that some old English coins had been discovered at the site. Recently this observation was validated when the owner of nearby property recovered a 1563 sixpence, which was sold to a <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> coin collector.<ref target="#CH5-n44">44</ref>

                  <p>Much of the recovered English silver from the southern colonies appears to have been cut for use as small change, although uncut examples have also been found. <persName>James</persName> Fort excavations have unearthed some English silver from the reign of <persName>Queen Elizabeth</persName>: a one-eighth wedge of a shilling (Pl. 3, 29) at 1.5d; three sixpence (Pl. 3, 30), of which one had been cut into a rectangle of about one-quarter of a complete coin and holed, possibly for use as a pendant and another, dated 1565, cut in half to make a threepence; two halfgroats (Pl. 3, 33), one of which was halved to 1d while the other was rolled into a cylindrical shape and used as jewelry; a threehalfpence (Pl. 3, 34), halved to 3 farthings, and a silver penny of <persName>James I</persName> (Pl. 3, 37), halved to a halfpenny.<ref target="#CH5-n45">45</ref> Among the uncut English silver are three sixpence,

dated 1573, 1593, and 1602, and a <persName>James I</persName> halfpenny (the Tudor rose/ Scottish thistle variety of 1606–1608; Pl. 3, 38). Archaeologists have also recently recovered a Scottish billon eightpence groat (Pl. 3, 36) from the reign of <persName>James I</persName> (VI) dated 1597 (0.6d sterling).<ref target="#CH5-n46">46</ref> Although no gold has been recovered, <persName>James</persName> Fort archaeologists have unearthed coin weights for the <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> ryal (15s) and the <persName>James I</persName> double crown, angel, and unite as well as a weight for the French gold écu of <persName>Henry II</persName> (1546–1559) and a specimen of an écu weight issued under <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> stating the value of the coin as 6s.<ref target="#CH5-n47">47</ref> Certainly some gold found its way to <placeName>Jamestown</placeName>.

Among his possessions was a cut coin, namely, a one-third piece of a hammered gold Angel, most likely dating from the reign of <persName>Henry VIII</persName> (Pl. 4, 43).

                  <p>In the northern colonies several uncut specimens of English coinage have been unearthed. At <placeName>Ferryland</placeName> the seventeenth-century recoveries with pre–1650 minting dates include from <persName>Elizabeth I</persName>: two threepence, one groat and two sixpence (Pl. 3, 30–33); from <persName>James I</persName>: a penny (portrait variety) and a gold quarter-laurel cut down to 1s, as well as a <persName>James I</persName> Irish sixpence and two Irish shillings (Pl. 3, 39–40). In addition, a <persName>James I</persName> Tudor rose/ Scottish thistle penny variety was found in a post–1696 fill layer. From the reign of <persName>Charles I</persName>, <placeName>Ferryland</placeName> archaeologists have found two shillings (Pl. 4, 41) and a Scottish 20d piece (Pl. 4, 44) in a seventeenth-century context, as well as a silver penny that was recovered in an eighteenth-century fill layer (Pl. 4, 45).

                     <placeName>Greater Boston</placeName> and <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> have been continuously built-up over the past four centuries, leaving little opportunity for extended archaeological investigations. Consequently, just a few early, pre–1650, archaeological sites have been excavated in this historically important area. To the best of my knowledge only one of those sites, the RM excavation at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> Plantation, has yielded English silver: a penny from the mint of the Archbishop of <placeName>York</placeName> emitted during the reign of <persName>Henry VII</persName> (Pl. 4, 46) and a <persName>James I</persName> third coinage penny of the Tudor rose/Scottish thistle variety.<ref target="#CH5-n55">55</ref> However, many records and probate inventories from <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay and <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> Colony mention sums or values in ready money or silver, thus we know coins were available. For example, the probate inventory of Stephen Deans of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, which was taken on October 2, 1634, stated that he had money that came to a total value of 7s as well as five pounds of beaver valued at £2 10s.<ref target="#CH5-n56">56</ref> Unfortunately, the inventory simply states "In Monye" and then gives the appraised value as 7s, so we have no idea what varieties or denomination of coins were present. In a few cases the inventories mention specific varieties of coins and it is clear that English coinage was present. The 1633 probate inventory of <persName>Richard Lackford</persName> of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> lists among his possessions a box containing three one-shilling coins.<ref target="#CH5-n57">57</ref> We also know that in late July 1636, Lieutenant Lion Gardener, commander of a <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay outpost at Saybrook (now Old Saybrook) at the mouth of the Connecticut River, purchased goods for five gold pieces from the merchant and fur trader, <persName>John Oldham</persName>, in

Court rulings from August 20, 1623, also suggest there was some specie, since prices for various wines, beer and hard liquor were set both in ready money and tobacco. For example, sack sherry was not to be sold above 4s the gallon in ready money or above 6s the gallon in tobacco, when tobacco was 3s per pound (see <persName>McIlwaine</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Minutes of the Council and General Court,</hi> 5). The court records are quite fragmentary, but in subsequent years payments mentioned in the surviving records were typically expressed in tobacco, or occasionally corn, but not coin, suggesting coin payments became rare.</p>

The gold angel, named for the image of St. Michael the Archangel spearing a dragon on the obverse of the coin, was first minted under <persName>Edward IV</persName> during his second coinage issue of 1464–1470 and was originally valued at 6s 8d, later raised to 10s.

In 1639 it seems more probable that a <persName>Henry VIII</persName> example is the Harry Angel being described (although, as discussed below, a <persName>Henry VII</persName> penny from the mint of Archbishop Rotherham of York, was recovered at Plymouth Plantation).</p>

                     <p>Berry, "The Numismatic Record," 25–44 and 65–66, with one Irish shilling (listed on 65 as item 89 [well-worn but probably from the second coinage]) from a post–1696 refuse layer. The other two pieces of <persName>James I</persName> Irish silver are: a sixpence, on 42, item 37 worn at the top so the privy mark is lost but from the form of the legend (discussed at the end of this note) we know it is from the first coinage of 1603–1604, while the other shilling (66, item 90) is from the second coinage and bears a martlet privy mark, dating it to 1604–1605. Due to mixed deposits and plough zone recoveries not all items are accurately datable as to a precise archaeological context as to when the coins were first deposited (i.e., when they were lost). The archaeological context of the <placeName>Ferryland</placeName> finds as listed in Berry are as follows. <persName>Elizabeth I</persName>: threepence, one mixed deposit and the other before 1650; the groat, between 1660 and the end of the century; the sixpence, one from a mixed deposit and one from a plough zone; <persName>James I</persName>: penny, a pre–1650 recovery, cut laurel, a pre–1650 recovery; Irish sixpence, a surface find, Irish shillings, one undated find at the bottom of a defensive ditch and the other from post–1696 refuse layer; and <persName>Charles I</persName>: penny, from a eighteenth century fill layer, shillings, one from a plow zone and another from a late seventeenth century context and the Scottish 20d piece is from the Kirke midden, dating to the mid to later seventeenth century. See also <persName>Jordan</persName>, "DK Token": 3022–3033, which explains the interpretation of the dating of the recoveries in more detail. It is interesting to note that <persName>James I</persName> Irish shillings and sixpence also circulated in <placeName>England</placeName>. Several specimens are cited in Edward Besly, <hi rend="italic">English Civil War Coin Hoards</hi> (<placeName>London</placeName>, 1987), 12, 20, 36, 39, 47. Besly also mentions that some Scottish 20d coins of <persName>Charles I</persName> were recovered in English hoards on 36 and 39. See also Colgan, <hi rend="italic">For Want of Good Money,</hi> 103–107, on the two coinages of Irish silver under <persName>James I</persName>, which had a higher intrinsic value than <persName>Elizabeth’s</persName> third coinage silver for <placeName>Ireland</placeName> (see footnote 37 above on the Irish issues of <persName>Elizabeth</persName>). The <persName>James I</persName> issues passed at a value of 9d sterling per Irish shilling, however they were actually slightly overvalued for, although they were three-quarters of the weight of English issues, 72 grains to the English 92.9 grains per shilling, they were only .758 fine silver, which is below the English .925 sterling fineness. Interestingly, the royal proclamation of October 1603, authorizing the coinage stated that the shilling "shall goe current and be taken of all persons in this kingdome for twelve pence sterlinge" and other denominations proportionally. This phrase caused confusion in <placeName>England</placeName>, since it literally put the lighter Irish emission on par with English silver, however, it was not until three years later that a proclamation was issued clarifying that the value was only "twelve pence Irishe... but nyne pence English." See Colgan, cited above, for extended passages from the proclamations quoted in this footnote. The privy marks of the bell (1603–1604) and the martlet (1604–1605) are associated with the first Irish coinage of 1604, which includes in the obverse legend ANG • SCO, while the second coinage of 1604–1607 revises the legend to MAG • BRIT and employs the martlet (1604–1605), rose (1605–1606) and escallop (1606–1607) privy marks.</p>

Additionally, 589 glass beads for the fur trade were uncovered from the early occupation layer.

                        <persName>Karin Goldstein</persName> showed me these recoveries when I visited Plimoth Plantation on December 5, 2006. The coin labeled "C1-Low Countries silver," which is well-worn, clipped and slightly bent, is actually a <persName>Henry VII</persName> (1485–1509) sovereign penny from the ecclesiastic mint of York issued by Archbishop <persName>Rotherham</persName>. It can be identified because the Tudor shield with two keys below is clearly visible on the reverse (keys are not included below the shield on coins from other ecclesiastic mints). The <persName>James I</persName> penny, listed as item C1–119, has a reverse rim legend that lacks stops between words and displays two pellets above the thistle, placing it in the third coinage of 1619–1625. It is the variety with an inner beaded circle.</p>

                        <persName>Gardener</persName> had recently emigrated from <placeName>England</placeName> and thus probably possessed English coins. Also, it seems the £50 in gold held by <persName>Oldham</persName> was not in chunky Spanish-American cobs but rather in hammered <placeName>Europe</placeName>an coinage, again, probably English (as we shall also see below with the <persName>Richmond</persName> Island hoard), because, as is explained below, Indians holed the coins and used them in necklaces. We have encountered an Indian coin necklace made up of <persName>James I</persName> copper tokens recovered at the Indian burial site on the south side of the Piscataway Creek in <placeName>Maryland</placeName> (see footnotes 20 and 21 above) and have also noted that several recovered copper jetons were holed for suspension. The Scottish Puritan soldier and fortification engineer, <persName>Lion Gardener</persName> arrived in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay on November 28, 1635, and was directed to what is now called Old Saybrook, Connecticut, where he constructed a fort and commanded a contingent of twenty soldiers. <persName>John Oldham</persName> was a merchant, who originally settled in <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> in 1623, and then moved to Watertown in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay sometime before July of 1632. In 1633, he became engaged in the Connecticut Valley fur trade. In 1634, he opened a trading post at Wethersfield on the Connecticut River (just south of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>). In late July of 1636, during the Pequot War, <persName>Oldham</persName> traveled down to the mouth of the Connecticut River stopping at Old Saybrook, where he sold <persName>Gardener</persName> some items before setting sail into Long Island Sound heading east for Block Island. It seems <persName>Oldham</persName> was planning to trade with the Indians and possibly either acquire some goods from <placeName>Dutch</placeName> traders or return to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, since he was carrying his gold. While at Block Island, <persName>Oldham</persName> was murdered by an Indian, who was allied with the Narragansett tribes. <persName>Gardener</persName> related this incident in his narrative of the Pequot War as follows, "But I wonder, and so doth many more with me, that the Bay [<placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay] doth no better revenge the murdering of Mr. <persName>Oldham</persName>, an honest man of their own... The Narragansets that were at Block Island killed him, and had £50 of gold of his, for I saw it when he had five pieces of me, and put it up into a clout [a rag or scrap of cloth] and tied it up all together, when he went away from me to Block Island; but the Narragansets had it [the gold coins] and punched holes into it, and put it about their necks for jewels; and afterwards I saw the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> have some of it, which they had of the Narragansets at a small rate." <persName>Gardener’s</persName> account is in <persName>Charles</persName> Orr, ed., <hi rend="italic">History of the Pequot War: The Contemporary Accounts of Mason, Underhill, <persName>Vincent</persName> and <persName>Gardener</persName>

                  <p>There is little recovered foreign silver found in pre–1650 archaeological contexts. For the most part, the finds are small denomination coins, with only one documented eight-reales, which was recovered in <placeName>Newfoundland</placeName>. Certainly some eight-reales were available in the southern colonies. Governor <persName>Butler’s</persName> contemporary account of the <placeName>Bermuda</placeName> or <placeName>Somer Islands</placeName> Plantation relates that in 1615, "Spanish dollars" estimated at about £20 in value (about 90 coins) were discovered at the Flemish Wreck, a bay at the northern point of Sandys Tribe bordering on Somerset.<ref target="#CH5-n62">62</ref> These valuable coins were kept
<pb n="219"/>
secure and spent on imported goods. Unfortunately for us, it seems Spanish dollars were rarely misplaced or lost. However, a few smaller denomination foreign silver coins were lost and have been unearthed. At <persName>James</persName> Fort, excavations have uncovered a German sechsling of 1629 from <placeName>Lubeck</placeName> (a silver six-pfennig coin; Pl. 4, 47), a <placeName>Dutch</placeName> two-stuivers from <placeName>Zeeland</placeName>, dated 161[—] (Pl. 4, 48), a silver Swedish one-öre of <persName>John III</persName> (Pl. 4, 49), dated 1576 and a shilling from Livonia dated 1577 (Pl. 4, 50).<ref target="#CH5-n63">63</ref> In <placeName>Ferryland</placeName> the few foreign silver coins that have been unearthed reflect the colony’s partners and destinations in the fishing trade. The coins recovered in a

seventeenth-century archaeological context, up through the 2002 summer excavation, have been reported by <persName>Berry</persName> and include: two examples of the douzain from <placeName>France</placeName>; a s<persName>Ingle</persName> one-stuiver coin, two two-stuivers and one six-stuiver coin cut down to 1d from the Netherlands; a 60-reis, a 100-reis (Pl. 4, 51), and a 120-reis coin from <placeName>Portugal</placeName>; a half-real of <persName>Ferdinand</persName> and <persName>Isabella</persName> from <placeName>Spain</placeName> (Pl. 4, 52) and a one real (Pl. 4, 53) and an eight-reales cob (Pl. 5, 54) from Spanish <placeName>America</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n64">64</ref> In Maine, no foreign silver datable to a pre–1650 context has yet been recovered from excavations at English trading posts.<ref target="#CH5-n65">65</ref> At the RM site on <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> Plantation, so far only one coin has been recovered that may be of foreign origin. Unfortunately, it cannot be accurately identified because the planchet is worn almost completely smooth. The artifact has a diameter of 30mm and appears to be from continental <placeName>Europe</placeName> based on the few letters that can be distinguished on the legend (Pl. 5, 55).<ref target="#CH5-n66">66</ref>

                  <p>All of these coins, coppers and tokens helped facilitate exchange in an economy that heavily depended on barter and the use of money substitutes, such as beaver, wampum, corn and tobacco. I shall come back to the question of the circulation of Spanish-American silver later, but before leaving the pre–1640 period, I would like to present a vignette of the economy at a
<pb n="221"/>
Maine trading-post from the 1630s, that, at first glance, appears to be an economy without coinage, but on closer inspection demonstrates the dichotomy of local and international exchange.</p>

A "wet and foul" wad of rope yarn was pulled out of one of the recovered cannon and about eight or nine days later the wad was loaded into the cannon and used as shot, while testing the salvaged ordnance. The canon was aimed toward the harbor, but it was observed that the wad of rope quickly broke apart. It was then learned from surviving ship crewmen that £30 in gold and silver coins had been hidden in the rope. Several <placeName>Boston</placeName>ians immediately began searching the harbor at low tide and took the coins. <persName>John Winthrop</persName> stated that <persName>Edward Bendall</persName>, the individual who recovered the wreck, brought action in court to recover the coins and was judged to be the rightful owner of the booty.

He relates that a report reached the governor stating there was a large treasure containing "Spanish dollars and <placeName>Portugall</placeName> crusadoes," but, "arriueinge at the hopefull place, instead of the heapes they looke for, behold some smale aspersions of dollers (to the totall value of about some twenty poundes sterlinge) are found." See <persName>Nathaniel Butler</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Historye of the <placeName>Bermudaes</placeName>,</hi> 68 and <persName>Henry C. Wilkinson</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Adventurers of <placeName>Bermuda</placeName>: A History of the Island from its Discovery until the Dissolution of the Somers Islands Company in 1684,</hi> 2nd ed. (<placeName>London</placeName>: Oxford University Press, 1958), 74–75. At the time, a Spanish eight-reales, or dollar, was valued at 4s 4d, thus making about £20 value somewhere around 90 to 95 coins. According to Ives, the place name "Flemish Wreck," dates back to 1619, when a Flemish man-of-war of 30 tons with a crew of 27 was cast upon the shoals near Somerset. The crew abandoned their ship, making it to the shore on a raft; as described in a letter by <persName>Lewis Hughes</persName> to <persName>Nathaniel Rich</persName> of August 12, 1619, see Ives, <hi rend="italic">The Rich Papers,</hi> 137–139. Thus, the use of the place name "Flemish wrack" by <persName>Butler</persName> as the location of an event that occurred in 1615, is probably an anachronism; <persName>Nathaniel Butler</persName> was governor of <placeName>Bermuda</placeName> from 1619 until 1622 and wrote his history of <placeName>Bermuda</placeName> after returning to <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>

Most of the recoveries I discuss were found in soil layers that can be dated to a period before 1660, that is, the item was lost in the ground sometime before 1660. However, one must remember archaeological context does not always allow us to date precisely when an item was lost, especially when dealing with recoveries from plow zones or areas with continuous occupation.

For the most part, coins that clearly date to the later part of the century are excluded from this discussion, but occasionally may be mentioned in the footnotes. Additionally, one must realize there are several recovered coins that have not yet been published and, further, every season more coins are found as archaeological digs continue. The varieties and totals given here should only be taken as an indication of the quantities and varieties of coins that circulated in the early colonial period.</p>

               <p>We are extraordinarily fortunate that a substantial correspondence survives from the manager of an early trading and fishing settlement on <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName>, which is located about ten miles south of <placeName>Portland</placeName>, Maine, off the coast of <placeName>Cape Elizabeth</placeName>, at the south end of <placeName>Casco Bay</placeName>. From these records we get a glimpse of how exchanges occurred in this area and the way in which coins were used in trade and commerce. Further, from a <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> coin hoard that dates back to this era, we can identify some of the coinage that was available in the region.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>John Winter</persName> supervised a small fishing community of about sixty individuals centered on <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> who worked for a company of investors in <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, <placeName>England</placeName>, headed by the merchant <persName>Robert Trelawny</persName>. The workers signed on for a term of three years and were paid a portion of the catch, with craftsmen, farmers, and other non-fishing personnel drawing an annual wage. The company also ran a trading post, with Winter as the manager. Each year the annual catch of cod was sent to <placeName>Spain</placeName> where it was sold for hard currency. Profits were then disbursed to the shareholders and workers with a portion of the funds being used to purchase manufactured goods that were then shipped to <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> for sale at the trading post.<ref target="#CH5-n67">67</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There were several small English outposts in the <placeName>Portland</placeName> area where settlers did a mixture of farming, fishing and some fur trading. Additionally,
<pb n="222"/>
some independent fur traders annually purchased supplies from <persName>John Winter</persName> before leaving for the backcountry on fur trading expeditions. The <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> trading post stocked a variety of imported manufactured items that could be traded to the local Indians for beaver pelts. These items were usually called "truck" and came to include various types of cloth and blankets along with kettles, knives, hatchets, pins, hooks, and needles among other things. Fur traders had no money and so could not afford to make over-the-counter purchases at the trading post. Therefore, Winter extended them credit for truck items, anticipating that they would pay him with beaver pelts upon their return from the backcountry. Winter bluntly explained to Trelawny that locals wanted the products he sold but they did not have any good method to pay for them, stating, "The most parte of the dwellers heare ar good buyers but bad payers."<ref target="#CH5-n68">68</ref> The result of this situation was that when the traders had beaver, Winter’s products sold at profitable rates, but this was only the case if the price of pelts remained stable or increased, otherwise profits would decline, "for heare [Winter declared] with vs theris [there is] no other payment for goods byt bever."<ref target="#CH5-n69">69</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In addition to stocking truck for the fur trade, Winter also sold goods to be consumed by the local English inhabitants. These were two distinct clienteles. For unlike the fur traders who made quantity or bulk purchases each season before leaving on an expedition, the local inhabitants came to the post periodically to make small purchases. Company employees could obtain goods on credit against future earnings but independent local residents needed to have some means of paying for their necessities. The local population did not have much coin, but they were all involved in the beaver trade to some degree. Goods at the trading post sold for beaver pelts and were priced accordingly. In 1634, Winter wrote to Trelawny,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Heare, I put away goods to the English now &amp; then, bread at 6 lb. of bever [per hogshead], pease at 7 lb. [per hogshead], Cootes [coates], somm at 2 lb., somm 2 lb. 1/4, stockins 2 lb. per dozen, shues at 6 ounces &amp; som at 7 ounces, but I sell but few; sacke &amp; acquavite 2 gallons per lb. of bever, &amp; som tymes but 6 or 7 quartes per lb., as the tymes do serue of plenty or scanty...<ref target="#CH5-n70">70</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="223"/>
               <p>Thus, <persName>John Winter</persName> accepted larger annual payments in beaver pelts from the fur traders for the truck they bought on credit and also accepted beaver for over-the-counter purchases from local settlers.</p>
               <p>When items were sold to company employees, prices were denominated in sterling in the ledger and charged against future earnings. Thus, when reporting to <persName>Trelawny</persName>, post manager <persName>Winter</persName> used two monetary systems, namely beaver and sterling. For instance, soon after enumerating the beaver prices just quoted, <persName>Winter</persName> went on to explain that he sold waistcoats to local residents at three-quarters of a beaver pelt, while a company employee’s account was debited six shillings per waistcoat.</p>
               <p>From <persName>Winter’s</persName> letters and ledger entries it appears that on the local level most trading post transactions were conducted using beaver or, during the final years of the settlement, sacks of corn at harvest time, while company employees used credit against future wages. Winter occasionally mentions that some coin was available, but this coin was typically not used in daily exchange; rather it was reserved for foreign trade.</p>
               <p>The <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> trading post was not a self-sufficient enterprise, but rather depended on regional and trans<placeName>Atlantic</placeName> partnerships to obtain supplies and find markets for its products. We can see this process in operation based on the surviving records relating to the <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> imports and exports from 1638. During the spring, two ships delivered supplies that had been purchased in <placeName>England</placeName> at the request of <persName>John Winter</persName> to be sold at the trading post. After the merchandise was brought ashore the two ships were loaded with salted fish to be taken to market in <placeName>Spain</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n71">71</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Although corn and meat were scarce in 1638, it seems the plantation felt it was well stocked with other supplies once both ships had safely arrived and unloaded their cargoes.<ref target="#CH5-n72">72</ref> Indeed, a third supply ship, the <hi rend="italic">Hercules,</hi> was expected in September.<ref target="#CH5-n73">73</ref> Post manager <persName>Winter</persName> felt that he had a more than sufficient stock of wine, oil and earthenware pots, so he shipped the extra
<pb n="224"/>
supplies to <placeName>Boston</placeName> on the company boat, where the wine and oil sold, but no buyer was found for the pots.<ref target="#CH5-n74">74</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It seems that while the company boat was in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay an independent merchant from <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, docked at <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> from whom <persName>Winter</persName> purchased £86 1s in merchandise. Now, <persName>Winter</persName> had recently sent his stock of fish to market on the ships that arrived in the spring and needed to build up an inventory for the <hi rend="italic">Hercules,</hi> expected in about six weeks. Thus he was not able to offer fish to the Irish merchant in payment for his purchases. Without fish, <persName>Winter</persName> was required to pay in specie. However, since he did not have sufficient funds on hand, he paid a small amount, £6 1s, in money in order to round the debt down to exactly £80 and then charged that amount to <persName>Trelawny’s</persName> account in <placeName>England</placeName> by giving the Irish merchant a bill of exchange to be presented to <persName>Trelawny</persName> for payment. What is most interesting is that in a letter to <persName>Trelawny</persName>, <persName>Winter</persName> explained if the merchant had been able to wait fifteen days longer before departing, he could have been paid in money because at that time Captain Hawkins returned from the excursion to <placeName>Boston</placeName> with some specie. From <persName>Winter’s</persName> annual accounts for the plantation we learn the wine and oil sent to <placeName>Boston</placeName> sold for a total of £549 6s 11d, with half of the purchase price being paid immediately and the other half extended as credit, to be paid in six months. We also discover that <persName>Winter</persName> had locally sold about six hogsheads (3 butts) of the wine that was paid for with beaver pelts.<ref target="#CH5-n75">75</ref>
                  <persName>Winter</persName> explained that since the expedition to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay had returned, he had a total of about £250, of which £160 was in money and the rest, namely £90, in beaver.<ref target="#CH5-n76">76</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="225"/>
               <p>In addition to the £160 in specie received in 1638, there are some transactions from 1639 that demonstrate the use of coinage. In September of 1639, when sending returns to Trelawny in <placeName>England</placeName>, <persName>John Winter</persName> explained that he was shipping "sixty pounds in English gold" on the <hi rend="italic">Fellowship</hi> under the command of George Luxton.<ref target="#CH5-n77">77</ref>
               </p>
               <p>From <persName>Winter’s</persName> accounts we can see that coins came into the <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> trading post from sales to colonial merchants, primarily in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. Some of this coin was used to pay company workers, when the employee’s salary exceeded the credit purchases they had made that year at the trading post. Thus, we discover that while there were almost no coin transactions among the local inhabitants in the <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> area, the company and some fishermen did have a certain amount of coinage, which they acquired from regional and trans<placeName>Atlantic</placeName> ventures and that they used the specie to purchase products from merchant supply ships and to make returns to <placeName>England</placeName>. The use of specie and the reference to a payment to Trelawny from <persName>Winter</persName> in English gold, mentioned above, give us a context for a remarkable coin hoard uncovered on <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> over a century ago.</p>
               <p>On May 11, 1855, a Mr. Hanscom and his son uncovered a ceramic quart-size container while plowing a previously uncultivated plot of land about 100 feet from the <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> shoreline. The vessel contained twenty-one gold and thirty silver coins having a face value of £20 2s 7d along with a gold wedding ring. All the recovered coins were English except for one Scottish 1602 gold "sword and septre" piece. All coins dated between the reigns of <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> and <persName>Charles I</persName> with the most recent item being a <persName>Charles I</persName> gold unite bearing a heart privy mark, used 1628–1629, thus making it possible that this hoard dates to the period of <persName>Winter’s</persName> trading post.<ref target="#CH5-n78">78</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="226"/>
               <p>Overall, the hoard included a face value of £19 4s in gold and 18s 7d in silver. Categorized by denominations the hoard contained: two threehalfpence, one groat, 18 sixpence, nine shillings, three gold double crowns (Pl. 5, 56), and one Scottish "sword and septre" variety (Pl. 5, 57) (the double crowns and the Scottish gold coin each had a face value of 10s sterling), 15 gold laurels or unites at 20s (Pl. 5, 58–59) and two gold unites at 22s. Most of the silver coinage was from the reign of <persName>Elizabeth I</persName>, while the majority of the gold coins came from the emissions of <persName>James I</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n79">79</ref> Undoubtedly this is due to the fact that silver coinage predominated during the reign of <persName>Elizabeth</persName> with silver accounting for 85% of all coin production, while under <persName>James I</persName> gold coins comprised about 90% of the mint’s output.<ref target="#CH5-n80">80</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The <persName>Richmond</persName> hoard contains higher denomination coins. There are a considerable number of gold coins and the silver denominations are almost exclusively sixpence and shillings with only three examples of smaller denominations. This accumulation clearly does not represent coins used in local exchange but rather represents someone’s savings, most likely hidden in the earth to keep it secure. The coins may have been acquired from some combination of payments by <persName>Trelawny’s</persName> company for independently obtained fish sold to <persName>Winter</persName> along with money paid to an employee as his portion of the fishing profits, once his trading post account had been balanced. It is also possible these funds may reflect some profit from the sale of items in the regional trade with <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the hoard is almost exclusively English, with a s<persName>Ingle</persName> Scottish gold piece. It is possible that these coins do not represent a cross
<pb n="227"/>
section of all the coins available locally at that time, but that they were collected with a bias for higher denomination English coins. However, that such a grouping of English gold and silver could be accumulated on the <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> outpost, suggests a close connection with English trade and finance.</p>
               <p>At <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName>, we find a settlement with two very distinct methods of payment. Local purchases rarely, if ever, included specie transactions. Company employees used credit against future wages, while local residents developed a barter system in which beaver was the standard of exchange with corn and other commodities employed when beaver was scarce, or, when the seller preferred payment in the other items. On the other hand, regional trade was based on the sale of goods for specie or by barter, exchanging one marketable or needed commodity for another. In the <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> area, the commodity offered in such trades was typically fish. Occasionally bills of exchange were accepted in lieu of specie, but such bills were often deemed by the creditors to be too risky. Usually international imports could only be acquired for specie or valid bills of exchange payable in <placeName>England</placeName>. Specie played a minimal, almost nonexistent, role in local exchange, but was an important element in the regional and trans<placeName>Atlantic</placeName> trade of <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName>. Company employees and probably to a lesser extent a few local residents had some specie available, but they reserved it for the purchase of regional and foreign imports that were occasionally available when truck merchants, offering their wares for sale, docked in the area. They did not use specie for daily exchange among themselves or at the trading post. Furthermore, it seems that a significant portion of the available specie was in English coin.</p>

               <p>I would now like to move down from the Maine coast of the late 1630s to <placeName>Boston</placeName> in 1640. In the ten years following the founding of <placeName>Boston</placeName> in 1630, over 21,000 English subjects with Puritan inclinations migrated from their homeland to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. The population in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> grew at a faster rate than the supply of goods. Colonists complained about the high cost of food and the scarcity of manufactured items. Some silver and gold
<pb n="228"/>
coin was available but it was not easy to come by. In fact, the coin supply had to be supplemented with commodity money. This was accomplished by offering the purchaser credit with payment due later, usually in corn, wheat or some other specified crop that was periodically rated by the colony. For larger purchases, cattle, priced on the open market, were typically used as the means of transferring wealth.</p>
               <p>When specie was available it was used to make purchases in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, but much of it was eventually spent on merchandise offered by importers docked at the wharf in <placeName>Boston</placeName> Harbor. During the General Court of March 3, 1635/6, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay tried to regulate the import trade by prohibiting anyone except government authorized agents from making purchases directly from the importers. The goal of the legislation was to allow the state to control the import trade by setting both wholesale and retail prices. However, the government’s efforts proved to be unpopular and the prohibition was quickly repealed three months later at the next meeting of the General Court on May 25, 1636. Importers preferred to sell provisions on the open market and the colonists who were fortunate enough to have some specie, or who had family credit in <placeName>England</placeName>, preferred to acquire items directly from the importers at wholesale rates.<ref target="#CH5-n81">81</ref> Merchants, fishermen and traders came to <placeName>Boston</placeName> with wares and departed with much of the available coin, along with bills of credit, and some promissory notes. However, the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay coin supply did not dry up because, as more colonists arrived in <placeName>Boston</placeName> with their life savings, the meager money supply was replenished. This precarious cycle came to a halt in 1640. Although some English coinage continued to be available after 1640, that year was a defining moment in the history of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay economy. Major transformations were set in motion that can be viewed as the initial steps leading to the founding of the Hull mint.</p>
               <p>In November of 1640, the anti-royalist Long Parliament assembled in <placeName>London</placeName> and quickly took control of governmental affairs, giving hope to Puritans in <placeName>England</placeName> that long awaited reforms would finally be implemented. This political event immediately ended the great migration. Without
<pb n="229"/>
additional colonists there was no new supply of English money and <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay sank into an economic depression.<ref target="#CH5-n82">82</ref> The ramifications of the migration cessation were felt throughout the English colonies, including the royalist plantation in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, where the economic situation already looked bleak due to the declining price of Chesapeake tobacco.<ref target="#CH5-n83">83</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, it appears emigration from <placeName>England</placeName> slackened considerably during the spring and summer of 1640, as Puritans elected to forgo the hardships of a trans<placeName>Atlantic</placeName> voyage and colonization, anticipating reforms would soon be in place once the <placeName>London</placeName> Parliament assembled. Indeed, <persName>John Winter</persName>, at <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName>, Maine, recognized this situation and wrote to Robert Trelawny on June 27, 1640, that, "Provision is very plentyfull now in the Bay [<placeName>Boston</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay], &amp; very Cheape. Money growes scarce their [there] with them; yf [if] passangers Com not over with money, the prize [price] of Cattell will fall speedily."<ref target="#CH5-n84">84</ref>
                  <persName>Winter’s</persName>
                  <pb n="230"/>
analysis proved accurate. Indeed, during that summer <persName>John Winthrop</persName> noted, "This year there came over great store of provisions, both out of <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, and but few passengers, (and those brought very little money,)...so now all our money was drained from us, and cattle and all commodities grew very cheap." In October of 1640, Winthrop noted that, "The scarcity of money made a great change in all commerce. Merchants would sell no wares but for ready money [i.e., coin], men could not pay their debt though they had enough [i.e. assets, such as property and capital goods], prices of lands and cattle fell soon to the one half and less, yea to a third, and after one fourth part."<ref target="#CH5-n85">85</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There is an excellent example of the rapid decline in cattle value in a letter of late August 1640 from <persName>Edward Carlton</persName> to <persName>John Winthrop</persName>. <persName>Carlton</persName>, in <persName>Rowley</persName>, <persName>Essex County</persName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, was preparing to depart for <placeName>England</placeName> on the <hi rend="italic">Sparrow</hi> on September first. He needed cash for his trip and wrote to <persName>Winthrop</persName> eight days before leaving, asking <persName>Winthrop</persName> for funds so that <persName>Winthrop’s</persName> account with him would be balanced. <persName>Winthrop</persName> owed Carlton £73 in money, for which <persName>Winthrop</persName> had paid £28 in money along with a heifer, a cow, and a calf. Carlton stated that he could only get 20 marks for the heifer (a mark equaled two-thirds of a pound, thus the value was £13 6s 8d), but that he would credit <persName>Winthrop</persName> £14; for the cow and calf he could get £20. This meant <persName>Winthrop</persName> still owed him £11. The price of cattle had declined so quickly that in the time it took for the animals to get from <placeName>Boston</placeName> to <persName>Rowley</persName>, about 30 miles to the north, <persName>Winthrop’s</persName> payment was short!<ref target="#CH5-n86">86</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="231"/>
               <p>
                  <persName>John Winter</persName> had noticed signs of an impending money shortage in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay as early as June of 1640, months before the <persName>Carlton</persName> letter of late August. Evidence of this money shortage during the summer of that year can be detected in the notebook of Thomas Lechford, an attorney who practiced in <placeName>Boston</placeName> from June 27, 1638, through July 29, 1641, when he returned to <placeName>England</placeName>. Lechford drew up various legal instruments such as certificates, mortgages, indentures, bills of exchange, warrants, and petitions, typically charging from 6d to 2s for his services.<ref target="#CH5-n87">87</ref> Over his three-year tenure in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, Lechford produced over 650 legal documents in about 560 customer transactions, of which some transactions were for multiple documents. Each transaction was listed separately in his notebook, with payment recorded in brackets at the end of the entry. Interestingly, it appears that almost all of his payments were in money since Lechford explained the
<pb n="232"/>
details of any payment made in commodities. From June of 1638, when he opened his business through June of 1640, there were no commodity payments. Then, between July and September of 1640, <persName>Lechford</persName> recorded five payments in commodities, with three others up through June of 1641.<ref target="#CH5-n88">88</ref> Thus, based on payments recorded by <persName>Lechford</persName> during the period leading up to and then into the depression, the money supply appears to have tightened by July 1640. The relationship between the lack of new colonists and the scarcity of money was clear to all <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay inhabitants by the time <persName>Lechford</persName> departed for <placeName>London</placeName> in the late summer of 1641. Indeed, that spring, on June 2, 1641, <persName>John Winthrop</persName> had explained the situation in some detail.<ref target="#CH5-n89">89</ref> Soon after returning to <placeName>London</placeName>, <persName>Lechford</persName> wrote a book about <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay that was published in 1642 and stated that "Money is wanting by reason of the failing of passengers there two last yeares."<ref target="#CH5-n90">90</ref> Several projects were implemented at that time to redirect the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> economy.<ref target="#CH5-n91">91</ref> One of these initiatives was a shift from
<pb n="233"/>
constructing houses to building ships.<ref target="#CH5-n92">92</ref> In February 1641, the Reverend Hugh Peter coordinated a project to construct a 300-ton ship in Salem and soon thereafter the people of <placeName>Boston</placeName> began work on a 150-ton vessel.<ref target="#CH5-n93">93</ref> This was the first step toward developing a new economy in fishing and entering the international import and export trade. That same year <persName>John Turner of Roxbury</persName> took a small pinnace of 15 tons to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, and, in the words of <persName>John Winthrop</persName>, "returned with great advantage in indigo, and pieces of 8, etc."<ref target="#CH5-n94">94</ref> The next summer five more ships were built, three in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, including the 200-ton merchant ship <hi rend="italic">Trial,</hi> one in <placeName>Dorchester</placeName> and another in <placeName>Salem</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n95">95</ref> As late as 1639, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay had imported fish from <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> and other northern fisheries. By the early 1640s, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> had become an exporter of fish and was positioning itself to become a significant merchant center for the transportation of commodities to and from the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> and beyond.<ref target="#CH5-n96">96</ref> In 1643, <placeName>Boston</placeName> merchants sent
<pb n="234"/>
the <hi rend="italic">Trial</hi> to the distant island of <placeName>Fayal</placeName> in the Azores with a cargo of salted cod and barrel staves that were traded for wine. The ship then continued to the island of St. Christopher (<persName>St. Kitts</persName>) in the Caribbean where some wine was traded for cotton and tobacco. <persName>Winthrop</persName> explained that the crew also salvaged guns and anchors off the shore of the island, which they brought home along with some "gold and silver" that they obtained through trade. The following year the <hi rend="italic">Trial</hi> transported salted cod to Bilbao, <placeName>Spain</placeName>, then sailed on to <placeName>Malaga</placeName> before returning to <placeName>Boston</placeName> with wine, fruit, oil, iron, and wool. The following year, <placeName>Boston</placeName> merchants traveled to the <placeName>Canary Islands</placeName> where they entered the highly profitable slave trade.<ref target="#CH5-n97">97</ref>
               </p>
               <p>During the 1630s, Spanish-American coinage was not commonly encountered in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. This is not to say such coinage was unknown in the area, just that it was not prevalent. We have seen Spanish silver was a very small portion of the pre–1650 <placeName>Newfoundland</placeName> coin recoveries and it also appears from the documentary evidence that Spanish silver was a minor coinage in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay before the depression of 1640. However, several references to Spanish silver are found in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay documents from the 1640s and later periods, indicating that the depleted supply of English money was being replenished with foreign coins, particularly Spanish-American cobs. Indeed, in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, as late
<pb n="235"/>
as the General Court Order of May 13, 1640, Spanish-American silver was still rated at par with <placeName>London</placeName> at 4s 4d (52d) per eight-reales. There was no attempt to retain cob silver in the colony, rather it was viewed as a trade coin to be used for foreign payments and thus was valued at the English rate. This rating was endorsed in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay just a few months before the Long Parliament was called in <placeName>London</placeName>, the event that ended the great Puritan migration and ushered in the first depression in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. However, two years later, as the colony was recovering from the depression, the situation dramatically changed. In June of 1642, and again three months later in September, the value of the eight-reales was advanced in two 4d increments from 4s 4d (52d) to 5s (60d).<ref target="#CH5-n98">98</ref> Cob coinage was coming into the colony, as we have seen in the 1641 expedition of <persName>John Turner</persName>, and the General Court was advancing the value of Spanish-American silver to attract more silver into <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay.<ref target="#CH5-n99">99</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="236"/>
               <p>The records of the <placeName>Boston notary</placeName>, <persName>William Aspinwall</persName>, survive for the period 1644–1651, listing hundreds of contracts, many of which relate to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> trade. Several of these documents include payments in commodities or money, without mentioning the specific type of money to be used, but some specify Spanish dollars, such as the accounts of <persName>Thomas Babb</persName> for 1644 and 1649.<ref target="#CH5-n100">100</ref> This indicates that just a few years after <persName>John Winter</persName> sent £60 in English gold from <placeName>Richmond Island</placeName> to make payments in <placeName>England</placeName>, in September of 1639, we find <placeName>Boston</placeName> merchants using Spanish-American silver rather than English gold. The trend continued throughout the decade. Among other documents, there is an invoice from 1648 of which £20 10s 11d was to be paid in pieces-of-eight rated at 5s each (82 cobs) with the remaining 11d to be paid in wampum. Also, there is a bill of exchange from 1649 payable in Barbados for 100 pieces-of-eight. Indeed, by 1646 the General Court deemed the quantity of Spanish-American silver in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay to be sufficient to repeal a law of 1641 that had allowed employers to pay workmen in corn rather than money, regardless of the stipulations in the original agreement, stating that "from henceforth all bargaines made for mony shallbe performed &amp; paid in mony."<ref target="#CH5-n101">101</ref> The
<pb n="237"/>
quantity of Spanish-American cob money in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay increased substantially throughout the decade of the 1640s.</p>

                  <p>In should be understood that the great migration was not just an exodus to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. Only about 21, 000 to 22, 000 of the some 65, 000 English colonists who participated in the great migration of 1630–1640 sailed to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, the remainder settled in other colonies. In the Chesapeake, the price of tobacco had been falling for over fifteen years. In the period from 1618–1625 tobacco often sold at 36d per pound but by the mid–1630s it was down to 6d per pound. After the settlement of <placeName>Maryland</placeName> in 1634, tobacco production increased and the price declined further to 3d per pound in 1637, where it remained until 1640, when the price fell even lower during the period 1640–1643; see <persName>Jordan</persName>, "<persName>Lord Baltimore</persName> Coinage," 2770–2771. Coin became so scarce in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> that in January 1641/2, the House of Burgesses enacted legislation decreeing that money debts were no longer pleadable or recoverable in court. Thus, even if a debtor had signed a binding agreement requiring that payment to a creditor be made using gold or silver coin, rather than tobacco or another commodity, the creditor would not have any legal recourse if the debtor paid the creditor in commodities rather than specie. The act was renewed in the following year with the qualification that contracts for horses, mares or sheep requiring payment in coin would be actionable. This legislation remained in force until its repeal on October 10, 1649. See Hening, <hi rend="italic">Statutes at Large,</hi> vol. 1, 262 on the Assembly of March 2, 1642/3, Acts 37 and 47 also vol. 1, 267–268, which refer to the now lost legislation of 1641/2 and vol. 1, 417 on the Assembly of December 1, 1656, Act 3, explaining that money debts were once again actionable and defining the precise time period when money contracts had not been actionable.</p>

Thus, <persName>Carlton</persName> requested that <persName>Winthrop</persName> pay a total of £23 in money within the week, so he would have the cash for his voyage (the £23 total includes £12 for corn and £11 for the shortfall in the value of the cattle payment that <persName>Winthrop</persName> had sent).

On October 10, <persName>Winthrop</persName> added a note to the letter, this note was a reminder for his records, stating that he had paid <persName>Carlton</persName> for the outstanding debt and for <persName>Luxford’s</persName> steer, that is, £11 and £20, but he did not pay money for the corn, rather, on the same day he appended the note to his letter to Carlson, <persName>Winthrop</persName> made arrangements to have 80 bushels of Indian corn delivered to the waterfront for Carlson’s family to pick up, thus balancing the account.</p>

In the 1642 legislation the "<placeName>Holland</placeName> ducatour," that is, the <hi rend="italic">ducatoon</hi> of 60 stuivers or three guilders [with an intrinsic value of 66d sterling or 5s6d] was raised to 6s, and the "rix doller," the <hi rend="italic">rijksdaalder</hi> of 50 stuivers or two and one-half guilders [with an intrinsic value of 55d sterling or 4s7d] was made current at the same rate as the eight-reales, namely, 5s.

The <hi rend="italic">ducatoon,</hi> of this period was the <hi rend="italic">ducatone,</hi> first minted in the <placeName>Spanish Netherlands</placeName>, in <placeName>Brabant</placeName> and <placeName>Tournai</placeName>, in 1618, and produced throughout the century. The coin contained 501.23 grains of .944 fine silver and displayed a bust of the ruler on the obverse and the royal heraldic shield on the reverse. Later, from 1659 through 1794 a coin of similar size and value was minted in each of the seven northern United Provinces. The <placeName>Dutch</placeName> coin, known as a <hi rend="italic">Dukaton,</hi> was slightly heavier at 505.86 grains but with slightly less pure silver at .941 fineness. This <hi rend="italic">Dukaton of Zilveren Rijder</hi> was called a "silver rider" in the American colonies. The obverse depicted a soldier in full armor wielding a sword on horseback with the provincial heraldic shield below, while the reverse displayed the crowned arms of the <placeName>United Netherlands</placeName> held up by two crowned lions. The other coin mentioned in the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> legislation, the "rix dollar" or <hi rend="italic">rijksdaalder,</hi> was actually a variety of different coins, each averaging about 448 grains in weight of .885 fine silver. These coins were independently minted by individual cities or provinces in the <placeName>United Netherlands</placeName> and passed at 50 stuivers. Usually the obverse of the coin had a half portrait of the ruler (often with a drawn sword), while the reverse displayed an heraldic shield. Additionally, several German and Scandinavian cities minted similar coins, known as <hi rend="italic">Thalers</hi> in their native areas but called "rix dollars of the Empire" by the English. Starting in the 1650s and continuing throughout 1795, another silver coin was produced, a slightly smaller silver ducat of 436 grains at .873 fine silver valued at 48 stuivers. This coin was also used in the American colonies, where it passed at the same rate as the ‘rix dollar’ and was know as the ‘leg dollar.’ The obverse depicted a standing soldier in full armor with a sword in his right hand. In his left hand the soldier held straps that were attached to the crowned provincial shield displayed in front of him. The shield completely obscured the soldier’s left leg, hence the name "leg dollar." The reverse displayed the crowned arms of the <placeName>United Netherlands</placeName>. See footnote 54 above for a "leg" dollar dated 1655, that was recovered in <placeName>Portland</placeName>, <placeName>Maine</placeName>.</p>

               <p>The problems of counterfeit and lightweight clipped cobs that circulated during this era are well known.<ref target="#CH5-n102">102</ref> For ease of exchange, merchants preferred coins of a reliable fineness that could be traded by tale rather than by weight. The <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay solution was to establish a mint where sterling shillings (Pl. 6, 60), sixpences (Pl. 6, 61), and threepences would be produced at a 22.5% weight reduction from the English standard. This advancement or "crying-up" of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay coinage attracted even more silver into the Commonwealth and insured the economic viability of the mint.</p>
               <p>Once <persName>John Hull’s</persName> mint opened, local merchants would no longer accept heavily clipped or suspicious looking cobs. Individuals were expected to trade these items at the mint for NE silver. An intriguing entry is found in a <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> probate inventory dated October 29, 1652, just two months after the Hull mint first opened for business in <placeName>Boston</placeName>. The entry states that £1 6s 9.5d in money was found in the house of the deceased and that the money "was Changed att <placeName>Boston</placeName> from bad to better with great losse."<ref target="#CH5-n103">103</ref>

               <pb n="238"/>
               <p>This might be our earliest reference to silver being taken to the Hull mint and exchanged for NE coinage. It seems that the silver coinage being brought in was heavily clipped Spanish-American silver, which, by weight, had an intrinsic value far below its face value and thus was exchanged at a loss. <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay silver seems to have been accepted quickly, for it soon appears in probate inventories. In the March 5, 1653/4, inventory of the estate of <persName>Thomas Trusler</persName> of <placeName>Salem</placeName> we find listed "in N. E. silver, 10s.; and Spanish money, [4] pc. of 8, 1li."<ref target="#CH5-n104">104</ref> Some English money also still circulated, side-by-side with <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and Spanish silver, as we see
<pb n="239"/>
from the <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> probate inventory of <persName>Sarah Jenny</persName>, dated 1656, which lists one piece-of-eight, two halfcrowns and seven pence in silver.<ref target="#CH5-n105">105</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The primary rationale for authorizing <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> silver coinage, and, in 1659, the short-lived <persName>Lord Baltimore</persName> silver was to stimulate the local economy. Obviously, the minters expected to make a profit at the ventures, but both the General Court of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay and <placeName>Maryland’s</placeName> Proprietor, Cecil Calvert, <persName>Lord Baltimore</persName>, understood that providing a reliable supply of government authorized coinage would facilitate transactions, so merchants and tradesmen could flourish. However, it must be remembered that even in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, during the height of the minting operation, not everyone had silver coins and many transactions still involved commodity exchanges. This included transactions between merchant and merchant as well as transactions between merchant and tradesman or farmer. Silver coinage, insofar as it was available, was a desirable alternative to barter and was viewed as a benefit to trade, but it was never available in large enough quantities to replace other methods of exchange. Indeed, in contemporary ledgers the majority of the recorded transactions, even in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, included money substitutes.<ref target="#CH5-n106">106</ref> Specie was always in short supply in the colonies, and, in fact, in <placeName>England</placeName> there were complaints throughout the century that there was not enough money in circulation.<ref target="#CH5-n107">107</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The emission of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> silver was part of <persName>Lord Baltimore’s</persName> plan to develop his colony. At the same time that he was minting coins, <persName>Lord Baltimore</persName> was also starting to transform <placeName>St. Mary’s City</placeName> from a manor estate into the first real city and capital of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n108">108</ref>
                  <persName>Baltimore’s</persName> plans failed for a variety of reasons, but it is clear that the colonists closely associated
<pb n="240"/>
a supply of reliable money with the growth of towns and trade. The 1661 <placeName>Maryland</placeName> mint act begins:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For as much as money being the Rule and measure of the vallue of Commodityes noe [no] trade or Comerce can be well managed without itt, And the want of itt in this Province is a mayne [main] hinderance to the Advancement of this Collony in Trades Manafactors Townes and all other thinges which conduce to the flourishing and happy State... .<ref target="#CH5-n109">109</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Also, the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> 1671 act for the advancement of foreign coinage stated that without the conveniences of money "Manufacturers handycrafts or Tradesmen" could not subsist.<ref target="#CH5-n110">110</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Without coinage, purchases were often transacted by offering credit with payment to be made in commodities at a later date, typically at harvest time. However, this system was not a cost effective arrangement for the merchant-creditor. For example, in <placeName>Boston</placeName> on June 15, 1660, <persName>John Hull</persName> accepted eight and seven-eighths bushels of wheat, presumably <persName>Winter wheat</persName>, and on September 5, ten bushels of summer wheat, then on September 17, two beaver skins, all in payment of debts owed to <persName>Hull</persName> by <persName>John Winthrop</persName>. <persName>Hull</persName> explained that good wheat was worth 4s 6d per bushel, but this wheat had weevils in it so he could only get 4s 3d per bushel and he only was able to get that price by giving the purchaser three months time to make the payment. Otherwise the selling price for ready payment would have only been 4s per bushel. <persName>Hull</persName> then went on to say that rather than sell the beaver, which was inferior, he simply kept it and credited <persName>Winthrop’s</persName> account three or four shillings more than he should have.<ref target="#CH5-n111">111</ref> Thus, even after <persName>Winthrop’s</persName>
                  <pb n="241"/>
payments were received, it took additional time and effort for <persName>Hull</persName> to dispose of the commodities and actually balance the account. And this was a straightforward book credit exchange! Typically, many small, or petty, exchanges involved promissory notes passed on from the original receiver to a second party and then on to a third or even a fourth party, with the final determination of who owed how much of a specific commodity to whom, requiring an appearance at the quarterly court.<ref target="#CH5-n112">112</ref> A commodity based credit system was better adapted to a s<persName>Ingle</persName> product plantation economy, like <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, or <placeName>Bermuda</placeName>, where the vast majority of the population lived on farms and exchanged promissory notes between individuals or drew on book credit at the local store during the year with an annual balancing of all accounts after the harvest, with tobacco as the only commodity accepted for payment. Colonials clearly understood the limitations of commodity exchanges and believed specie coinage was necessary to overcome these limitations thus facilitating trade and industry and thereby stimulating the growth of towns.</p>
               <p>Since a goal of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> coinages was to facilitate local trade, the coinages focused on shillings, sixpences, and threepences in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> (Pl. 6, 62–71),<ref target="#CH5-n113">113</ref> with the fourpence or groat replacing the threepence in <placeName>Maryland</placeName> (Pl. 7, 72–74).<ref target="#CH5-n114">114</ref> Neither colony considered
<pb n="242"/>
minting higher denominations such as the crown (5s) or halfcrown (2s 6d), even though the larger coins yielded higher per unit minting profits than smaller denominations. The shilling was an adequate high denomination issue for internal daily transactions involving local shopkeepers and craftsmen.</p>
               <p>For the acquisition of imports, merchants were expected to rely on any foreign silver and gold they could accumulate, primarily Spanish-American cobs, or on sterling credit made available to them internationally as bills of exchange. Indeed, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay passed laws prohibiting the export of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> coinage, but the borders could not be adequately patrolled to enforce these regulations. <placeName>Boston</placeName> merchants with purses filled with <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> silver, but without sufficient Spanish-American cobs or appropriate foreign credit to directly purchase foreign goods, were expected to participate in cargo shipping, relying on international exchange by barter. These merchants acquired quantities of local products at wholesale rates, usually in partnership with a few other local businessmen, and then transported the products to foreign ports where they bartered the cargo for regional items that could be brought back home and sold at a profit. For instance, <placeName>Boston</placeName> merchants would export native salted cod or wood planks to another colony, say Barbados, where these items were traded for quantities of sugar, salt or other <placeName>West Indies</placeName> commodities that could be brought back to <placeName>Boston</placeName> and sold locally for <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay coin. Neither <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> nor Baltimore silver, nor any plan for a mint in seventeenth century colonial British <placeName>America</placeName> attempted to address the problem of international exchange. Thee two colonies focused their resources on trying to, at least partially, address the issue of local exchange.</p>
               <p>During this period, legislation was passed to attract coinage into <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, in order to stimulate manufacture and trade at a time when tobacco prices
<pb n="243"/>
were falling. On November 20, 1645, the House of Burgesses enacted legislation to draw Spanish-American silver to <placeName>Virginia</placeName> by advancing the value of an eight-reales to 6s, thus surpassing the 1642 <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> legislation that had advanced the eight-reales from 4s 4d to 5s. Furthermore, the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> act authorized a mint to be established that would produce copper 2d, 3d, 6d and 9d coins and additionally called for merchants and others to "desist or leave off trading for tob’o [tobacco] vpon the penaltie and forfeiture of the thing so bought or sold."<ref target="#CH5-n115">115</ref> The proposed mint never opened and silver cobs did not pour into the colony, since <placeName>Virginia</placeName> had nothing to sell except tobacco, which continued to remain the standard of local exchange. Without a diverse economy offering a variety of desirable products, <placeName>Virginia</placeName> was unable to entice merchants and consumers to bring silver into their colony.</p>
               <p>In 1655, <placeName>Virginia</placeName> revised its strategy and once again tried to foster a money economy. The House of Burgesses, "ffor the greater incouragement of manufacture and other trade" enacted legislation that "all peeces of eight of what mettle soever shall pass current and lawfull at five shillings."<ref target="#CH5-n116">116</ref> This legislation adopted the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay advancement rate of 5s for the eight-reales, but apparently lowered the fineness or intrinsic value requirement to a level that was below the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> minimum, probably to attract debased Potosi cobs that were unwanted or only acceptable at a discount elsewhere.<ref target="#CH5-n117">117</ref> Whether this was the original intention of the
<pb n="244"/>
legislation is not known. Clearly, it is not how the law was interpreted in practice. It appears that the phrase "all peeces of eight of what mettle soever" was taken to refer to all coins and tokens, therefore the colony attracted a number of worthless copper jetons rather than Spanish-American silver! It is possible that the Burgesses had originally hoped to enforce a local valuation on token coinage, as had been done during the first years of colonization in <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> with jetons and in the <placeName>Somer Islands</placeName> with Hogge Money. However, unlike the earlier period, the government no longer had a supply house where the tokens could be used to purchase merchandise, nor did the colony have the funds to covert the jetons into their designated value in silver. Laborers and craftsmen were stuck with jetons that could not be used to purchase the imported goods they desired to acquire. During the next session of the Burgesses, on March 10, 1655/6, the act was repealed, for they stated, "Wee find by experience, and the artificers [i.e. craftsmen] know it, that nothing can more discourage them, for after they have long laboured for a subsistence... they would have soe many counters in stead of sterling money for the sweat of their browes."<ref target="#CH5-n118">118</ref> It was further stated that eight-reales would continue to be valued at 5s and that wampum would retain its present value.<ref target="#CH5-n119">119</ref> During the legislative session of March 13, 1657/8, the eight-reales was again legislated at 5s and it was decreed that no more than 40s, that is, eight of these coins, could be exported from the colony at a time.<ref target="#CH5-n120">120</ref> However, without products to sell, legislation alone could not attract silver into the economy. As Bruce demonstrated from
<pb n="245"/>
probate inventories, even wealthier <placeName>Virginia</placeName>ns had very little coin until the last quarter of the century, with tobacco remaining the predominant medium of exchange.<ref target="#CH5-n121">121</ref>

The inventory states that there were 9 pieces-of-eight, however at that time a full weight piece-of-eight was 5s, so nine pieces-of-eight would be £2 5s not £1, which is the total value listed in the inventory. There is no indication that the pieces were drastically cut or severely clipped. I checked the original document in the <persName>James Duncan Phillips</persName> Library at the Peabody Essex Museum, <placeName>Salem</placeName>
                     <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, listed under Essex County Quarterly Court Files, vol. 2, leaf 139, to see if an error was made in the printed edition. Indeed, the printed edition is accurate; the original document that was copied and docketed in the files of the Essex County Court lists 9 as the number of pieces-of-eight. Most likely the individual who originally copied out the inventory for the court record mistranscribed the number; if the number was 4 and the two intersecting angle strokes were somewhat curved, it could have been easily misread as a 9. Four eight-reales would equal the £1 value listed in the inventory. Originally, the s<persName>Ingle</persName> sheet document was folded vertically to create a four-page pamphlet. Sometime later, after the item was filed with the court, the long sheet was opened and folded horizontally so that it would fit more easily into a folder. Consequently, on the obverse of the sheet the left column is blank, except for the docketing information and is numbered as page 4, with the text starting on the top of the right hand column numbered as page1. On the reverse of the sheet the inventory continues in the left column, numbered as page 2 and then concludes in the right column, which is labeled as page 3. The money entries are listed in a section called "Armes," which includes weapons, powder, bullets, moulds, 24 pounds in leaden weights, two Bibles and a Psalm book, two chests and the coins. The coin entries are found in the middle of page 3, at a crease in the paper, in an area that conservators have strengthened (and obscured) with Japanese paper. A more accurately formatted transcription of this portion of the inventory than is found in the printed edition follows:</p>

                  <p>In 1662 <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay started producing a twopence denomination (Pl. 6, 68), a coin that had been traditionally known as a halfgroat.</p>

                  <p>The groat or fourpence coin was introduced by <persName>Edward I</persName> in 1279 and remained a standard coin of the realm for centuries. <persName>Edward VI</persName> first introduced the threepence, but the public was so acclimated to the groat that production of threepence coins was suspended. <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> revived the threepence in her third coinage of 1561–1577 and included it in her fourth (1578–1582) and milled (1561–1564) coinage issues as well as her third Irish coinage (1601–1602). But none were produced under <persName>James I</persName>. Both groats and threepence were issued under <persName>Charles I</persName>, although threepence were only produced at provincial mints (between 1638 and 1649), not at the Tower mint. During the Commonwealth, neither the groat nor the threepence was minted, although a halfgroat (2d) was part of the standard Commonwealth issue.

                  <p>In using the phrase "what mettle soever" the Burgesses may have meant "at whatever fineness," (in this sense ‘mettle’ could be a variant spelling of metal or it could mean ‘one’s mettle’ in the sense of character, disposition or temperament, namely, pieces-of-eight ‘of whatever metal’ or ‘of whatever character,’ both interpretations would refer to fineness) implying that coins from the Potosí debasement scandal, revealed in 1648, would be acceptable. After the Potosí scandal was uncovered, the Hapsburg shield variety cobs were retired at the <placeName>Peru</placeName> vian mints, namely at Potosí, Santa Fe de Bogota, and Lima, because too many individuals refused to accept these coins, suspecting they were receiving debased products. However, shield cobs continued to be produced in <placeName>Mexico</placeName> since they did not have a problem with debased coinage. In the Viceroyalty of <placeName>Peru</placeName> a new coin design was issued in 1652. The obverse adopted a design similar to the earlier cob reverse, but employed a distinctive Cross of Jeru<placeName>Salem</placeName> that included perpendicular end bars and included the heraldic symbols of León and Castile in the four quadrants of the cross. The new reverse was based on the design used for the pre-cob coins depicting the Straits of <persName>Gibraltar</persName> with the Pillars of <persName>Hercules</persName>. The two vertical pillars intersected three horizontal lines of text, giving the overall appearance of what is frequently called the "tic-tac-toe" design. It seems that the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> legislature was willing to accept the debased older Potosí cobs displaying the Hapsburg shield.

               <p>As previously mentioned, small change of was not part of the English regal coin emissions of this period. During the reign of <persName>Elizabeth I</persName> and again, after the era of the patent farthings, from the outbreak of Civil War and throughout the English Commonwealth era, it was left to local merchants to improvise with privately produced trade tokens. The situation in the colonies also required the settlers to adopt alternatives to small change silver. Even in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, the General Court did not assign the mint the task of producing small change for the colony. We have seen that coins were only part of the economic mix: they helped facilitate exchange in economies that heavily depended on barter and the use of money substitutes such as beaver, corn and tobacco. The imported jetons, doubles tournois, patent farthings, and other copper, lead, and cut silver coins previously mentioned, were never available in large enough quantities to become a significant and widely used small change medium throughout the English colonies.</p>
               <p>Even while the great migration was underway and some English coin was still entering the economy, there was a need to find solutions to the small change shortage. By the mid–1630s most colonies were engaged to some extent in the beaver trade, exchanging manufactured goods like cloth and tools with the Indians in return for furs. Wampum, also known as peag and wampumpeag (with numerous variants), was an essential element in this trade because Indians wanted wampum as well as manufactured goods.</p>
               <pb n="246"/>
               <p>Wampum consisted of polished beads produced from shells by Indian tribes situated along the coast of southern <placeName>New England</placeName> and Long Island (Pl. 7, 76). The raw material was plentiful and the production cost was low, therefore, wampum was an inexpensive commodity. Also, local colonial merchants typically had little problem selling quantities of wampum to fur traders, who regularly needed to replenish their supply of these beads since they continually offered the beads to the northern and inland Indians in return for furs. As long as the fur trade was profitable, wampum was a readily available, local, low-cost, and fungible commodity with a market value. For these reasons, when no small change coins were available, merchants were willing to accept some wampum in payment for goods from fellow colonists, as a result wampum beads soon became the most prevalent small change substitute.</p>
               <p>During the first years of the decade of the 1630s, <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> Plantation laid claim to the local wampum trade in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. The Pilgrims collected beads both as tribute from and in trade with the wampum-rich Narragansett and Pequot tribes. They then transported the wampum to their Maine trading posts where they offered the beads to the wampum-poor Abenaki and <placeName>Pentagoet</placeName> tribes in trade for beaver skins.<ref target="#CH5-n122">122</ref> Since <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> controlled the wampum trade, the colony of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, established
<pb n="247"/>
in <placeName>Boston</placeName> in 1630, was unable to acquire sufficient wampum to satisfy the needs of its traders and merchants during its initial years.<ref target="#CH5-n123">123</ref> Indeed, it seems at first <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay settlers were trading silver and gold coins to the
<pb n="248"/>
Indians in return for food and other supplies, because the Court of Assistants issued an order prohibiting this practice during its monthly session on March 1, 1630/1.<ref target="#CH5-n124">124</ref> Since the colony had an insufficient wampum supply, on March 4, 1634/5, the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay General Court legislated that musket balls would pass as small change at a farthing each.<ref target="#CH5-n125">125</ref> However, during the early 1630s, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay was quickly expanding, soon far surpassing <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> in population and wealth. As <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> grew, the political situation with the Indians rapidly changed. Due to a number of events, in November of 1634 both the Narragansett and Pequot tribes felt it to be in their best interest to shift their alliance from <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> to the larger colony of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay and sent them tribute.<ref target="#CH5-n126">126</ref> As a
<pb n="249"/>
consequence of this realignment, quantities of wampum were annually sent to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. Because wampum was a valuable commodity in the fur trade both merchants and the pubic preferred it in place of musket balls or farthing tokens. Thus, just as the farthing musket ball legislation was being enacted some wampum began entering <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. Lead balls apparently had a short tenure as a small change substitute since they are not mentioned in any contemporary sources other than comments in and about the legislative record. It seems wampum entered the colony and quickly became the small change option of choice. It was so pervasive by 1637 that the General Court considered it necessary to regulate wampum value. On November 15, 1637, the General Court first decreed that wampum should pass at six beads per penny for any sum under a shilling. The court record simply stated, "It was ordered, that wampampege should passe at 6 a penny for any summe vnder 12<hi rend="sup">d</hi>."<ref target="#CH5-n127">127</ref> The legislation did not assert wampum was to become a small change substitute, rather, the laconic wording of the order implies wampum was already in circulation and that the General Court was simply legislating a standard value and limiting the quantity to be tendered
<pb n="250"/>
per transaction to prevent disagreements when the beads were employed in daily commerce.</p>
               <p>In fact, contemporary sources demonstrate that wampum was being used as small change in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay before the 1637 legislation was passed. From the Essex County probate records we learn that at her death in 1636, Sarah Dillingham of Ipswich had £1 2s2d in coins in her purse along with 4d in wampum. She also had an additional £3 17s 11d in coins stashed in two small boxes and another box with 10s 4d in wampum.<ref target="#CH5-n128">128</ref> In this probate record money clearly refers to coinage, because all commodity monies, such as corn and cattle along with all her other possessions, were individually listed in the inventory and assigned monetary values. This is an unusually detailed description but unfortunately the individuals making the inventory were not numismatists and so did not identify the specific coins or distinguish between blue and white wampum beads. It is likely a portion of this money, if not the majority, was probably English, because the amounts are not easily divisible into Spanish cob coinage. Further, it appears halfpence and patent farthings were not present, since none of the amounts ended with fractions of a penny. Indeed, it is possible the smallest coin was the 2d halfgroat. It is especially interesting to discover in her purse, Mrs. Dillingham was carrying £1 2s 2d in coins and just 4d worth of wampum that she clearly used as small change.</p>
               <p>The 1637 General Court Order regarding wampum value was not the final statement. Beads were assigned a higher value in October 1640 but then revised back down to their earlier level in June 1641, which put them back on par with the value in the Connecticut and New Haven colonies.<ref target="#CH5-n129">129</ref> During the depression of 1640, English silver was depleted and, for the
<pb n="251"/>
short term, commodity monies and wampum became more prominent. In the legislation of June 1641, wampum was to pass current in payment of debts for sums up to £10 (a significant increase from the 1637 limit of 12d); then in October of 1643 the limit was lowered to £2 as Spanish-American silver began entering the colony.<ref target="#CH5-n130">130</ref> As more Spanish-American silver became available, the inconveniences of wampum became less tolerable. Later in the decade, during the General Court session of October 1648, wampum usage was further curtailed by legislation requiring all beads to be merchantable and strung, thus taking poor quality, blemished and chipped beads out of circulation.<ref target="#CH5-n131">131</ref> Seven months later, during the General Court session that opened on May 2, 1649, the legislature ordered that wampum
<pb n="252"/>
could no longer be used to pay taxes but continued to permit wampum to be used in private exchange.<ref target="#CH5-n132">132</ref> It seems that wampum was being devalued at this time, for in the probate estate inventory of <persName>John Woody</persName> of <placeName>Roxbury</placeName> (<placeName>Suffolk County</placeName>), dated June 4, 1650, wampum was rated at seven beads per penny rather than the legislated six beads.<ref target="#CH5-n133">133</ref> A few months later, in
<pb n="253"/>
October 1650, the General Court took the devaluation even further. They continued to allow wampum to be used to pay debts up to £2, but the value of the beads was reduced by 25% from six white or three blue per penny to eight white or four blue beads per penny.<ref target="#CH5-n134">134</ref>
               </p>
               <p>After the <persName>Hull</persName> mint opened in 1652, the public became even less amenable to accepting wampum from merchants as small change than previously, especially if they had paid with silver. In May of 1657, the House of Deputies of the General Court ruled answering a petition from the <persName>Charles</persName>town ferrymen that passengers could not refuse to accept change of a penny or two in wampum, since the lowest denomination coin minted was the threepence.<ref target="#CH5-n135">135</ref> It seems that customers who paid with a <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> threepence wanted coin in return, not wampum. Indeed, it appears that with the exception of ferry rides, wampum was rarely used as small change by the late 1650s. Indeed, in the farming communities of Essex County wampum no longer appears as a small change substitute in probate inventories after 1657.<ref target="#CH5-n136">136</ref> In May of 1661, wampum was demonetized when the legislation of 1643, allowing the continued use of wampum for amounts up to 40s,
<pb n="254"/>
was repealed.<ref target="#CH5-n137">137</ref> In the following year, the General Court of May 1662 authorized the minting of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> twopence. Thus, one could now make a penny purchase by using a threepence and receiving a twopence coin as change.</p>
               <p>Wampum passed out of general use as a small change medium in <placeName>Boston</placeName> during the 1660s but remained viable in outlying areas, such as the furtrading outpost at Springfield. Wampum also continued to be used in <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> as well as in Connecticut, with the last recorded use of wampum as a small change money substitute dating from 1704, when <persName>Sarah Kemble Knight</persName> mentioned its use in <placeName>New Haven</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n138">138</ref>

He goes on to demonstrate that the quantity of coins mentioned in probate inventories increases somewhat during the last decade of the century.

                  <p>In 1627, <persName>Isaac de Rasieres</persName>, the chief trading agent and Secretary to the Director-General of <placeName>New Netherland</placeName>, made an official state visit to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> in response to the establishment of a trading post at Aptucxet, facing the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> controlled Narragansett Bay. This was the first permanent trading post erected by <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>. The goal of De Rasieres was to convince the Pilgrims to agree to tap the Maine shores for furs rather than compete against the <placeName>Dutch</placeName>. Many of the Pilgrims had lived in Leiden for about a decade before departing for <placeName>America</placeName>. Several of them spoke some <placeName>Dutch</placeName> and had friends (including their pastor, <persName>John Robinson</persName>) and relatives who stayed behind in the Netherlands. The <placeName>Dutch</placeName> knew the Pilgrims and treated them with courtesy and friendship but clearly viewed them as competitors. De Rasieres explained how the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> used wampum at Fort Orange (<placeName>Albany</placeName>) when bartering for furs and suggested that the Pilgrims could use wampum in Maine to gain an advantage over other traders in that region. To this end, De Rasieres sold <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> beads worth about £50. It took two years for the Pilgrims to dispense this wampum, because, at first, the northern Indians did not value wampum as highly as the Mohawk and Connecticut valley tribes. However, once wampum was introduced into the Maine fur trade, it quickly became popular. Bradford stated that "it was two years before they could put off this small quantity, til the inland people knew of it; and afterwards they could scarce ever get enough for them [that is, the <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> traders could scarcely ever get enough wampum to satisfy the Maine Indians]."

The Cushnoc trading post on the Kennebec River (established 1628) and the <placeName>Pentagoet</placeName> post (1629) at the mouth of the <placeName>Pentagoet</placeName> River, were the main sources of fur for <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>. In 1632 <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> Plantation shipped 1,348 pounds of beaver to <placeName>England</placeName>, while in 1633 the total rose to 3,366 pounds and then increased to 3,738 pounds in 1634. See <persName>Bradford</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> Plantation,</hi> 288–289 and 261, where he states concerning the 1633 shipment, ".. .much of it coat beaver which yielded 20s per pound and some of it above, and of otter skins 346 sold at a good price." <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>’s success in trading wampum for furs was noted by <persName>John Winthrop</persName> of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, who added to his journal entry for August, 12, 1634, that "Our neighbors of Plim: had great trade allso this year at kenebecke, so as mr. winslowe Carried with him into <placeName>England</placeName> this yeare about 20: hhdes.

                  <p>In <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, coin was supplemented by a variety of commodity monies, of which, corn became far more significant that beaver. As early as October 18, 1631, the Court of Assistants ordered that, "corne shall passe for payement of all debts at the vsuall rate it is solde for, except money or beaver be expressely named;" see Shurtleff, <hi rend="italic">Records of the Governor and Company of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay,</hi> vol. 1, 92. Because beaver was not abundant in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay, pelts were never as common a money substitute in <placeName>Boston</placeName> as they were in Maine, the Connecticut Valley and <placeName>New Netherland</placeName>; but corn remained a viable money substitute in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. During the General Court session of March 4, 1634/5, a tax was repealed that had been instituted on June 5, 1632, assessing a 12d per pound tax for beaver and it was ordered that merchantable beaver would pass in trade at 10s per pound. This is the last regulation passed by the General Court regarding beaver as a money substitute in <placeName>Boston</placeName>. During the later 1630s, beaver continued to be a substantial business for the Pynchon family in Springfield and for <persName>Simon</persName> Willard in the Merrimac Valley, but it was clear beaver would not drive the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay economy. <placeName>Boston</placeName> merchants that accumulated a supply of wampum typically sold it to traders in Springfield or the Merrimac Valley. In the 1640s and later, beaver continued to be used as a medium of exchange at the frontier trading posts, but it was not used in this manner in the rest of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. For the General Court Order of 1634/5, see Shurtleff, <hi rend="italic">Records of the Governor and Company of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay,</hi> vol. 1, 140, items 207 and 210.

The Pynchon trading post in Springfield was established by William Pynchon in 1636 and continued under his son John, after William returned to <placeName>England</placeName> in 1652.

                  <p>The smallpox epidemic that erupted in November of 1633 and ravaged the Indian tribes throughout <placeName>New England</placeName>, shifted the balance of power among the various tribes. In 1634, the Pequots attacked a group of Narragansett Indians that were traveling through Pequot territory on their way to the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> House of Hope trading post. In retaliation, <persName>Jacob Elekens</persName>, the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> trader at the House of Hope, seized <persName>Tatobem</persName>, the <persName>Pequot sachem</persName>. After the <persName>sachem’s</persName> ransom of 140 fathoms of wampum had been paid, <persName>Elekens</persName> murdered <persName>Tatobem</persName>. In retaliation for <persName>Eleken’s</persName> duplicity the Pequot’s burned the post. The <placeName>Dutch</placeName> then replaced <persName>Elekens</persName> with <persName>Pieter Barentsen</persName>, who made peace with the Indians, but was not able to regain their trust. The situation in the Connecticut Valley further deteriorated due to various intratribal Pequot rivalries following the murder of their sachem. Additionally, the Narragansett Indians were troubled by the alliance <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> Colony had made with their enemy, sachem Massasoit of the Pokanoket tribe. At this point, both of the powerful and wampum-rich warring nations, the <placeName>Narragansetts</placeName> and <placeName>Pequots</placeName>, independently schemed to become the dominant tribe in the area by making an alliance with <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay. Both tribes sent delegations to <placeName>Boston</placeName> within days of each other, at the end of October 1634, at which time <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay brokered a temporary peace between the two nations and began to receive wampum tribute from them. See <persName>Winthrop’s</persName> entry of Nov. 6, 1634, <persName>Winthrop</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Journal of <persName>John Winthrop</persName>,</hi> ed. <persName>Dunn</persName>, <persName>Savage</persName> and <persName>Yeandle</persName>, 133–135 and <persName>Winthrop</persName>, <hi rend="italic">

However, the truce did not last and each tribe continued to attempt to dominate the other. By 1636, the situation had deteriorated into the Pequot Wars in which <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay and the other Puritan colonies allied with the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes against the Pequots. For an excellent analysis of this war and a description of the preliminary events leading up to the conflict with a significant discussion on the role of wampum, see Cave, <hi rend="italic">The Pequot War,</hi> with his description of the events of October and November, 1634 on 69–71.

                  <p>In October of 1640, white beads were legislated at a farthing value and black or blue beads at a halfpenny (that is, four white or two blue or black beads per penny) with a limit of 12d per transaction unless the receiver was willing to accept additional quantities. See <persName>Shurtleff</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Records of the Governor and Company of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay,</hi> vol. 1, 302. Also, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> vol. 1, 329, for the legislation of June 2, 1641, stating "It is ordered, that wampampege shall passe currant at 6 a penny for any summe under 10<hi rend="sup">h</hi> [li for pounds], for debts hereafter to bee made." It is interesting to note that the 1641 legislation simply mentioned beads were six per penny, as had been stated in 1637. There was no specific distinction made between white and black or blue beads. It has been suggested that the 1637 and 1641 statements did not refer to all color beads but only to white beads at six per penny, implying black or blue beads would be three per penny, which was the rate at that time in the colonies of Connecticut and <placeName>New Haven</placeName>. See <persName>Donald Taxay</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Money of the American Indians and Other Primitive Currencies of the <placeName>America</placeName>s</hi> (<placeName>New York</placeName>, 1970), 134. I suspect this is the case, but it seems there may have been a reason to only mention the lower valued beads. It is interesting to note that a <placeName>New Haven</placeName> statute explains some colonists preferred the white beads and were reluctant to accept the higher rated black beads. An order issued by the <placeName>New Haven</placeName> General Court in December 1645 stated that white beads would by six per penny and black beads three per penny but went on to explain: "And some men being at present loath to receive the blacke, it is ordered that any payment vnder 20s, halfe white &amp; halfe blacke shall be accounted currant pay..." [followed by a provision requiring the wampum to be merchantable stating that the only exception to the above order would be ".. .if any question arise about the goodness of the wampum, whether white or blacke, Mr. Goodyeare, if the parties repaire vnto him, is intreated to judge therin."]. See <persName>Charles</persName> J. Hoadly, ed., <hi rend="italic">Records of the Colony and Plantation of <placeName>New Haven</placeName>, from 1638 to 1649</hi> (<persName>Hartford</persName>, 1857), 211.

This reluctance to accept black beads may be a reason <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay legislation of 1637 and 1641 focused only on white bead value.</p>

Circulating wampum was required to be unblemished and whole and as a temporary experiment it was to be strung in one of the following eight values: white beads were to be in lengths of a penny, 3d, 12d or 5s; while black beads were to be strung in lengths of 2d, 6d, 2s 6d or 10s. The order read "It is ordered, for triall until the next Court, that all passable or payable peage henceforth shalbe intire, without breaches, both the white &amp; the black, without deforminge spotts, sutably strunge in eyght knowne parcels; the peny, 3d, 12d, 5s, in white; the 2d, 6d, 2s 6d, &amp; ten shillings, in blacke."

Also, we discover from <placeName>New Haven</placeName> legislation of 1648 that the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay law of October 1648, was, in part, based on an agreement made by the Commissioners of the United Colonies at their meeting in <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> in September 1648. On October 9, 1648, at a meeting of the <placeName>New Haven</placeName> General Court it was recorded, "The Governor acquainted the court that the Commissioners have ordered to command it to ye severall generall courts that wampum should not be forced vpon any man for payment which is not in some measure suitably stringed, &amp; if any stone wampum be presented, it be broken" [that is, the stone wampum was to be destroyed and discarded].

               <p>The history of coinage during the period from 1660 until Queen <persName>Anne’s</persName> Proclamation of 1704, along with the numerous attempts during that time to advance Spanish silver, is a lengthy episode that is well beyond the scope of this paper. Suffice it to say that by the close of the century some Spanish-American silver was circulating in all the English colonies, even in the tobacco colonies of <placeName>Bermuda</placeName>, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName>Maryland</placeName> with an influx of lion

dollars during the last quarter of the century in the <placeName>Middle Atlantic</placeName> region.<ref target="#CH5-n139">139</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As the coastal beaver supply was depleted and the fur trade moved further inland, the economic incentive to use wampum as a small change substitute declined dramatically. During the last quarter of the seventeenth century, wampum use was marginalized along the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> seaboard. By 1700 it was rarely used. Just as <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Bay had demonetized wampum in 1661 and replaced it with the twopence in 1662, populated areas all along the coast were now looking for small change coins to use with whatever silver might be available. Additionally, in newer settlements as well as in less populated rural areas where silver was rarely encountered and commodity exchange was the norm, there was a desire to acquire inexpensive coppers to facilitate exchange, thereby attracting craftsmen and merchants to boost the local economy. Thus, both larger, more populated areas, as well as newer and rural coastal settlements wanted small change.</p>
               <p>We find a variety of coppers entering the <placeName>Middle Atlantic</placeName> and Chesapeake regions during this era. A few copper <persName>Lord Baltimore</persName> pennies, called <hi rend="italic">denaria</hi> (Pl. 7, 75), have been recovered in the vicinity of <placeName>St. Mary’s City</placeName>, <placeName>Maryland</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n140">140</ref> Although production of this denomination was very
<pb n="256"/>
limited, the coppers did assist, to some degree, in addressing the small change shortage at <placeName>St. Mary’s City</placeName> during a period of growth in the 1660s. Also, the unpublished recoveries of patent farthings at <placeName>St. Mary’s City</placeName>,
<pb n="257"/>
mentioned earlier, may be from this period as well as the <persName>Charles I</persName> "rose" farthing recovered from the Clark and Lake trading post on Arrowsic Island, Maine, and the <persName>Charles I</persName> patent farthing found by <persName>Hardy Phippen</persName> during the mid-nineteenth century in <placeName>Salem</placeName>, Massachusetts.<ref target="#CH5-n141">141</ref> Furthermore, it is likely the two hoards of patent farthings discussed above, which were deposited in the ground no earlier than the mid–1660s at Yorktown first arrived in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> during this era.<ref target="#CH5-n142">142</ref> At a previous Coinage of the <placeName>America</placeName>s Conference, <persName>John Kleeberg</persName> discussed the <placeName>New York</placeName>e in <placeName>America</placeName> Token of ca. 1670 (Pl. 7, 77) in relation to the need for small change.<ref target="#CH5-n143">143</ref> He also discussed the use of some Commonwealth era English merchant tokens in <placeName>America</placeName> at that time.<ref target="#CH5-n144">144</ref> Merchant tokens (Pl. 7, 78) have been found in locations as diverse as the Hamptons on Long Island,<ref target="#CH5-n145">145</ref>

They were used to replace wampum as small change in more populated areas, while in newly settled and rural coastal areas they were used to stimulate local trade and assist in developing a money based economy.</p>

               <p>During this era, the colonial economies were growing, more settlers were arriving and new cities were being established. In the <placeName>Middle Atlantic</placeName> region, <placeName>New York</placeName> had been acquired from the <placeName>Dutch</placeName>, the first <persName>Quaker settlers</persName> arrived at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> was established and the first significant town was being built in <placeName>Maryland</placeName> at <placeName>Annapolis</placeName>, which soon became the capital of the province. Throughout this period and over the next century, there were continual ch<persName>Allen</persName>ges to increasing the money supply. The ingenuity of the colonists in adapting to these ch<persName>Allen</persName>ges and the diversity of their evolving responses is what makes colonial numismatics such a fascinating, complex, and rewarding field of study.</p>

                  <p>The coin is called a <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi> (neuter), not a <hi rend="italic">denarius</hi> (masculine), hence the nominative plural is <hi rend="italic">denaria</hi> not <hi rend="italic">denarii</hi>. Since there is little information available regarding specimens of the Baltimore <hi rend="italic">denarium,</hi> I am providing a passage from my forthcoming work on <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> coinage (but without the accompanying footnotes that cite my sources) summarizing the current census: "[1] There is only one known example of the Baltimore <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi> that has been handed down over time, all the others are ground recoveries. This coin, often graded as extremely fine or uncirculated, displays sharp die impressions. Its provenance can be traced back to early nineteenth century <placeName>London</placeName>. <persName>James</persName> Bindley acquired the specimen at a <placeName>London</placeName> auction for £12 1s; all that was known of its previous lineage is that the item had been consigned to the auction by a Mr. <persName>Hodsol</persName>. <persName>Rogers Ruding</persName> stated that he examined the coin while it was in the Bindley collection, describing the <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi> in 1817 in the first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Coinage of Britain,</hi> vol. 2, 309, and plating a drawing of the copper in "Supplement Part II," plate VII, item 12, in vol. 4 of the <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> published in 1819. The coin passed through several English collections until the dealer Frederick <persName>Lincoln</persName> obtained it at an auction for the American collector <persName>Joseph J. Mickley</persName> of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in 1859. <persName>Charles I</persName>. Bushnell acquired the specimen for $370 in W Elliot Woodward’s auction of the Mickley collection on October 28, 1867. Since then the coin has been in various American collections, most recently auctioned by Stack’s on May 11, 2004, in the second part of the auction of the <persName>John J. Ford</persName> Jr., Collection. [2] A second <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi> surfaced in the early twentieth century. This is a corroded ground recovery acquired by <persName>Robert C. H. Brock</persName> that was donated to the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> Mint Collection, listed in the 1912 edition of the printed catalog of their holdings. In 1923, that coin, along with the rest of the mint collection was transferred to the Smithsonian, where it now resides in the national numismatic collection as item 1988.0063.0024. [3] A third holed specimen was identified by Malcolm Storer in a group of coins donated by Dr. <persName>S. A. Green</persName> to the <placeName>Boston</placeName> Museum of Fine Arts in February of 1917. Since that time other specimens have been recovered from the ground. [4] A corroded <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi>, clearly a ground recovery specimen, was donated to the Smithsonian by the numismatic dealer Thomas Warfield in 1965 as having been "found in <placeName>Maryland</placeName> in recent years;" it is catalogued as item 263992.0001. [5] Another example, found in 1977 by a college student using a metal detector, was offered in the Bowers and Ruddy auction of February 9, 1978. Subsequently, that <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi> passed to <persName>John Roper</persName> and was described and plated in the Stack’s 1980 auction of the <persName>Roper</persName> collection. [6–8] Additionally, three more <hi rend="italic">denaria</hi> have been uncovered at <placeName>St. Mary’s City</placeName>, <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, where one was discovered in a garden several decades ago and then donated to the St. Mary’s Historical Society; two others have been uncovered more recently in the archeological excavations of seventeenth century Historic <placeName>St. Mary’s City</placeName>. All of these specimens were produced from the same set of dies. [9] On July 12, 2007, Stacks reported in their eNews announcements that another <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi> was unearthed in the spring of 2007 by "A pair of metal detectorists working in the historic riverside community of Middlesex County, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>—near where the Rappahannock River meets the Chesapeake Bay." This area is across the Potomac and about fifty miles down the coast from <placeName>St. Mary’s County</placeName>, <placeName>Maryland</placeName>. The coin was auctioned on August 5, 2007, at Stack’s Milwaukee sale, <hi rend="italic">The <persName>J.A. Sherman</persName> Collection,</hi> lot 213, pages 78–79 in the auction catalogue, where it realized $41, 400. This listing is not exhaustive for Mike Hodder in the Stack’s <persName>Ford</persName> Catalogue, part II, lot 274, mentions another example, unknown to me that is only listed as [10] in "a private collection." There are also rumors that a few additional specimens have been uncovered but the discovery remains unannounced and the finds are being kept off the market for the present. I suspect further specimens may be uncovered in archaeological digs and by metal detectorists along the Potomac side of <placeName>Maryland</placeName> and possibly in nearby areas of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. I inspected the item that was cataloged as an original <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi> in the <placeName>Maryland</placeName> Historical Society (gift of Frederick A, Dolfoeld, 1945.81) and found it is not an original but rather a worn Idler token with the advertisement inscription removed. The <hi rend="italic">denaria</hi> ground recoveries from <placeName>Maryland</placeName> and especially the specimens found during the controlled archeological dig of seventeenth century sites in <placeName>St. Mary’s City</placeName>, verify the <hi rend="italic">denarium</hi> is an original colonial coin dating from the time of <persName>Lord Baltimore</persName> rather than a later fabrication and that this coin did circulate in <placeName>America</placeName>."</p>

Kleeberg</persName> (<placeName>New York</placeName>, 1992), 15–38. <persName>Kleeberg</persName> suggests that the farthing-sized <placeName>New York</placeName>e in <placeName>America</placeName> token was produced in <placeName>England</placeName> as a trade token for <persName>Francis Lovelace</persName> while he was governor of <placeName>New York</placeName> (1668–1673). Most probably the surviving examples were patterns, for they were produced in two metals, brass and pewter, in very limited quantities. Although <persName>Kleeberg</persName> does not specifically state that the token was intended for use in <placeName>America</placeName>, he does discuss the lack of small change in <placeName>New York</placeName> at that time. But one could infer that the <placeName>New York</placeName>e token was produced in <placeName>England</placeName> at the expense of Governor Lovelace to be a small change coin for the colony of <placeName>New York</placeName> but that it was never minted as a regular issue. <persName>Kleeberg</persName> suggests that the token was probably planned and produced soon before 1672, but was never put into general production, because all trade tokens were demonetized in that year in favor of a standard regal copper coinage. Furthermore, <persName>Kleeberg</persName> stated that if the token was intended for use in <placeName>America</placeName> another reason to stop the project was that on August 9, 1673, the <placeName>Dutch</placeName> recaptured <placeName>New York</placeName>, ending Lovelace’s tenure as governor and thus bringing an unforeseen but immediate halt to all of his projects. <placeName>New York</placeName> was subsequently returned to the English in the Treaty of Westminster, signed on February 9, 1674.</p>

The precise archaeological context of the recovery is not reported but it appears to be in a context of the 1670s since <persName>Wing</persName> mentions the farthing as an example of a foreign import, presumably related to the period of the voyage of the tobacco ship <hi rend="italic">Constant Friendship</hi>, which docked at Greenbury Point in early January 1672 and remained there until the spring.

                  <p>The tokens were officially demonetized by a royal decree of August 16, 1672, which stated they were not to be used after the first of September. Additional legislation was passed on February 20, 1673/4, and a proclamation was issued on December 5, 1674, reiterating the ban.

            <p>Depending upon one’s point of view, <persName>Mark Newby</persName> is either the beginning or end of the story of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage in the North American colonies.<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> Either way, <persName>Newby</persName> remains as the last documented participant in the journey of the enigmatic <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage to the New World. And like the coinage itself, his story, as we know it, is a blend of fact, fiction, and plain old homespun lore.</p>
            <p>Most American Colonial numismatists tend to abbreviate their thinking about <persName>Newby</persName> as the <placeName>London</placeName> tallow chandler who moved to <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, and ultimately to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> to escape religious persecution and start a life of Quaker simplicity in the New World. Along the way, he, perhaps with others, managed to acquire over 14, 000 <persName>St. Patrick</persName> halfpence that the small group of Quakers would use in their new settlement. Unfortunately, shortly after their authorization, <persName>Newby</persName> died and the coins were redeemed by his widow never to be heard of again.</p>
            <p>Our research indicates that he indeed traveled from <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> in part to escape religious persecution and that he did likely bring with him <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage for use in local commerce in the new Quaker settlement, but the remainder of the story appears to be largely apocryphal.</p>

               <p>The story of <persName>Mark Newby</persName> begins on February 25, 1638 in the <placeName>Hamlet</placeName> of <placeName>Earsdon</placeName>, in <placeName>Northumberland</placeName>, <placeName>England</placeName> where <persName>Ralph</persName> and <persName>Dorothy</persName>
                  <persName>Newby</persName> gave birth to their first son Mark.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> The family ultimately moved to the County of <placeName>
                     <placeName>Durham</placeName>
                  </placeName> where <persName>Ralph</persName> and <persName>Dorothy</persName> had another son and daughter. In Gladfelter’s seminal article on <persName>Newby</persName>, he observes that <persName>George Fox</persName>, the founder of the Quaker movement, had begun proselytizing and "calling men to the eternal inward realities and to lives of unswerving devotion to the light" around 1654 in both <placeName>Northumberland</placeName> and <placeName>Durham</placeName>. Later that year, Friends meetings were established
<pb n="291"/>
in both Counties.<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref>
                  <persName>Gladfelter</persName> speculates that it was around this time that <persName>Newby</persName>, about 16, was first exposed to and possibly converted to Quakerism.</p>
               <p>The trail of <persName>Mark Newby</persName> picks up again around a decade later in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. On May 26, 1663 he married the landed widow <persName>Elizabeth Welsh</persName> (two years his senior) in the County <persName>Kilkenny</persName> near the village of <placeName>Gowering</placeName>.<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref>
                  <persName>Elizabeth</persName> soon gave birth to two children in quick succession: <persName>Mary</persName> born in <persName>Kilkenny</persName> in February 1664 and <persName>Joseph</persName> in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> in January 1665. Records suggest that the couple moved to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> in 1665 and remained there for over a decade. It was in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> that <persName>
                     <persName>Newby</persName>
                  </persName> set up a shop as a merchant, a trade far more compatible with the actions and achievements he undertook for the balance of his life.</p>
               <p>The deaths of <persName>Mary</persName> and <persName>Joseph</persName> along with those of three other children and their mother Elizabeth must have been tragic for <persName>
                     <persName>Newby</persName>
                  </persName> and may have influenced his ultimate decision to move to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>. He buried Elizabeth on June 22, 1672 in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>.<ref target="#CH6-n5">5</ref> Another event that occurred just eight months before <persName>Elizabeth’s</persName> death certainly added to his personal tragedy and no doubt started him on the path of emigration to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>. <persName>Albert Cook Meyers</persName> follows William Stockdale (a contemporary of <persName>Newby</persName>) when he reports:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In 1671, <persName>Mark Newby</persName> of <placeName>Thomas Street</placeName>, <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, "because for Conscience sake he could not be an observer of Holidays (so-called) he opened his shop on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> month called Christmas day." For this "he had his house assaulted by a rude multitude," who with great violence threw dirt and stones into "his Shop, endangering his life and his families; spoyled (sic.) Shop-goods, broke Glass-windows and Pewter vessels, abused their neighbors for reproving them; the said <persName>Mark</persName> damnified."<ref target="#CH6-n6">6</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Despite this experience and the passing of his children and wife, <persName>
                     <persName>Newby</persName>
                  </persName> remained in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>. On March 24, 1674, he married <persName>Hannah Holmes</persName>. On February 14, 1675 they had their first child <persName>Rachel</persName>. While it is not known
<pb n="292"/>
whether <persName>
                     <persName>Newby</persName>
                  </persName> and his new family continued to face religious persecution, it is clear that thousands of other Quakers throughout <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Ireland</placeName> did. It is perhaps for this reason that shortly after his marriage to <persName>Hannah</persName> he moved his family to County <persName>Wicklow</persName> where a Society of Friends was emerging. <persName>
                     <persName>Newby</persName>
                  </persName> went on to have three more children, <persName>Stephen</persName>, <persName>Edward</persName>, and <persName>Elizabeth</persName>, before he immigrated to the New World.<ref target="#CH6-n7">7</ref> Between March 1675 and August 1681, <persName>
                     <persName>Newby</persName>
                  </persName> met <persName>William Bates</persName> in the Ballicane Meeting of Friends. Bates, another devout Quaker, had suffered fines and imprisonment for pursuing his religious beliefs.<ref target="#CH6-n8">8</ref> His harsh experiences led him to join a group of leading local Quakers who were pursuing the establishment of a new settlement in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>. It was probably through Bates that <persName>
                     <persName>Newby</persName>
                  </persName> was persuaded to join or, more likely, negotiated his way into the expedition.</p>

                  <p>Earlier authors have variously spelled the surname as "<persName>Newbie</persName>" and "<persName>Newby</persName>." The original copy of the removal certificate (letter of introduction) for <persName>Mark Newby</persName> and one of his co-adventurers William Bates to the Friends in the New World uses the spelling "Newby" and thus is assumed to be correct.

               <p>As <persName>Gladfelter</persName> first pieced together, there is a continuous stream of documentation that places <persName>Newby</persName> in or near <placeName>Dublin</placeName> in the trade of a merchant from 1663 to 1681. The notion of <persName>Newby</persName> being a <placeName>London</placeName> tallow chandler or candle-maker appears to start with <persName>John Clement’s</persName> book, <hi rend="italic">The First Emigrant Settlers in <placeName>Newton Township</placeName>,</hi> which devotes a full chapter to <persName>Mark Newby</persName>.<ref target="#CH6-n9">9</ref>
                  <persName>Gladfelter</persName> speculated that this error had its origins in Clement somehow confusing the word "Barbican" for "Ballicane" in <persName>Newby</persName> removal certificate issued by the Ballicane (<placeName>Ireland</placeName>) Friends, a document that would serve as a letter of introduction to the Friends in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>. Clement evidently assumed the Friends’ Meeting that was located on Barbican Street in <placeName>London</placeName>, although it is not clear how the leap to tallow chandler was made.<ref target="#CH6-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Whether this was the source of confusion or not, and with all due respect to the vocation of candle-making, it appears that the resources as well as the business and political acumen employed by <persName>Newby</persName> in planning and financing the voyage to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> were beyond what one might have expected a candle-maker or even successful merchant to have had.<ref target="#CH6-n11">11</ref>

               <p>It appears that <persName>Newby's</persName> decision to emigrate with his family from County Wicklow to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> was motivated in part by the desire to pursue religious freedom and to avoid the persecution he had faced in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> and that the Society of Friends continued to face locally. Considering the shared experiences of <persName>Bates</persName> and <persName>Newby</persName> it is not surprising that they decided to partner together in the voyage. Still, in addition to religious freedom, settlers like <persName>Newby</persName> also hoped to reap a profit from their enterprise.<ref target="#CH6-n12">12</ref> In <hi rend="italic">The History of <placeName>Salem</placeName> County <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>,</hi>
                  <persName>R. G. Johnson</persName>, the first historian from <persName>Fenwick’s</persName> Colony observed that,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[t]hey were every one of them speculators in these western lands and... their sole object was to accumulate fortunes, although they were all men of high character and distinction...it must be apparent to every observer that self interest was at the bottom of all their schemes and maneuvers.<ref target="#CH6-n13">13</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Reed</persName> and <persName>Miller</persName> further suggest that spiritual and material prosperity went hand in hand, for if the individual Quakers did not prosper, nor could their Society of Friends.<ref target="#CH6-n14">14</ref> Certainly, <persName>Newby</persName> was no exception to this rule. In fact as we assess the actions of <persName>Newby</persName> leading up to his departure and his activities upon his arrival, it appears that the <persName>Newby</persName>s may have been one of the principal beneficiaries of the new settlement.</p>
               <p>Given that <persName>Newby</persName> was a merchant in <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, he undoubtedly experienced the shortages of small change that periodically occurred in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> during his residence there.<ref target="#CH6-n15">15</ref> He would have been keenly aware of the difficulty of conducting day-to-day commerce without a supply of hard money. He also would have understood the value of good money versus bad, what traded freely and what traded at a discount, and finally what might be required to help effect exchange in a new settlement. Thus it is not surprising that among the voyagers on <hi rend="italic">Ye Owner’s Adventure,</hi>
                  <persName>Newby</persName>
                  <pb n="294"/>
was the one to anticipate the need for coinage in the New World.<ref target="#CH6-n16">16</ref> He was also best positioned to be aware of a hoard of copper <persName>St. Patrick</persName> tokens in hiding from the era of <persName>Charles I</persName> and to be sensitive to the opportunity to acquire these same coppers at a discount after their demonetization on the Isle of Man assuming that either of these were sources for <persName>Newby</persName> halfpence. Whatever the circumstances were that brought the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers into <persName>Newby</persName> hands, they must have been acquired at a favorable enough price that he could afford to purchase them and still be able to pay for his land in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> and the cost of passage for himself and his family. It is probable that well before departing—most likely before purchasing the coppers—he had also secured acceptance of this new "coin of the realm" from his fellow voyagers. While some have speculated that he acted in concert with others in bringing these <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins to the New World, the following discussion shows that this is highly unlikely as he and his estate alone ultimately stood as guarantors for the new <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> coinage.</p>

               <p>From 1674 to 1683, <persName>Newby</persName> and his fellow Quakers in <placeName>Dublin</placeName> were slowly realizing that their only hope for religious f<persName>Reed</persName>om and economic prosperity lay in the colonies of <placeName>North America</placeName>. At the same time, Lords <persName>Berkeley</persName> and <persName>Carteret</persName> along with several other influential <persName>Quakers</persName>, including <persName>John Fenwick</persName>, <persName>William Penn</persName>, <persName>Gawen Lawrie</persName> and <persName>Nicholas Lucas</persName>, were sorting through a complex set of deeds, patents, and rights of proprietorship in order to create a land stock company to represent the approximately 4,600 square miles of property in <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> Land Stock Company was capitalized with 100 shares of stock. Those shares were then divided into tenths. One tenth went to Fenwick for his role in its formation and the remaining 90 shares or nine tenths were offered for sale at £350 per share. Over time, Quakers purchased virtually all of the shares. Of the entire group of purchasers, 100 were English, 17 were Irish, and 3 were Scots. Six of the Irish Proprietors settled in <persName>Newton Creek</persName>, the Third or "Irish" Tenth (Fig. 1).<ref target="#CH6-n17">17</ref> According to

               <p>Although <persName>Newby</persName> seems to have been one of the more enterprising and ambitious of the new voyagers to <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>, it appears that he was also among the last to join the venture and perhaps was only included or induced by his association with <persName>William Bates</persName>.

               <p>At the same time, we see <persName>Newby</persName> deeply involving himself in the government, basic finance, and commerce of <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>. <persName>Newby</persName> was elected to the Second Session of the General Free Assembly of <placeName>West Jersey</placeName>, which met on May 2–6, 1682. It is probable that he had worked hard and carefully behind the scenes from as early as the days of voyage formation back in County <persName>Wicklow</persName> in order to see the following legislation pass during that same session:</p>

               </p>
               <p>At this meeting of the Assembly, <persName>Newby</persName> was also made Commissioner for Dividing and Regulating Lands for the Third Tenth interest in the Land Stock Company, which included <placeName>Newton Township</placeName>. The Commissioners

were endowed with broad powers including marking the bounds of each Tenth, overseeing the purchase and sale of property, surveying such property, insuring the proper allocation of better located portions of the property, and guarding against land manipulation or concentration.<ref target="#CH6-n22">22</ref> This commission again reflected <persName>Newby</persName> respect, influence and inclusion in the center of commerce for the new settlement.</p>

               <p>It is generally believed that the number of <persName>Newby</persName> halfpence put into circulation by this Act was at least 14,400. This is the amount that Stewart reckoned was redeemed by <persName>Newby</persName> estate approximately two years latter. However, as we will see, this redemption never really occurred. Moreover, there is no evidence that the 300 acres of land <persName>Newby</persName> used to satisfy certain debt obligations owed by his estate were even related to the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage.</p>
               <p>The <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> Assembly Act authorizing the coinage only required <persName>Newby</persName> to provide the Assembly with collateral "from tyme to tyme." We could find no evidence that any collateral was ever issued. Moreover, <hi rend="italic">The <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> Deeds</hi> Vol. B: 126 (Fig. 3) is the primary source for the £30 debt owed by <persName>Mark <persName>Newby</persName>’s</persName> estate upon his death and its payment by <persName>Hannah Newby</persName> on behalf <persName>Edward Newby</persName> as a primary beneficiary with 300 acres of land out of a 350 acre parcel originally owned by <persName>Mark</persName>. The remaining 50 acres were to be distributed by <persName>Hannah</persName> to <persName>Edward</persName> on his twenty-first birthday. The debt is described as being due by virtue of an account owed

by <persName>Newby</persName> to the Province. There is no mention of coinage redemption nor is there any indication as to why the debt was due to the Province in the first instance.</p>
               <p>Had the coinage been redeemed by <persName>Newby's</persName> estate, it would have been included and inventoried in his estate along with all property other than real property. <persName>Newby's</persName> estate inventory reflects no such coinage. So where do the apocryphal £30 (= 14, 400 halfpence) come from? There is no way to
<pb n="301"/>
be absolutely certain, but it appears that based on <persName>Clement’s</persName> first discussion of the financial affairs and settlements of <persName>Mark Newby’s</persName> widow in 1877, Frank Stewart made an unwarranted inductive leap in his monograph on <persName>Newby</persName>. <persName>Clement</persName> reports that "when a settlement was made between the administratrix and the Commission, a deficiency of thirty pounds was discovered in the banking operations [of <persName>Newby</persName>]."<ref target="#CH6-n23">23</ref> He goes on to say that this was made good by his personal estate and that the previously collateralized land was released as part of the settlement to go into trust for his second son Edward <persName>Newby</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(sic).</hi> As noted above, the source documents for the debt settlement paint a slightly different picture.</p>
               <p>The use of land to pay a preexisting debt to the Province is very different than the redemption of coinage. Given <persName>Newby</persName> active roll in the financial and administrative affairs of the <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> Assembly, his position as Commissioner of Dividing and Regulating Lands for the Third Tenth and his own apparent coinage and real estate dealings, it is not difficult to imagine that some reconciliation of accounts would have been required upon his sudden death.<ref target="#CH6-n24">24</ref> This seems far more plausible than the notion of a unilateral redemption of a desperately needed coinage that had just entered circulation.<ref target="#CH6-n25">25</ref> We must also remember, that the Act of May 2–6, 1682 demanded that <persName>Newby</persName> or his heirs would redeem the coinage on demand, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> that they must redeem them upon his death. In the authors’s view, the £30 (14,400 halfpence) redemption is destined to follow the same fate as that of the tallow chandler.</p>

area into the early nineteenth century.<ref target="#CH6-n27">27</ref> We do not know Breen’s source for this later <persName>Maris</persName> reference, but we do know that <persName>Maris</persName> was aware that these enigmatic coppers were produced in two sizes, for he describes both small and large sizes (Figs. 4<hi rend="italic">–</hi>5).<ref target="#CH6-n28">28</ref> According to the records of <persName>Philip L. Mossman</persName>, who has been tracking North American finds of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coinage for several years, a total of nine of the small size ("farthing") coppers and one off-metal silver "shilling" have been found in <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts,</placeName>
                  <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, and <placeName>North Carolina</placeName> (Fig. 6).<ref target="#CH6-n29">29</ref>
                  <persName>Mossman</persName> has no record of any of the large size coppers ("halfpence") ever being found in <placeName>North America</placeName>.</p>
               <p>On May 3, 1681, the Commissioners of <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> gave the <placeName>Burlington</placeName> Court jurisdiction over the regulation of the rates at which English coin should pass. It was decided that the "King’s copper farthing" should pass as a halfpenny and the halfpenny as one penny (<persName>Reed</persName> and <persName>Miller</persName> 1989: 245).<ref target="#CH6-n30">30</ref> These cried up rates were rescinded by the Act of May 1682 which monetized <persName>Mark <persName>Newby</persName>’s</persName> halfpence. However, we do not know weather it was the rates or the coinage itself that were rejected in favor of <persName>Newby</persName> coins. Perhaps the small module <persName>St. Patrick</persName> "farthings," which are roughly the size of a regal farthing, were also considered halfpence in the Province in accordance with the legislation of 1681. The "farthings" may have been what <persName>Newby</persName> had authorized as halfpence.</p>
               <p>We may never know for certain whether <persName>Newby</persName> halfpence were the small or large size <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coins. As a token coinage whose intrinsic value was probably outstripped by its face value, it is also possible that both small and large module pieces circulated indescriminately as halfpence. Perhaps anything "round and brown" would have passed muster as halfpence in a cash-starved economy like that of <placeName>West Jersey</placeName> in the late 1600s.</p>

            <p>The American Numismatic Society’s collection of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> token coinage owes its interest and richness to a number of important acquisitions and to individual efforts and contributions by some distinguished numismatists of a bygone age, among them <persName>Harry Prescott Clark Beach</persName>, <persName>Frederick Alexander Canfield</persName>, <persName>Henry Chapman</persName> and, more recently, <persName>Henry Grunthal</persName>. The <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series have enjoyed renewed interest and much progress in research during the past several years thanks to the efforts of the participants in this Coinage of the American Conference and others, among them the late <persName>John Griffee</persName>, <persName>Jim LaSarre</persName>, <persName>Roger Moore</persName>, <persName>Stan Stephens</persName>, and of course <persName>Robert Vlack</persName>. It is hoped that by hereby making the ANS specimens more readily available for researchers, further work may be facilitated.</p>
            <p>The first <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coin to enter the ANS collection was acquired in 1911 as a purchase. A number of the other examples in the collection today were also purchased by the Society. The first donated <persName>St. Patrick</persName> piece, a gift from <persName>Isaac J. Greenwood</persName>, followed shortly upon the initial acquisition. The occasion of this Coinage of the <placeName>America</placeName>s Conference Proceedings, marking 95 years of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> token coinage’s presence in the cabinet, provides a fine justification to photograph the entire ANS collection of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> pieces consisting of 10 "halfpennies," 19 "farthings," and 3 forgeries and, also an excellent opportunity to acknowledge those whose perspicacity and generosity have preserved these coins for posterity.</p>
            <p>The largest s<persName>Ingle</persName> parcel of <persName>St. Patricks</persName> obtained by the Society came through an advantageous 1945 purchase from <persName>Henry</persName> Grunthal in the days when he was a very helpful <placeName>New York</placeName> City coin dealer before he joined the ANS staff as Curator for Medieval and Modern Coins and Medals. Consisting of five of the larger-sized <persName>St. Patrick</persName> pieces—the so-called halfpence, on the one side of which the saint is shown exhorting a congregation—and six of the smaller coins, traditionally called farthings, this assemblage was part of the former collection of Harry Prescott Clark Beach. The important acquisition totaled 1,380 items overall including a large number of Colonial and obsolete <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> notes and miscellaneous coins. Beach, a <placeName>New York</placeName> lawyer and "rather obsessive genealogist," had been a noted numismatic collector from the 1920s to 1940s.</p>
            <p>The splendid numismatic collection of mining engineer and minerologist Frederick Canfield (1849<hi rend="italic">–</hi>1926) had been bequeathed to the <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> Historical Society (NJHS). Records show that in 1931 the NJHS turned
<pb n="313"/>
               <persName>Canfield’s</persName> entire numismatic collection, numbering some ten thousand pieces, over to the ANS on loan for cataloguing, management and disposition. In return for identifying and processing the material from the bequest, assembling for the NJHS a comprehensive suite of the finest examples of all pieces pertaining to the state’s history, and disposing of the balance of the collection for the benefit of the NJHS, the latter presented to our cabinet a selection of <persName>Canfield’s</persName> items to be retained for our own collection. This gift included a small group of duplicates of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> coppers that had been retained in the NJHS collection. Although not <persName>Canfield’s</persName> best examples, these pieces are still quite presentable specimens. Incidentally, <persName>Frederick Canfield</persName>, a <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> native and life-long resident, was an 1870 graduate of Rutgers College who received his degree in mining engineering from Columbia University in 1873. He was a collector’s collector, who carefully assembled and catalogued the all-time finest suite of <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> mineralogical specimens, which he bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution along with a funding endowment to maintain it. Canfield once said that a collector "takes a scientific or an aesthetic pleasure in accumulating new, strange and interesting objects, which may be studied with profit or arranged to please the eye" (Palache 1927, 68). In the 1880s, by means of his knowledge and understanding of fossilized plants, he had been able to establish the geological age (Tertiary) of the famed <persName>Cerro de Potosí</persName>, in <placeName>Bolivia</placeName>—the world’s greatest silver ore deposit.</p>
            <p>Among other donors to the Society’s <persName>St. Patrick</persName> holdings were <persName>William Proctor</persName> and <persName>Rachel T. Barrington</persName>. One most peculiar <persName>St. Patrick</persName> piece, a forgery, came from the celebrated cabinet of Mrs. <persName>R. Henry Norweb</persName>. This was joined in recent years by a couple of additional forgeries donated by Mr. and Mrs. <persName>R. Byron White</persName>—"Becker" copies made by <persName>Peter Rosa</persName>. Most of the early purchases of <persName>St. Patrick</persName> pieces were acquired from renowned <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> dealer <persName>Henry</persName> Chapman, while other purchases came from a 1911 and a 1912 <persName>Thomas Elder</persName> sale.</p>
            <p>The average state of preservation of the ANS coins may be considered above the norm for the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> series, typically found, as they are, in well-circulated condition. They constitute a fine resource that, unlike private holdings, is readily available to all. It is a collection that deserves to be known, studied, and thoroughly appreciated. In what will hereby become
<pb n="314"/>
one of the larger published presentations of these coins, the illustrations of the individual specimens may speak for themselves.</p>
            <p>The following catalog is divided into two sections, one including the larger- and the other the smaller-module coins. The larger series has been classified by their <persName>Vlack</persName> die variety numbers, as discussed by <persName>Vlack</persName>, <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>., in the <hi rend="italic">Colonial Newsletter</hi> (<persName>Vlack</persName> 1968; <persName>Moore</persName> 2005). The smaller series has been grouped following a numerical assignment based upon the initial classification proposed by Crosby with other references given (Crosby 1875). For each item’s attribution, I provide its ANS accession number, variety references, physical characteristics, salient classificatory details, provenance, and, where warranted, a discussion.</p>
            <p>Publication of the Proceedings of the American Numismatic Society’s 2006 Coinage of the <placeName>America</placeName>s Conference (COAC) on the seventeenth century "<persName>St. Patrick</persName>" token coinage, affords a welcome opportunity to bring the entire collection of these pieces in the Society’s cabinet to the attention of researchers and collectors. This grouping of the popular but enigmatic items is by no means complete, nor is it among the best or largest ever assembled. However, it is, I am reliably informed by Early American specialist <persName>Anthony Terranova</persName>, an excellent and representative assortment. We are pleased and fortunate to hold these pieces, among which may very well be some examples of the coinage introduced into circulation in the British North American Colony of <placeName>New Jersey</placeName> by the immigrant <persName>Mark Newby</persName> (or <placeName>Newbie</placeName>), in 1681.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A uniform preliminary description applicable to the larger-module pieces may be offered as follows:</p>
               <p>Official or semi-official base-metal token coinage, probably of halfpenny denomination. Presumably minted to the order of one of the Lords Lieutenant of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> (possibly late in the reign of <persName>Charles I</persName>, but more likely in that of <persName>Charles II</persName>): <persName>James Butler</persName>, Duke of <persName>Ormond</persName>; <persName>Thomas Butler</persName>, Earl of Ossory, as Deputy; <persName>John Robartes</persName>, <persName>Baron Robartes</persName>; <persName>John Berkeley</persName>, <persName>Baron Berkeley</persName>; or <persName>Arthur Capell</persName>, Earl of Essex.</p>
               <p>Denomination: Halfpenny?</p>
               <pb n="315"/>
               <p>Mint: <placeName>Dublin</placeName> or <placeName>London</placeName>, probably the operation of Peter <persName>Blondeau</persName>, ca. 1667? (<placeName>Danforth</placeName> 2007, 15).</p>
               <p>Designer/engraver: Unknown. <persName>Breen</persName> and others believed this work had been done by <persName>Nicholas Briot</persName> (d. 1646) or under his tutelage. A similarity of the king’s portraiture to that on a <persName>Briot</persName> pattern having been noted (<persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 34).</p>
               <p>Composition: copper; brass.</p>
               <p>Die alignment: 12:00 (vertical; "medal turn")</p>
               <p>Edge: vertically milled ("<persName>Reed</persName>ed").</p>
               <p>Obverse: FLOREAT REX ("May the king flourish!"); King <persName>kneeling l</persName>., radiate-crowned and wearing ermine cape, gazing upward toward crown at 12:00 and playing a large Celtic harp ornamented by a semi-nude winged female "angel" figure facing outward from the pillar or column; above the harp is the British royal ("imperial" style) crown with jeweled double arches, surmounted by a <hi rend="italic">globus cruciger,</hi> toward which the king casts his gaze; the king kneels on a tessellated pavement indicated by a grid-work pattern; the vicinity of the double-arched crown, at which the king stares, is fitted with a yellow brass "splasher" (or plug), generally distorted and spread in the striking process.</p>
               <p>Reverse: ECCE GREX ("Behold the flock!"); <persName>St. Patrick</persName> shown as a bishop facing, standing on ground, wearing cope and mitre and holding a shamrock (trefoil) raised in blessing in his r. hand and a transverse bishop’s crozier in l.; around him, a congregation of people (the <hi rend="italic">grex)</hi> is shown standing— disported seven to l. and three to r.—and facing inward, toward the saint; the foremost figure on l. is a woman raising with both hands a fold of her dress; on r., the garnished arms of <placeName>Dublin</placeName> (three castles ardent, each of two towers) conceals the lower part of the figures.</p>
               <p>Varieties: <persName>Crosby</persName> (1875) initially noted four obverse and six reverse dies; <persName>Vlack</persName> (1968) identified five obverse and six reverse varieties, clarified and refined by <persName>Moore</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> (2005). <persName>Breen</persName> (1968) believed he had discovered additional varieties, but these remain unverified and may presumably be subsumed under the presentation of better specimens presented by <persName>Moore</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> Spink (2002) categorizes the coinage into six classifications, three each under the numbers 6567 and 6568.</p>

               <p>A uniform preliminary description applicable to the smaller-module pieces may be offered as follows:</p>
               <p>Official or semi-official base-metal token coinage. Presumably minted to the order of one of the Lords Lieutenant of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> possibly late in the reign of <persName>Charles I</persName> but more likely in that of <persName>Charles I</persName> i: <persName>James Butler</persName>, Duke of <placeName>Ormand</placeName>; <persName>Thomas Butler</persName>, Earl of <placeName>Ossory</placeName>, Deputy; <persName>John Robartes</persName>, <persName>Baron Robartes</persName>; <persName>John Berkeley</persName>, <persName>Baron Berkeley</persName>; or <persName>Arthur Capell</persName>, <persName>Earl of Essex</persName>.</p>
               <p>Denomination: Halfpenny of reduced weight? Farthing?</p>
               <p>Mint: <placeName>Dublin</placeName> or <placeName>London</placeName>, probably <persName>Peter Blondeau</persName>, ca. 1667? (Danforth 2007, 15).</p>
               <p>Designer/engraver: <persName>Nicholas Briot</persName>?, <persName>Blondeau</persName>? and/or others? Composition: copper; brass.</p>
               <p>Die alignment: 12:00 (vertical; "medal turn")</p>
               <p>Edge: Vertically milled ("<persName>Reed</persName>ed").</p>
               <pb n="319"/>
               <p>Obv.: FLOREAT REX ("May the king flourish!"; King <persName>kneeling l</persName>., radiate-crowned and wearing ermine cape, gazing upward and playing a large Celtic harp ornamented by a semi-nude winged female "angel" figure facing outward from the pillar or column; above harp, a British royal crown with jeweled double arches; the king kneels either on an empty field or a series of waves and "sea-beasts." The vicinity of the double-arched crown, at which the king stares, is fitted with a brass "splasher," generally distorted in the striking process.</p>
               <p>Rev.: QVIESCAT PLEBS ("May the common people be at peace!"); <persName>St. Patrick</persName> shown as a bishop, standing l., facing, wearing cope and mitre, gesturing with his r. hand to banish serpents, etc., and holding transverse metropolitan (patriarchal) cross in his l. hand ; on l., creatures departing to l.; on r., the west front of a cathedral church with tall central spire, viewed from northwest. The "creatures" being banished appear to be a large flying insect; one or more snakes, or a snake and a rodent or other small mammal (?); a winged quadruped (seemingly a griffin, dragon or, less likely, Pegasus) and a toad (?).</p>
               <p>Varieties: Over 200 die varieties are presently believed to exist. <persName>Crosby</persName> (1875) noted 22 obverse dies and 23 reverse dies, sorting the obverses into six categories and the reverses into ten on the basis of differences in the punctuation markings (or lack thereof) in the legends. <persName>Breen</persName> (1988) noted "over 120 die vars." of the "farthings" and grouped them under ten numbers in his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia.</hi> He also assigned two numbers to silver specimens, one to the gold, and one to a lead trial piece. He noted "over 70 vars." of his number 208 alone. Spink (2002) divides the "farthing" coinage issues into six numerical catalog listings (6569–6572 and 6572 A and B) with three sub-categories—for the three known proof issues struck in silver and/or gold. Some examples, not represented in the ANS collection, show <persName>St. Patrick</persName> nimbate. Some feature a bird (heraldically, a martlet) beneath the kneeling king on the obverse, sometimes accompanied by circlets (or perhaps better interpreted as a s<persName>Ingle</persName> annulet and/or two annulets forming a figure 8) which can appear without the martlet as well.</p>
               <p>Since the condition of the pieces in the ANS collection is generally less than pristine and in the absence of the availability of a larger body of
<pb n="320"/>
comparative materials, or the time to develop one, it has been thought best not to try to delineate all of the classificatory details of the dies. The ANS coins have been in the past attributed by <persName>Breen’s</persName> listings. They also bear assigned variety numbers of obverse and reverse designations based on another classification system, following <persName>Crosby</persName>, here entered with quotation marks. <persName>Crosby</persName> noted obverse variants 1) with : before REX, 2) with : after REX, 3) with : before and after REX, 4) with : before and after REX, and · after FLOREAT, 5) with : before and after REX, and an additional · after the second :, and 6) with * before REX and **** after. He then mentions that there are varieties on which, below the kneeling figure of the king, there is 7) "a bird," 8) a bird "sometimes accompanied by three small circles." <persName>Crosby</persName>’s classification of the reverses is as A) without punctuation, B) with · after PLEBS, C) with ’ before PLEBS and . after, D) with · before and after PLEBS, E) with : before PLEBS, F) with : after PLEBS, G) with : before and after PLEBS, H) with :· after PLEBS, I) with : before and :· after PLEBS, and J) with * after QVIESCAT and after PLEBS. It is to be hoped that some day soon a proper die study of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> "farthings" may be executed.</p>

The ANS coin with the accession number 1927.38.76, presently on exhibit in the Federal Reserve Bank of <placeName>New York</placeName> and inaccessible, may be a silver piece, although it was listed as such in the ANS data base records as of 1995.</p>

This piece was withdrawn from the <persName>Bowers</persName> and <persName>Merena</persName>, <persName>Norweb</persName> Collection Auction II (24 &amp; 25 March 1988, lot 2386) as a forgery (see <persName>Kleeberg</persName>, http://www.fake-gold-bars.co.uk/how/how.pdf) It is the interesting and notorious gold forgery reputedly executed by <persName>Paul Franklin</persName>. Mrs. <persName>Norweb</persName> had become furious with <persName>John J. Ford</persName>, Jr., when he declined to sell to her the unique gold <persName>St. Patrick</persName> piece he had obtained from the <persName>F. C. C. Boyd</persName> collection. <persName>Franklin</persName> evidently sought to make a major sale by producing an alternative example of the <persName>St. Patrick</persName> gold piece for her delectation and funneling it through other intermediaries (<persName>Kleeberg</persName>, 53). "Probably by using a copper farthing to make transfer dies, he prepared a fake gold <persName>St. Patrick’s</persName> coin, and through an agent in <placeName>England</placeName>, Brian H. Grover, salted it into an obscure auction at Lewes in Sussex. Spink’s, the leading English coin dealers and one of Mrs. <persName>Norweb’s</persName> preferred agents, were told about the unusual piece and went to bid on it for her. Grover shilled them up to £500 ($1,400)" (<persName>Kleeberg</persName>, 56). <persName>Ford</persName> subsequently condemned this piece, to keep <persName>Franklin</persName> "in line" per <persName>Kleeberg</persName>.</p>
