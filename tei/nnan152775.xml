                  <name type="pname">John Law</name>
               </hi> was a larger-than-life figure: a dissolute young rake, then in turn a professional gambler, a brilliant economic theorist, and finally a leading political figure. Law's economic theories linked credit and money and thus provided a theoretical basis for paper money and government management of the money supply; the virtual bankruptcy of the French monarchy in 1716 gave him an opportunity to put his theories into practice. In a series of bold measures, he reformed the French government's finances, created a national bank and a trading company to manage them jointly, and issued large stock offerings to capitalize the company. As the shares of his Mississippi Company became eagerly sought after, the share value became entirely disproportionate to the Company's actual revenues. The share price soon collapsed, bringing down the Mississippi Company and the Banque Royale along with it.</p>
            <p>The rise and fall of Law's financial system affected a great many investors and was widely commented on throughout <name type="place">Europe</name>. Among the many forms of commentary that were produced are a number of medals, mostly satirical and many of them made by the German medallist Christian Wermuth. These medals were studied by several authors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries but have been relatively neglected since. This book catalogues the diverse medals that commented on Law's financial system, assembling the much greater amount of information now available about the series, along with a supplementary catalogue of types that were suggested by earlier researchers to have referred to Law but are no longer considered to do so.</p>

            <p>At the bedrock of my moral support has been my wife Regina. She has served variously as translator, travel guide, listener, critic, and cheerleader. I could not have persevered without her.</p>
            <p>I need to acknowledge an immense debt to my editor, <name type="pname">John Kleeberg</name>. His patience combined with his competence in both numismatics and economics allowed him both to correct errors and to suggest relevant additions. His wondrous command of languages ancient and modern raised the translation of the mottoes on the medals to a standard of excellence beyond even the level of all the illustrious predecessors in the field. The value added by this contribution cannot be overstated. Finally, I am overwhelmed by the incredibly perceptive reading of this manuscript given by <name type="pname">David Yoon</name>. I am flattered and the book is improved by his erudition.</p>

            </head>
            <p>It has been almost a century since the flowering of interest in the medals of <name type="pname">John Law</name>. In the twenty-six years between 1885 and 1911, no less than four publications treated the subject in depth. The high quality of the work during that period had much to do with the relative silence in the interim. By 1911, much of what could then be said had been said.</p>
            <p>Much new information has since come to light: additional varieties of <name type="pname">John Law</name> medals have been discovered, previously published varieties have proved to be questionable, and collectors have assembled enough examples of all varieties to permit a more disciplined metrology of the series than heretofore possible.</p>
            <p>Perceptions of <name type="pname">John Law</name> himself have likewise been evolving. Originally branded a scoundrel—hence the satirical nature of most of the medals in the series—the reputation of Law has undergone a gradual transformation. Unquestionably the implosion of the Mississippi Bubble caused great financial loss and hardship. With the pain of such losses centuries behind us, however, it is easier to see that the Mississippi System contained much of value.</p>
            <p>The following brief biography attempts to explain the transformation in the man's reputation. The study of historical medals enables us to compare how an appreciation of events when they occurred differs from how these events are viewed given the perspective provided by time. In the case of <name type="pname">John Law</name>, the difference between contemporary and present-day views is dramatic.</p>

            </head>
            <p>At various points in his life, <persName>John Law</persName> was a dissolute rake, an athlete of note, an accomplished gambler, a brilliant economic theorist, a politician of the first rank, and a corporate executive. <persName>John Law</persName> was, as the saying goes, "larger than life"</p>
            <p>Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in April 1671, Law received a solid education. At age nineteen he was drawn to the social scene in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2643743">London</placeName> where, tall, dark, handsome, and possessed of natural charm, he indulged in most of the vices of the upper class. Regrettably, he killed a fellow rake in a duel in April 1694, for which he was sentenced to be hanged. With the aid of highly placed friends he escaped from prison the following year and fled to the Continent.</p>
            <p>Judged by his early years, <persName>John Law</persName> was destined to be an abject failure. He had squandered his inheritance on high living; his taking of another's life had forced him to flee from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. Although relatively little is known of his activities in the years immediately following these events, it is clear that his perspective underwent major change. His transition from a dilettante to a man of purpose was as total as it is today unexplained. Perhaps his emotional and intellectual maturation was a matter of necessity, perhaps he encountered an inspirational mentor, or perhaps his inherent genius simply took hold.</p>
            <p>In the five years following his escape, Law studied banking in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2750405">Holland</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>. Even as he pursued his studies, Law developed an unusual means of support: gambling. His mathematical aptitude, which must have been extreme, permitted him to calculate the odds in various games of chance with greater accuracy and/or rapidity than those against whom he played. His gambling enabled him both to support a high standard of living and to amass a considerable fortune. It is ironic that one of the vices of his youth should become, pragmatically speaking, a virtue in his early maturity. There can be no retrospective measures of such qualities, but Law's success at gambling defines him as a man of unusual daring, discipline, and self-confidence. Moreover, in the early modern period it was one of the few careers
<pb n="4"/>
in which someone with unusual mathematical aptitude could make a good living. <persName>John Law</persName> was one of the earliest financiers to apply mathematical studies to the analysis of financial markets; on Wall Street today, he would be called a "quant". These traits were all necessary as Law evolved from the roles of odds-maker and theorist to a more ambitious career as financial adviser to governments.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Law the Theoretician</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Returning to his native land in 1700 (Scotland was still under separate rule), Law published his first opus, "Proposals and Reasons for Constituting a Council of Trade" (Law 1700). The local gentry had lost a comparatively large investment in the unsuccessful Darien expedition earlier that year and the Scottish economy languished in the doldrums as a result. Not unlike the Mississippi Company seventeen years later, Law proposed to concentrate all of the conventional revenues of the kingdom in a single entity, then to add sundry new taxes, and finally to use the "surplus" to promote local commerce and manufacture. Scotland suffered from the lack of a viable financial institution capable of supplying liquidity to the economy, a role that the proposed Council was intended to play (undercapitalized, the Bank of Scotland had been crippled by the relatively large outflow of funds entailed by the Darien venture).</p>
               <p>In 1704, Law wrote his <hi rend="italic">Essay on a Land Bank</hi>, the foundation for a proposal to the English government to establish a bank whose notes were issued against land as opposed to metallic money (Law 1994). Land, Law argued, held a more stable long-term value than did silver, the price of which varied with the volume of bullion arriving from the New World as well as with the machinations of monarchs.</p>
               <p>In 1705, Law published his magnum opus, <hi rend="italic">Money and Trade</hi> (Law 1705). As with his Essay, the author proposed a bank capitalized with land as a superior store of value. However, this bank was also intended to stimulate the moribund Scottish economy. Perhaps the first monetary theorist with a well-developed sense of the equation of exchange, <persName>John Law</persName> argued that the level of trade was proportionate to the money supply and that, by expanding the latter, one could stimulate the former, at least until full employment was reached. The proposal, debated extensively by the Scottish Parliament in the summer of 1705, failed of passage by only a small margin. Law did not win his point—Scotland was soon absorbed by <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> anyway—but he had succeeded in articulating advanced economic concepts in terse but highly intelligible prose. In the words of <persName corresp="#viaf_44314765">Antoin Murphy</persName>, <hi rend="italic">"Money and Trade</hi> is a majestic work towering over the contemporary writings of the early eighteenth century" (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 77).</p>
               <p>Law was not done with advising governments. He developed a friendship with <persName corresp="#viaf_13103874">Victor Amadeus II</persName>, Duke of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q14118">Savoy</placeName>, a friendship that led to a proposed Bank of Turin modeled after the Bank of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> established in 1694. The duke advised
<pb n="5"/>
Law that he needed a larger stage for so grand a concept, advice that next led the Scotsman to the court of <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName>.</p>
               <p>On the face of the matter, it would seem unlikely that a Scottish Protestant—and a professional gambler at that—would have any hope of introducing new ideas to the most Catholic court of the Sun King. The challenge took Law three years to surmount, but by August 1715, he was on the verge of gaining approval to form France's first commercial bank, its purpose to include not only the creation of credit but also the management of the kingdom's astronomical debt. Unfortunately, <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName> died before plans to move ahead could be finalized.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName> was succeeded by his five-year-old great-grandson, <persName corresp="#viaf_72486">Louis XV</persName>, in August 1715. Law wasted no time in addressing <persName>Philip</persName>, Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2989317">Orléans</placeName>, the young king's regent. <placeName corresp="#geonames_2989317">Orléans</placeName>, with whom Law was to have an intense, sometimes stormy relationship, was a sybaritic aristocrat who happened to be a skillful politician (when he put his mind to it) and an insightful judge of matters economic. He embraced Law's proposal for a royal bank, which was to have the dual function of stimulating credit and, given the large proportion of the royal income that was required to service the royal debt, of managing the liabilities side of the national balance sheet as well. However, the Regent's Council rejected Law's plan. It was his sixth such rejection but, never one to dwell on defeat, Law returned within six months with a new scheme to create a private bank with more limited functions. With the formation of the Banque Générale on 2 May 1716, <persName>John Law</persName> the theorist became <persName>John Law</persName> the business executive.</p>
               <p>From 1700 to 1715, Law's economic theories had evolved from a relatively simple land bank to more versatile plans to move beyond the limitations of metal-based monetary systems to an all-encompassing monetary and fiscal model. This vibrant, pleasure-loving man not only created brilliant theories but also was endowed with the energy to be the indefatigable salesman of his ideas.</p>

               </head>
               <p>With the charter for Banque Générale, Law had won his way from theory into the real world. It is worth pondering what that real world was like. Between twenty-six years of war and an addiction to personal extravagance, <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName> had run up debts in excess of two billion livres, a sum roughly equal to and, by some estimates substantially greater than, the country's gross national product (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 128–130). By 1715, the interest burden alone was greater than <placeName>France's</placeName> tax revenues, the monarchy's debt sold at discounts ranging from 50 to 75 percent, and a large operating deficit grew beyond control.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> was bankrupt in all but the technical sense. Indeed, after the death of <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName>, the expedient of bankruptcy was seriously considered (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 135). Instead, two nearly equivalent measures were put into place. The Visa,

adopted 7 December 1715, and the Chamber of Justice, instituted on 14 March of the following year, were measures to compromise royal debts that were deemed to have been ill gotten by the holder. The execution of these measures was arbitrary and open to corruption. Sentiment among those owning financial instruments ranged from demoralization to terror, as four hundred million livres of their holdings were disallowed. The Visa and the Chamber of Justice effectively caused the traditionally powerful financiers and rentiers to maintain a low profile, thus creating a vacuum into which Law now entered.</p>
               <p>The perspective of the monarch of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> was that he owned everything in the kingdom, and thus any level of taxation could be justified. Virtually every product, every service, and every asset was taxed, a burden from which the nobility and the Church were largely spared. Taxation, tithes, and feudal dues took four fifths of the farmer's income (Gooch 1956: 86). Salt, which might have sold for three or four

livres per unit in a free market, sold for sixty livres after a <orgName corresp="#wikidata_Q12544">Byzantine</orgName> array of taxes that required, by one estimate, 24,000 regular agents to collect, of whom 21,200 were employed to guard against smuggling (<persName>Matthews</persName> 1958:110).</p>
               <p>It was into this unpromising environment that the Banque Générale was introduced (Figure 1). Established on 2 May 1716, the bank had no lending powers, but it could take deposits, issue bank notes, discount bills and letters of exchange, and facilitate transactions in foreign exchange. Received with a skepticism befitting the depressed mood of the financial community, Law's operation got off to a slow start. However, he took the shrewd step of denominating his banknotes in specie-equivalent écus (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997:154)—i.e., the notes would be redeemed at the weight of the silver contained in the coinage at the time of issue, a feature that protected the note holder against debasement (Figure 2). This anti-debasement feature, coupled with growing royal patronage and the pre-existing vacuum in financial services, combined to create an enterprise that grew in public stature even as it generated healthy profits for its shareholders.</p>

                  </ref> taken at face value, even though these instruments were selling a fraction of par value. In a small way Law had begun to address the need to manage the kingdom's debt by converting some of that debt into a more useful form. Although the institution did not possess express lending powers, one can infer from the large profits reported that the bank became an active lender (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 161). In this way a second tenet of Law's economic theories, the augmentation of the money supply by using credit, was put into practice.</p>
               <p>The crowning achievement of Banque Générale was the acceptance of its banknotes. By an edict of 10 April 1717, its notes became legal tender for the payment of taxes. Later, banknotes would become the mandatory means of payment, fulfilling Law's dream of achieving freedom from the limitations of a specie-based financial system. Thus, <placeName>France's</placeName> first private bank became a triumph of economic theory put into practice, even as its operating success did much to lift the spirits of the financial community.</p>
               <p>By September of 1717, the Bank had issued seventy-eight million livres of notes (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 159), a small sum set against a GNP of two billion livres. However, it had become the major royal depository and it handled a majority of the kingdom's tax receipts. Clearly, <persName>John Law</persName> had the Regent's active support. As would soon become clear, both men shared a much broader vision. The bank served to increase the nation's money supply, but it was a minor factor in handling the huge overhanging debt. The <hi rend="italic">Lettres Patentes</hi> creating the Banque Générale contain the exact wording of this all-important provision, which can be seen in Figure 3. Law's next creation was the Company of the West. Established in August 1717 to develop trade in the Louisiana territories, the Company raised capital by accepting <hi rend="italic">billets d'état,</hi> a form of floating debt, in payment for its shares. The <hi rend="italic">billets</hi>, of which there were 250 million livres outstanding, were then selling at a 70% discount to par. The proposed 100 million livres offering of Company stock would remove fully 40% of the <hi rend="italic">billets</hi> at the same time, to the extent that the stock sold at or above issue price, serving to uplift the price of the remaining <hi rend="italic">billets</hi> outstanding.
<pb n="9"/>
From the beginning the prognosis for both the Company and the kingdom were closely linked.</p>
               <p>The Company's first year of operation was largely consumed in raising capital. The public offering of 100 million livres was not fully subscribed until December of the following year, and even then not all the capital—i.e., <hi rend="italic">billets d'état</hi>—had actually been paid in. For removing the <hi rend="italic">billets</hi> from circulation, the Company of the West was given by the Crown an annual income of four million livres. This payment, combined with monopoly trading rights in tobacco as well as an exclusive twenty-five-year right to develop the Mississippi territories, constituted a fairly unexciting enterprise in which Law and the Regent were larger investors by far than the general public. However, the pace was soon to accelerate.</p>
               <p>In December 1718, the Banque Générale was converted into the Banque Royale. The latter was given a nearly unfettered ability to issue banknotes; the notes or gold became mandatory payment for all transactions greater than 600 livres and the provision that gave the paper specie equivalency was eliminated. Shareholders of the old bank were paid off in specie, with the King owning 100% of the shares of the new bank. A large holding of <hi rend="italic">billets d'état</hi> in the new bank's treasury was converted into shares of the trading company, thus establishing a close linkage between the two entities from the outset.</p>
               <p>In May and June of 1719, Law merged the Compagnie des Indes, the Compagnie de la Chine, and the Compagnie d'Afrique into his Compagnie d'Occident. The old Occident then changed its name into the Compagnie des Indes. The company had obtained a global profile, but at 450 livres, its stock languished below the issue price of 500. Law's solution was to offer 25 million livres in new shares at 550—i.e., a premium over market, with his own personal guarantee of full subscription. That bold act stimulated the old shares, which by June had risen from 450 to 650 livres. The chain reaction had begun.</p>
               <p>Stock companies, although well established in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2750405">Netherlands</placeName>, were a novelty in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. Between 1717 and 1719, there had only been three issues—the Company of the West, the United Farms (a lease to collect taxes), and a smallish canal project. The latter two sold down to deep discounts whereas Law's venture struggled back above issue price only when he made his bold commitment to take up new shares at a 10% premium. When the old shares rose to 650, Law, in a masterstroke, ceded his rights to the new issue (<hi rend="italic">les filles,</hi> or "the daughters") at 550 to holders of old shares <hi rend="italic">(les mères,</hi> or the mothers). Because <hi rend="italic">les mères</hi> now had subscription rights at a 100-livre discount to market and, further, because <hi rend="italic">les filles</hi> required only a 10% down payment (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 68), interest in the new issue mounted rapidly. By mid-July, the stock had risen to 1000 livres, double the level of May but, as events were to prove, only the beginning.</p>
               <p>In the same month, the Company acquired the profits of the Mint for nine years, worth an estimated 6 to 12 million livres annually (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 191), for a price of 50 million livres. To fund this purchase, Law floated a further issue of
<pb n="10"/>
50,000 shares at a price of 1,000 <hi rend="italic">(les petites filles,</hi> or "the granddaughters"), with rights to purchase these shares accorded to holders of <hi rend="italic">les mères</hi> and <hi rend="italic">les filles.</hi> By mid-September, persons of all ranks had succumbed to speculative fever and the stock was at 5000.</p>
               <p>The accomplishments of 1717 to mid-1719 were by any standard, contemporary or modern, extraordinarily rapid: the regional trading companies had been consolidated into one, the rights to the tobacco monopoly had been acquired as had the rights to the Mint, four large and successful issues of equity had been brought to market and, finally, a state bank that could print the liquidity required by myriad stock transactions was firmly in place.</p>
               <p>It seemed like an appropriate time to pause. However, although the kingdom's monetary functions were now in good working order, Law recognized that the massive state debt still loomed as a threat to economic stability. In the boldest move among many such, he proposed in August that the Company lend the Crown 1.2 billion livres at a modest 3% rate of interest, the proceeds of which would be used to retire debt and to repurchase offices. In return, the Company was granted a forty-year extension of its trading privileges in Louisiana and a nine-year lease on the tax farms.<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>The enormity of Law's scheme is difficult to appreciate. The magnitude of the very large numbers is obvious, but the iconoclasm involved is not. Traditionally, the tax farms had been leased to a group of powerful financiers who made immense profits by guaranteeing the Crown a fixed amount of tax revenue and pocketing the overage. These financiers, who had also made large loans to the King, had many friends in high places and, indeed, were in high places themselves. Not content to displace this group only, Law would also have eliminated the jobs of all those officeholders whose offices were repurchased. Taken together the proposals represented a frontal assault on the establishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>John Law</persName> had now made a large number of enemies. To preserve his position he had to undertake more ventures. It is not clear how he intended to handle the Crown's debt, whether to re-issue it in a different form at a lower coupon or whether to convert it into equity.<ref target="#CH1-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> But he did take advantage of a soaring market to do three equity offerings in the space of three weeks, from 13 September to 4 October. Combined, these offerings raised an astonishing 1.5 billion livres, expanding the shares outstanding from 300,000 to 600,000 in the process.</p>
               <p>With 600,000 shares priced at 5,000 livres, the Company now had a market capitalization of 3 billion livres. In theory, this valuation was buttressed by the
<pb n="11"/>
1.5 billion livres just raised, but because the newest shares had been sold in ten monthly installments, the Company did not yet have the cash, and the owners faced a steady stream of capital calls going forward. A bigger threat to equilibrium was that, by financing at 5,000 livres, Law had confirmed that valuation and now needed to earn a return on the 3 billion livres of market capitalization. The "overage" on the 50 million livres lease of the tax farms might supply 10 million or even 20 million livres, but such sums, even when combined with 30 to 40 million livres in profits from tobacco, trading, and the mint, could provide no rational justification for the market price of the shares. Thus, between a seemingly unsustainable share price and the vast amounts that shareholders needed to complete purchases at the 5,000 livres offering price, the Mississippi Company, as the Compagnie des Indes was popularly known, was doomed in theory if not in fact.</p>
               <p>The prospect of owning stock had now captivated the public's fancy. As the price rose from 5,000 in August to 10,000 in December, frenzy prevailed in the Rue Quincampoix, where the stock trading took place. Financial instruments, until recently the province of the great financiers alone, were now sought by the nobility, the bourgeoisie, and servants alike. Vast new fortunes were made, with Paris awash in ostentation of all sorts, and <persName>John Law's</persName> praise was sung everywhere by a large chorus of enriched shareholders.</p>
               <p>On 5 January 1720, Law was made Contrôleur-Général of Finances, the equivalent of first minister of the realm. It is ironic that the share price reached its peak of 10,100 within days of that appointment (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 214). Law could not relax in his new glory because it now was apparent to him that the liquidity in the system—i.e., the value of the shares plus the volume of bank notes that had been issued to facilitate stock transactions—had soared beyond 6 billion livres as against the 3 billion livres that he deemed an appropriate money supply for <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> at that time (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 211).</p>
               <p>Law was faced with an essentially impossible situation, but being the brilliant financial engineer that he was, he only increased his activity. In the time frame from December 1719 to February 1720, he approved the export of specie and, one month later, reversed course. He limited personal holdings of specie to 600 livres before, on 11 March, demonetizing gold and silver entirely. Thus, he eliminated by fiat the possibility of a run on the bank to convert paper notes into hard currency. However, at the same time, he lessened the people's faith in the paper notes that were the only legal tender that remained.</p>
               <p>The specie issue was a sidebar. If the money supply, as measured by bank notes outstanding plus the market value of the Company's shares, was excessive, then one or the other would have to contract. For the first two months of 1720, the bank helped to stabilize the share price, expending 800 million livres to buy back 85,000 shares at an average price of 9,300 (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 227). However, whereas these maneuvers reduced the value of shares outstanding, they increased bank notes by an equal amount, leaving no net change in the System's overall liquidity. Clearly,
<pb n="12"/>
Law had to choose between maintaining the value of notes by shrinking the supply or maintaining the value of the stock by propping it up, issuing more notes in the process.</p>
               <p>On 23 February 1720, in what was to be Law's maximum effort to save the System, an edict was published merging the Banque Royale with the Compagnie des Indes, placing new restrictions on the issuance of notes and, finally, closing down the open market operation that had been supporting the shares (<persName>Hyde</persName> 1948:128). With the bank's buying power withdrawn, the share price promptly fell into the mid-7,000s. Major shareholders, among whom were the leading members of the Regent's Council of Finance as well as the king himself, expressed consternation at their paper losses.</p>
               <p>In theory, Law could have educated his backers on the merits of a free market, confessing that the shares might be overvalued in the short term. Instead, on 5 March 1720, he rescinded the hopeful edict of 23 February and once again pegged the share price at 9000. After being temporarily idle, the printing presses returned to full-scale operation.</p>
               <p>Law knew that he could not continue issuing banknotes indefinitely. Running out of alternatives, he elected to maintain the supply of notes and shares but to deflate the value of each in monthly installments. In an edict published on 21 May, it was proposed that a share worth 9,000 in May would fall by 500 livres per month to 5,000 in December; a bank note worth 10,000 livres would decline to 5,000 over the same period of time. Although there was a strong theoretical basis for this package, it was inevitably misunderstood, leading to a crash in the shares (to 4,200 by the end of May), a revocation of the 21 May edict on 28 May, and Law's house arrest (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 252).</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>John Law</persName> was returned to office on 2 June, with the share price rallying in the week thereafter to 6,300. However, the flaws of the System had been exposed, giving its powerful enemies ample opportunity to counterattack. These enemies now advocated a return to hard currency, an effort in which they were so successful that the role of banknotes was reduced progressively until, on 10 October, the notes lost their status as legal tender. The price of the Company's shares declined in parallel to the fortunes of the banknote, reaching 3,200 in November (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 208), after which no price records have survived.</p>

               </head>
               <p>For those who had invested in <persName>John Law</persName>, the fall of the system was a disaster. Entire fortunes were lost and mortgaged estates sold into bankruptcy. It did not assuage popular feelings that the source of all this pain was a foreigner, and a Protestant at that.</p>
               <p>However, those at the top fared better than those below. Thanks to Law, the king sold one quarter of his holdings in the Company at 9,000 (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997:
<pb n="13"/>
226), added to which huge amounts of the Crown's debt had been erased as these obligations were converted into Company shares. The Duke of Bourbon and the Duke de la Force, members of the Regent's inner circle, remained friendly to Law (for a while), because large chunks of their holdings were repurchased also.</p>
               <p>Having been displaced by the System, the wealthy financiers and rentiers invested in it little if at all, and once the bubble burst, this group resumed control. The reconstituted General Farmers bought the lease for indirect taxes in 1721 for 40 million livres. Whereas this was down from the 52.5 million paid by the Company in 1720, the lease rose in the following years, reaching 80 million livres in 1726 (<persName>Matthews</persName> 1958: 62). This strong recovery would suggest that the French economy was in much better shape in 1720, bubble notwithstanding, than it was in the dark days of the Visa and the Chamber of Justice in 1716. Rather, it took another sixty-nine years of Bourbon mismanagement before the Ancien Régime was brought down by the Revolution.</p>
               <p>A great deal of attention has been paid to Law the financier; almost none has been devoted to Law the reformer. During the autumn of 1719, when the popularity of the Mississippi System was nearing its zenith, Law imposed his influence on every facet of the economy. Amongst the offices repurchased were those collecting taxes on cloth, tallow, hay, coal, and meat, with the result that retail prices on such basics as corn, poultry, eggs, and meat fell by one third (<persName>Hyde</persName> 1948:194)- Rents on the Hotel de Ville<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> were reduced from 4% to 3%, with the difference to be applied to tax reduction. A vast array of public works including canals, bridges, and barracks were begun. Law even proposed to combine hundreds of taxes into a single levy on income to include the nobility and the church, both of which had long been exempt from direct impositions (<persName>Hyde</persName> 1948:120).</p>
               <p>A fair, if hypothetical, question is whether the monarchy would have fared better if the system had remained in place. The question is worth posing because it pits personalities against process. Let us assume that the speculative fever could have been held in check while the availability of credit powered the economy to its full employment potential. This happy combination would have created more tax revenues, permitting debt reduction and lowering of taxes, either one of which would have fostered still more economic growth. A king too young (ten years old in 1720) to have become profligate, added to the quarter century of peace following the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, created the ideal environment for Law's System to prosper.</p>
               <p>Against this halcyon prospect, Law would have faced the increasing envy and enmity of the financiers and rentiers whose livelihood the system replaced. When
<pb n="14"/>
the Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2989317">Orléans</placeName> died in 1723, he was succeeded by <persName corresp="#viaf_119658">Cardinal Fleury</persName>, who had no experience in financial matters and who, in his subsequent twenty years of being the de facto first minister, showed little interest in innovation. Although Law retained a few friends in high places, notably the Duke of Bourbon, he would have stood essentially alone against forces of reaction that permeated the entire power structure.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName corresp="#viaf_72486">Louis XV</persName> showed no interest in ruling himself, creating a vacuum that some powerful personality might have filled, but none ever did. Perhaps <persName>John Law</persName> could have been that person and perhaps his success would have been sufficient to shield him against the never-ending intrigues at the court that were the equivalent of the national sport. All said, the very nature of an absolute monarch is to change his mind at will. A prosperous economy which gave rise to liberal social trends would have pleased Voltaire, but such dynamics would likely have been anathema to the people who counted and for whom traditions were more important than progress. Ironically, it was the reactionary custom of dueling that prevented <persName>John Law</persName> from practicing his economic theories in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, the one country that might have provided a liberal home to his advanced ideas.</p>
               <p>That Law was blamed for the <persName>Bubble</persName> by his contemporaries need not be argued. Even sixty years later in 1783, <persName corresp="#viaf_17231985">Horace Walpole</persName> had this to say: "Law was a very extraordinary man but not at all an estimable one" (<persName>Hyde</persName> 1948: 194). Some writers in the nineteenth century continued in that vein; some became more positive. It was not until the twentieth century that Law's contributions received full recognition. Writing in 1954, <persName corresp="#viaf_64011725">Joseph Schumpeter</persName>, the great historian of economic thought, offered this appraisal: "<persName>John Law</persName> (1671–1729), I have always felt, is in a class by himself. He worked out the economics of his projects with a brilliance and, yes, profundity which places him in the front ranks of monetary theorists of all times" (<persName>Murphy</persName> 1997: 6). Judging from the volume of recent publications on the subject, Law's reputation as a theorist is rising rapidly among modern academic economists.</p>
               <p>A proper evaluation of <persName>John Law's</persName> contribution is made difficult by the complexities of the Mississippi System. Gradually, the pieces of the story have been assembled—what securities were issued in what volume, the subsequent price action of those securities, the major transactions of the Mississippi Company, and the content of relevant edicts issued by the Regent's Council. It has remained for a modern scholar, <persName corresp="#viaf_44314765">Antoin Murphy</persName>, to bring all these pieces into focus and then to pose the pivotal question: Was the System the work of a flawed genius or was Law doomed to failure by entrenched interests? His book, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>John Law</persName>, Economic Theorist and Policy-Maker,</hi> frames this pivotal question and then addresses it in an admirably thorough fashion. His opus is by a wide measure the most useful reference on the entire subject.</p>
               <pb n="15"/>
               <p>It is possible to advance persuasive arguments on both sides of the "pivotal question" For the purpose of this monograph, what is important to note is that <persName>John Law</persName> faced formidable difficulties. The launching of the Banque Générale came only after prior proposals to six different governments had been rejected; only a monarchy on the verge of bankruptcy was willing to give the new ideas a try. Further, the functions of commercial banking were virtually unknown in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, such that the novelty of paper money was in itself an issue. Law's mission was complicated by the fact that he was a foreigner who, until his conversion to Catholicism, professed an alien religious faith. Finally, by far the most dangerous obstacle was the existence of a powerful establishment opposed to progress. By definition, the establishment included the richest men in the land.</p>
               <p>The magnitude of the obstacles faced meant that Law must implement his changes at breakneck speed. In the space of four years, from the founding of Banque Générale on 2 May 1716 to the notorious edict devaluing paper money issued on 20 May 1720, the credit of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> had been re-established and the entirety of the staggering national debt had been redeemed. Quite naturally, this dizzying pace of progress had caused a euphoric rise in the price of Mississippi Company shares. The whole, backed as it was by the massive issuance of banknotes, was on shaky ground.</p>
               <p>After having been rejected on so many occasions, <persName>John Law</persName> must have been intoxicated by his initial and subsequent successes. Between intoxication and an expected backlash from the establishment, Law could have had multiple motives for moving swiftly. Perhaps, given more time to execute, the System might have worked. It is not our purpose to answer that pivotal question. It suffices to observe that enough is now known about <persName>John Law</persName> to permit intelligent debate.</p>
               <p>One final question that does deserve to be addressed is the relevance of the Mississippi Bubble to modern times. As noted above, the French reacted to the trauma of deflated share prices by expunging Law's system in all its aspects. Whereas the trading company survived, the centralization of revenues was disbanded, the paper notes were made worthless, and a long list of economic reforms were terminated. The way to avoid risk, it was reasoned, was to resort to the "tried and true".</p>
               <p>The natural tendency for us with our recent Internet Bubble is to do the same, i.e., to condemn the entire risk-taking function. Indeed, the pillorying of stockbrokers, however much deserved, the disintegration of the market for initial public offerings, and the redemption of mutual fund shares is strongly reminiscent of what occurred in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. In cleansing the excesses, we risk also removing some basics. Our challenge in financial markets today is to retain the entrepreneurial climate that, by fostering an extraordinarily high level of innovation, has been a role model for developed economies.</p>
               <pb n="16"/>
               <p>Investors cannot be compelled to be entrepreneurs, but they will assume this role voluntarily if prospective returns outweigh the losses inherent in the assumption of risk. Individuals will bet their money (and their careers) on innovation if the magnitude of the reward motivates them to do so. However, the aftermath of our Internet Bubble features more skepticism and finger-pointing than gusto for accepting new challenges. Just as a study of <persName>John Law</persName> demonstrates that the skeptics of his age were blind to the man's virtues, much to their detriment, so too are modern investors, pained by losses on Internet start-ups, in danger of minimizing the financial potential of new ventures. If the pendulum of investor sentiment shifts too far from risk toward safety, the growth rate of the economy will slow along with its ability to bear the social burdens that a more dynamic prosperity can support.</p>
               <p>If there is one abiding characteristic of bubbles, it is our proclivity to fall victim to self-deception. No one understood the Mississippi System better than its architect. In gathering all the revenue streams of the kingdom, <persName>John Law</persName> realized that whatever the benefits of being able to coordinate monetary and fiscal policy, these benefits lay mostly in the future. Thus, as the share price rose from 450 to 1,000 livres it must have occurred to him, if to nobody else, that the share price was soaring well beyond the fair value of the enterprise. When the stock then rose to 2,000, to 4,000, and then to 10,000 livres, such thoughts must have become oppressive, and yet, such is the intoxication derived from success that Law made only token attempts to restrain the Bourse even as he accelerated the printing of bank notes. In an analogous vein, investment bankers in the 1990s lowered their quality standards, orchestrated inordinate premiums in the aftermarket, and turned their analysts into cheerleaders. Soaring valuations of marginal business models, instead of providing food for thought, served only to stimulate the collective faith in the wisdom and propriety of the IPO process.</p>
               <p>Today we regard these titans of finance as knaves and fools. Although no satirical medals have been struck in their "honor", this omission is largely due to an array of alternative floggings, none of which offer the wit and sophistication of the eighteenth-century original.</p>
               <p>In the chapters that follow, we delineate the numismatic aspects of the medals of <persName>John Law</persName>. Earlier writers shared our passion for the subject but, being pioneers, they made mistakes and omissions that can now be corrected. What cannot be fixed is availability. Regrettably, our research suggests that the medals are a good deal rarer than thought, thus rendering the series impractical for all but the most dedicated specialists.</p>
               <p>However, we suggest that possession does not really matter. Rather, it is ours to enjoy the poignant satire on <persName>John Law</persName> medals, a poignancy born of pain. From our vantage point today, the satire is enriched by the irony that the man deserved

            </head>
            <p>Lessons are doomed to be unlearned; memories fade with time. These aphorisms could describe many episodes in human experience. They certainly fit the rise and fall of <persName>John Law's</persName> Mississippi system. The intense trauma created by this economic cataclysm subsided over the decades and then the centuries that followed. Today, excepting a handful of academics, our memories of the man and his system are vestigial at best.</p>
            <p>The numismatic literature about <persName>John Law</persName> follows the trend of diminishing intensity. The most eloquent expression of pain is captured in the Dutch book, <hi rend="italic">Het Groote Tafereel der Dwaasheid,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Great Mirror of Folly.</hi> First published in 1720 and re-published capriciously for decades thereafter, this is a compendium of contemporary commentary. It contains several plays, twenty-seven poems and a range of forty-seven to seventy-four folio-sized prints (Cole 1949: 7, 8). All of the material is satirical in nature; some of it refers to contemporary Dutch speculations, some to <placeName>England's</placeName> South Sea Bubble, and most to <persName>John Law's</persName> System. The sheer volume of the satire attests to the magnitude of the economic losses caused by rampant speculation. The eloquence and variety of the satire suggests that the losses were widespread as well as massive.</p>
            <p>When interest in non-classical numismatics began to flower in the mid-nineteenth century, <persName>John Law</persName> was still a familiar name to educated collectors. <persName>Alexi</persName> knew him as an economist, but there were enough knowledgeable numismatists to assist him in gathering a respectable list of medals. Benjamin Betts was utterly captivated by the <persName>John Law</persName> story, as were his contemporaries, <persName corresp="#viaf_36547176">C. Wyllys Betts</persName> and his editor, <persName corresp="#viaf_41750788">William T. R. Marvin</persName>. These three, consulting with enthusiastic friends, succeeded in deciphering the often-enigmatic inscriptions on the medals. They did not share the pain of economic loss; the rise and fall of the Mississippi system was too far removed for that. However, well grounded in both languages and
<pb n="22"/>
history, they brought the relics of an earlier era to life, capturing the romance and mystery of a compelling personality.</p>
            <p>Following the publication by the two Bettses, written material on the <persName>John Law</persName> medals thins out and then ceases altogether. Medina in 1924 is a simple rehashing of <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>. Excepting <persName>Grueber</persName> and <persName>Wohlfahrt</persName>, who take peripheral looks at the subject, nothing of consequence has been written for ninety years. Numismatically, <persName>John Law</persName> has vanished into the ether. The written corpus is presented in Table 1.</p>

                  <persName>S. Alexi</persName> was an economist, and fifty-seven of the sixty-seven pages in his book reflect this training. He provides a thumbnail biography of <persName>John Law</persName> (including an appendix that depicts the Law family tree), and then concentrates on issues of economics. <persName>Alexi</persName> gives us a meticulous list of the financial paper issued by the Banque Royale, its predecessor the Banque Générale, and the Mississippi Company itself. He also provides a chronology of events and edicts, paralleling the rise and fall of the price of Mississippi shares. <persName>Alexi's</persName> stated purpose was to assemble the facts in a dispassionate, non-judgmental fashion.</p>
               <p>The addition of a list of nineteen <persName>John Law</persName> medals along with two photographic plates depicting eleven of the nineteen is a happy afterthought. Presumably the eleven plated examples were provided by the numismatic friends to whom the author refers; the remaining eight are taken from German numismatic literature, principally Borchman (1763) and Hauschild (1806). <persName>Alexi</persName> does not give credit to Professor <persName corresp="#viaf_316775779">C. Fieweger</persName>; however, that man's superb collection of <persName>John Law</persName> medals (ten pieces) came to market in Berlin in 1885, an occurrence that seems beyond coincidence (Collection Fieweger 1885). In the five years after 1885, <persName>Alexi</persName> authored several articles for <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Numismatik</hi> (<persName>Alexi</persName> 1887; 1890a; 1890b), but <persName>John Law</persName> remains by far his most important contribution to our discipline.</p>

                     <persName>B. Betts</persName> 1885.</hi> In 1885, <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> delivered a paper before the American Numismatic Society. Betts had been collecting <persName>John Law</persName> medals for six years beforehand, his first acquisition having been published in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> (Poillon 1879: 96). By 1885, he had assembled a dozen pieces, more than anyone theretofore and more than all but a handful of collectors since. These plus four in the cabinet of fellow Society member <persName>Daniel Parish</persName>, Jr., plus ten described in <persName>Alexi</persName> plus two medal-like engravings in <hi rend="italic">Tafereel der Dwaasheid</hi> added up to an astounding twenty-eight varieties (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 4). Those in attendance urged Betts to publish the paper, but he felt it was too "crude" and needing of "further investigation" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 4). It is possible that the author's notes for this paper survive somewhere in the archives of Yale University, where a number of his <persName>John Law</persName> medals now reside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>.</hi>
                  <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> sold his twelve specimens to <persName corresp="#viaf_36547176">C. Wyllys Betts</persName>, who was then writing his authoritative <hi rend="italic">American Colonial History Illustrated by Contemporary Medals</hi> (<persName>Betts</persName> 1894). <persName>John Law</persName> medals occupy numbers 114 through 141 in this book, a total of twenty-eight varieties. Included are all eighteen varieties from <persName>Alexi</persName>, five non-<persName>Alexi</persName> varieties from <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName>, two new entries from Medallic Illustrations, one from the cabinet of <persName>Daniel Parish</persName>, Jr., and two for which the source is not noted. Not included are the two engravings from <hi rend="italic">Tafereel der Dwaasheid</hi> listed by <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName>—properly so because no medals from these designs have ever surfaced.</p>
               <p>In his 1885 paper, <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> was able to translate the legends and inscriptions "by the help of several friends" (<persName>Betts</persName> 1907: 4). It is not known whether <persName corresp="#viaf_36547176">C. Wyllys Betts</persName> had access to these translations or whether the translations in his book were his own. Whichever way, between <persName>C. W. Betts</persName> and his editors (<persName corresp="#viaf_41750788">William T. R. Marvin</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_45606719">Lyman Low</persName>), great enigmas are resolved. The combination of the bad Latin and archaic, dialectal German to be found on the medals together with chronograms that required deciphering pose a challenge that today would require a team of linguists to confront. We must be grateful to our nineteenth-century predecessors, all of them heavily grounded in the classics, for sparing us the effort.</p>
               <p>If rendering legends is the abiding contribution of <hi rend="italic">American Colonial History,</hi> its weaknesses lie in metrology (a number of diameters provided are inaccurate) and sequencing (the order of presentation is virtually random). That said, the book possesses the virtue of being widely available in both original and reprinted editions.</p>

was then privately printed (1907) with an introduction and indices appended. The author was to die at age 86 within a year after completing his magnum opus.</p>
               <p>With the passage of 25 years from his original paper, the author broadened his list from 28 to 38 varieties (Table 2).</p>
               <p>The "miscellaneous" category includes the same two engravings from <hi rend="italic">Tafereel der Dwaasheid</hi> to which are added single specimens from five far-flung sources. Despite advancing years, Betts continued to cast his net. Ten varieties listed by <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> are not listed by <persName corresp="#viaf_36547176">Charles Wyllys Betts</persName> (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: nos. 5,10,15, 25,29,31,33, 34,37,38).</p>
               <p>Of the ten, three are recognized to be dubious by the author (nos. 15, 37, and 38), number 5 is apocryphal in our opinion, two are engravings from <hi rend="italic">Tafereel der Dwaasheid</hi> for which actual medals are not believed to exist (nos. 33 and 34), and eight (nos. 25 through 32) are actual medals that, for reasons to be discussed subsequently, do not belong in the <persName>John Law</persName> series. This leaves one number (10) that is a legitimate addition to the <persName>John Law</persName> corpus. It bears repeating that <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> had previously contributed five unpublished varieties to <persName>C. W. Betts</persName> for inclusion in his opus. Thus, the <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> monograph can be criticized for superfluous varieties. Like <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>, it also contains weak metrology (inaccurate diameters, absence of weights) and pays little heed to sequencing. However, these flaws are minor compared to its abiding strengths.</p>
               <p>The strengths of the <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> opus must begin with the man's obvious zeal for his work. Beginning with his first acquisition in 1879, Betts maintained an intense interest in <persName>John Law</persName> that lasted for almost three decades. The biographical section on Law (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 5–21) brings the subject matter to life. It captures the essence of the "hero" and gives a solid rendering of the workings of the Mississippi System, all done in an engaging literary style that exudes the author's command of the material.</p>
               <p>However great the virtues of the biographical section, these are exceeded by the author's brilliant descriptions of individual pieces. Betts went to great lengths to decipher inscriptions written in French, Dutch, German, and Latin—often in archaic or colloquial forms. Occasionally, his renderings are less fluid than those of Grueber or <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>, but his accompanying information, including

the footnotes, is far superior. The lavish attention that <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> gives to his descriptions serves both to elucidate and to ennoble the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Grueber.</hi> Herbert Grueber was for two decades the Assistant Keeper, then the Keeper of Coins and Medals at the British Museum. With the Museum's collection close at hand, he wrote extensively on British and Roman coinage. His principal works on these subjects remain as important today as at the time of publication.</p>
               <p>In 1885, Edward Hawkins compiled his <hi rend="italic">Medallic Illustrations of the History of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2648147">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</placeName>

A lasting numismatic classic, it lists five varieties of <persName>John Law</persName> Medals (<persName>Hawkins</persName> 1885: 2.448–452), only one of which was in the Museum's cabinet. <persName>Hawkins'</persName> descriptions of the medals are brief; his translations of the mottoes are literal. His then editor, <persName corresp="#viaf_30299064">H. A. Grueber</persName>, was to raise the Museum's contribution to <persName>John Law</persName> to a higher level.</p>
               <p>In 1904, <persName>Grueber</persName> began to illustrate the original work using photographs of plaster casts. These photographs are useful in themselves, but the author's accompanying descriptions elaborate on the information compiled by <persName>Hawkins</persName>. In the case of <persName>John Law</persName> medals, the descriptions go far beyond the base established in 1885. <persName>Grueber</persName> expands the varieties cited from five to fourteen; even more important (because both Bettses had already described twice as many) were the renderings of the inscriptions. A truly educated man, <persName>Grueber</persName> picks up many nuances missed by earlier writers. His translations are always coherent and often inspired. One regrets only that <persName>Grueber</persName> did not describe more <persName>John Law</persName> varieties because, if he had, he would almost certainly be the preferred source on the subject.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Medina.</hi> José Toribio Medina was the author, editor, and printer of over 400 books, of which a dozen are numismatic works. The most extensive of these is <hi rend="italic">Medallas Europeas Relativas a América</hi> (<persName>Medina</persName> 1924), which catalogues nearly 500 medals. The medals are organized by eight countries, rather than by date as was the case with <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>. Otherwise <persName>Medina</persName> borrows liberally from <persName>Betts</persName>. The <persName>John Law</persName> medals contained in <hi rend="italic">Medallas Europeas</hi> are sequenced exactly as in Betts except for <persName>Betts</persName> 125, which is naturally placed in the author's French section. <persName>Medina's</persName> descriptions of <persName>John Law</persName> medals paraphrase the descriptions in <persName>Betts</persName>, with the result that little of value is added. Many medals elsewhere in the book reference the "Colleción Medinense". The fact that no <persName>John Law</persName> medals are so referenced raises our suspicion that <persName>Medina</persName> owned none himself and copied what he knew from other published sources.</p>

                     <persName>Wohlfahrt</persName>.</hi> In her definitive book on Christian Wermuth (<persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> 1992), <persName corresp="#viaf_34546251">Cordula Wohlfahrt</persName> was not focusing on <persName>John Law</persName>. Of the 1488 medals she attributes to the artist, less than 1% refer to the Scottish financier. Nonetheless, her contribution to the subject of <persName>John Law</persName> medals is an important one detailing, as she does, the methods employed by Wermuth to manufacture and distribute his designs.</p>
               <p>We learn from <persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> that Wermuth was a self-educated man sufficiently versed in the classics to have devised his own Latin inscriptions; we learn that he

regularly re-used dies (<persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> 1992: 5), thus explaining the small variations in legends described later; we learn that most of the designs were done on speculation—i.e., with no advance subscriptions—and, finally, we learn that <persName>Wermuth</persName> had a multi-country network of agents for whom he maintained a catalogue of his current offerings.</p>
               <p>Roughly 10% of all medals made by <persName>Wermuth</persName> were satirical in nature. <persName>Wermuth's</persName> sense of humor was not always appreciated by the powerful monarchs of the day, and some of his creations were suppressed (<persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> 1992: 15). Censorship, actual or implied, may be one reason for the scarcity of <persName>Wermuth's</persName> Law medals. It is certainly the reason that none (with a single exception) are signed even though it was the artist's normal practice to do so.</p>
               <p>From time to time, <persName>Wermuth</persName> published <hi rend="italic">Specificationes</hi> detailing the designs then available (<persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> 1992:24; <persName>Wermuth</persName> 1698; 1699; 1701; 1702; 1707; 1736). Typically, his satirical medals were of relatively small diameter and were offered in tin (as well as in silver and copper) so that the budget-conscious jokester could make an impulse purchase. Costs were also minimized by simple, shallow designs and by the reuse of dies. What he produced was more an inelegant piece of ephemera than a historical milestone. The very intent of the medal—a good contemporary joke—argued against its being studiously preserved for future generations. When the editors of <persName>C. W. Betts</persName> refer to medals which "are mostly wretched pieces of work of a South German die-cutter" (<persName>C. W. Betts</persName> 1894: 59), they are missing the point.</p>

                  <persName>John Law</persName> medals is not complete and her renderings of the inscriptions are obligatory at best. However, these are minor defects when compared to the richness of the fabric that she weaves. Many have written in depth about <persName>John Law</persName>, but she alone provides the perspective of a satirist of <persName>John Law</persName>: she documents the life, times, and travails of he who would mock an establishment that was truly established.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">French literature.</hi> The story of <persName>John Law</persName> medals was well addressed by the Germans (<persName>Alexi</persName>, Wohlfahrt), Americans (<persName>C.

These authors treat the subject sometimes with distinction but always with passion. <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, the nation that played host to the saga and the one that lost the most in the process, has remained strangely silent. There is not a single article on the subject in the <hi rend="italic">Revue Numismatique.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Revue Belge de Numismatique</hi> does a little better with a review of <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> monograph in 1908 (Bigwood 1908), and a mention in the proceedings of 1964 (Société Royale de Numismatique 1964: 183). However, between these two distinguished and long-lived periodicals, there is nothing that adds to our knowledge of <persName>John Law</persName> medals.

            </head>
            <p>As described in Chapter 2, much has been written on the subject of <persName>John Law</persName> medals. The large written corpus belies the fact that the medals themselves are more than scarce—they are rare. The seeming irony that much has been written about little speaks eloquently for the intense curiosity that the subject evokes when it is infrequently encountered.</p>
            <p>In casting the net for our overall census, we attempt to avoid double counting by using the year 1960 as a dividing line. In the years prior to 1960, a period that witnessed the publication of all the major works in the field, the harvest of appearances is a lean one. <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName>, arguably the leading authority on <persName>John Law</persName> medals, collected this genre for twenty-three years and amassed a total of twenty-three pieces. No one else came close to rivaling this accomplishment (Table 3).</p>
            <p>No doubt a number of pieces have eluded our census. Even so, the appearance of only 133 medals over a century and a half makes an obvious point: the population is extremely small.</p>
            <p>The post-1960 census corroborates the earlier data. Deceased numismatists Ted Craige and Leonard Finn assembled collections of fifteen and twelve medals respectively; <persName corresp="#viaf_242460117">George Fuld</persName> managed to find six. Most of these, along with another seven specimens in the Henry Christensen sale of 20 September 1967, found their way into present-day holdings as shown in Table 4.</p>
            <p>There is room for error in the foregoing census but, in our opinion, not much. The 138 medals we list could grow to twice that number but not materially more.<ref target="#CH3-n1">

               <persName>John Law</persName> medals rarely appear at auction and, in turn, a poll of the auction houses uncovered no mystery buyers and/or rumors of long-hidden hoards. Collectors such as Craige, Finn, and LaRiviere acquired their <persName>John Law</persName> medals one at a time.</p>
            <p>The obvious question arises: why are these pieces so rare? A sample of the largest collections of the past and present by metal reveals the proportions shown in Table 5.</p>
            <p>Given that these medals were topical in nature—the equivalent of today's humorous birthday card—it seems likely that many more specimens were purchased

in the lower-cost base metals than in silver. The fact that a strong majority of the surviving population is struck in silver would suggest that many of the white metal, lead, and copper medals were simply discarded. Whatever the number struck, the survival rate suffered from the lack of intrinsic value as well as from the modest appearance of most designs.</p>
            <p>It is known also that many of Christian <persName>Wermuth's</persName> satirical medals were banned by political authorities (Wohlfahrt 1992: 15). The <persName>John Law</persName> pieces would certainly have been "non grata" in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, where the genre remains virtually unknown to this day. It is hard to believe that the medals were cordially welcomed anywhere in a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName> dominated by absolute monarchies and which still basked in the Peace of Utrecht.</p>
            <pb n="30"/>
            <p>Whereas both the ephemeral nature of the item and the hostile political climate mitigated against widespread distribution, the fundamental reason for the scarcity of <persName>John Law</persName> medals rests with Christian <persName>Wermuth</persName>. Though capable of sophisticated work for projects on commission, this prolific artist produced his satirical medals on speculation. As a speculator, he minimized his investment in dies by executing them in shallow relief. In like manner, he would have minimized his investment in inventory, making medals only when orders generated from his price list were received. There was no subscription list for satirical material. Rather, business was dependent upon demand from those wishing to enjoy a good joke, an audience which, given the widespread losses on Mississippi Company shares, would have been constrained at the outset. Fortunately, there were some individuals who retained their sense of humor during difficult economic times. It is to these inveterate connoisseurs of wit that we owe the handful of <persName>John Law</persName> medals that survive today.</p>
            <p>In the text that follows, we assign a rarity rating to each variety listed. This rating is based on the Sheldon scale as follows:</p>
            <p>R-8 Unique or nearly unique (1–3)</p>
            <p>R-7 Extremely Rare (4–12)</p>
            <p>R-6 Very Rare (13–30)</p>
            <p>R-5 Rare (31–75)</p>
            <p>To determine rarity, we have counted all appearances from 1806 until the present day, many of which appearances are of course redundant. We have then doubled the total number of appearances, redundant or not, in order to assign a specific rating. Given that the most common variety (Adams 25) has appeared only 21 times, all ratings are R-5 and above. A summary of rarity ratings yields the following:</p>
            <p>R-8 6</p>
            <p>R-7 26</p>
            <p>R-6 15</p>
            <p>R-5 4</p>

               <p>It is interesting to compare the modern population of medals with the modern population of a contemporary book, <hi rend="italic">Het Groote Tafereel Der Dwaasheid.</hi> A folio-sized volume containing a broad assortment of satirical drawings, plays and poems, <hi rend="italic">Tafereel der Dwaasheid</hi> first appeared in 1720, the year that the Mississippi and South Sea bubbles broke. <persName>William Reece</persName>, the eminent <placeName corresp="#geonames_4839366">New Haven</placeName> book dealer, estimates the present-day population of this marvelous work at 500 copies. Granted that the book was reprinted for many years after its original publication and that the medals were made only for a year or two, nonetheless the comparison strongly suggests that the medals were regarded as ephemera and, accordingly, have experienced a relatively low survival rate.</p>

            <p>The Chamber of Justice was an occasionally-used tool of French royal governments. Employed often in the seventeenth century (1601, 1607, 1625, and 1661), the Chamber dealt with extraordinary circumstances whereby otherwise unpalatable initiatives could be cloaked in judicial solemnity. <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName> remains a towering figure in history, but his wars and his monuments cost far more than his revenues could support. When he died in 1715, he left debts so large that the interest alone was equal to half of the kingdom's revenues.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_72486">Louis XV</persName>, the great-grandson of <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName>, was only five years old when the throne passed to him. His advisors seriously considered declaring bankruptcy, but instead they created a Chamber of Justice in 1716. The ostensible purpose of this initiative was to punish profiteers who had taken advantage of the state. However, the practical purpose was to reduce the debt by any means—i.e., abrogating the "bad" debt while confirming the "good".</p>
            <p>
               <persName>John Law</persName> had returned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> after the death of <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName> who, several years earlier, had summarily dismissed Law's plan for financial reforms because Law was a Protestant. <persName>Alexi</persName> maintained that Law advised the King's Regent, the Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2989317">Orléans</placeName>, and Noailles, the Superintendent of Finance, in structuring the mission of the Chamber (<persName>Alexi</persName> 1885: 5). Other authorities make no mention of Law's involvement. Whatever the case, the 1716 Chamber of Justice marks the beginning of financial reform under the new regime and, thus, is an appropriate starting point for a catalogue of <persName>John Law</persName> medals.</p>
            <p>The 1716 Chamber of Justice medal familiar to numismatists is the one cited both by <persName corresp="#viaf_36547176">C. Wyllys Betts</persName> (no. 125) and by <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> (no. 1). It features an obverse engraved by Jean Le Blanc and a reverse by Jean Duvivier. Progressive deterioration of the reverse die makes it clear that this is the first of four obverses depicting the king followed by two more obverses depicting the Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2989317">Orléans</placeName>. Our <persName>John Law</persName> series starts out with these designs.</p>

               <hi rend="italic">Reverse A.</hi> One can debate whether the massive debts incurred by <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName> were the fault of the borrower or the lenders. This design adopts the latter view: the lenders are symbolized by Cacus, a famous robber in classical mythology; he is best known for having stolen a herd of cows from Hercules, hiding them by walking them backward into a cave. In the present case, he is being dragged from the cave by Hercules, a flattering metaphor for the newly formed Chamber of Justice. The legend: VINDEX AVARAE FRAUDIS⋅ ("the avenger of avaricious fraud"); in the exergue: CHAMBRE DE JUSTICE /1716 ⋅ In the field above the feet of Hercules are the letters DV for the engraver of this reverse, Jean Duvivier.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Group of Twelve</hi>
               </head>
               <p>We place the following group of twelve medals near the beginning of the series for two reasons. First, the mottos are equivocal, suggesting that the ultimate fate of the Mississippi Company is not yet known. Secondly, there are no images on these pieces, from which one might infer that the financier had not yet become an obvious target of satire.</p>
               <p>Although <persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> lists only six of the twelve medals, there can be no doubt that the first eleven were executed by Christian <persName>Wermuth</persName>. The style is strongly suggestive of his work and the group is die-linked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">7.</hi>
                  <persName>Grueber</persName> and both Bettses place this medal at or near the beginning of their respective series. Of the three, only <persName>Grueber</persName> reads the piece as satirical, seeing double entendre where the Betts brothers saw none. The best clue as to intent may be the concluding words on the reverse, which name Strasbourg as the place of origin. Although Christian <persName>Wermuth</persName>, the engraver,<ref target="#CH4-n2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> did not have a shop in that city, he attended numerous fairs and may have fabricated this medal for or during such an event. He would not have wanted to leave any clue as to the country of manufacture if the medal was an apparent attack on the French establishment.<ref target="#CH4-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> This clue, as well as the fact that the medal raises issues about the Mississippi system but does not resolve them, suggests that the time of striking was early in 1720, well before the debacle that was to occur in July of that year.</p>
               <p>Like most of <persName>Wermuth's</persName> topical designs, No. 7 features crude figures in low relief. The purpose and, today, the appeal of the medal is not the artistry but the witty commentary on then current events. No other medal in the series delivers more wit or more insight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Obverse 7.</hi> The figure of Law standing in court dress and facing the figure of Envy crouched in a cave. Law holds a three-masted schooner in his left hand and in his right a scroll which reads LOVISIANA | EST EST | BANCO ET | MONETA ("what Louisiana is, is both a bank and a mint"). Above, the winged figure of Fame blows two trumpets—the upper one emits the words LAVS IN ASTRIS. ("praise among the stars") and the lower one LAVS IN TERRIS. ("praise on earth"). The word LAVS ("praise") is a pun on the name Law, the latter often spelt "Laws" (pronounced "lass") in French.</p>

that is born of virtue, I regard as glory, not odium. Cicero against Catiline, first oration, chapter 12" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 26). The phrase from Cicero is a slight misquotation, since the original has "putarem", not "judico", but the adjustment makes sense given the limited size of the medal and greater clarity of using the indicative mood instead of the subjunctive. Put another way, the notoriety given <persName>John Law</persName> by jealous critics redounds to his glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Reverse</hi> C. The four-part dialogue on the reverse would have made good theater. Envy speaks first, *INVIDIA* | LVCRIPETAS ALLICIS | VANAE VENDITIONE SPEI | ("Envy: 'You entice those who seek wealth by the sale of a worthless hope'" [<persName>C. W.

               <p>This obverse differs from obverse 10 (below) only slightly: the specified interest rate of 10% is changed to 4%; the date, if it was not 1717, was altered too. The capital of the West Indies Company was subscribed by tendering government debt; this debt was then surrendered to the government which then guaranteed the Company a 4% return on face value in perpetuity. Because MIT X PRO CENT ZU or a 10% interest rate was incorrect, it stands to reason that obverse 8 came first in the progression, its rarity (only a single example is known) suggesting that the error was discovered almost immediately. Although the remainder of the motto is identical to the wording on obverse 10, the position of the letters is quite different, confirming that obverse 8 was a distinct die whose fate was to be discarded as opposed to reworked. <hi rend="italic">Reverse D.</hi> In thirteen lines: SO | VERSICHERTS | LAWS | UND SPRICHT: | DIESES GLAUB ICH | ANDERS NICHT⋅ | MANCHER | DOCH MIT THOMA | SPRICHT: | ICH GLAUB ES | NOCH LANGE | NICHT ⋅| 1720⋅ ("So Law assures us and speaks: I believe this and nothing else; many another, however, says with [doubting Saint] Thomas, 'I do not yet believe it by a long measure. 1720".

               <p>With great insight, <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> ties the obverse and reverse inscriptions together as follows: "The last three lines on the obverse, seemingly refer to, and should be read after the reverse, which is a song or verse of two responsive couplets; the two lines of each ending spricht and nicht alternately: in the first, Law asserts that the shares are to pay good interest; while in the second, the doubters express their dissent from this proposition. 'In the end it will be seen which song has the true ring'—i.e., Law's words or those of the doubters" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 36).</p>

               <p>1720. <persName>Wermuth</persName> quotes only the first part of verse 9 from the Luther translation: "But they that will be rich fall into temptation..." These words would be enough in an age of constant bible reading to bring to mind the rest of the two verses: "... and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition; 10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows" (1 Timothy 6: 9–10; King James version). The sentiment expressed by this reverse is more judgmental than the preceding and, hence, we place it after Reverse D in the sequence.</p>

This latter seems to refer to high returns being achieved by Law's System, but the defecating man connotes the gross materialism inherent in acquiring such wealth. The expression "Nooit breekt ijser" actually means "Iron never breaks" <hi rend="italic">(nooit</hi> is Dutch for "never"); the proper phrase, "Necessity breaks iron", is "Nood breekt ijzer". Although <persName>Wermuth</persName> knew enough Dutch to include a common Dutch idiom on his medal, his lack of command of the language led him to substitute the incorrect <hi rend="italic">nooit</hi> for <hi rend="italic">nood;</hi> of course, use of the correct word would have complicated matters further by making his chronogram senseless. The author depicts the System as a mixture of good and evil. The chronogram adds up to 1720, although it can be confusing to people not familiar with the Dutch alphabet. In Dutch, the diphthong "Y" is considered equivalent to "IJ", so the three "Ys" in the chronogram stand for six Roman numeral "Is".</p>

The lower left blade is spewing ACTIEN (shares); the lower right blade emits coins.</p>
               <p>This design is an amazingly perceptive rendition of Law's complicated system. With a very small amount of capital (gold pieces), Law sets in motion an apparatus that sucks in <hi rend="italic">billets</hi> (the government debt that is exchanged for Banque Royale's equity) and, further, causes people to sell their jewelry, with the proceeds thereof likewise sucked into purchasing stock. With the capital thus attracted, the Banque issues a large volume of its own notes (<hi rend="italic">actien</hi>) and earns large profits (the coins) on its net interest income.<ref target="#CH4-n6">

               <p>The windmill is also a play upon contemporary words for defrauding the money market by drawing bills of exchange in a circular arrangement, called in Dutch <hi rend="italic">Windnegotie</hi> (wind negotiations). A draws on B, B draws on C, and C draws on A, thus creating credit by the mere float of the outstanding bills of exchange.

               <p>The following seven medals are dated 1720 but, from the inscriptions, it is clear that they were made later in the year after the bubble had burst. Armed with the clarity of hindsight, the authors are alternately brutal and humorous in their treatment of the subject. Not restrained by uncertainty, they pummel the target.</p>

He depicts Law in the full regalia of court dress: cocked hat, flowing wig, and an elaborate coat with an impressive decoration (a Maltese cross, which <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> identifies as possibly the French Order of the Holy Spirit, the Saint Esprit), (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 31n). In his right hand he cradles a package labeled ACTIEN (shares) and BILLETS (notes). The facial features of the portrait include the eyes set deep below arched brows and a nose that is large even by monarchical standards. Here, then, is the epitome of power and greed. The legend reinforces the majesty of Law's person.

("Because the world wishes to be deceived and no longer has any desire for lotteries, so one creates shares here, there, and everywhere, which the present-day world desires, 1720"). The first four words, "Kwia muntus fuld tezibi" is a phonetic approximation of the Latin phrase, "Quia mundus vult decipi" ("because the world wishes to be deceived"). The phrase first appears in Sebastian Brant's <hi rend="italic">Ship of Fools</hi> of 1494; it was used by the sixteenth-century papal legate Caraffa, later Pope Paul IV, in the phrase, "Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur" ("the world wishes to be deceived, therefore it will be deceived").</p>

As interests mounted, the bourse was moved to Rue Quicampoix, a narrow street soon congested with traffic as speculators flocked to the site.

There seems no doubt that this was from a different die" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 33), and he assigns it his no. 5. Given that the sources cited by <persName>Alexi</persName> (Borchmann 1763; Hauschild 1806) were ancient ones and that no example has turned up

since, I am inclined to believe that the piece is apocryphal. <persName>Wermuth</persName> made medals to order, and the uninspired design of reverse M seems unlikely to have stimulated enough demand to have needed a replacement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Obverse 19.</hi> On the following piece, <persName>Wermuth</persName> accomplishes his satire without use of images. He begins by giving a grand introduction: PARIS-| MISSISIPPISCHER-| ACTIEN | GENERAL-DIRECTOR | EST, EST, | LAWS | SCOTUS EDENBURGICUS⋅| MERCATOR | MONETARIUS | INTRICATISSIMUS | BANQUIER &amp; GENERAL-| CONTROLLED | FINANCIER | TRES-RAFFINÉ | MDCCXX.

                  </ref> Despite his skills and titles, <persName>John Law</persName> is now penniless. This conclusion is not wholly accurate, but because he never sold any Mississippi shares, Law did lose most of his fortune.</p>

               <p>At first reading, the obverse and reverse inscriptions seem clever but not profound. However, if these words are put into the context of monarchical government prevalent in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255148">Europe</placeName> three hundred years ago, their boldness becomes apparent: Law is established as an important agent of the Crown if not the power of the Crown itself, following which the provocative statement that all Frenchmen are mad.

<pb n="46"/>
more formal than is the case with other satirical medals in the series. However, it can now be said with certainty that both pieces are the work of Christian <persName>Wermuth</persName>: our number 24 is listed by <persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> (<persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> 1992: 370), who, in turn, derived her listings from the author's <hi rend="italic">Specificationes</hi>, or catalogues of designs for sale. Because not all of the medals offered by <persName>Wermuth</persName> were his own, solid reinforcing evidence is supplied by the fact that numbers 24 and 25 are punch-linked to others of <persName>Wermuth's</persName>
                  <persName>John Law</persName> designs.</p>
               <p>Accepting that these pieces are the work of <persName>Wermuth</persName>, the more challenging problem is to explain the change in style. By cutting a massive rim featuring three concentric circles that, in turn, are amplified by an inner, corded circle, the author is stating the importance of what is contained within these rings. That content, described below, is worth all of the study that a patient numismatist may want to devote to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Obverse 20.</hi> To the left is a half-draped woman lying on a chaise. On the table next to her are two glasses and a flask. Facing the woman is a man in a wheelchair, his crutches (or her crutches) and slippers on the floor; the man's head is bandaged; he wears an invalid's robe. Behind them a female figure representing Nemesis, sword in right hand and lighted torch in left, exits stage right. Legend at the top: SVSTINE, | VEL | ABSTINE! ("sustain or abstain", i.e., "hold on or let go", or in Wall Street parlance, "put up or shut up") (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 42).</p>

The chronogram gives the date 1720 [<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 43]). This translation lacks eloquence but, given the seemingly random mixture of Latin and German words, it is extremely difficult to read the author's exact intent. Another attempt at translation is, "When you have damages yourself, it is not necessary to mock those who need nursing themselves." <persName>B. Betts</persName> identifies the reclining woman as "a nearly nude female" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 42).</p>
               <p>If the scene is to be as important as its impressive frame, the female can only be <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> and, therefore, the seated figure in the wheelchair with crutches is <persName>John Law</persName>. Nemesis moves away to the right, having dealt out a severe dose of misfortune. Because she is lying down and is less dressed, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> is even sicker than Law, who can at least sit up with arms folded. Perhaps the author is saying: "things are so bad they can't get worse".</p>

[<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 44]). Law did suffer from gout, but these biting words damn the entire ruling structure as perpetual drunkards. It would be stretching things to call this medal a temperance piece, yet it clearly mocks the French Court's penchant for the grape.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> sees a conspiracy taking place: "Two soldiers of the guard, each with battle-axe and sword, are standing facing each other; the one on the left, about to commence his rounds, holds his hat before his face in token of secresy; the other, with his hat under his arm, his term of duty being ended, holds in his hand behind him a bag of money; he is repeating to the new-comer the watchword, and a hint that if he is discreet, he also may have money when his turn comes to be relieved" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 58). Inscribed above: GELD IST DIE LOSUNG ("Money is the watchword"). The term "Losung" has multiple meanings in this context, so the statement can also be read as "Money is the answer" or "Money is the solution". Below: ABER ("But....")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Reverse T.</hi> A sad old man standing in court dress points with his right hand to an uplifted purse in his left; coins are falling out of the purse from a hole in the bottom. Legend above: WIE'S KOMMT SO GEHT'S. ("As it comes, so it goes"). Below in two lines: NULLA BLEIBT | ÜBRIG. ("Nothing remains left over"). The style is similar to that of <persName>Wermuth</persName>, even to the phrase GELD IST DIE LOSUNG, also used in a 1707 design (see S-11 below). However, the letter placement is more careless than one would expect from a master. Even so, Bruno Kirschner unhesitatingly attributes this piece to <persName>Wermuth</persName>, but cites no authority for his attribution. He places the piece in his series of Jewish satirical medals, but concedes that the fit is a loose one (although the beard, the hat, and the antique garb of the old man were standard depictions of Jews in this period). We think that the fit is very loose indeed given

that <persName>Wermuth</persName> could convey biting anti-Semitism when he chose but has not done so here. Our rationale for maintaining this medal in the <persName>John Law</persName> series is that the themes embodied in the inscriptions fit very well with postBubble sentiment. Nonetheless, the notion that "money is the solution" is too universal to be attributed to any category with certainty, especially when a date is lacking.</p>

The meaning of the inscriptions, both obverse and reverse, are quite clear, but other interpretations of the imagery could be made. Designs that cause the numismatist to stop and ponder contribute to the charm of the series.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">30.</hi> This is prototypical Christian <persName>Wermuth</persName>—a crude design wrapped in a labyrinth of wit. The wit is not easily deciphered; in the eloquent words of the editors of <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>, "It is clearly impossible to give a rendering of the legends and the inscriptions on these pieces... the 'Latin is anything but Latin... the inscriptions were composed by one ignorant of the language or are wrong by intention" (<persName>C. W. Betts</persName> 1894: 61n). To the present author, the grammar and spelling may be execrable, but the meaning seems pungently clear.</p>

Betts</persName> 1907: 44). <persName>Grueber</persName> describes Melac as "a French general and field marshal, who commanded in Germany in the war of 1689, and was noted for slaughtering the inhabitants...." (<persName>Grueber</persName> 1904–11: commentary on plate 144). The outside line contains a chronogram for 1720, the inside line for 1721, thus placing this medal toward the end of series.</p>
               <p>On and below the bust: ERGO IEAN LAW⋅| HIC NIHIL | EXPECTES⋅("Therefore, <persName>John Law</persName>, you should expect nothing here"). <persName>Wermuth</persName> saved some of the best for last because the comparison of Law's impact on personal finances with Melac's destruction in the Palatinate is a devastating one. Authors who composed such biting commentary did well to remain anonymous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Reverse V.</hi> Legend above: <hi rend="smallcaps">LaVs tIbI et IMpostor CorVos eLVDIs hIantes</hi> ("Praise to you Law, impostor that you are; you have escaped the open mouths of the ravens. The date 1720 is expressed in chronogram" [<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 45]). Then follows an eighteen-line inscription, pregnant with subtleties, in Latin as follows: ITA | ACTVM EST | CVM IIS QVI | AVGENDAE PECVNIA CAVSA | ACTIORVM NOMINE | CHARTAS CAPTABANT PECUNIATAS | LITTERATA CHARTAE OSORES | INGNIOSAE PECUNIAE CONTEMTOR | PRO AVCTO TANDEM ACTVS CENSV | CREDITORVM CENSVRAM | PRO PECVNIA CHARTAS | PRO LAQVEARIB⋅ LAQVEOS HABENT | ET DVM PAVLVM NON | SED SAVLVM AVDIVNT | IVDAM SEQVNTVR | ET CVM HOC FIVNT | LITTERA | LONGA⋅ <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> makes a literal translation: "so it is all over with those who, for the sake of increasing their wealth, sought after moneyed papers, under the name of shares. Now they are haters of the lettered paper [literary papers]. Despisers of honest money, at last, instead of increased wealth, they have the censure of their creditors; instead of good money, they have only paper; instead of fretted [paneled] ceilings, they have halters; and while listening not to Paul (as they suppose) but to Saul, they are following Judas, and with him they will become a long letter," i.e., they will be hung (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907:46).</p>
               <p>Although <persName>Wermuth</persName> uses a lot of words to make the point that paper money is evil, he wraps his message in delicate shades of meaning that are well described by the editors of <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>: "It is not possible in a translation to give the contrasts in sound of the Latin words; but the following may properly be noted. ACTVM is used for its similarity with Actien, the word denoting stocks; PECVNIATAS CHARTAS, moneyed papers, i. e. bank bills, is contrasted with LITTERATA[S] CHARTAS, lettered papers, i. e. books;
<pb n="51"/>
... PRO AVCTO CENSV, literally, 'instead of an increased rating of property,' where census, 'the rating,' is contrasted with censure. LAQVEARIB[US] 'paneled ceilings,' as adornments of a palace, contrasted with LAQVEOS, 'snares,' and alluding to the duty of rich men, as declared by <persName>St. Paul</persName> to <persName>Timothy</persName>...which is also hinted at in the next line of the inscription, DVM PAVLVM, etc. LITTERA LONGA, i. e. the letter I is used as an emblem of the body of Judas, who hung himself...'' SAVL seems to have a double meaning and is probably an anagram of LAVS [i.e., Law, in French], and finally, LAVS TIBI in the outer legend are the first words of the introit which precedes the reading of the gospel in the service of the [Roman Catholic] church (<persName>C. W. Betts</persName> 1894: 70).</p>
               <p>The reference to ravens in the outer legend was explained by <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName>: "I was for a long time sorely puzzled as to the meaning of Law's fortunate escape from the ravens.... The central design in plate No. 20 of 'Het Groote Tafeerel der Dwaasheid,' seems to solve the riddle. It apparently refers to an attack of insanity with which Law was threatened in March, 1720, as shown by the following extract from a letter of Lord Stair (the English Ambassador)... 'Law's head is so heated that he does not sleep at night.... He gets out of bed almost every night, and runs stark, staring mad about the room..."' (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907:46). Why eighteenth-century Europeans connected ravens with insanity is obscure, but the linkage was well accepted.</p>
               <p>We quote at length to help modern collectors to understand the richness of the verbiage employed. Whereas <persName>Wermuth's</persName>
                  <persName>John Law</persName> medals are ephemeral commentary—few people today doubt the utility of paper money—they provided the well-educated people of those times with humor that could be savored at leisure and which rewarded the time invested in deciphering the message. The contrast between the aesthetics of the medal and the quality of its contents is extreme. The irony implicit in that contrast is, no doubt, part of the satire.</p>

The spacing of the letters argues for separation and, if so, the general sense of the periphery would be: "In shares of the Mississippi Company and its bank notes, the System has all that remains." For the field: "The French have told, and we all have told (the story); the Englishman and the Dutchman, and (the people of) Frankfort, Nuremberg, Hamburg and Augsburg, and those who have thought over their losses, are advised to be silent" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 45–46). The text on this reverse clearly is more cautious in tone than our next number, a clue which could be used to place it either before or after in the sequence.

               <p>In the verses cited, the sentiments that Paul expresses to Timothy are varied. Verse 6 avers that religion or goodness brings riches to those who are content with what they have. Verse 10 raises the familiar refrain that money is the root of all evil. Verses 17 through 19 warn the rich not to look down upon the poor, emphasize that money is untrustworthy and that sharing is the way to create capital. In the King James Version, the verses read:</p>
               <p>6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.</p>
               <p>7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</p>
               <p>8 And having food and raiment let us therewith be content.</p>
               <p>9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</p>
               <p>10 For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The following list of associated medals falls into three categories. The first, comprised of S-1 and S-2, contains candidates for inclusion in the regular list. However we have seen examples of neither design, nor have previous authors on the subject. Since the inscriptions lack direct reference to <persName>John Law</persName>, the pieces must go on probation until specimens are available for direct examination.</p>
            <p>The second category, comprised of S-3 through S-6, consists of near relatives to the <persName>John Law</persName> series. The final category, our numbers S-7 through S-18, have been listed by one or more previous writers but, in our opinion, incorrectly so. We include them to provide continuity, as well as out of a sense of nostalgia.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="bold">S-1.</hi> The following piece is listed as part of lot 688 in the Montagu Sale of 24 May 1897. To our knowledge, it or its like has not appeared as a <persName>John Law</persName> medal since that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Obverse.</hi> Legend not given. Described by Sotheby's as "an escutcheon with following arms, two Scotsmen at sides of a coffer, emptying water out of a vessel" (Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge 1892:112).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Reverse.</hi> "MANN SEZT. SICH. NICHT. FVR. MAAS. &amp; etc." ("They place no amount nor limit on....").</p>
            <p>The primary argument in favor of this piece is the reverse motto, which is shared with our numbers 9 and 13. However, it could not be from the same die because the diameter is different from either of the foregoing. Also supportive is its inclusion in the <persName>John Law</persName> series by the distinguished Mr. Montagu.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the cataloguing by Sotheby's is terse, omitting obverse motto, full reverse motto, reasons why the figures are Scotsmen, and any interpretation of the scene depicted. This century-old puzzle will be resolved only with the appearance of another specimen or by the discovery of this same design in another series.</p>

            <p>By inference, both collectors accepted this medal as part of the <persName>John Law</persName> series. Nonetheless, neither Craige nor Ford had access to a great deal of material now available. As with S-1, it will be necessary to examine an original specimen in light of this new material before a more certain classification can be made.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">S-3.</hi> This piece qualifies as "associated" in that two renowned numismatists have included it in the series. Jacques Schulman, in cataloguing the <persName>Fernand David</persName> Collection (Schulman 1930), describes lot 274 as a "satirical medal on <persName>John Law</persName> and the Mississippi Company." Lot 274 is struck in silver but lots 275, 276, 276a, and 277 contain no less than seven specimens in bronze and one in pewter. Thus, our S-3 is relatively common, especially compared to the five previous <persName>John Law</persName> medals in the David sale, which the cataloguer rates as rare to very rare.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> lists this medal as his number 37, although he is quick to point out that it does not belong to the series. He cites a note in the American Journal of Numismatics quoting Alphonse de Witte, which reveals the following: "This medal was struck in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> towards the close of the reign of <persName corresp="#viaf_268675767">Louis XIV</persName>, as the decoration for a Society of the gay courtiers of that monarch, who called themselves 'The Regiment de la Calotte' [Regiment of the Skullcap].... This Society proposed to reform the customs and the style of their time by turning everything into ridicule" (<hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1889: 88).</p>
            <p>Obverse. "Folly facing, enthroned amidst the clouds, holding in his left hand a fool's bauble. He wears a crown and the traditional costume of the Court fool,—the slashed doublet with bells on its points" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 66–69).

               <hi rend="bold">S-4.</hi> The following piece was submitted by Ms. <persName>C. J. M. Schulman-Ruhé</persName> of Laurens <persName>Schulman B.V</persName>. It does not refer to <persName>John Law</persName> directly, but it is of the period (1720) and celebrates thankfulness for limitations on stock trading outside the capital of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2750405">Holland</placeName>. Presumably, these limitations spared the Dutch from a Mississippi Bubble and/or a South Sea Bubble in their country. However, Arthur Cole estimates that illicit stock offerings in smaller cities outside Amsterdam cost the populace 350,000,000 guilders (Cole 1949:46). Dutch investors were not as sober as this medal implies.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">S-5.</hi> In modern times, this medal has been the source of some confusion. In its sale of 3 December 1980, lot 306, Sotheby's catalogues the piece as commemorating the Banque Générale (founded by <persName>John Law</persName> in 1716). The same specimen was re-offered in LaRivière III (15–17 March 2001) lot 2045, where the cataloguer adopts Sotheby's attribution.</p>
            <p>There is no obvious link between this design and the Banque Générale. Indeed, <persName corresp="#viaf_72486">Louis XV</persName>, who is depicted on the obverse, had declined very specifically (via the regent's council) any participation in the enterprise. Further, <persName>John Law's</persName> institution was founded in order to lessen the country's dependence on gold and other specie, not to celebrate precious metal, as the reverse motto would appear to do.</p>
            <p>Though seemingly simple, the reverse motto—AMAT AUREA CONDERE SAECLA—is susceptible to various translations. Two of our well-educated
<pb n="58"/>
peers rendered it as follows: "He who loves to live long golden years"<ref target="#CH5-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> and "exalted king creates the golden age(s)"<ref target="#CH5-n2">

               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The need to speculate on the purpose of the medal or the intended translation of its motto is eliminated by reference to earlier sources. Nicolas Godonnesche and G. R. Fleurimont assembled a series of prints of reverse designs on <persName corresp="#viaf_72486">Louis XV</persName> medals, dedicating it to the king sometime before the latter's death. They call this particular design "Le Bonheur de la <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>" ("The Happiness of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>"), translating its motto as "C'est elle qui fait les Siecles d'Or" (Godonnesche and Fleurimont 1748?) ("It is she who brings the golden centuries").</p>
            <p>A somewhat later source, <hi rend="italic">Médailles françaises au Musée Monétaire</hi> (1892), also describes the subject being commemorated as "Le Bonheur de la <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>," giving the identical translation of the motto. However, this listing of the reverse has a different obverse, which we describe under S-6 below. <hi rend="italic">Obverse.</hi> Bust of a very young <persName corresp="#viaf_72486">Louis XV</persName> in classical costume with laurel wreath.

            <p>Numbers S-7 through S-18 were all executed by Christian <persName>Wermuth</persName>. They are dated variously 1699, 1701, 1702, 1707, and 1736; none is dated 1720. Notwithstanding the lack of a "proper" date, <persName>Alexi</persName>, both Bettses, and <persName>Grueber</persName> all include one or more of these twelve in their respective lists. That this group of worthies could have been lured into making mistakes is quite understandable: the style is reminiscent of other Law medals, added to which the mottoes—CREDIT ist MAUßE-TODT ("credit is as dead as a mouse"), BANQVERODT ist A LA MODE ("bankruptcy is fashionable") and WEXEL BRIEFE ("letters of exchange")—all reference a financial theme.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Alexi</persName> asterisks the date MDCCI, explaining in a footnote: "Ein Stempelfehler, soll 1720 heissen" ("a mistake in the die, should be 1720") (<persName>Alexi</persName> 1885: 63n). <persName corresp="#viaf_36547176">Charles Wyllys Betts</persName> is of like mind: "MDCCI (an error in the die for MDCCXX)" (<persName>C. W. Betts</persName> 1894: 60). <persName>Grueber's</persName> rationalization is slightly different: having declared that our S-7 was struck upon Law's flight from <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, he opines "Across the waist of Law is inscribed the incomplete date MDCC..." (<persName>Grueber</persName> 1904–11: description for plate 144 no. 14).</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_73342574">Benjamin Betts</persName> lists more die combinations from this group—seven compared to four for <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>, two for <persName>Alexi</persName>, and one for <persName>Grueber</persName>. Perhaps because he had seen more pieces, he was more suspicious. While including these designs in his list out of deference to earlier authors, he notes, "Of course, if the dates upon the medals are correctly engraved, they antedate the advent of Law by several years, and the pieces must be excluded" (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 56n). It is all well and good to attribute evidence that doesn't fit to an engraver's error. However, this explanation begins to run thin when, as happens with this grouping of medals, an obverse dated 1702 is married with a reverse whose date in chronogram is 1736. Just as the explanation runs thin, so too does Betts's deference to earlier authorities. Under a later number in his list, he adds the following footnote: "<persName>Alexi</persName>... had not seen the original, but followed an earlier authority, and our assignment rests solely on his
<pb n="60"/>
opinion; but the dates on both the dies have no reference whatever to the downfall of the System, so that the correctness of his judgment seems to be questionable, to say the least. Indeed, these seven pieces... seem rather to belong to the class of tokens known as spiel-marks or game counters..." (<persName>B. Betts</persName> 1907: 57). From time to time, Christian <persName>Wermuth</persName> issued <hi rend="italic">Specificationes</hi> (what we call "catalogues") from which his agents could order medals currently in stock. In the Specificatio of 1698, the design entitled "Credit ist Maußetodt" first appears (<persName>Wermuth</persName> 1698). Clearly, this design has nothing to do with <persName>John Law</persName>. Nor do the subsequent "engravers errors". Nor does any one of the dozen die combinations that we will list below. Rather, these pieces emanate from <persName>Wermuth's</persName> whimsical using, reusing, and reworking of his die inventory over a period of four decades.</p>
            <p>It should also be noted that the <hi rend="italic">Specificatio</hi> of 1698 makes CREDIT IST MAUßETODT the obverse and BANQUERODT IST A LA MODE the reverse of the piece, as do subsequent <hi rend="italic">Specificationes.</hi> Not having access to this source of information, <persName>C. W. Betts</persName>, <persName>B. Betts</persName>, <persName>Alexi</persName>, and <persName>Grueber</persName> all grant BANQVERODT the honor of the obverse position, probably because this side bears the date.</p>
            <p>Our list contains twelve distinct varieties. Doubtless there are more, such as the piece in the 1698 <hi rend="italic">Specificatio</hi> that we have never seen. In order to import some clarity to a confusing mélange, we will affix Roman numerals to the obverses and small letters to the reverses.</p>

The full text of this verse in Jeremiah in the Vulgate is: "Et curabant contritionem filiae populi mei cum ignominia, dicentes: Pax, pax: et non erat pax." The King <persName>James</persName> translation reads: "They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, 'Peace, peace; when there is no peace."' As so often, <persName>Wermuth</persName> misquotes his source, partly to save space, partly to make a more compact summary of the original text, and partly, also, because he was a slave of his chronograms.</p>
            <p>In the field in nine lines: * 2 * | SCHAV | PFENNIG | GROSCHEN. | FIAT | IVSTITIA | AVT | PEREAT | MVNDVS * ("Commemorative medalet. Let justice be done or the world will perish.")

The proper quotation is, "Let justice be done even though the world should perish", privileging justice above all other qualities; it was a favorite motto of the Holy Roman Emperor <persName>Ferdinand I</persName> (1556–64).</p>
            <p>This die differs from others in that it is dentillated around the periphery and sloppily executed overall. Perhaps <persName>Wermuth</persName> handed the task to an apprentice; perhaps he was just getting old.</p>

By the end of the year 1694, this busy engraver owned a house complete with domestic staff as well as a valuable coin collection (<persName>Wohlfahrt</persName> 1992: 19). However, the poem can be read also as not a complaint of poverty, but a reminder to his customers that in a time of scarce credit, <persName>Wermuth</persName> expected to be paid in good hard money for his medals.</p>
