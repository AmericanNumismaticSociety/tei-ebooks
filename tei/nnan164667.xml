            <p> Money of the American Confederation Period was the subject of the eleventh Coinage of the Americas Conference, sponsored annually by the
                    American Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing Council as a
                    forum for the dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of <placeName>North and South America</placeName> . </p>
            <p> The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present
                    papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all who have an
                    interest in the topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants travelling to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> area to come to know the Society's collections and library better during the days
                    surrounding the conference. </p>
            <p> A number of special exhibits were mounted on the theme of COAC 1995 and remained on view at the Society for several months. Two exhibits
                    featured material from the Society's collection: a survey of <placeName>U.S.</placeName> made counterfeit halfpence and a special display
                    of medals of the Confederation period. Individual exhibitors included <persName>Daniel Freidus</persName> ( <placeName>Vermonts</placeName> ) and <persName>Mike Ringo</persName> (counterfeits of the period); on display also were important items from the
                    Donald Groves Collection. </p>

            </head>
            <p> It is with great pleasure that I introduce the papers delivered at the 1995 Coinage of the Americas Conference. This was the eleventh such
                    annual event, first gathered in 1984, for the expressed purpose of presenting an in-depth focus on a specific topic in American numismatics.
                    The 1995 program, "Coinage of the American Confederation Period," embraces a brief but extremely active numismatic era in American history.
                    We are not just concerned with coins as a metallic medium of exchange, but rather we visualize numismatics as an eclectic science which
                    draws upon history, politics, economics, art, biography, linguistics, metallurgy, physics and chemistry. Without doubt, the papers in these
                        <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> reflect this broader definition of numismatics as we explore the diverse coinages current in the
                    Confederation period. </p>
            <p> The Confederation period was a time of change and challenge as the young, recently freed country, strove to establish its own national
                    identity. The new nation had no currency of its own and of necessity continued to rely on the same foreign coins which had freely circulated
                    here since the earliest colonial times. As a consequence of the economic stagnation which followed the Revolution, the country was crippled
                    by a major post-war depression when all gold and silver virtually disappeared from commerce. In distinct contrast, the small change medium
                    remained abundantly stocked with token coppers, especially counterfeit English halfpence which had been in circulation for years. As a
                    reaction against these many spurious light weight coins, several states minted their own good quality, token coppers during the
                    Confederation period with the expectation that popular rejection of the light weight, inferior <pb n="x"/> issues would drive them from
                    circulation. For this reason, the many state copper which enrich the numismatics of this period came into being. </p>
            <p> These <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> are a collection of papers which describe several aspects of the profuse coinage minted in the
                    period after the Revolution and prior to the establishment of the Federal <placeName>mint</placeName> ; to 1993, some 693 different die
                    varieties of domestic coppers have been identified with the list ever expanding as new discoveries are made. <ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
                    The immense variety and sheer numbers of Confederation coppers have stimulated much attention and research, and rightly so. Investigators
                    have been hampered and frustrated in their efforts since there are no surviving artifacts used in the manufacture of these coins. Thus, all
                    our information must be extrapolated from the examination of the existing coins themselves and from literary evidence published in
                    contemporary newspaper accounts and other documents. But this lack of immediately available data should not deter us from the continued
                    pursuit of information about this numismatic era. Many years ago, <persName>Damon G. Douglas</persName> , well known for his research
                    into the Fugio cents, stated it very succinctly. "The copper coinages of that critical period in American history, the first decade after
                    the Revolution, still present unexhausted fields for fruitful research." <ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p> Thus, there are many challenges before us for continued numismatic research but we must remain humble in the fact that we do not have all
                    the answers about these intriguing coinages. I believe it is safe to say that there is more that we don't know than we do know. As a result,
                    investigators must possess the wisdom to separate appealing speculation and unsubstantiated numismatic tradition from confirmed fact. In
                    regard to Confederation coppers, except for a few notable exceptions, we know painfully little about the mints, the mintmasters, their
                    business associates and practices, and just how the money entered circulation. I expect that new genealogical discoveries and documentary
                    evidence will disclose important clues as to the lives and activities of some of the individuals whose roles in these Confederation coinages
                    have remained enigmatic. There are still untapped literary sources yet to be discovered, as exemplified in these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> by <persName>Eric Newman's</persName> identity of the party responsible for the Nova Constellatio tokens. <placeName>Mint</placeName> attributions for many of these coppers are still unsettled; in the past, many mints were assigned based solely
                    on the basis of deductive reasoning, some of whose logic has collapsed under closer scrutiny. Newer technology such as computer image
                    enhancement, improved photography, and high energy, <pb n="xi"/> non-destructive, planchet analysis may assume a leading role in deciphering
                    some of these mysteries. </p>
            <p> Numismatists in general are just beginning to appreciate the counterfeit English halfpence as the most prevalent copper of the period. This
                    new awareness has unfortunately spawned a temptation to view any crude counterfeit English halfpenny as an American product based on no
                    firmer evidence than a rough appearance. While there is literary evidence to support American "blacksmith" type counterfeits, <ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> we cannot identify them as to type and it remains inaccurate to assign every barbarous counterfeit halfpence to
                    this side of the Atlantic. Contemporary newspaper accounts <ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> reveal that local entrepreneurs did cast
                    counterfeit halfpence which, by their nature, leave no telltale evidence as to site of origin. Thus, many cast counterfeit halfpence found
                    in this country today may well be of domestic origin, a fact we can neither prove nor disprove. Except for the proven <persName>Machin's</persName> Mills imitations, it becomes problematic to designate other struck counterfeit halfpence as American when one considers
                    the sophisticated and complicated infrastructure required to mint coppers. The sheer magnitude of such an operation to smelt ore, to
                    prepare, roll, and anneal planchets, to engrave dies, and to strike coins, would have been a major business venture available to but a few
                    in pre-industrial <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . But these considerations should not deter one from
                    continued inquiry into the counterfeit English halfpence, both domestic and imported. In fact, two important papers in these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> deal with these fascinating, but humble, coppers, coins whose importance is just now earning recognition
                    as important players in early American numismatics. </p>
            <p> Another interesting American series, generally of English origin but contemporary to the Confederation period, includes the Washington
                    pieces. While these tokens enjoyed no official status, it was obvious that many circulated. We are pleased to have a complete catalogue of
                    Washingtonia by <persName>George Fuld</persName> included in these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> . </p>
            <p> To this point the emphasis has been placed on the money circulating between the end of the Revolution and the advent of the Federal <placeName>mint</placeName> . Whereas the coins in our cabinets today are the survivors of the economy of those times, we have another body
                    of contemporary history documented by the medals struck to commemorate significant events of the period. As <persName>Frederic H.
                        Betts</persName> wrote in the introduction to his brother's posthumously published book, "One is to look upon a cabinet of Medals 'as a
                    treasure, not of money, but of knowledge'... ." <ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> With the sensitivity that the <pb n="xii"/> holistic approach
                    to the study of numismatics includes an appreciation of all the events and factors that shaped the history of the era under study, <persName>Alan M. Stahl</persName> has provided us an inventory of the <hi rend="italic">Comitia Americana</hi> medals authorized by
                    Congress to honor the heroes of pre-Federal <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . </p>
            <p> I wish to thank all the participants in this year's Coinage of the Americas Conference for their contributions of time, effort, and
                    knowledge. The editorial assistance I received in preparation of these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> from <persName>James C.
                        Spilman</persName> and <persName>Michael Hodder</persName> is gratefully acknowledged. Finally, we all express our gratitude to the
                    staff of the American Numismatic Society for making this symposium possible as a medium through which we can share our interest in this
                    fascinating and engaging period of American history with numismatists everywhere. </p>

               <p> The American Confederation, extending from 1781 until 1789, can be considered the period of our national adolescence. These seven years
                        spanned the time frame between our emergence as a nation from the cocoon of infant colonialism until our start on the road to maturity
                        as a Federal Republic. It was a "betweentimes" when our country went through all the growing pains expected from a post-pubescent,
                        gangly teenager, such as the evolution of character and self-reliance, the development of trusting relationships with peers, and the
                        assumption of adult responsibility. It is the monetary history of this fascinating epoch which is the focus of this year's Coinage of
                        the Americas Conference. <ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p> One cannot speak of the Confederation period as an isolated historical event but rather one must consider the prior experience of
                        colonialism which shaped our nation's adolescent personality. From 1607, with the first permanent settlement in <placeName>Jamestown</placeName> , until 1749, with the settlement by the English military of the garrison at <placeName>Halifax</placeName> ,
                        14 British colonies were founded on the <placeName>North American mainland</placeName> . These colonies were very different in
                        composition and character from one another with distinct economic, geographic and climatic diversity. In the North, the economy was
                        dominated by forest products, fishing and small farms, whereas in the South, large plantations worked by slaves were scattered over the
                        countryside. The population was generally concentrated in cities along the eastern seaboard. Beyond these coastal communities,
                        occasional towns and villages of a few dozen houses punctuated the largely forested and rural landscape. Travel, communication, and
                        commerce between the colonies, except by sea, was very difficult and tedious. Roads were poor or nonexistent; even in the best of
                        conditions the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> to <placeName>Boston</placeName> stagecoach could
                        make only 40 miles a day traveling from three in the morning to ten at night. <ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> Rarely did people stray more
                        than 20 miles from their birthplace. The population was largely of English extraction, generally illiterate, and lived on farms at a
                        subsistence level of economy. <ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref>
                  <placeName>British North America</placeName> was not a single country but rather a collection of "several distinct regional
                        economies, most of them tied more closely to Great Britain than to each other... ." These "regional differences among the colonies were
                        so sharp and ties between them so weak that it is misleading to speak of an 'American economy' or an 'American population' early in the
                        colonial period." <ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="3"/>
               <p> Moreover the governments were dissimilar; only <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> were
                        true republics where all public officials were elected by the people. In three others— <placeName>Pennsylvania, Delaware</placeName>
                        and <placeName>Maryland</placeName> —the lords proprietary selected the governors; and in the remaining nine (including <placeName>Nova Scotia</placeName> ), the governor was appointed by the monarch. The varied political structure of the colonies
                        notwithstanding, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> looked on these North American plantations in the same
                        way. The natural resources and economic development of every colony were to be regulated from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> and any potential profits were to be directed toward increasing the wealth and power of the
                        mother country under a system called <hi rend="italic">mercantilism.</hi> To this end, a series of restrictive laws was passed by
                        Parliament, collectively known as the Acts of Trade and Navigation, which were designed to ensure that the colonial economies remained
                        subservient to that of the mother country and that English interests were protected. However onerous these controls might appear at
                        first glance, the colonies also benefited from membership in the British Empire with a large free-trading area, naval protection, easy
                        credit, and restricted foreign competition. The negative aspects of mercantilism included suppressed colonial manufacturing, restricted
                        foreign markets, and the export of earned specie to pay for manufactured necessities and luxuries. <ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p> From 1689 to 1763, the colonies became entangled in the North American extension of a series of European conflicts as continental
                        governments continued a ceaseless drive for power. <placeName>England's</placeName> war machinery was fueled to a large part by raw
                        materials from <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> , consistent with its mercantilist policies. In
                        addition, Parliament expected that the colonies would bear some of the financial burden of the so-called French and Indian Wars. <ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p> Until 1763, the Navigation Acts had little practical impact on the colonies since they were largely ignored or effectively circumvented
                        by experienced smugglers. In spite of these restrictive laws on the books, the local economies expanded and prospered. But, with the
                        peace following the final French and Indian War, the scene changed. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> , in
                        1763, had now emerged as the most powerful nation in <placeName>Europe</placeName> , but with a massive war debt. To bolster its
                        economy and recoup its strength, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> now turned its attention across the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> with renewed vigor and began to enforce the old Acts of Trade and Navigation in an attempt to squeeze
                        from their plantations all their natural wealth. <persName>George III</persName> and his Tory government looked on the colonies not
                        as political communities but simply as chartered companies and crown possessions where any freedoms or popular assembly existed only at
                        the king's pleasure. For the first <pb n="4"/> time, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> stationed a permanent
                        standing army in the colonies which was three times larger than that deployed on the battle front during wartime. It was evident that
                        the presence of such troops was intended "to control rather than to protect." <ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <p> Parliament passed even more unpopular laws which were designed to benefit English rather than colonial interests. As if this increased
                        control was not bad enough, the colonial economies were crippled by an oppressive post-war depression when foreign trade and revenue
                        from exports virtually ceased. The use of paper money in the colonies, which since 1690 had been helpful in financing local initiatives,
                        was severely regulated in 1751 and again in 1764 by laws specifically engineered to ensure that English merchants be paid in hard
                        currency rather than unstable paper. Parliament, still operating under the tenants of mercantilism, was always ready to manipulate the
                        colonies for <placeName>England's</placeName> benefit but rarely inclined to assist their overseas dominions for their sake alone.
                        Now sugar, tea and other imports were heavily taxed as an additional revenue measure. If it had been enforceable, the Stamp Act would
                        have severely encumbered all local enterprises. Common law rights to trial by peers in the colonies were abrogated. Taxation without
                        representation became the rallying cry as the Stamp Act Congress asserted that the colonists had the same native rights as all free
                        Englishmen. The maturing colonies had outgrown their dependence on <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and
                        resented this increased control over their lives which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> was now exerting in
                        the postwar period after 1763. Unfortunately the British government "lacked the wisdom and the political genius" to recognize the
                        liberties of its overseas citizens as defined and protected under the English Constitution and blindly perceived no need to reconfigure
                        their imperial organization to accommodate these natural freedoms. The colonies did have some vocal support in Parliament, notably from
                            <persName>William Pitt</persName> and <persName>Edmund Burke</persName> . <persName>Pitt's</persName> advocacy was
                        duly acknowledged by a medallet struck in his honor. While <persName>George III</persName> interpreted the rebellious actions of
                        the colonists as "insufferable disobedience" "requiring disciplining," <persName>Pitt</persName> , in his wisdom, recognized that
                        if violence ever erupted, any peaceful resolution or reconciliation would be difficult. His conciliatory efforts were constantly
                        thwarted by a king dominated Tory Parliament. Push came to shove on April 19, 1775, at the Battles of <placeName>Lexington</placeName> and <placeName>Concord</placeName> when the British attempted to seize colonial munitions. A skirmish escalated
                        into a full fledged war just as Pitt had predicted. By the summer of 1776, there was no vestige of royal authority in any of the
                        colonies which had become openly hostile toward all forms of centralized power. Their basic conflict was not <pb n="5"/> primarily to
                        gain political and economic independence from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> but rather the colonists
                        wished to retain those historical freedoms of free Englishmen which they had enjoyed from the beginning and now were threatened by an
                        insensitive and autocratic monarchy and Tory Parliament. <ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> While many colonial Tories remained loyal and
                        hoped for a reconciliation, other factions pressed for complete autonomy. <ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p> This is an incomplete thumbnail sketch of the economic and political scene in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North
                            America</placeName> at the outbreak of the Revolution, a conflict whose causes were multifactoral and cannot be explain ed by any single
                        circumstance. All of a sudden a unique situation was at hand in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> .
                        For the first time, 13 diverse, suspicious, self-sufficient colonies were forced into a position where they had to cooperate with one
                        another to repel a tyranny which would have destroyed them individually. It was an easy task to burn the midnight oil and draft a
                        Declaration of Independence which asserted their autonomy from an oppressive metropolitan regime. But after this proclamation which
                        severed the bonds of colonialism was signed, sealed and delivered, these 13 colonies, who had had minimal prior interaction, still
                        viewed each other with such mistrust they could come to no immediate consensus as to how they would govern themselves. It took until
                        March 1781 for them to agree upon a form of self-rule which was set forth in the Articles of Confederation. And even after this polity
                        was drafted, it was not ratified until just seven months before Cornwallis surrendered. </p>
               <p> The Articles of Confederation were conceived as an instrument to bind the states in a firm league of friendship, but it did not
                        establish a single nation. The collective states under the Articles of Confederation were unwilling to abdicate to a central government
                        any more authority than they were willing to accept from their colonial masters. The financial, foreign policy and war powers set forth
                        in the Articles of Confederation were jealously guarded by the states since nine votes out of thirteen were required for passage of most
                        measures. While the individual states did retain the sole authority to levy taxes, they did agree to share with Congress the parallel
                        authority to establish a mint and emit paper money. To finance the war effort, the states were unwilling to assert their prerogative and
                        levy taxes, but instead pursued an alternative solution with a printing press and issued reams of unsecured paper money. Congress,
                        without any taxing authority, had no alternative but to circulate bills of credit very early in the war to meet government expenses. </p>
               <p> The monetary principles expressed in the Articles of Confederation reflected the paranoia which had been conditioned from years <pb n="6"/> of English control over colonial fiscal policy. Throughout the colonial experience, hard money supplies fluctuated depending
                        upon the strength of the individual colonial economies. Even at best, small denominational silver was always in demand for local trade.
                        During periods of war, when the export of raw materials and supplies was brisk, earned specie became more plentiful as the economy
                        prospered. These times of plenty were followed by cycles of postwar recession as the export market contracted and hard money became in
                        short supply as trade languished. During such intervals of economic slowdown, when circulating hard money was scant, alternative
                        solutions were devised to ensure adequate currency so that local commerce could continue. Such successful measures included the use of
                        wampum in the 1600s, the development of regulated commodity monies, the minting of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> silver, and
                        more commonly, the emission of paper currency by colonial governments either as unsecured bills of credit, as fiscal instruments backed
                        by the value of land, or notes emitted against anticipated tax receipts. </p>
               <p> During the Revolution, hard money was particularly scarce, driven out of circulation by an excess supply of depreciated, unsecured paper
                        money. Directly following the war, there was a sudden abundance of specie from those areas occupied by foreign troops who had been paid
                        in hard money. This surplus was short-lived since the country went on a buying-spree and soon the specie was returned to <placeName>Europe</placeName> to pay for many imported commodities and luxuries which had been in short supply during the war. As would
                        be anticipated from prior experience, in 1784 a devastating postwar depression followed the Revolution with effects which were nearly as
                        crippling to the country as those witnessed in 1929. <ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Exports faltered, credit was expensive, merchants
                        were burdened with a glut of unsaleable imported goods, hard money was just not available, and many experienced financial ruin. Barter,
                        as a medium of exchange, was revived in several areas; bankruptcies were commonplace. In <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> ,
                        returning war veterans, unpaid for their years of military service, were now obliged to meet their tax bills in non-existent hard
                        currency or face financial ruin with threats of foreclosure and debtors prison. An armed encounter between these disgruntled farmers in
                        western <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and the militia ensued in the notorious Shays's Rebellion. To the north, the state of
                            <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> itself was bankrupt and in other legislatures there was agitation for cheap paper money to
                        release citizens from the burden of personal debt. <ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>
               </p>
               <p> Some historians have characterized the postwar Confederation with such labels as "the critical period" <ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref>
                        of American history or <pb n="7"/> "the period of peril" <ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> since they speculated that the new nation was
                        on the brink of anarchy and dissolution. Another commented that Shays's Rebellion frightened <persName>George</persName>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> out of retirement into politics. <ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> At any
                        rate, the times were difficult. It did not take long to realize that this new government established under the Articles of Confederation
                        was completely inept to lead the emerging nation and the need to mend its multiple defects soon became evident. This would have been an
                        impossible task since a major flaw in the structure of this code required that any amendment must receive the unanimous approval of all
                        the states. Instead, the entire document was discarded in favor of the Constitution of 1787. This new Federal government has stood the
                        test of time, enduring now for more than 200 years. But this final union did not occur until the young nation resolved its serious
                        problems of adolescent bickering and mutual mistrust. With these internal conflicts dispelled, the 13 colonial infants could now emerge
                        "from many into one" and with this new spirit they launched themselves into young adulthood where united they faced the new and
                        different challenges of the next century. </p>

               <p> During the Revolution, the states and Continental Congress had resorted to bills of credit to finance the war but these notes rapidly
                        became valueless. Now in the postwar period, most legislatures witnessed an agitation to resume printing bills of credit so at least
                        there would be some form of currency for local commerce and the alleviation of private debt. Many states, having learned their lessons
                        from unsecured paper money during the war, resisted this temptation to solve their fiscal ills by notes unbacked by specie. Some of the
                        more successful paper that held its value did continue to circulate. </p>
               <p> As in the prior colonial period, dependency continued on Spanish and French gold and silver, Dutch silver and Portuguese gold. Since
                        there had been a chronic coin shortage in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> for many years, the export of
                        specie coins, even to its own overseas plantations, had always been forbidden. </p>

               <p> Nonetheless, this restriction was successfully circumvented and English gold and silver did make its way to this side of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> . The values of these diverse foreign currencies, in terms of local monies of account, were commonly
                        published in tables to assist the public in commercial transactions. <ref target="#fig-1">Fig. 1</ref> , printed in 1784 and
                        representative of such broadsides, is of particular interest since it also enumerates the value of English far things and halfpence in
                        relation to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> copper. <ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> Even into the early Federal period, after
                        the decimal system had been officially adopted, the states still continued to calculate the value of their coins in the old colonial
                        monies of account system denominated in pounds, shillings, and pence. Typical of such conversion tables is <ref target="#fig-2">fig.
                            2</ref> , published in 1793 by <persName>Samuel Sauer</persName> (Somer) of Germantown, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> , which reckoned the value of common specie coins of the day in the several colonial
                        monies of account as well as in terms of the new Federal denominations. <ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> Although the 1793 table is dated
                        after the Confederation Period, it was selected to demonstrate the concurrent use of the new Federal and old colonial notations, a
                        practice which continued well into the next century. The cyclical shortage of hard money previously described, while definitely
                        troublesome, did not necessarily suspend commerce since many large transactions, both local and overseas, could be satisfactorily
                        transacted using bills of exchange. <ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref>

               <p> The Spanish American milled dollar, first minted in <placeName>Mexico City</placeName> in 1535, was the most important silver coin on
                        this continent from the first settlements until the middle of the last century. Over its 351 year history, the eight reales piece
                        remained the world's silver standard due to its uniformity. Its fractional pieces, including the bits, levies, and picayunes, formed the
                        backbone of our silver small change medium. Although never recognized with legal tender status due to its lower silver content, the
                        pistareen, a debased two reales coin from mainland <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> , was another very
                        important player in our colonial and Confederation periods ( <ref target="#fig-3">fig. 3</ref> ). Spanish, Portuguese, English and
                        French gold commonly traded as high denominational <pb n="12"/> specie coins for the first 250 years of our history ( <ref target="#fig-4">fig. 4</ref> ). Since the early Federal Mint could not keep up with the demands of the coinage requirement for the
                            <placeName>United States</placeName> , these foreign gold and silver specie coins continued as legal tender in this country until

               </figure>
               <p> During the Confederation, the copper small change medium was plentiful in direct contrast to the hard coin money which was in short
                        supply during the devastating post-Revolutionary War depression. Whereas the circulating gold and silver money was from the countries
                        described above, the copper money was regal English since there was no prohibition against the export of Tower halfpence and farthings.
                        In fact, from 1695 to 1775, about 17% of the copper output from the <placeName>Tower Mint</placeName> was exported to the North
                        American colonies, amounting to some £69,000. In 1749 alone, 10 tons of cop- <pb n="13"/> pers, about a quarter of the year's production
                        of farthings and halfpence, were included in a large sum of money sent to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> by Parliament as
                        partial repayment of the debt incurred during the French and Indian Wars. The only legitimate copper of the Revolutionary period was the
                            <placeName>Virginia</placeName> halfpenny minted for the colony in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>
                        . These coppers were delivered just weeks before the War broke out and so were withheld from general circulation until hostilities
                        ceased ( <ref target="#fig-5">fig. 5</ref> ). </p>

                  <p> (b) This crude cast counterfeit (98.6 grains) is easily identified due to rough surfaces and the telltale cud above the kings head
                            where the metal was poured into the mold. It is smaller due to shrinking of the molten metal upon cooling. </p>
               </figure>
               <p> Since the currency value of regal English coppers was about double the intrinsic value of the metal plus the minting costs, significant
                        profits were available not only to the king but also to the counterfeiters who surfaced in great numbers to make their fortunes. These
                        clandestine forgers had little to fear from the authorities since the punishment, if apprehended, amounted to a virtual slap on the
                        wrist. At first bogus coppers were sand cast but soon these illegal operations began striking counterfeits in presses from engraved
                        dies. By 1753 in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> , it was estimated that about half the circulating copper
                        was counterfeit. The large numbers of regal English coppers, <pb n="14"/> sent legally to the colonies, were quickly followed by the
                        spurious ones. Soon commerce was flooded with these light weight, counterfeit issues which were accepted by a generally uncritical
                        public whose only concern was that they receive full value in commerce for their token coppers. The importation of these coppers,
                        interrupted by the Revolution, resumed again after the War and figured even more prominently during the Confederation (figs. <ref target="#fig-6">6</ref> , <ref target="#fig-7">7</ref> ). </p>

               <p> Since the counterfeit copper industry in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> was so profitable, as evidenced
                        by the vast numbers which circulated on both sides of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> , it was only natural for this illegal
                        activity to spread into British <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> . Original research on counterfeit
                            <persName>George III</persName> halfpence was presented in the symposium by <persName>Charles W. Smith</persName> . Many
                        counterfeit English halfpence of domestic manufacture have been identified, the largest source believed to have been <persName>Machin's</persName> Mills in <placeName>Newburgh, New York</placeName> ( <ref target="#fig-8">fig. 8</ref> ). Similarly, Irish
                        halfpence and farthings were extensively counterfeited. Both the false and regal issues were exported to <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> in large numbers as substantiated by a 1787 report from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> . In fact, 1781 and 1782 bogus Irish <pb n="15"/> halfpence were commonly used as
                        planchets for several <placeName>Vermont</placeName> state issues ( <ref target="#fig-9">fig. 9</ref> ). The exportation of these

               </figure>
               <p> In 1786, one estimate asserted that nearly half the coppers in circulation for the previous 20 to 30 years were counterfeit. The new
                        Articles of Confederation empowered both the state and national governments to coin money and, under this authority, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> in 1785, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> in 1786, and <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> in 1787 commenced to mint their own copper coinages with the expressed goal of ridding commerce of the vile,
                        base coppers, which were perceived as inflicting financial injury, especially upon the poor. The plan was to mint state authorized
                        coppers of consistent quality with the expectation that the citizens would only accept these new, true weight coppers while rejecting
                        the counterfeit halfpence which comprised the bulk of the money. </p>
               <p> Although not a member of the Confederation, <placeName>Vermont</placeName> also adopted the same practice in 1785 and issued its own
                        coppers. The early history of this republic and the background of its mint are the subject of a paper by <persName>Pete
                            Smith</persName> . The attractive landscape coppers, whose reverse motif is similar to the Nova Constellatio issues, were products of
                        the Rupert <placeName>mint</placeName> in 1785 and 1786. Later bust issues are thought to have been inspired or directly copied from
                            <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> designs. Certain bust right issues were struck over unnegotiable 1785 Nova Constellatio
                        coppers and counterfeit Irish halfpence. </p>
               <p> In 1786 the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> Assembly strove to improve the quality of the small change
                        medium by authorizing three million legal tender <pb n="16"/> coppers of 150 grains each, for which privilege the licensees would return
                        a 10% royalty to the state. The official contract was shared by two mints but several clandestine operations have also been identified
                        making a total of 139 <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> die varieties with a total combined coinage of
                        about four million pieces. The earlier issues from <placeName>Rahway</placeName> and <placeName>Morristown</placeName> were
                        typically of high quality but soon there appeared lighter weight coppers which discredited the integrity of the full weight coinage (
                            <ref target="#fig-10">fig. 10</ref> ). These inferior coppers included the 1788-dated issues attributed to <placeName>Morristown</placeName> and others, overstruck on light weight host coins, believed to be from <placeName>Elizabethtown</placeName> .
                        Recent work by Hodder has added much to our understanding of this complex series. <ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref>

               <p> There are 355 die varieties of <placeName>Connecticut state</placeName> coppers included within 26 distinct bust types dated from
                        1785 to 1788 with an estimated total production of about seven million. The only authorized mint was the Company for Coining Coppers of
                            <placeName>New Haven</placeName> which struck coppers from dies engraved by <persName>Abel Buell</persName> . Their
                        franchise may have passed legally to James Jarvis and Co. on June 1, 1787, who continued to <placeName>mint Connecticut</placeName>
                        coppers on stock designated for the Federal Fugio contract. Besides these two mints, at least five or six prolific clandestine
                        operations existed which increased their profit margin by ignoring the 5% royalty payable to the state and by minting coppers
                        considerably below the prescribed <pb n="17"/> 144 grains ( <ref target="#fig-11">fig. 11</ref> ). The end result was that the abundant
                        light weight counterfeit <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coppers just added to the glut of inferior coppers already in circulation
                        rather than to replace them with a proper coinage. Thus the attempt to rid commerce of light weight coppers only resulted in more
                        inferior coins being added to the copper medium which already was far larger than the economy required. <persName>James A.

               <p> In addition to the coppers actually minted by the several states already mentioned, many pattern issues were also struck during the
                        Confederation by competing contractors in anticipation that a coveted franchise would be awarded to the winner. Other issues during this
                        period include the familiar Immunis Columbia pieces and the several <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName>
                        coppers. <ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> Other speculative coinages were <pb n="18"/> urged for which no patterns were ever struck. Some

               <p> Numismatists have long observed the appearance of similar letter punches within the various state series, particularly noting those with
                        obvious flaws or breaks. It has been intriguing to speculate that such broken punches, when identified, belonged to an individual die
                        sinker. Thus, the temptation has evolved to treat these observed defects like the signature of the engraver and the attempt made to
                        assign a particular artist or <placeName>mint</placeName> of origin to many of the state issues described above. This approach has
                        not withstood the test of time and its deficiencies are reviewed in detail by <persName>John Lorenzo</persName> in regard to <persName>James Atlee</persName> and the broken "A" letter punch. </p>
               <p> Soon after the peace treaty, a large number of copper tokens arrived in this country from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> which circulated widely. These Nova Constellatio coppers were lighter than the state issues yet to come and were
                        frequently used as host coins on which to overstrike <placeName>Vermont, Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers. <persName>Eric P. Newman</persName> has newly discovered facts
                        concerning these important coppers. Another large series of tokens dated from 1783 to 1795, primarily of English origin and collectively
                        termed the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> coppers, appeared immediately after the Revolution. <persName>George Fuld</persName> has prepared an extensive study of the Washingtonia minted during the Confederation period. </p>
               <p> We have seen how the state mints failed to drive the light weight counterfeit coppers out of circulation and in most cases just
                        contributed to the plethora of inferior coins. So, as one might expect, when the Federal government tried its hand at the same game, it
                        also failed miserably. The Fugio coppers, the first United Stated authorized coin, were minted under a contract awarded to <persName>James Jarvis</persName> , the minter of most of the 1787 <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> series ( <ref target="#fig-13">fig. 13</ref> ). Only a small percentage of the authorized amount was ever minted and these were released in the
                        summer of 1789 in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> at a <pb n="19"/> time known as the Coppers Panic
                        when coppers ceased to circulate, an episode in the numismatic history of the Confederation worth noting. </p>

               <p> In 1789, the nation still remained in the clutches of a serious postwar depression. Although earned money from exports was scarce and
                        there was a dearth of circulating specie, the small change medium was still flooded with inferior grade coppers. Merchants were
                        overwhelmed with large quantities of this mostly counterfeit, token coinage, which were only negotiable in small sums. It had no legal
                        tender status, it could not be exchanged for gold or silver; in short, no one wanted it. In the summer of 1789, public confidence in
                        this token copper medium collapsed and overnight the exchange rate plummeted from 20 to 48 coppers to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> shilling. It was an economic calamity for the poor whose entire wealth was invested
                        in this unstable medium. Copper coins were not even valued as scrap metal because the world price for copper had fallen to an all time
                        low. This coppers panic primarily involved the area within the economic orbit of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> and <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers
                        were received preferentially because of their legal tender status and soon traded again at 24 to the shilling. As the world price for
                        copper dramatically rose into the next decade, faith in copper coins returned and the once discredited issues were called back into
                        circulation while new ones were minted by the Federal government. </p>
               <p> In the meanwhile, the New Constitution of 1787 had been ratified since it was recognized that a more stable federal system would be
                        necessary if this new republic were to survive as a single country rather than as a collection of 13 bickering siblings. A priority on
                        the national agenda was to respond to the need for a standardized national currency. Included in this plan was the blueprint for a
                        Federal <placeName>Mint</placeName> which opened in 1793 to provide for the monetary needs of the new republic. It took several years
                        before the output <pb n="20"/> of the new Federal <placeName>Mint</placeName> could satisfy the demand for money and so foreign gold
                        and silver remained legal tender until 1857. In the interval, the state coppers and other pre-Federal coins and tokens took up the slack
                        in the small change medium and continued to circulate in some parts of the country as late as 1856. Many worn Confederation coppers
                        succumbed to a less noble fate and ended up as scrap metal for sleigh bells, buttons and frying pans. Other monetary changes were also
                        slow since old habits die hard. For many years people continued to calculate in the old colonial money of account notations of <hi rend="italic">£, s</hi> ., and <hi rend="italic">d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> This overview of Confederation coinages has been just that; a summary of the first episode of our national numismatic heritage.
                        Considering the economic and political complexities of the period, it becomes easy to understand the factors that gave rise to this vast
                        copper coinage which so enriched this era and continues to stimulate interest and research today. </p>

                            balance which is held by a third party. American merchant A has a credit balance with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> merchant A; American merchant B wants to buy some English goods from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> merchant B, but he has neither credit nor specie coin to send by ship.

               <p> Even the most casual collector is fascinated by a counterfeit coin. Perhaps part of this fascination is based upon the fact that a
                        counterfeit coin has a story to tell that goes far beyond government production quotes and conversion of moneys of account. It has a
                        personal component to its history and seems to struggle to speak out with an individual voice. I have often heard colleagues remark,
                        when inspecting a <persName>George</persName> III counterfeit halfpenny, "If only this coin could talk!" In my opinion, to a
                        certain extent, coins can tell us much about themselves if we ask the right questions and listen carefully and critically. <ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p> The purpose of this study is to look at the contemporary counterfeit <persName>George</persName> III halfpenny from a scientific
                        and statistical point of view. There exists a growing and exciting literature on both the taxonomy (classification by style and die
                        type) and socio-economic basis for the production of these counterfeit coins. <ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> Catalytic to these recent
                        studies is the continuous flow of excellent scholarship documented by the Proceedings volumes of the Coinage of the Americas Conference,
                        sponsored annually by the Ameican Numismatic Society, <hi rend="italic">ANS Museum Notes</hi> (now <hi rend="italic">American Journal of
                            Numismatics)</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Colonial Newsletter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> I became interested in the British <persName>George</persName> III contemporary counterfeit halfpenny series about ten years ago,
                        but it was only in 1992/93, when on sabbatical at the <placeName>University of Oxford</placeName> , that I began to look at this
                        series from a new perspective. In the summer of 1992, I was offered a number of counterfeit examples by a local coin dealer in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2640729">Oxford</placeName> . I mentioned to him that this coin series not only circulated in his
                        country, but it also circulated during the colonial and confederation periods in my country. An interesting conversation followed in
                        which he informed me that the most common date in the counterfeit series was 1775, but that was not the case for the regal series they
                        were imitating. He was also of the opinion that the counterfeits were substantially lighter in weight, on average, than the halfpence
                        produced by the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> . A cursory examination of my handful of coppers supported his observations. </p>
               <p> Compelled by scientific curiosity to get a more quantitative picture of the series, I approached a colleague in the Department of
                        Materials, where I was studying, to sponsor me for a library card (reader's ticket) for the numismatic library in the <placeName>Ashmolean Museum</placeName> , which he kindly did. For many weeks thereafter, I spent my spare time systematically going through the
                        numismatic literature <pb n="25"/> trying to answer the simple question, "Of the six years 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773, 1774, and 1775, what
                        is the relative frequency of occurrence of the counterfeit halfpence?" There were some tantalizing hints but apparently no one had
                        carried out a careful date analysis study <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> I found detailed information about the production of the series
                        by the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> , but mostly anecdotal information about the counterfeits. By mid-winter, my spare-time
                        interest had grown into a project. It had also expanded in scope to include a plan to assemble a collection of counterfeit examples
                        while in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> , and a comparative assembly collected back in the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> from sources not directly traceable to English sources. In addition, I soon came to realize there were
                        examples with dates outside the regal interval (1770-75), interesting questions on weight and size, and virtually no information on
                        elemental composition as it applies to mining and smelting sources. These topics address issues of production and distribution. Guided
                        by the old scientific adage, to measure is to know, I set out to try to find answers to this ever-growing list of questions. The results
                        of some of my studies are incorporated in this paper. </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Study Methodology</hi>
               </head>
               <p> Collecting, analyzing, and presenting data, in a broad sense, is what is meant by statistics. It is a very practical way to understand a
                        large population, by looking at a smaller sub-group of the population, called a sample. For instance, by shaking out a few piles of M
                        &amp; Ms from a bag, we can pretty much assure ourselves (infer from the sample) that the number of red M &amp; Ms in the bag is the
                        same as the number of green M &amp; Ms in the bag, even though we have not examined the entire contents of the bag (the population).
                        However, for the sample to be a fair representation of its population, care must be exercised in how the sample is taken. (We wouldn't
                        want to hire a color-blind M &amp; M statistician!) We also need to know whether the population we are sampling is biased. (Did someone
                        get to the bag before it was sampled and eat some of the green M &amp; Ms?) These are major issues in any statistical study and since we
                        know that a coin collection can be a highly biased group of examples, not at all characteristic of the general population from which it
                        was assembled, the challenges of using a fair sampling technique and assuring that the population is unbiased, are formidable. </p>
               <p> Collections, by their very nature, are assembled with specific goals in mind. I have a friend who collects shillings. It makes a
                        beautiful collection but it is certainly not representative of the general population of British coinage, or even the population of
                        British monarchs. <pb n="26"/> He also specializes in coins of <persName>Charles I</persName> and thus his shilling collection
                        incorporates this interest (is biased in this regard) and therefore does not evenly represent the population of all British shillings. </p>
               <p> To minimize both sampling error and population bias in this study, I have taken the following measures. First, I assembled a collection
                        of 300 counterfeit examples under controlled situations, sampled as fairly as I could—without regard to grade, date, or cost. I would
                        look at the <persName>George</persName> III counterfeits available at coin shops or market stalls throughout <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and I would either buy all that were offered or buy none. The point being, I did not pick
                        and choose by grade, date, or any other criteria. In addition I regularly purchased examples from two coin dealers who acquired large
                        lots for me using this all or none technique. The only criterion for rejecting examples was based upon damage, excessive corrosion or
                        coins with unreadable dates. Since I was interested in date analysis as well as weight and size, damaged coins (holed, bent, or deeply
                        pitted) were of no use. It took two years to assemble The Study Collection used for this project. At the same time, and in a similar
                        way, I put together a smaller collection of regal examples. </p>
               <p> I have also inventoried a medium size private English collection and a large private <placeName>U.S.</placeName> collection, each
                        assembled, to my satisfaction, in an unbiased manner. <ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p> Upon returning to the <placeName>U.S.,</placeName> I assembled an inventory of examples of <persName>George</persName> III
                        contemporary counterfeit halfpence with no known direct English sources. This was very difficult and after considering nearly 300 coins,
                        I have chosen to include 60 examples in this inventory. These include coins from the archaeological record (sites prior to 1857 in <placeName>northern New England</placeName> ), coins through bequest to historical societies (small groups with no systematic effort to
                        "round out" the holding), and purchased coins for which I was able to trace at least three owners in the <placeName>U.S.</placeName>
                        previous to me having no known mail order component to their collecting hobby, and no military service in <placeName>Europe</placeName> . </p>
               <p> A statistical study of these collections, as well as others, and a discussion of the elemental metallic composition of both counterfeit
                        and regal examples will be presented in the sections that follow. </p>

               </head>
               <p> We begin this section with a look at the regal production of <persName>George</persName> III halfpence. In response to both a lack
                        of sufficient silver coinage in circulation and "after <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> Tradesmen had
                        petitioned for a supply of new copper coin, in order to throw counterfeits out of circulation," <ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> resumed minting of copper in <pb n="27"/> 1770. This "Experiment of a Temporary Relief to the Public"
                            <ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> continued for six years. The output of halfpence from the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> during
                        this period, in long tons, was: 1770, 9.0; 1771, 55.0; 1772, 50.5; 1773, 39.7; 1774, 24.0; and 1775, 22.8 for a total of 200.95 long
                        tons. In terms of percentage of total production, the values are: 1770, 4.5%; 1771, 24.0%; 1772, 25.1%; 1773, 19.8%; 1774, 11.9% and
                        1775, 11.3%. These values are illustrated as a histogram in <ref target="#fig-14">fig. 1</ref> . We see from these numbers that the
                        regal production of <persName>George III</persName> halfpence was concentrated in the years 1771, 1772, and 1773, with over 70% of
                        the output during that period. </p>
               <p> We turn now to the date distribution of counterfeit <persName>George III</persName> halfpence with the same date range as the regal
                        issue, namely 1770-75. However, one must keep in mind that the date on a counterfeit coin represents only the earliest hypothetical date
                        of circulation and not necessarily its actual earliest date of circulation or its date of production. We will return to this point at
                        the end of this section. </p>
               <p> We first consider The Study Collection identified above. This is a medium size collection of 300 coins assembled in such a way as to
                        represent, as closely as practical, the extant population in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> today. The
                        distribution by date for The Study Collection is 1770, 4; 1771, 13; 1772, 10; 1773, 55; 1774, 51; 1775, 167 or by percent 1770, 1.3%;
                        1771, 4.3%; 1772, 3.3%; 1773, 18.3%; 1774, 17.0%; and 1775, 55.7%. These values are illustrated as a histogram in <ref target="#fig-15">fig. 2</ref> and stand in dramatic contrast to the regal production values in fig. 1, in at least two significant ways. The most
                        obvious difference is that over 50% of the counterfeit pieces are dated 1775. Secondly, nearly 90% of the counterfeit pieces are
                        concentrated in the last three dates. One, of course, might say that we should not expect the production of counterfeit examples to
                        correlate in any way with the production of regal examples. However, this is not what the merchants of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> had expected when they petitioned the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> for a new
                        coinage. They expected precisely the opposite effect, namely, that the new coinage would drive the counterfeit coinage from circulation!
                        This was definitely not what happened. </p>
               <p> Contemporary accounts of the profound extent of counterfeit production are numerous. <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> of Soho,
                        in a letter to <persName>Lord Hawkesbury</persName> dated April 14, 1789, states: <q> In the course of my journeys I observe that I
                            received upon an average two-thirds counterfeit halfpence for change at toll-gates, etc. and I believe the evil is carried into
                            circulation by the lowest class of manufacturers who pay with it the principal part of the wages of the poor people they employ.
                            They purchase from subterraneous coiners 36 shillings worth of copper (coins in nominal value) for 20 shillings, so that the profit
                            derived from the cheating is very large. </q>

               <p> In a letter to <persName>King George III</persName> , ca. 1800, the <placeName>Earl of Liverpool</placeName> writes: <q> It is
                            certain that the quantity of counterfeit copper coins greatly exceeds the quantity of legal copper coins: the Officers of the <placeName>Mint</placeName> were of the opinion, in the year 1787, that even then they exceeded the legal copper coins. Their
                            number has certainly increased ever since: the quality of these counterfeit copper coins is in truth beyond calculation. </q>
               </p>
               <p> To estimate the amount of counterfeit coinage in circulation, the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> examined a sample in 1787 and
                        found that only 8% had a tolerable resemblance to the kings coin, the remainder being characterized from blantantly inferior to trash.

               <p> The Study Collection requires no further description at this point. The large <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Private Collection (third
                        column) was put together over a 15-year period using English coin dealers as the source of examples. This collection was essentially set
                        aside as it was accumulated and only recently (July 1995) a systematic statistical analysis by date and weight was carried out. The date
                        distribution <pb n="31"/> of this collection stands in remarkable agreement with that of The Study Collection. </p>
               <p> The medium size English collection was inventoried in 1993 and was put together by a private collector over a period of about 10 years.
                        As can be seen, the date distribution of this collection is in good agreement with respect to the previous two collections. </p>
               <p> The <persName>Bramah</persName> Survey of 1929 is the name I give a "grab sample" of <persName>George</persName> III halfpence
                        described by <persName>Ernest Bramah</persName> . <ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> To get an estimate of the ratio of regal coins to
                        counterfeit coins and a distribution by date, <persName>Bramah</persName> states, without elaboration, "For sake of comparison an
                        analysis is here given of an assortment of the issue, got together promiscuously." Whatever "got together promiscuously" means, I
                        consider it a "grab sample" from the extant population in 1929 and include it in Table 1, feeling its historic uniqueness outweighs its
                        slightly less than scientific sampling methodology. The full details of The <persName>Bramah</persName> Survey are included as
                        Appendix A. This survey, given its sample size, is in good agreement with The Study Collection. </p>
               <p> The Yale Collection was inventoried by <persName>C. Wyllys Betts</persName> , and included as part of an address to the American
                        Numismatic and Archaeological Society in April 1886, entitled "Counterfeit Half Pence Current in the American Colonies and their Issue
                        from <placeName>Mints of Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Vermont</placeName> ." <ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> Three points
                        must be made clear to understand its inclusion in Table 1. First, the number of coins in the collection is not specified by Betts, only
                        the number of die varieties. Secondly, Betts, in discussing the Yale Collection states, "The Yale Collection, which is the chief source
                        of information on this subject (i.e., ca. 1886), contains counterfeits of the following dates...." Betts then enumerates the collection
                        by date but does not state that they are all British counterfeits. Third, we are not informed how the Yale Collection was put together,
                        that is, the sampling methodology employed. However, we see a remarkable agreement between the date distribution for the Yale Collection
                        and The Study Collection, especially when the size of the Yale Collection is taken into consideration. Thus I have included it in Table
                        1 for its unique and important historic perspective. </p>
               <p> The rightmost column in Table 1 is an inventory of the Defaced <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> Halfpenny
                        Hoard. Enumeration of the entire hoard, found in an archaeological site in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> in
                        1981, is described in Appendix B. The 129 dated <persName>George</persName> III counterfeit examples are included in Table 1. As
                        can be seen, Table 1 establishes the relative frequency, by date, for the British <persName>George</persName> III contemporary
                        halfpenny series. </p>
               <p> The Study Collection, as well as all the other collections, shows <pb n="32"/> 50% or more of the examples are dated 1775: a remarkable
                        result that invites interpretation. If we assume that the collections are fair samples of the population of coins produced, we are led
                        at once to at least two hypotheses: 1) either counterfeit coin production nearly tripled from 1774 to 1775 and then abruptly stopped;
                        or, 2) counterfeit coin production did not change substantially in 1775, but continued for several years employing the date 1775.
                        Several indications support the second hypothesis. If we imagine, for the moment, we are in charge of a mint making counterfeit coins
                        toward the end of 1775 or early in 1776 and our last reverse die finally fails, in order to continue production we must have new dies
                        cut. However, we do not know if the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> plans to produce coins dated 1776. (It is not even clear if the
                            <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> knew in 1775 if it would produce copper coins dated 1776.) We can order our new dies dated
                        1775, we can request a die design that hedges the issue by using a 5 that looks like a 6, or we can speculate and order dies with the
                        new year, 1776. In fact, it appears all three options were exercised. </p>
               <p> Counterfeit halfpence dated 1776 are only about one-half as scarce as those dated 1770 (discussed below). Far more common are examples
                        with a 5 that looks like a 6, as illustrated in <ref target="#fig-16">fig. 3</ref> . Here the top bar of the 5 is tilted up and the base
                        of the 5 curls around until it almost, but not quite, forms a closed loop. This leads one to ask, if the production of counterfeit
                        halfpence did continue past 1775, then when did production cease? There does not seem to be a definite answer to this question but, as
                        can be seen from <ref target="#fig-17">fig. 4</ref> , dies with the date 1775 were still being used as late as 1797! Fig. 4 shows a
                        counterfeit <persName>George III</persName> halfpenny struck over an English token ( <placeName>Middlesex</placeName> 363,
                        J.Palmer/Mail Coach) <ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref> of 1797. These overstrikes are quite scarce (perhaps less than 12 known) but
                        nonetheless provide a vivid example of the fact that the date on a counterfeit coin does not indicate its year of production. </p>

               <p> With the substantial number of coins represented in the first three collections listed in Table 1 (about 2,000 examples), one can form a
                        reasonable impression of the types and relative frequency of coin production errors. Of the 205 error coins examined, the most frequent
                        error, 39%, is the double strike. This type of error occurs, as the name implies, when a struck coin is not fully ejected from the press
                        and the dies are brought together again, making a second impression on the coin. Brockages account for 29% of the error examples. A
                        brockage occurs when a struck coin is not ejected from the press, but a blank is fed in and struck between one of the dies and the
                        previously struck coin. </p>

               <p> Reverse brockages are nearly twice as frequent as obverse brockages, 63% compared to 37%, respectively. This may indicate that it was
                        common practice to load the coin press with the reverse die on the bottom and the obverse die on top. Thus, when a coin is struck but
                        not ejected, because it sticks unseen to the upper die, it presents its reverse to the next blank fed in, with the reverse die facing
                        the other side of the blank from below. Remarkably, 90% of all brockages examined were full brockages, meaning the blank is fully
                        registered over the lower die. This might indicate that some type of blank centering fixture was employed in the press feed technology
                        and as long as the initial coin remains stuck to the die, a full brockage results. This is further borne out by the fact that off-center
                        strikes are unusual, accounting for only 6% of all production errors. In counting off-center strikes, I did not include examples less
                        that 5% off-center, assuming that amount of misalignment was probably within contemporary production standards. Incomplete blanks or
                        clipped examples account for about 10% of all production errors. This results if the operator of the blank cutter fails to advance the
                        copper sheet more than a full blank diameter or unknowingly reaches the end or the edge of the sheet. A menagerie of multiple errors,
                        uniface examples, tab or edge pinches, and a few triple strikes make up the remainder of the error types. I was quite surprised to find
                        five press loading errors: four examples of coins with an obverse on both sides from two different dies (not a brockage, but two fully
                        struck obverse impressions) and one double reverse example, with each die dated 1771. </p>
               <p> The above analysis, expressed as percentages, is based upon a population of 205 error examples. However, it would be inaccurate to
                        conclude that because I examined about 2,000 coins, one coin in ten is a production error. Collectors tend to hold on to novel examples
                        and even actively seek them out. Since I had control of the sampling methodology for The Study Collection, it is only from that source
                        that I can venture an estimate of absolute error frequency. Of the 300 coins in The Study Collection, eleven are error examples: four
                        double strikes, three off-centers, two brockages, and two incomplete blanks for an absolute frequency estimation of about 4%. </p>
               <p> Using the dated examples of error coins, one can test the hypothesis that the generation of an error coin is an accidental happenstance.
                        Another way of saying this is if the hypotheses is true that the generation of an error coin is a random event, then the percentage of
                        error coins, by date, should track with the percentage <pb n="36"/> of all coins by date. Using the dated double strikes, off-centers,
                        and brockages, this hypothesis does appear to be true: 1770, 0%; 1771, 10%; 1772, 2%; 1773, 15%; 1774, 18%; and 1775, 55%; from a sample
                        size of 152 dated errors. (Of the 205 error coins 152 were dated; all obverse brockages, and several off-centers and double strikes were
                        without date impressions.) The match to the percentages in Table 1 for the population as a whole is not perfect, but for the small
                        sample size it is still very good. The year 1771 stands out as errorful. This might be a consequence of the fact that, although
                        counterfeiting of <persName>George III</persName> halfpenny series began in 1770, large scale counterfeit operations lagged by
                        about a year, based on the number of die varieties and extant examples from 1771 as compared to 1770. Thus technical problems associated
                        with enhanced production first showed up in 1771. </p>
               <p> It should be noted that I have not included die cutting errors, such as misspelled legends, reversed letters, etc. in the above error
                        analysis. Unlike a double strike or an off-center, each of which is unique, a miscut die produces innumerable identical examples. This
                        type of error must be analyzed using entirely different statistical techniques than those employed in this project. A study of this type
                        is planned. </p>

               <p> One can see that as the practice of counterfeiting continued, lighter examples were accepted by merchants and tolerated by consumers.
                        The trend to lighter coppers continued beyond the <persName>George</persName> III halfpenny series into the remaining decades of
                        the eighteenth century with the proliferation of all types of commercial tokens as well as the evasive halfpenny series, the latter
                        being of even lighter weight on average than the 1775 counterfeits. <ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p> At first glance it might seem to be a simple matter of careful measurement to determine whether a smaller than average blank or thinner
                        than average sheet stock was employed in making a light weight coin. However, the thickness of a coin, considering the various aspects
                        of the design, is not a well defined concept and the diameter of the blank is not the same as the diameter of the coin produced from it.
                        In fact, coins struck without a collar, as the <persName>George</persName> III, 1770-75 <persName>halfpenny</persName> series
                        was, are not round. </p>
               <p> Metal movement during striking depends upon the coin design, among other factors. The metal in the field areas of the design, where the
                        dies come closest together, is pushed radially outward more than in areas of high relief, like the device area. On a weakly struck coin,
                        one can often see this effect in that the roller marks from the sheet mill on the undisturbed surface of the blank at the bust area show
                        a rough, pocked texture, even though the field areas are smoothly struck. Thus, unless the coin design is concentric on both obverse and
                        reverse, coins struck without a collar are not round. The Fugio series, having essentially concentric designs on both obverse and
                        reverse, tend to be round although struck without a collar. Coins of the <persName>George</persName> III, 1770-75 <persName>halfpenny</persName> series are wider than they are high. That is, when held with the date horizontal, the horizontal
                        diameter of the coin is larger than its vertical diameter by as much as several percent. This is because the field areas on both obverse
                        and reverse are oriented left/right and the metal pushes out more in the horizontal direction than it does in the vertical direction.
                        The extent to which this noncircularity takes place depends upon the operating pressure of the coin press and the softness of the blank,
                        but the direction is determined by the coin's design. The softness of copper can be controlled during coin production. Mechanical
                        working of copper, called work hardening, for example while drawing an ingot into a bar or rolling a bar into a sheet, makes it harder.
                        Heating the copper, called annealing, resoftens it. A bar of copper might be annealed several times during processing to make the sheet
                        from which the blanks are punched. Since punching is easier to carry out with hardened copper, the sheet is not annealed during the
                        final stage of rolling just prior to blanking. The blanks are annealed before striking to soften the copper in order to help assure a
                        well-defined image. </p>

               <p> If short cuts are taken, like infrequent annealing, cracks, delaminations, and shallow strikes result and inferior coins are produced. </p>
               <p> We now consider the hypothesis that counterfeiters used inferior production equipment and naive technologies as compared to the
                        equipment and technologies used by the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> . These technologies might include, but are not limited to,
                        inferior coin presses resulting in reduced and irreproducible striking pressure and improper annealing procedures during rolling,
                        blanking, and before striking. To test this hypothesis let us consider two pairs of correlation plots. </p>
               <p>
                  <ref target="#fig-18">Fig. 5</ref> shows a correlation plot of the weight of each coin in The Study Collection against its corresponding
                        vertical diameter, i.e., its size. We see, not surprisingly, a strong correlation between weight and size. The interesting feature in
                        this figure is that the solid circles are examples dated 1775, while the open circles are examples dated 1770-74. Note that the lighter
                        1775 coins are smaller. If coiners were unable to control the rolling process, producing copper sheet of varying thickness from edge to
                        edge or from sheet to sheet, we might expect far more scatter of the data and little correlation between size and weight, even when
                        smaller diameter blank cutters were employed. The solid diamonds in this figure show the correlation of weight versus vertical diameter
                        for a small collection of regal examples. Even though the weight range of the regal examples is narrower than that of the counterfeits,
                        the scatter in the size is essentially the same. This scatter is a measure of the variability of the production process and this figure
                        implies, among other things, that the technical level of the counterfeiters in controlling their rolling technologies was comparable to
                        that of the <placeName>Royal Mint's</placeName> ability to control its rolling technologies. I assumed in this analysis that the
                        production of blank cutter tools, being a straightforward lathe operation, was completely controlled as far as choosing the diameter of
                        the cutter is concerned. </p>
               <p>
                  <ref target="#fig-19">Fig. 6</ref> shows a correlation plot of the weight of each coin against its corresponding noncircularity.
                        Noncircularity is defined as the ratio of the difference between the horizontal diameter and the vertical diameter, to the vertical
                        diameter, expressed as a percent. Again, the 1775 examples are shown as solid circles and the 1770-74 examples are shown as open
                        circles. Weight and noncircularity are not as correlated as weight and size. Here the scatter is a measure of the variability of press
                        pressure and adherence to the practice of annealing the blanks prior to striking. The solid diamonds in this <pb n="41"/> figure show
                        the correlation of weight versus noncircularity for regal examples. We see a narrower weight range for the regal examples but
                        essentially the same scatter in noncircularity. This implies that the ability of the counterfeiters to control their press and annealing
                        technologies was similar to the <placeName>Royal Mint's</placeName> control of their press and annealing technologies. Thus the
                        hypothesis that the counterfeiters used inferior production equipment and naive technologies is apparently not supported by extant coin
                        samples. It also suggests that the lighter coins were intentionally manufactured lighter as production of counterfeit coins continued
                        through the latter part of the eighteenth century in what appears to be well-controlled and systematic use of production technologies. </p>
               <p> Because the various counterfeiting operations were not necessarily coordinated, there was no attempt to work within a specified range of
                        size or weight, beyond what would be accepted into circulation. <placeName>The Royal Mint</placeName> did a much better job in this
                        regard, adhering well to a prespecified weight range, 140.9-167.9 grain; average 153.4 grain and size range, nominally 28.5 mm-30.0 mm;
                        average 29.1 mm. In all other respects the counterfeiters appear to have been technically as skilled and perhaps as well equipped as the
                            <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> . To quote <persName>C. Wilson Peck</persName> , discussing facsimile <persName>George III</persName> counterfeit halfpence, "...it is a fatal mistake to judge a specimen solely on its general appearance, as the
                        workmanship and weight of some of the counterfeits are almost as good as the genuine ones and it is only by comparing the details (of
                        the designs) that the spurious piece is discovered." <ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref>

               </head>
               <p> As described above, a small inventory of counterfeit examples was assembled in the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> from sources with no
                        known direct English connections. The operative word here is direct. One would like to think, that by being sufficiently careful in
                        sampling, a collection so assembled would represent examples of counterfeit <persName>George III</persName> halfpence that actually
                        circulated in <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
                        centuries. No doubt some examples in the inventory fall into that category but it is not clear what fraction of the inventory they
                        represent and thus it would be naive to label the entire inventory as such. These coins are simply a collection assembled using a
                        different sampling technique; the history of each coin being scrutinized as far back as practical to verify the criterion "not <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> from English sources." This stands in contrast to the random sampling technique employed in assembling
                        The Study Collection from verified English sources. It also represents <pb n="42"/> a collection assembled from a different population
                        of extant coins. </p>
               <p> In both <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> these coins circulated for several decades. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> ,
                        contemporary records tell us that attempts were made to pull counterfeit coppers out of circulation. However, these efforts were not
                        very successful and, because copper coinage was essential for small scale commerce, from 1814 onward, the <placeName>Royal
                            Mint</placeName> agreed to accept at face value the 1719-75 issues of contemporary counterfeits "as could not be excluded without skilled
                        scrutiny." <ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> In <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> these coppers were
                        circulating along with state coppers. <persName>Crosby</persName> , in discussing coppers circulating in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , notes "A very great number of pieces in imitation of British
                        halfpence...generally called by the name <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> Coppers...are made there and imported in casks under the
                        name of HardWare or wrought copper." <ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref>
               </p>
               <p> The purpose of assembling a collection in the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> , using this type of controlled sampling, was to determine
                        if it would somehow differ from The Study Collection assembled directly from English sources. One might expect that it would differ, but
                        how it differs and to what extent, are the major issues of interest. It could be argued that since the ultimate source of these coppers
                        is, after all, English manufactories, the population would not differ significantly in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> once released into circulation. However, one
                        must test this hypothesis in order to know and, as can be seen from Table 3, nothing could be further from the truth. </p>

               <p> At least two major differences exist between these collections. Perhaps the most significant being the larger percentage of 1771
                        examples in the "U.S. Collection"; the other being the reduced <pb n="43"/> representation of 1775 examples. (The exchange of the order
                        of 1773 and 1774 examples in frequency of occurrence is probably not statistically significant in a population this size.) </p>
               <p> To understand the reasons for these differences is a challenge, however some historic issues may bear on this puzzle. On the one hand we
                        know that in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> the production of counterfeits accelerated in 1771, following
                        commencement of the <persName>George III</persName> halfpenny series in 1770. We also know that new laws regarding counterfeiting
                        were passed in that year under Statute 11, <persName>George III</persName> , Chapter 40, page 231, stating that coining of false
                        copper money, once punishable as a misdemeanor, was now deemed a felony. Punishment was also extended to buyers and sellers of
                        counterfeit coins. </p>
               <q> If any person after 24th June 1771, shall buy, sell, take, receive, pay or put off any counterfeit copper coin, not melted down or cut
                        in pieces, at or for a lower rate or value than the same by its denomination, imports, or was counterfeited for, he shall be adjudged
                        guilty of felony. <ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref>
               </q>
               <p> It is quite possible that, at least temporarily, the combined effects of a substantial upturn in production accompanied by new laws
                        attempting to govern trafficking may have resulted in increased export to <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North
                            America</placeName> . It was not until 1798 that a law was passed explicitly forbidding export (Statute 38 <persName>George
                            III</persName> , Chapter 67, page 81, 1798, "false coin, including copper, could not be exported or put on board any ship"). The extent
                        to which these two events enhanced export activity is yet to be fully documented. </p>
               <p> We are certain that a profound decrease in export occurred in 1775, and for a considerable period thereafter, as the War for
                        Independence brought the mercantile economy of the colonies to an abrupt halt. This may account for the reduced percentage of examples
                        with this date in the "U.S. Collection." </p>
               <p> For completeness, I should add that regal halfpence and farthings were scarce in North American commerce. Bad money drove out good and
                        regal coinage of all denominations was taken back to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> at every opportunity.
                        Furthermore, the farthing as a denomination had no North American counterpart (except for limited production of the half cent in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> ) and apparently did not circulate here in any meaningful way. <ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref>

                        completely lost if they had been included in the statistical analysis by date above. Furthermore, because of their relatively small
                        sample size, a statistical analysis by date of this population would carry little validity. Fortunately, for small subpopulations of
                        this type, analysis can proceed using the technique of comparative evaluation. For this purpose I have chosen the least frequent date,
                        1770, as the basis for comparison, giving it a value of 100. Thus a coin outside the regal interval which occurs one fourth as
                        frequently as counterfeit coins dated 1770, would have a comparative rarity of 25%. </p>
               <p> We begin by defining the population of <persName>George III</persName> counterfeits to which this comparative rarity analysis will
                        be applied. This is most easily done by exclusion. Since certain well-defined numismatic populations stand separate from the topic of
                        this study, they should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be included. These groups are the <persName>Mould-Atlee Tory</persName> Coppers
                        dated 1771, 1772, 1774, 1775, 1776 and 1777, the Machins Mills Coppers dated 1776, 1778, 1787, 1788 (and of course the <placeName>Connecticut and New York</placeName> mules in this series which do not have the Britannia reverse), and the <placeName>Bungtown</placeName> Coppers dated 1784 and 1786. <ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref>
               </p>
               <p> The results of the comparative rarity analysis are shown in Table 4. Overspecification is avoided by using broad comparative rarity
                        ranges. </p>

               <p> It should be mentioned that an explicit study of the dates 1781 and 1785 has been carried out by <persName>Eric P.
                            Newman</persName> . <ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref> My studies support his conclusion in that I did not find a single example dated 1785
                        in any of the private or museum collections I examined in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> . The date 1781
                        is found both in English and American collections. </p>
               <p> I am fairly sure that other dates will be added to Table 4. Any omissions are purely the result of the limited nature of this study and
                        the collections that I have thus far inventoried. </p>
               <p> It is difficult to draw any strong conclusions from Table 4 but a few points of interest should be noted. The dates 1776 and 1777 were
                        discussed above as possibly stemming from the incorrect assumption by counterfeiters that the 1770-75 series would continue. The date
                        1781 coincides with the resumption of striking of Irish <persName>George</persName> III halfpence by the <placeName>Royal
                            Mint</placeName> after a five year lapse and perhaps anticipation that the British series would resume resulted in an output of
                        counterfeits with that date. Some evasive coppers are also dated 1781. For the less frequently occurring dates, I have no explanation
                        beyond the remarkable tolerance of a large sector of the population to offer and accept coppers without regard to design detail. <ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref>

                  <hi rend="bold">Coin Composition and the Melting Hypothesis</hi>
               </head>
               <p> It is not difficult to find opinions in the numismatic literature, some rather strongly stated, that counterfeit halfpence are
                        frequently encountered in copper of inferior quality, that is, highly impure or intentionally debased. In this section I will show that
                        this is not the case and discuss some of the possible reasons why. It is certainly true that many examples come to us in a very poor
                        state of preservation, perhaps from having been in the ground for a long period of time. Moreover, there is no lack of examples with
                        delamination flaws and occasional silicaceous inclusions, but these are not primarily debasement issues. </p>
               <p> I have had the opportunity to measure the elemental composition of both regal and counterfeit <persName>George</persName> III
                        halfpence using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and I have found that the vast majority of the counterfeit examples measured were not
                        only of good quality copper, but over 60% were, for all practical purposes, the same quality copper as the regal examples measured.
                        However, having said that, I do not wish to give the impression that the analysis of elemental composition is a simple task or that my
                        studies in this area, at the time of this writing, are complete. </p>
               <pb n="46"/>
               <p> I became interested in the elemental composition of the <persName>George III</persName> halfpenny series in the context of what has
                        become known as the melting hypothesis. The melting hypothesis simply states that it was possible to make a profit as a counterfeiter by
                        melting regal halfpennies and producing light weight counterfeits from the copper so derived. <ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref> For
                        example, if the average weight of counterfeits produced is 100 grains instead of the nominal regal weight of about 150 grains, one could
                        melt 5 regals to make 7 counterfeits (even with some wastage) for an apparent profit, at face value, of 40%. Because this rough estimate
                        does not account for capital investment, labor, or supplies (equipment, dies, fuel, etc.) it is clearly an overestimate. However, it has
                        been further proposed that to support a reasonable margin of profit, scrap metal was added to the melt along with the regal halfpence.
                        This is where compositional analysis can help clarify the situation. Using scrap metal to increase the volume of the melt sounds simple
                        (just toss in the odd horseshoe, a handful of used glazing lead, and some broken bronze marine hardware) but there are several
                        metallurgical and economic reasons why this was not done as a standard large-scale practice, although it probably was tried on occasion
                        out of desperation or ignorance. </p>
               <p> Copper ores are complex, often containing small amounts of other metals such as lead, iron, zinc, tin, silver, arsenic, antimony and
                        nickel, along with silicon, calcium, sulfur, carbon and oxygen. In fact, rich copper ores might only contain 5 percent copper. Smelting,
                        the process that extracts the metallic copper from the ore, is a rather violent thermo-chemical process. In the eighteenth century
                        copper ores containing sulfur were roasted in air to make copper oxide and then reduced to metallic copper using carbon monoxide,
                        derived from charcoal, in a high temperature environment. For example, chalcocite, Cu <hi rend="sub">2</hi> S, is first roasted in air,
                        Cu <hi rend="sub">2</hi> S + 2O <hi rend="sub">2</hi> = 2CuO + SO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> to produce copper oxide, CuO, and then reduced
                        to copper, Cu, following the equation CuO + CO = Cu + CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> . Oxygen containing copper ores were reduced directly to
                        copper using carbon monoxide in a similar manner. Malachite, Cu <hi rend="sub">2</hi> CO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> , for example, follows
                        the equation, Cu <hi rend="sub">2</hi> CO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> + CO = Cu + 2CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> . In the smelting process, certain
                        elements from the ore, such as silver and nickel, readily disolve in molten copper and thus tend to be concentrated, while others, like
                        zinc, are usually lost entirely in the fumes. Iron, often in the form of iron pyrite in the ore, is oxidized and makes up a major
                        portion of the discarded rock-like slag. Arsenic and antimony behave chemically similar to copper in the smelting process and thus occur
                        in the smelted copper in approximately the same ratio as they appeared in the ore. Tin and lead are lost to some extent <pb n="47"/>
                        but, because they tend to alloy with copper, they are usually present in the smelted copper if present in the ore. Thus the level of
                        purity of smelted copper tends to be high, without further refining technologies being employed. Smelted copper might contain a few
                        percent of tin or lead, a few tenths of a percent of arsenic and antimony, and trace amounts of silver, nickel, iron, and zinc, the
                        exact proportions depending on the ore source, the smelting process and the skill of the workers. This is essentially the composition of
                        the regal halfpence of <persName>George III</persName> and the vast majority of the counterfeits. However, the details of the ore
                        smelting process alone do not account for the fact that apparently counterfeiters did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> employ substantial
                        additions of scrap metals to the melt. We must look for other reasons to understand this observation. </p>
               <p> Iron melts at 1540°C, a substantially higher temperature than the melting point of copper at 1150°C. In addition, only small amounts of
                        iron will normally alloy with copper, so tossing the odd horseshoe or bucket of nails into the melt simply just will not work: they
                        won't melt. </p>
               <p> Brass, an alloy of copper with zinc, was expensive in eighteenth century Britain, due to the difficulty in producing zinc and the
                        complicated technique of making brass directly from a mixture of smithsonite, ZnCO <hi rend="sub">3</hi> , and granular copper. Because
                        of its ease of machining, the industries of clockmaking, watchmaking, and the production of scientific instruments kept the demand for
                        brass, and thus the price, high well into the nineteenth century. </p>
               <p> Bronze, the most common alloy of copper, incorporates tin, or tin together with lead, to produce a hard corrosion-resistant material.
                        Bronze was by far the most important non-ferrous alloy for industrial purposes in eighteenth century Britain and available in large
                        quantities due to the native deposits of its constituent ores. However, the scrap price for bronze, like the scrap price for brass, was
                        substantially greater than the scrap price for copper. </p>
               <p> Lead, due to the availability of its ore and ease of smelting, was less expensive than scrap copper and thus a possible candidate as a
                        debasing component. But, because of its very low melting temperature, 327°C, as well as other metallurgical issues, it is difficult to
                        get substantial amounts of lead to alloy with copper as a homogeneous mix. The way this is accomplished in practice is to add tin, along
                        with lead, and usually starting from the ores, not the metals <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> However, this results in a bronze that can
                        be brittle and very difficult to roll into sheet. </p>
               <p> Tin, at about the same scrap price as copper, offered no economic advantage as a debasing material. In addition, copper-tin bronzes <pb n="48"/> approach the hardness of a coin die, hardly a desirable feature. </p>
               <p> We can conclude from this brief discussion of metallurgical issues that extensive debasement of copper was either technically impossible
                        or economically out of the question. But, even if all the regal halfpence were melted to make counterfeits, it would not begin to
                        account for the magnitude of counterfeits in circulation in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. </p>
               <p> We are therefore left with both an explanation of the relatively high quality copper used by eighteenth century counterfeiters (it was
                        both the practical and economical material of choice) and a conclusion concerning debasement of copper for coinage. Debasement was
                        probably carried out to a limited degree, perhaps experimentally, perhaps out of ignorance, or perhaps out of desperation, but it was
                        not carried out as a large-scale common practice. Thus, it is not surprising that after measuring 10% of the coins in The Study
                        Collection, I found the composition of the majority of them the same as the composition of the regals I measured. When I did find
                        departures that were significant, it was higher than usual iron content, perhaps indicating melting in iron containers and/or ore
                        sources with very high iron pyrite content, and higher tin/lead values, perhaps indicating some use of scrap bronze. However, in no case
                        did the departure (debasement) from the composition of copper used for the regal issues exceed more than 10%. </p>
               <p> And what about those delaminations and silicaceous inclusions occasionally found in counterfeit coins? These result from taking
                        shortcuts in the production processes and quality control; for example, the careful elimination of slag from the melt and other oxides
                        from the ingot before drawing the ingot into a bar. Not annealing the bar at different stages in the drawing process and/or rolling
                        process to prevent work hardening and crack propagation, will lead to delamination. These are not primarily debasement issues. My
                        studies in this area are not yet complete and much work remains to be done. It is not even clear in detail what mines and smelters were
                        suppliers to the Royal Mint during this period, let alone who the counterfeiters were and where they obtained their materials. But one
                        can conclude that the counterfeiters did not use copper of inferior quality. Perhaps they used less than the best available, but
                        definitely, it was not extensively debased as a large scale practice. </p>

               </head>
               <p> The English <persName>George III</persName> contemporary counterfeit halfpenny series represents a unique chapter in Anglo-American
                        numismatics. The number of these coins circulating in both economies was enormous as well as functionally essential to small scale
                        commerce. What at first appears to be the product of amateur efforts turns out to be a large scale, technically competent, well-managed
                        enterprise, rivaling if not matching the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> by almost every measure of engineering competence of the
                        time. </p>
               <p> From the data presented herein, I would suggest the following interpretations. </p>
               <p> Responding to formal petition from the business community, the <placeName>Royal Mint</placeName> resumed production of copper coinage
                        in 1770. Counterfeiting of this new series began in earnest the following year and continued for over two decades. From examples extant
                        today, the counterfeiters' efforts, taken together, appear to have outperformed the Mint by somewhere between 5/1 and 8/1, producing
                        facsimile light weight coinage of comparable composition. It is likely that the sources of copper ore and the smelting operations
                        employed by the counterfeiters were the same as those employed by the <placeName>Mint</placeName> . It is probable that in some years
                        the contracts by various counterfeiting operations for materials and services could have exceeded those of the <placeName>Mint</placeName> . Production technologies and equipment also appear to have been comparable. In two areas the <placeName>Royal
                            Mint</placeName> was exceedingly successful: the very high degree of die-making craftsmanship and artistry, and the ability to stay
                        within production constraints of weight and size. In all other respects, the counterfeiters of the late eighteenth century were working
                        at the state of the art of production engineering in what stands as one of the largest clandestine manufacturing operations in

                  <p> "This corroborates Montagu's experience—that the year 1775, and particularly for halfpence, was the most prolific of forgeries.
                            Those who may be inclined to be skeptical about these proportions might submit their own specimens to a careful scrutiny and
                            comparison. There are two ready tests of genuineness: weight and appearance. The former is the less important, for although true
                            specimens are of full weight, unfortunately, so is a certain proportion of forgeries, though there are farthings of such flimsy
                            fabric that they will float on water. But appearance imposed a harder task and the various efforts to reproduce the official
                            expression of <persName>George III</persName> , and the correct pose and visage of the lady on the reverse, have resulted in a
                            gallery of unintentional caricatures that makes a good collection of these pieces a very entertaining series." </p>

                  <p> In March 1981, a hoard of about 325 defaced counterfeit halfpence was discovered in the <placeName>City of London</placeName> at
                            a building site being cleared prior to archaeological excavation. Each coin had been cut into two or more pieces. This defacement
                            was probably the work of an official, removing the coins from circulation, and rendering them for scrap resale. The coins are now in

            <p> A substantial portion of the counterfeit halfpence in circulation in the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the 1780s was imported.
                        <ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> This paper will examine some of the evidence as to how they were imported, by whom they were imported, and
                    from where they were imported. Since the Second World War, there have been numerous discoveries of coins on shipwrecks, particularly of
                    Spanish treasure fleets. <ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> Lacking was a hulk of a ship carrying not Spanish silver treasure, but rather
                    counterfeit halfpence. </p>
            <p> Such a shipwreck—or to be more accurate, the coins from such a shipwreck—has in fact been found. Around 1930, the Coast Guard dredged the
                    Indian River inlet on the coast of <placeName>Delaware</placeName> . Shortly after this, massive numbers of copper coins began to be
                    washed up on the beaches near <placeName>Rehoboth Beach</placeName> , in particular on " <placeName>Coin Beach</placeName> ." Children
                    filled buckets with these copper coins. I read about this in a book on treasure and shipwrecks, <ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> and I wrote to
                        <persName>Julius Reiver</persName> inquiring whether he had any more information about the coins and the wreck. Not only did <persName>Jules</persName> send me information about the wreck, he sent four coins to me in the post, of which he wanted to keep the best
                    for himself and the other three he donated to the American Numismatic Society. None of these coins is in good condition, but enough detail
                    remains so that it is clear that all four are counterfeit British halfpence. Until then all I had read about the coins from the wreck was
                    that they were "British and Irish halfpence." <persName>Jules</persName> wrote to me as follows: <q> Before World War II I had a
                        tremendous bout with hay fever every year. It started the middle of August, and diminished slightly, until the first frost. Living at
                        the seashore brought great relief, because of the lower pollen content of the ocean air. So I went to <placeName>Rehoboth</placeName>
                        every year... . </q>
               <q> I spent a fair amount of time at <placeName>Coin Beach</placeName> . Using no equipment but a broken tree limb or a stick washed up
                        on the beach, I dug into a lot of sand. Never did a decent coin appear. The salt water had corroded every coin. I probably gave away
                        many of the coins. Years later, when I became interested in British coins, I found some of the coins I had found, and did get some
                        others from friends... . </q>
               <q> I think that I remember seeing the remains of the ship just barely in the water (at low tide). The wreck was good for something else.
                        There were quite a few girls in <placeName>Rehoboth</placeName> in the summer. It was a simple way to get a first date. "How about
                        going to <placeName>Coin Beach</placeName> and see what we can find?"... . I do remember that the best time to search <pb n="57"/>
                        was just after a storm. The surf churned things up and brought new sand to the top. <ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref>

            <p> From what shipwreck do these coins come from? Traditionally, they have been assigned to the <hi rend="italic">Faithful Steward</hi> , which
                    sank in 1785. <persName>John Potter</persName> , in his <hi rend="italic">Treasure Diver's Guide,</hi> suggests that some of the coins
                    found on " <placeName>Coin Beach</placeName> " may have come from a sailing ship, the <hi rend="italic">Three Brothers,</hi> which sank
                    in 1775. Another important shipwreck in the area is <hi rend="italic">HMS De Braak,</hi> which sank in 1798. <hi rend="italic">De
                        Braak,</hi> however, can be eliminated because it sank inside <placeName>Delaware Bay</placeName> , not outside it. Dr. <persName>Spencer Peck</persName> has published a narrative of the shipwreck of the <hi rend="italic">De Braak</hi> which says that when
                    she sank, "her boat [was] alongside for the Captain who intended to go ashore at Lewes Town." <hi rend="italic">De Braak</hi> must have
                    already rounded <placeName>Cape Henlopen</placeName> to be anchored off Lewes. <ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> If the report of the find of
                    a British guinea dated 1782 on " <placeName>Coin Beach</placeName> " is accurate, then that eliminates the <hi rend="italic">Three
                        Brothers.</hi> Of the various possibilities, the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
               </hi> is clearly the likeliest. This is because of the date of the latest coin found so far (1782); the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
               </hi> sank at a peak period of importations of counterfeit halfpence into the <placeName>United States</placeName> ; and finally because
                    of the Irish halfpence which were found, which fit very neatly with the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName> ,
                    </hi> because it had departed from an Irish port, namely <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> . It is also worthy of note that <persName>Robert Marx's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic"> Shipwrecks of the <placeName>Western Hemisphere</placeName> , </hi> which is often more accurate than <persName>Potter</persName> , <ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> does not list the <hi rend="italic">Three Brothers</hi> at all, so the <hi rend="italic">Three Brothers</hi> may just be a "ghost shipwreck." <ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref>

            <p>
               <persName>Neil Rothschild</persName> has made some very interesting comments about the wrecks in this area. He has dived off the Indian
                    River inlet, which is no mean feat, because during the change of tide the currents are quite swift in and out of the inlet: <q> I have dived
                        and photographed a number of wrecks off the Indian River Inlet. I have never found a coin, although I have to admit I have never
                        seriously looked for coins. I can say that there are a large number of wrecks off Indian River; wooden schooners of anonymous identity
                        and many unidentified wrecks piled up on the Fenwick shoals, a shallow area 10 miles or so off the Inlet. There are literally wrecks
                        piled up on top of wrecks. Most of the wrecks date from the mid-1800s and earlier. Most have been demolished by the wave action, with
                        only a few wooden ribs or metal parts left. <ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Rothschild's</persName> point is an important one: this is an area with numerous wrecks which are intermingled. It is not a
                    matter of ab- <pb n="58"/> solute certainty that the coins on <placeName>Rehoboth Beach</placeName> come from the <hi rend="italic">
                        Faithful <persName>Steward</persName> . </hi> But the balance of the probabilities is that the coins are from the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName> . </hi>
            </p>
            <p> The swift currents in and out of the inlet which <persName>Rothschild</persName> has experienced help explain why the coins were swept
                    onto the beach following 1930. When the Coast Guard dredged the inlet, it strengthened the strong currents, and the currents then swept the
                    coins onto the beach. </p>
            <p> I have looked through numerous <placeName>United States</placeName> , Irish, and British newspapers for accounts of the shipwreck of the
                        <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
               </hi> ; most do report the wreck, but they also all report the same shipwreck narrative, verbatim. In the eighteenth and the nineteenth
                    centuries, newspapers followed a practice which the French and Germans call <hi rend="italic">colportage:</hi> the verbatim copying of
                    articles from other newspapers, sometimes giving the other newspapers credit, sometimes not. For example, it is not unusual for a Berlin
                    newspaper like the <hi rend="italic">Vossiscbe Zeitung</hi> to report news from Silesia by saying, "The <hi rend="italic">Schlesische
                        Zeitung</hi> reports..." and then give a word-for-word quote from the <hi rend="italic">Schlesische Zeitung.</hi> Nowadays this would be
                    called plagiarism, although our newspapers still have many verbatim accounts if they re-use the reports of wire services, if they buy
                    features from national syndicates, or if they reprint press releases without rewriting them. If there is an air disaster nowadays, the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> will publish one story, the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> another, and the <hi rend="italic">New
                        York Post</hi> still another, and if you buy all three papers you will have three stories from slightly different perspectives. This is
                    not the case with the reporting of the shipwreck of the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
               </hi> in three <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> papers, the <hi rend="italic">Daily Universal Register</hi> of <placeName>London, England</placeName> (which became the <hi rend="italic">Times)</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal,</hi> which all
                    contain this identical account of the disaster which befell the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
               </hi> Connoly <persName>M'Causland</persName> , <ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref> Master, from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> ,
                    bound to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> : <q> On the 9th day of July last, said vessel sailed from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> , having on board 249 passengers of respectability, who had with them property to a very considerable amount.
                        They had had a favourable passage, during which nothing of moment occurred, the greatest harmony having prevailed among them, until the
                        night of Thursday, the 1st instant September, when at the hour of ten o'clock, it was thought adviseable to try for soundings, and to
                        their great surprise found themselves in four fathoms water, though at dark there was not the smallest appearance of land. The
                        consternation and astonishment <pb n="59"/> which then prevailed, is easier conceived than described, every exertion was used to run the
                        vessel off shore, but in a few minutes she struck the ground, when it was found necessary to cut away her masts, &amp;c. all of which went
                        overboard. On the morning of the 2d, we found ourselves on Mohoba-bank, near Indian river, about four leagues to the southward off
                        Cape-Henlopen. Every effort was made to save the unhappy sufferers, who remained in the wreck during the night, although distant from
                        shore only about 100 yards. The same evening she beat to pieces. </q>
               <q> The sea running extremely high, the boats were with difficulty disengaged from the wreck, but before they could be got manned they
                        dashed ashore, therefore all relief was cut off, except by swimming or getting ashore on pieces of the wreck, and we are sorry to add,
                        that of the above, only 68 persons were saved, among whom were the master, his mate and 10 seamen. During the course of the day, the
                        inhabitants came down to the beach in numbers, and used every means in their power to relieve the unfortunate people on board, among
                        whom were about 100 women and children, of whom only 7 women were saved. Several persons who escaped from the wreck are since dead from
                        the wounds they received, and others are miserably bruised. </q>
               <q> With great pleasure we learn, that several humane and public spirited gentlemen of this city [ <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> ]
                        are raising a SUBSCRIPTION, for the relief of the unhappy people who were saved from the wreck of the Faithful <persName>Steward</persName> ; and there can be no doubt of their meeting with great [support?] from the benevolent Inhabitants, who have never
                        been backward in affording assistance to the distressed. </q>
               <q> About the same time a French brig from Ostend, bound to the same port, foundered in sight of the above ship, but the crew taking to
                        their boats, were saved. We have not learned her name, or any other particulars. <ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref>

               <hi rend="italic">The Belfast News-Letter</hi> printed the article on the front page, at the top left corner, and noted that this was not

            <p> "Sine-puxent" may refer either to <placeName>Sinepuxent Bay, near Ocean City, Maryland</placeName> , or to <placeName>Sinepuxent
                        Beach</placeName> , which is on the barrier <placeName>island south of Ocean City</placeName> . The location is approximately 40 miles
                    south of <placeName>Cape Henlopen</placeName> . </p>
            <p> When the ship <hi rend="italic">Friendship,</hi> captained by <persName>Miller</persName> , arrived in <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> on November 15, 1785, after a passage of five weeks, <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> learned that the citizens of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> had donated a thousand pounds to aid the
                    shipwrecked passengers. <ref target="#CH4-n14">14</ref> It is not specified, however, whether that was British sterling, Irish sterling, or
                        <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> currency. </p>
            <p> The <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal</hi> of November 24-26th, 1785, commented, "The vast emigrations from the Northern parts of this
                    kingdom, is a circumstance truly alarming, scarce a packet or any other intelligence comes over from America, but we hear of numerous
                    families arriving there to settle in that continent, many of whom bring off considerable properties, in order to carry on the linen and
                    other manufactures." After reviewing the danger from Indians, the <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal</hi> continued, "Even the dangers of the
                    deep are also to be dreaded, as is evident from the loss of the vessel from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> , with 249 passengers of
                    respectability that were going to reside in that part of the <placeName>Western Hemisphere</placeName> ." <ref target="#CH4-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p> Even as the passengers on the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
               </hi> met their tragic end, more immigrants were disembarking from other ships. For example, the <hi rend="italic">Daily Universal
                        Register</hi> reported from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> with a dateline of September 14th: "Monday last arrived the ship <hi rend="italic">Congress,</hi> Capt. <persName>M'Clenaghan</persName> , from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> , with near five
                    hundred passengers; a number of which she landed at <placeName>Newcastle</placeName> ." <ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref>
            </p>
            <p> I have come across two alternative shipwreck narratives. One account is by the diver <persName>Robert</persName> "Frogfoot" <persName>Weller</persName> , which is clearly based on the contemporary account quoted above, but with some impossible embellishments.
                    One embellishment is that the male passengers "tried to swim through the surf with their mouths full of silver sovereigns," a non-existent
                    coin. Weller also asserts that there was then a lighthouse at <placeName>Cape Henlopen</placeName> , although this is not <pb n="61"/>
                    mentioned in the contemporary narrative. <persName>Weller</persName> says that the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
               </hi> was carrying 360,000 copper pennies, which is quite believable once we read "halfpence" instead of "pennies." <persName>Weller</persName> mentions among the coins which have been found, copper British and Irish halfpence (he calls them "pennies") dated 1776
                    to 1782. Most of those coins would be counterfeits, judging by the dates, since 1775 is the last genuine date for British halfpence. <persName>Weller</persName> also says that "recently" (i.e. shortly before 1990) some gold coins had been found as well. <ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Philip Zbar Trupp</persName> gives a rather different shipwreck narrative. He says that the number of passengers on board was
                    360 (contemporary newspapers say 249); that the captain was <persName>William McCausland</persName> (contemporary newspapers call him
                        <persName>Connoly M'Causland</persName> ); and that 298 passengers drowned (contemporary newspapers say 68 out of 249 survived,
                    which would mean that 181 drowned). <persName>Trupp</persName> says that the passengers and the crew were on deck celebrating the first
                    wedding anniversary of a passenger, <persName>John McGreg</persName> , and were intoxicated when the ship ran aground. These
                    contradictions with the newspaper account lead me to set <persName>Trupp's</persName> account aside, until confirmation in a
                    contemporary source turns up. <ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Trupp</persName> does have interesting information about the coins recovered on the beach. He says that schoolchildren filled
                    buckets with the coins and that one reporter wrote that the coins were "as numerous as clam shells." He mentions that a recent treasure
                    hunter found one hundred coins in five days, of which fifteen were gold. The coins included guineas dated from 1766 to 1782, British and
                    Irish halfpence, some with holes drilled through them, and Spanish reales. The drilling of holes through coins is often done to cancel
                    counterfeit coins, and is probably the purpose here; having then been rejected in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> , the cancelled
                    counterfeit halfpence were shipped out to try their luck in the <placeName>New World</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p> The name of the ship, the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName> , </hi> is an interesting choice. It appears to
                    recall a phrase in a sermon by a Protestant prelate, <persName>Edwin Sandys</persName> , the <placeName>Archbishop of
                        York</placeName> (1516-88): "God hath made him rich, that he as a faithful <persName>steward</persName> might bestowe those rich
                    blessings vpon the familie... of God." <ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref> The phrase is a good choice, not only for the Protestant
                    associations, but also because Archbishop Sandys's two sons, Sir <persName>Edwin Sandys</persName> (1561-1629) and <persName>George Sandys</persName> (1578-1644), helped to settle the colony of <placeName>Virginia</placeName> . When <persName>George
                        Sandys</persName> was in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> in 1621-31, he spent the time translating Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses,</hi> which must be one of first works of classical scholarship done in what is now the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> . </p>
            <pb n="62"/>
            <p> Unlike the Spanish treasure fleets, it was not profitable to export counterfeit halfpence as the sole or chief freight of a ship. There had
                    to be a pre-existing, profitable trade upon which the counterfeit halfpence could piggyback. Such trades had to be two ways, because only a
                    very profitable one-way trade can afford to have ships return in ballast. Such a two-way trade existed with northern Ireland because of the
                    boom in flax growing and linen weaving; the <placeName>United States</placeName> exported flaxseed, flour, and tobacco to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> and imported linen, provisions and immigrants. </p>
            <p> Although immigrants were the most profitable freight, their destination was determined by the flax trade; in the eighteenth century, when
                    most flaxseed was exported from the Delaware bay ports, the immigrant ships would go to <placeName>Philadelphia, Newcastle</placeName> ,
                    and <placeName>Wilmington</placeName> . This pattern could change if a different port offered a profitable return freight: on the last
                    reported arrival in <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> of the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName> , </hi> in
                    April 1785, she had sailed not from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , but from <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref> On the other hand the <hi rend="italic">Congress,</hi> captained by <persName>M'Clenaghan</persName> ,
                    which arrived at <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> at the same time and may have been a sister ship of the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful
                            <persName>Steward</persName> , </hi> had sailed from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p> After 1790, when the flaxseed trade shifted to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , most of the immigrant
                    trade shifted with it. By the first years of the nineteenth century, <persName>Charles W. Janson</persName> claimed that much of the
                    American trade to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was smuggling. The Americans would bring some legitimate goods: flaxseed, tobacco, and
                    lumber, but they would chiefly smuggle in contraband, namely tea in chests, nankeens in bales, tobaccos in rolls, bandannas and other silk
                    handkerchiefs, and spices. The return freight was immigrants. <ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref> The most popular port to emigrate from was
                        <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> 's linen weaving industry experienced a boom during the period 1783-1813; it declined after the end of
                    the Napoleonic Wars. The <hi rend="italic">Ordnance Survey</hi> commented, "It may indeed, be safely asserted, that, taking both into
                    consideration, viz., the prosperity of the trading interest, and the spirit of gay and social intercourse of its principal inhabitants, the
                    latter years of the period—were among the brightest that the City had yet enjoyed." <ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref>

            <p> Irishmen of all faiths began emigrating to <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> in 1718; there were Catholics
                    and Anglicans among them, but most probably were <placeName>Presbyterians</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n26">26</ref> Before <persName>R.J. Dickson's</persName> 1988 study, earlier works tended to use the American War of Independence or the year 1800 as a
                    caesura, with eighteenth century Irish immigrants being described as <placeName>Presbyterians</placeName> (the "Scots-Irish") and
                    nineteenth century Irish immigrants being described as Catholics. This distinction <pb n="63"/> was an attempt, generally successful, by the
                    American descendants of Irish <placeName>Presbyterian</placeName> immigrants to describe their ancestors as "colonists," and thus equal
                    to the "WASPS," and distinct from the later Irish Catholic "immigrants." This distinction was not known to the eighteenth century immigrants
                    themselves. It does seem as though most Irishmen in this period saw themselves as Irishmen first, and Catholics or <placeName>Presbyterians</placeName> second; it was only in the nineteenth century, during the bitter debate over Catholic emancipation, that divisions
                    between Presbyterians and Catholics deepened. <ref target="#CH4-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p> In this context it is important to remember that the plantation of Ulster and the plantation of <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> —the creation of Protestant commonwealths in <placeName>Northern Ireland</placeName>
                    , in <placeName>Bermuda</placeName> , in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> , in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> —were
                    simultaneous, parallel events. The <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi> gives two book titles using the word "plantation" in
                    1610: <hi rend="italic">A Direction for the Plantation in Ulster</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> A true and sincere Declaration of the Purpose
                        and Ends of the Plantation begun in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> . </hi>
               <ref target="#CH4-n28">28</ref> The history of Ulster and the history of British <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North
                        America</placeName> have been intertwined from the very beginning. </p>
            <p> Although the <placeName>Presbyterians</placeName> took a prominent part of the defense of <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> during
                    its siege by <persName>James II</persName> , the legal settlement which followed the Glorious Revolution did not work to their benefit.
                    The Church of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> , with an Anglican rite, became the established church in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> ; the Church of <placeName>Scotland</placeName> , with a <placeName>Presbyterian</placeName> rite, became the established church in <placeName>Scotland</placeName> ; but the Church of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> , the established church in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> , followed the Anglican ritual. In 1689, "An Act for
                    Exempting Their Majesties' Protestant Subjects Dissenting from the Church of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> ,
                    from the Penalties of Certain Laws," commonly known as the Toleration Act, was passed by the English Parliament; but this did not apply to
                    Ireland, which was governed by a separate parliament. In 1704, the Irish parliament passed "An Act to Prevent the Further Growth of Popery,"
                    commonly known as the Test Act. This required holders of public offices to take the sacrament of communion in their local Anglican parish.
                    This compelled twenty-four members (out of thirty-eight) of the Corporation of <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> to resign, because they
                    were <placeName>Presbyterians</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n29">29</ref>
            </p>
            <p> In the colonial period the rate of emigration to <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North America</placeName> was about three
                    thousand a year. <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> was the chief port for the Irish emigrants. In July 1729, a <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> businessman reported that twenty-five ships had left the port that summer; each ship had 140 passengers on board. In
                    1759, three thousand people left from the ports of <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> and <placeName>Coleraine</placeName> . A report
                    to the <pb n="64"/> Irish Customs Commissioners said that in 1772 and 1773 about six thousand emigrants had left from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> . The <hi rend="italic">Maryland Journal</hi> of October 16, 1773, said that 3,500 people had left from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> in the previous twelve months. <ref target="#CH4-n30">30</ref>
            </p>
            <p> The chief destinations for these emigrants were <placeName>South Carolina, Nova Scotia</placeName> , and above all, <placeName>Philadelphia. Pennsylvania</placeName> became the Scots-Irish center in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> because
                    of its favorable geographic position. The emigrants would land at either <placeName>Lewes</placeName> or <placeName>Newcastle in
                        Delaware</placeName> , or at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . In the 1770s, the cost of passage from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> was three guineas (£3 and 3 shillings). <ref target="#CH4-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p> After the hiatus of the Revolution, emigration recommenced at once, and 1784 was a record year: over ten thousand emigrated from <placeName>Ireland</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n32">32</ref> The cost of passage from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> was £3 10 shillings in the 1780s, although it rose to £10 10 shillings by 1801. <ref target="#CH4-n33">33</ref> The conditions on the ships were terrible; <persName>Charles Janson</persName> observed in 1807 that "Guinea-men with
                    slaves were never crowded like the American ships from <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> with
                    Irish passengers. A small ship of 215 tons took on board five hundred and thirty passengers, who first paid the captain above 5000 <hi rend="italic">l</hi> . for their passage. To these must be added the ship's crew, making five hundred and forty-two souls, being nearly
                    double the number ever attempted to be stowed in a slave ship of that burthen." <ref target="#CH4-n34">34</ref> In 1790, the Irish Society
                    of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> got the authorities to prosecute Captain <persName>Robert Cunningham</persName> of the brig
                        <hi rend="italic">Cunningham</hi> of <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> because the ship ran out of food and the passengers were on
                    short rations for three weeks prior to arrival in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . Furthermore, there was
                    almost no vinegar to keep the vessel clean. <persName>Robert Cunningham</persName> was fined £500 <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> Currency and then remanded to gaol when he failed to pay the fine. <ref target="#CH4-n35">35</ref> The poor condition of the ships may in part explain the wreck of the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName> . </hi> It may also explain the questionable actions of the captain and the crew, who rescued
                    themselves, but left the women and the children to drown. </p>
            <p> Many Federalists looked upon the influx of the Irish with great dismay. Harrison Gray Otis commented, "If some means are not adopted to
                    prevent the indiscriminate admission of wild Irishmen and others to the right of suffrage, there will soon be an end to liberty and
                    property." <ref target="#CH4-n36">36</ref> And Uriah Tracy of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> commented about the Scotch-Irish in
                        <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> : "With very few exceptions they are United Irishmen, Free Masons,
                    and the most God-provoking Democrats this side of Hell." <ref target="#CH4-n37">37</ref> Although these people were mostly <placeName>Presbyterians</placeName> , they were also Irish nationalists; the leadership of <pb n="65"/> the United Irishmen uprising of
                    1798 was largely Protestant too. Wolfe Tone, the leader of the United Irishmen rebellion, temporarily emigrated to the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the 1780s. A very extreme United Irishman was Dr. <persName>James Reynolds</persName> , who fled from
                        <placeName>Belfast</placeName> to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in 1794. He hanged an effigy of <persName>George</persName> III from the yardarm and gave rum to the crew so that they might "drink the confusion of despots and the prosperity of
                    liberty all the world over." <ref target="#CH4-n38">38</ref> The Federalists introduced a naturalization act to slow the increase in Irish
                    voters, but the Alien and Sedition Acts failed, and the Irish voters went over en bloc to the Democratic-Republicans. <persName>Philip Livingston</persName> claimed that it was the poor Irish and the French in the Sixth and Seventh Ward of <placeName>New York
                        City</placeName> which enabled <persName>Jefferson</persName> to carry <placeName>New York City</placeName> , and hence <placeName>New York State</placeName> , in the presidential election of 1800. <ref target="#CH4-n39">39</ref>

            <p> The history of the <placeName>United States</placeName> is the history of immigration, and this is no less true for numismatics. The
                    names of <persName>Henry Voigt</persName> , <persName>John Reich</persName> and <persName>Christian Gobrecht</persName>
                    remind us of the contribution of <placeName>German</placeName> immigrants to the technology of the early mint. <ref target="#CH4-n40">40</ref> California fractional gold was made almost exclusively by French immigrants. <ref target="#CH4-n41">41</ref> The California
                    coining firm of Wass, Molitor &amp; Co. was set up by refugees from the Hungarian Revolution of 1848-49. <ref target="#CH4-n42">42</ref> I have
                    already pointed out the important role of French immigrants in <placeName>New York City</placeName> and the involvement of one of them,
                        <persName>Marc Isambard Brunel</persName> , in the design of the First Park Theatre (which is depicted on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> Theatre token) and in the <placeName>Castorland</placeName> project. <ref target="#CH4-n43">43</ref> The <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
               </hi> is one of many examples of <placeName>U.S.</placeName> numismatic history which is intertwined with the history of <placeName>Ireland</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n44">44</ref>
            </p>
            <p> Importation of counterfeit halfpence was an illicit operation. There are no advertisements in American newspapers of the time saying, "Just
                    arrived, fresh halfpence from <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> ." <persName>Walter Breen</persName> has suggested that the term
                    "hard-ware" was used as a euphemism for counterfeit coppers. <ref target="#CH4-n45">45</ref> The advertisement of the ship <hi rend="italic">Grange</hi> gives us an idea of the typical imports into the <placeName>United States</placeName> . In October 1785, the <hi rend="italic">Grange</hi> advertised for sale in the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> papers "Coal, Queen's Ware, <placeName>China</placeName> , Hyson Teas, Pipes, Whiting, Chalk, Copper in bottoms and sheets, coarse Woollens and a General Assortment of
                    MERCHANDISE." <ref target="#CH4-n46">46</ref> I suspect that the agents for this cargo could sell kegs of counterfeit halfpence too, but
                    they conceal that under the rubrics of "Copper in bottoms and sheets" and "a General Assortment of MERCHANDISE." </p>

               <p> I shall now review the various coins found on the wreck. The coins which Reiver sent us are all British counterfeit halfpence dated 1775
                        ( <ref target="#fig-20">figs. 1</ref> - <ref target="#fig-23">4</ref> ). I have been told that one collection of coins found on the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
                  </hi> also includes a Voce Populi coin of 1760 ( <ref target="#fig-24">fig. 5</ref> ). If this is confirmed, this is a very exciting
                        discovery, because this is the first find of a Voce Populi in the United States known to me. There were also numerous Irish halfpence on

                  </hi> , and they were almost certainly counterfeit as well. </p>

               <p> Where were these coins manufactured? There is a natural tendency to ascribe any counterfeit British coin to " <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> ." It certainly is possible that the large number of counterfeit coppers in circulation in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in this period was made in <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> and then exported via <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> across the Irish Sea to <placeName>Dublin</placeName> and <placeName>Belfast</placeName> and <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> . By 1820, <placeName>Belfast's</placeName> source of hardware (namely metal products, not
                        counterfeit coins) was <placeName>Scotland</placeName> , so some of the halfpence in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> could have
                        come from there; but the main port for cross channel trade with <placeName>Belfast</placeName> was <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n47">47</ref> There certainly was much coastwise shipping of counterfeit halfpence. The <hi rend="italic">Daily Universal Register,</hi> which later became the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> said on October 12, 1786: "A large
                        coinage of <hi rend="italic">halfpence</hi> has been discovered in the west of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> , on board a vessel, where that coin, amounting to 1000 <hi rend="italic">l</hi> ., was found concealed. It is
                        suspected to be a <hi rend="italic">consignment</hi> from the dock-yard men at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> to those of <placeName>Bristol</placeName> , ingeniously <hi rend="italic">wrought</hi> out of waste copper sheathing." <ref target="#CH4-n48">48</ref>
               </p>
               <p> But <placeName>Ireland</placeName> , too, had its own copper coinage manufactories. In 1790, by the best estimates, the population of
                            <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was larger than the population of the <placeName>United States</placeName> . <persName>Kenneth H. Connell</persName> estimated <placeName>Ireland's</placeName> population in 1790 at 4,591,000; <ref target="#CH4-n49">49</ref> the 1790 Federal census of the <placeName>United States</placeName> reports a population of 3,929,625. <ref target="#CH4-n50">50</ref> Although the histories of the Irish economy in this period do not mention a non-ferrous metals industry,
                            <ref target="#CH4-n51">51</ref> it is not <pb n="68"/> surprising that <placeName>Ireland</placeName> , densely settled with a
                        skilled population, should be a center for manufacturing counterfeit halfpence and other coins, tokens and medals in its own right.
                        There had to be the skills to make coins in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> , or <persName>James II</persName> would not have
                        been able to issue his gun money. There was a rash of issuers of tokens in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in the 1720s and 1730s—it
                        is a parallel phenomenon with Wood's coinage controversy—and these tokens were very likely made somewhere in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> . Their fabric and their style are totally unlike British coins of the day. These tokens have a dumpy fabric and
                        they use animals as obverse coin types, with an inscription on the reverse ( <ref target="#fig-25">fig. 6</ref> ). <ref target="#CH4-n52">52</ref> Another Irish coin and medal manufacturer was <persName>John V. Roche</persName> of <placeName>King Street, Dublin</placeName> , who diversified from making buttons for the army to making the Voce Populi coppers, and
                        who also made medals of Dean Swift, of the Convention of Pardo, and in honor of the great hero of the day, Admiral <persName>Edward Vernon</persName> ( <ref target="#fig-26">fig. 7</ref> ). <ref target="#CH4-n53">53</ref>

               <p> Curiously, there is a copper of the period which appears to be specifically directed toward a <placeName>Londonderry</placeName>
                        audience. This is the Colonel Percy Kirke evasive halfpence of 1796 ( <persName>Atkins</persName> 64; <ref target="#fig-27">fig.
                            8</ref> ). <ref target="#CH4-n54">54</ref> It is directed toward a <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> audience because Colonel
                        Kirke is an obscure character, most famous for relieving the siege of <placeName>Londonderry</placeName> in 1689. The name is spelled
                        "Percie Kirk" on the <pb n="69"/> halfpence, but the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi> gives his name as <persName>Percy</persName> or <persName>Percie Kirke</persName> . We can assume that some of these coins came to <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> , because the hoarder <persName>Aaron White</persName> of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> struck a new version of the token in the 1860s, but it has the wrong date, 1686 rather than 1689 (

               <p> The <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
                  </hi> is also important in that it brings out that the circulation of British and Irish halfpence was commingled. Britain had sought to
                        impose a steadily rising nominal value and inversely related falling intrinsic value on coinage as one moved from the metropolis to the
                        periphery. Irish sterling was valued at 8 1/3% over English sterling; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> currency was valued at 77.8% over English sterling. The distinct <placeName>British</placeName> and <placeName>Irish</placeName> coin types for halfpence should have kept each variety circulating within its home island, or if not that,
                        halfpence would at least flow from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> outward. But this did not happen. By the
                        late eighteenth century, the scarcity of regal coppers and the prevalence of counterfeits caused the exchange differential to break down
                        so that counterfeit Irish halfpence circulated in <placeName>Britain</placeName> to a small degree, counterfeit British halfpence
                        circulated in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to a slightly larger degree, and both <pb n="70"/> counterfeit British and Irish
                        halfpence circulated extensively in the <placeName>United States</placeName> and what would become <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> , with British halfpence outnumbering Irish anywhere from 3:1 to 20:1. This is clear from
                        the evidence of hoards and excavations. <placeName>The City of London</placeName> (1981) hoard contained three Irish counterfeit
                        halfpence out of a total of 325 counterfeit halfpence, although if the exchange differential had held up properly by rights there should
                        be no Irish halfpence in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> . <ref target="#CH4-n56">56</ref>
               </p>
               <p> A hoard of 206 counterfeit halfpence found near <placeName>Jonesborough</placeName> , <placeName>County Armagh</placeName> , now
                        in the Ulster Museum, had twenty-seven British halfpence of a total of 206; 170 pieces were Irish. <ref target="#CH4-n57">57</ref> Of
                        the halfpence found during the excavations for a highway in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , thirty-three (excluding the special
                        case of the 362 William III 1699 counterfeits) were British halfpence, ten were Irish. <ref target="#CH4-n58">58</ref> Finally, a Quebec
                        city hoard of coppers deposited around 1835-37, contained 500 counterfeits of British halfpence and 25 counterfeits of Irish halfpence.

                  <persName>Janson</persName> made a basic error in supposing that English guineas could have only come over in the hands of
                        Englishmen. But even if English guineas were not uncommon in this period, many of them were counterfeit. I have been unable to confirm
                        whether or not these guineas recovered from the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
                  </hi> were counterfeit, but I suspect they are. Some flotsam from an unknown wreck of the same period, found on the beach at
                        Mantoloking, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> , includes spade guineas and half guineas of 1789, all of
                        them brass counterfeits. <ref target="#CH4-n64">64</ref> There are numerous contemporary counterfeits of the guineas of this period,
                        which are quite difficult to distinguish from the genuine pieces. One of the most remarkable examples of U.S. circulation of counterfeit
                        half guineas is provided by the <pb n="72"/> countermark of <persName>Ephraim Brasher</persName> , who countermarked a counterfeit
                        half guinea of 1766 (figs. <ref target="#fig-29">10</ref> and <ref target="#fig-30">11</ref> ). Parallel to the manufacture and import
                        of counterfeit halfpence occurred the manufacture and import of counterfeit guineas and half guineas, joes and half joes. <ref target="#CH4-n65">65</ref> Further evidence for the circulation of counterfeit half joes in Britain is provided by a single find at

                        might give us some easy answers; in particular, I was hoping that there might be a 1785 counterfeit halfpence among the coins found.

               <pb n="73"/>
               <p> First, it shows us one method whereby the counterfeit halfpence were imported: they were brought in by immigrants, not wholly dissimilar
                        to the drug mules of today. Secondly, it focuses our attention on <placeName>Ireland</placeName> , as a center of circulation,
                        distribution and probably manufacture of counterfeit halfpence. Thirdly, it reminds us that there was a parallel counterfeiting
                        operation in gold alongside the better known counterfeiting operations in copper. Fourthly, there seems to have been a breakdown in the
                        differential between British and Irish coppers, so that they circulated at par. British halfpence circulated in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> , as did Irish halfpence in <placeName>Britain</placeName> , and both circulated, apparently indiscriminately, in
                        the <placeName>United States</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> . And finally, the <hi rend="italic"> Faithful <persName>Steward</persName>
                  </hi> provides us with some counterfeit halfpence with a clear terminus ante quem. It was in reaction to these floods of imports that
                        the states began to take steps to coin their own coppers. </p>
               <p> Much effort has gone into determining which coppers are "American," and which are not. This question is not as important as is usually
                        thought. Although each of the four major copper circulating jurisdictions involved— <placeName>Britain, Ireland</placeName> , the
                            <placeName>United States</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> —sought at times to cut
                        itself off from the others, the coinage systems were so similar and the trade so extensive that the copper coinage of the four areas was

                            counterfeits, not the gaming counters known as "spade guineas" with the motto "In Memory of the Good Old Days." The gaming counters
                            bear the dates 1788 (for half guinea sized counters) and 1797 (for guinea sizes). Furthermore, the bust on the gaming counters is
                            much cruder than the bust on the counterfeits found at Mantoloking. Both of the books by Nesmith have a photograph of the
                            counterfeits found at Mantoloking. </p>

            <p> The NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage embodies the radiant enthusiasm of the <placeName>United States</placeName> as a new nation
                    and features the goal of liberty and justice which inspired the achievement of independence. The design and the legends were derived from
                    the 1783 U.S. patterns arranged for the <placeName>United States</placeName> by <persName>Robert Morris</persName> as Superintendent
                    of Finance and developed primarily by <persName>Benjamin Dudley</persName> as the master craftsman. <ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> The
                    rays emanating from the Eye of Providence toward a constellation of 13 stars were adapted from the emblem designed by <persName>Francis Hopkinson</persName> and first used on the face of the $40 denomination of Continental Currency paper money issued pursuant to the
                    April 11, 1778 Resolution of the Continental Congress. <ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref> The legend, NOVA CONSTELLATIO, was the Latin form of
                    the words "a new constellation" used in the June 14, 1777 Resolution of the Continental Congress as to the design of the flag. </p>
            <p> Because of a lack of substantial historical data on the background of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers, the early numismatic
                    researchers and writers steadily presented new ideas and findings in the hope of reaching sound conclusions. <persName>Joseph B.
                        Felt</persName> , in 1839, mentioned the coins as did <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> and <persName>Dubois</persName> in 1842. <persName>Charles B. Norton</persName> advertised and described one in 1857. In 1858 <persName>John H. Hickcox</persName> described
                    both dates of the issue. <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> and <persName>DuBois</persName> as well as Norton attributed the issue to
                        <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> , misinterpreting Felt. <persName>Montroville W. Dickeson</persName> , in 1859, listed some
                    of their varieties, but in 1875, <persName>Sylvester S. Crosby</persName> presented a classification of their dies and combinations
                    which has not been superseded. <ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref>

                  <hi rend="bold">NOVA CONSTELLATIO or CONSTELLATIO NOVA</hi>
               </head>
               <p> Initially it seems desirable to justify the use of the name NOVA CONSTELLATIO rather than CONSTELLATIO NOVA. Prior to 1973, numismatic
                        writers, collectors and dealers routinely had used NOVA CONSTELLATIO in that word order ( <persName>Alexandre Vattemare</persName>
                        in 1861 being an exception). <ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> Because in 1973, I had republished a short item quoting a 1786 English
                        newspaper article which used "CONSTELLATIO NOVA," <ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref>
                  <persName>Walter Breen</persName> seized upon this word order and supported it in an erudite presentation. <ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref> This word order change was adopted by a steady stream of others (including myself) on the assumption that it was the proper
                        or preferred Latin adjectival placement and that the position of the eye might control the word order. <ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> My
                        present opinion is that there is unequivocal evidence to the contrary and the change might have been an exercise in scholarly fun rather
                        than being influenced by pedantic thinking. If Breen had been aware of all of the evidence, he probably would have changed his mind on
                        the basis of reasons which follow. </p>

               <p> The legend NOVA CONSTELLATIO in its circular form on one side of the 1000 unit 1783 U.S. silver pattern has one rosette centered in the
                        angular space in front of the word NOVA and after the word CONSTELLATIO, whereas a similar sized space after the word NOVA and in front
                        of the word CONSTELLATIO is blank. This clearly shows the intended word order as NOVA CONSTELLATIO. In one variety of the 500 unit 1783
                        U.S. silver pattern there is an angular space of about 120 degrees in front of NOVA and after CONSTELLATIO compared to a less than 10
                        degree angular space after NOVA and in front of CONSTELLATIO. Just as on the 1000 unit piece there is one ornament in front of NOVA and
                        following CONSTELLATIO and no ornament following NOVA and in front of CONSTELLATIO. In the other variety of the 500 unit silver pattern,
                        a <pb n="82"/> circle of stars replace the legend NOVA CONSTELLATIO. The 100 unit piece has a similar spacing relationship of the legend
                        to that of the first variety of the 500 unit piece but one stop or period closely follows CONSTELLATIO while another stop is directly
                        between NOVA and CONSTELLATIO. The 5 unit 1783 U.S. copper pattern has a very large angular displacement in front of NOVA and after
                        CONSTELLATIO and an ornament after CONSTELLATIO and before NOVA much larger that the stop in the space in front of CONSTELLATIO and
                        after NOVA. The spacing and ornamentation on all denominations of the 1783 <placeName>U.S.</placeName> patterns clearly show the word
                        order selected was NOVA CONSTELLATIO and not CONSTELLATIO NOVA ( <ref target="#fig-31">fig. 1</ref> ). </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Samuel Curwen's</persName> diary entry of May 15, 1784, used NOVA CONSTELLATIO to describe the 1783 <placeName>U.S.</placeName> copper pattern presented to him. <persName>Rathmell Wilson</persName> in a May 28, 1872 letter to <persName>John W. Haseltine</persName> used NOVA CONSTELLATIO in describing the full provenance of the two 1783 <placeName>U.S.</placeName> silver patterns he had acquired. <ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-32">
                  <graphic url="COAC11_082.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p> The subsequent private coinage of copper pieces dated 1783, which generally copy the design of the 1783 U.S. patterns, confirms the NOVA
                        CONSTELLATIO word order by having a star or quatrefoil in front of NOVA and after CONSTELLATIO or CONSTELATIO, whereas there is only a
                        single stop or period of much smaller size following NOVA and in front of CONSTELLATIO or CONSTELATIO ( <ref target="#fig-32">fig.
                            2</ref> ). This is also true of the <persName>Crosby</persName> variety 1-B of that coinage dated 1785. As to the other
                        varieties dated 1785, there is no ornamentation or punctuation between the two words. The angular <pb n="83"/> sweep between the two
                        words on all such coppers dated 1783 and 1785 is more or less equal, eliminating that factor from being determinative of word order. It
                        has been pointed out that the position of the central eye might determine the word order but that is overruled by the spacing and the
                        ornamentation ( <ref target="#fig-33">fig. 3</ref> ). </p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-33">
                  <graphic url="COAC11_083.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p> The evidence of intended word order on the private coppers happens not to be as strongly convincing as that on the 1783 U.S. patterns,
                        but the two groups cannot be treated differently when one is copied from the other. </p>
               <pb n="84"/>
               <p>Latin grammar allows a choice of word order.</p>
               <p> To show that the NOVA CONSTELLATIO word order was normal it is well to point out that in other American coinage of the same period, NOVA
                        precedes the noun in the legends NOVA EBORAC and NOVA CAESAREA. NOVA EBORACA COLUMBIA is used in that order on the Brasher doubloon gold
                        coinage. In commonly used geographical names, NOVA ANGLIA and NOVA SCOTIA reinforce NOVA as properly and commonly being the first word.
                        If I believed in the reversed word order the title to this study might be "COMMENTARII NOVI on CONSTELLATIO NOVA." </p>

                        for March 11-14, 1786, as follows: <ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref>
                  <q> The American Congress have lately made a copper coinage, which is now in general circulation: one side of the halfpenny bears the
                            circular inscription, "Libertas et Justitia" round a central cypher U.S. On the reverse is a Sun rising amidst Thirteen Stars,
                            circularly inscribed "Constellatio Nova." </q>
               </p>
               <p> This technically described those coppers dated 1785, because ET does not appear on the pieces dated 1783. An immediate contradiction of
                        portions of the March 11-14, 1786 commentaries followed in <hi rend="italic"> The Morning Chronicle and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> Advertiser </hi> for March 16, 1786: <ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref>
                  <q> A correspondent observes, that the paragraph which has lately appeared in several papers, respecting a copper coinage in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> is not true. The piece spoken of, bearing the inscription "Libertas et
                            Justitia, &amp; C" was not made in America, nor by direction of Congress. It was coined in Birmingham, by order of a Merchant in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , many tons were struck from this dye, and many from another; they
                            are now in circulation in America, as counterfeit half pence are in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> .

               </p>
               <p> No further rebuttal in English newspapers seems to have occurred so that the accuracy of the corrections seems to have been accepted. </p>
               <p> The original English announcement and its contradiction raised several perplexing problems. </p>
               <p> (a) If the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers dated 1783 had been in circulation when dated or a reasonable time thereafter the <pb n="85"/> matter would not have been newsworthy in March 1786. </p>
               <p> (b) Two pairs of dies were recognized and since at that time only types of design rather than specific die varieties were all that were
                        referred to, there is no indication as to whether these two types were intended to be distinguished by (1) block letters in U.S dated
                        1783, or script letters in US dated 1785; or (2) pointed rays or widening bifurcated (blunt) outer rays, each type of rays occurring
                        with both dates. </p>
               <p> (c) The name of the merchant in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> was not disclosed. </p>
               <p> (d) The amount of the coinage was only roughly estimated by the use of the words "many tons." </p>

            <p> OBSERVING in your last Magazine a representation of a copper, the coin of the renowned Protector, I beg leave to transmit to the public,
                    through the same very entertaining channel, a description of a <hi rend="italic">halfpenny</hi> lately struck by the <placeName>United States of America</placeName> , which, although of a late date, will, I presume, be thought no less curious, being the first of a
                    kind I have seen in this kingdom. </p>
            <p> Considering the principles that actuated the revolt of the English colonies in America, and that which brought about the Protectorship in
                    place of a royal government, the representations of the two coins would have been proper companions, had they met on the <hi rend="italic">same plate</hi> : but, should you favor my halfpenny with a place in your next, I shall esteem it no less fortunate to find them in the
                        <hi rend="italic">same volume</hi> in your repository. On one side, encircled within <pb n="86"/> a wreath of LAUREL, exceedingly well
                    executed, are the letters U S in cypher, surrounded with an inscription, LIBERTAS ET JUSTITIA; date 1785. On the reverse, in the center, is
                    a CONSTELLATION, from which issue THIRTEEN illuminated RAYS and between each ray is a small STAR, expressive of the THIRTEEN UNITED STATES;
                    round these rays and the stars is the following inscription: NOVA CONSTELLATIO. The new American halfpenny is in weight as three to two of
                    the English coin. </p>
            <p> The <placeName>United States</placeName> , as appears by the inscription on the front of their coin, have erected the standard of liberty
                    and justice. But, from what we have lately heard concerning American politics, both one and the other, I fear, are known only by name
                    throughout that vast, and once flourishing, continent. </p>

            <p> The writer ( <persName>W.B.</persName> ) was comparing the piece to a coin of Cromwell as Protector and thought that the NOVA

               <p> During the year 1785, and prior thereto, no American newspaper or other reports relating to NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage
                        have been located. The earliest publicity in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> made reference to, but did not
                        mention, NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers by name. It is dated March 13, 1786, and emanated as news in <placeName>Worcester</placeName> ,
                            <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> . It was on the subject of counterfeit halfpence and the need for <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> to authorize its own copper coin. It stated that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> , <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Vermont</placeName> had authorized copper coinage and "numbers
                        of them are now in circulation; they are in general well made, and of good copper, those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> in particular." <ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref> Since there was no coinage
                        officially authorized by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , this comment must have been referring to
                        NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers which were superior in quality to those of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . There was no copper coinage relating to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> in
                        circulation in 1786, or prior thereto, the rare 1786 NEO-EBORACENSIS copper being struck as a trial in too small a quantity to have been
                        put into general circulation. </p>
               <p> The use of the expression "now in circulation" indicated a recent introduction and that is corroborated for <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Vermont</placeName> in late 1785 by their first dates of mintage. The so-called <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> coppers would not have been included with <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers if the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> coppers had not been introduced at about the same time. This is additional evidence that NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers first
                        appeared in general circulation in late 1785 and coincides with the date of the first English publicity. </p>
               <pb n="88"/>
               <p> All subsequent American reports on the NOVA CONSTELLATIO subject during 1786 are directly or indirectly based upon the English newspaper
                        articles previously quoted and none are from information originally gathered in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . Each such rehash of English news resulted in several literal errors. These American articles began about two
                        months after the first of the English news reports, a period sufficient for the English newspapers to reach the American press. The
                        apparent errors consisted of substituting <placeName>Greenwich</placeName> for <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> as the source of
                        the coppers and substituting "forty tons" for "many tons" as to the amount of coinage from one die pair. </p>

                        correction. To the credit of the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Centinel </hi> , however, it added a following paragraph describing in detail the 1776
                        Continental Currency coinage in pewter, asserting that it was "the first money struck by Congress in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> ." </p>
               <p> The <hi rend="italic">Daily Advertiser</hi> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , on May 26, 1786,
                        then copied the corrected English news of March 16, 1786, naming <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> as the source and "many tons" as
                        the amount of coinage. </p>
               <p> There probably are more news articles on the subject to be found in the American press, but the above group fully demonstrates some <pb n="89"/> carelessness. Not only did American newspapers copy the English press with no investigation, but they copied one another in
                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> in the same manner, and were sometimes unaware of what they had
                        previously printed. </p>
               <p> They left intact the corrected English news source of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage. They also indicated the coins were
                        something new and therefore newsworthy. </p>
               <p> It has been pointed out by <persName>Walter Breen</persName> and by <persName>Philip L. Mossman</persName> that 40 tons of
                        copper coin from one pair of dies would be over 5,000,000 pieces, an impossible feat. Was this to stimulate reader-ship by asserting
                        that there was a large specific weight of coppers rather than "many tons?" In the <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi> , the
                        second definition of the word "forty" is "Used indefinitely to express a large number." As an example of such use, <persName>Shakespeare's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> (Act III, Scene i, lines 243-44) is cited in which Coriolanus is bragging about his fighting ability
                        by saying "On faire ground I could beat fortie of them." In American colloquial usage the expression "like forty" is cited as meaning
                        "with immense force or vigor" or "like anything." A quotation from <persName>Harriet Beecher Stowe's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> (1852) reads, "I has principles and I sticks to them like forty." These prominent usages show
                        that "forty" is not always used as a specific number but can be used as a substantial indefinite amount. The American newspapers were
                        apparently using such a slang meaning. </p>
               <p> It is surprising that all specific American comment on the NOVA CONSTELLATIO coinage took place during the month of May 1786, and then
                        seems to have been forgotten. The next mention of the coin in print in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName>
                        seems to have occurred in 1789, when <persName>John Beale Bordley</persName> of <placeName>Maryland</placeName> proposed a new
                        coinage system for the <placeName>United States</placeName> and in describing what had been in circulation included the 1783 NOVA
                        CONSTELLATIO copper coin under the name " <placeName>U.S.</placeName> " and gave its weight as 145 grains. <ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> The part of that coinage dated 1785 was not mentioned as date differences were not then considered of sufficient
                        importance. </p>

               </head>
               <p> In 1995, <persName>Mike Ringo</persName> presented his discovery that certain identical number and letter punches were used in
                        preparation of the dies for <persName>Crosby</persName> variety 1-A of the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers, for the 1783
                        GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO copper ( <ref target="#fig-36">fig. 6</ref> ) and for some English and Irish counterfeit halfpence. <ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref> This is particularly evident in the deformed 3 in the date of the two first mentioned pieces. He also
                        shows that stylistically some of these coins <pb n="90"/> have similar features. There is virtually no possibility that the dies for the
                        GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coppers would have been prepared in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> because pieces of
                        satirical coinage in the category of evasion halfpence which were extensively produced in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and <placeName>Ireland</placeName> with humorous and unofficial legends had no American <hi rend="italic">raison

               </figure>
               <p> Some difference of opinion has existed as to what message the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coppers were intended to convey. It is obvious that the
                        1783 date corresponds with the date of the Treaty of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> ending the American
                        Revolution but it was then an amusing and obvious <hi rend="italic">double entendre</hi> to be vague in indicating which <persName>George won</persName> , <persName>George</persName>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> or <persName>George III</persName> . The reverse device is also
                        deliberately ambiguous. The enclosure of 13 vertical bars is intended to be subtle with the <hi rend="italic">fleur de lys</hi> on each
                        of the four corners of the enclosure. This design represents the 13 former English colonies and the assistance the French gave to the
                            <placeName>United States</placeName> during the American Revolution. Behind the enclosure is a female figure with a sprig in one
                        hand and a staff in the other. If it were a figure of free <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> there should be
                        a liberty cap on the top of the staff and if a representation of Britannia a trident on top of the staff. The top end of the staff has a
                        slight bulge leaving a choice as to whether the enclosure is protecting a figure of free <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> or is restraining Britannia. </p>
               <p> The interrelationship of the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coinage and the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage is important evidence of the
                        English production of both coinages. If the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coinage is of English manufacture then this is another reason not to
                        challenge the English source of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage since some of their characteristics are the same. </p>
               <p> The GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coppers were said to have circulated first in <placeName>Georgia</placeName> , then <placeName>Virginia</placeName> , next in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> and later in <placeName>Florida</placeName> . <ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref> No factual support for these comments has been found <pb n="91"/> for their first promulgation and, therefore, they should
                        not be accepted without further justification. </p>
               <p> It is of interest to note that the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coinage spells its motto VOCE POPOLI in Italianate style instead of using VOCE
                        POPULI which is more appropriately spelled on the 1760 Irish halfpenny tokens. Similarly by error an L is omitted in CONSTELATIO in the
                        1783 obverse variety 3, such die being reused on the 1785 obverse variety 1. </p>
               <p> The date 1783 on the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coins appears to be used to correlate with the legends and devices rather than be the date of
                        their production and circulation just as the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers dated 1783 appears to be copied from the 1783 U.S.
                        patterns rather than be the date of their production and circulation. </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">A Change of Artisans</hi>
               </head>
               <p> When variety 1-A of NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers is compared to other 1783 varieties it can be noted that variety 1-A is
                        independent in punches and in quality of workmanship. There is a major die defect in the NOVA CONSTELLATIO obverse variety 1, there
                        being a large raised line running under TI and into the adjacent O and having small dentils extending from one side of it. Of the many
                        examples of this coin which are known, all have this defect. It appears to have been caused by a hardened gang punch for small dentils
                        having fallen accidentally on an unhardened completed NOVA die. The resulting shape of the defect is not curved sufficiently to have
                        been caused by a gang punch usable for the die on which it fell, but the punch seems to have been made for some larger coin or medal. </p>
               <p> The NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage other than 1783 variety 1-A is of superior die and planchet quality. This improvement
                        indicates a change of artisans and may have been demanded by the purchasers or by happenstance. This could have easily occurred in <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> where many diesinkers were at work. The past assertions that <persName>Thomas Wyon</persName> or
                        a member of that highly skilled Wyon family working in <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> was responsible for the improvement seems
                        justified but so far is without the extent of proof which researchers seek. </p>
               <p> In 1965, <persName>Robert A. Vlack</persName> stated that the <persName>Thomas Wyon</persName> attribution was valid because
                        identical letter punches were used on other British made dies known to be cut by <persName>Thomas Wyon</persName> for American
                        coppers with various other legends and dated 1785, 1786 or without date. Bushnell merely uses the name <persName>Wyon</persName> .

               <p> In what he calls "An Exercise in Fact and Supposition," <persName>Everett T. Sipsey</persName> in 1965 asserted that "three
                        definitely and four possible" letter punches used on the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO variety <persName>Crosby</persName> 2-B and on the
                        NOVA EBORAC variety <persName>Crosby</persName> 1-A were identical, but this position should be disregarded as it seems to be
                        without foundation. He also alleges that the reverse of the 1785 <placeName>Vermont</placeName> copper coinage and the NOVA
                        CONSTELLATIO private coppers had "almost identical device punches," a self destructive comment. While die punches might have been

                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> copper coinage also furnishes evidence relating to the period when the first NOVA CONSTELLATIO private
                        copper coinage was brought from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers were originally authorized on June 15, 1785,
                        but the legislation was modified on October 27, 1785, to reduce the weight of copper content ( <ref target="#fig-37">fig. 7</ref> ). The
                        first <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers were struck with the lower weight standard. That coinage did not take place until after
                        October 27, 1785, but the first dies could have been prepared at any time after the original June authorization. The <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers commenced with Green Mountain obverses, three varieties dated 1785, followed by another three dated 1786.
                        The reverse dies featured <placeName>Vermont</placeName> 's desire to be recognized as the fourteenth state, using "STELLA. QUARTA.
                        DECIMA." in that order as shown by the placement of stops between the words on the reverses of coppers dated 1785 (not 1786). The device
                        had the Eye of Providence with 13 sets of rays and 13 stars, but it might have been better promotion for <pb n="93"/>
                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> to have used 14 sets of rays and 14 stars in its design. It is important to note that the three
                        reverses of the 1785 <placeName>Vermont</placeName> Green Mountain coppers ( <placeName>Bressett</placeName> A, B, and C) have
                        widening bifurcated rays and the two reverses of the 1786 <placeName>Vermont</placeName> Green Mountain coppers ( <placeName>Bressett</placeName> D and E) have pointed rays ( <ref target="#fig-38">fig. 8</ref> ). There were no widening bifurcated or blunt rays
                        on the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO U.S. patterns prepared by Benjamin Dudley, only pointed rays, and, therefore, the <placeName>Dudley</placeName> patterns could not have influenced the first <placeName>Vermont</placeName> reverse designs unless there were
                        abandoned alternate <placeName>Dudley</placeName> drawings (no drawing of any design is known). </p>

               </figure>
               <p> The widening bifurcated long rays on the three reverses of the 1785 <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers are similar to the
                        widening bifurcated long rays on obverse 3 of the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers (identical to obverse 1 of the 1785 NOVA CONSTELLATIO
                        coppers). A major difference between them however is that the three reverses of the 1785 <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers have
                        13 short bifurcated rays whereas the obverse of 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO variety 3 has 26 short separated linear rays. </p>
               <p> The chronology of the use of the widening rays on the first <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coinage makes it reasonable to conclude
                        that William Coley of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , the first <placeName>Vermont</placeName>
                        diesinker, saw an example of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage with widening bifurcated rays before making the 1785 <placeName>Vermont</placeName> dies rather than vice versa. This must have occurred in the latter part of the year 1785, a time frame
                        which coordinates with the March 1786 English newspaper accounts of the appearance of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage in
                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> and which takes into account the normal delays of a personal trip or
                        sending mail or dispatches by trans-Atlantic shipping to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> . It follows that
                        the pointed ray design on the 1786 <placeName>Vermont</placeName> Green Mountain coppers was copied from one of the 1783 or 1785 NOVA
                        CONSTELLATIO pieces with a pointed ray design. <ref target="#CH5-n20">20</ref>

               <p> In the September 26, 1787 entry in the diary of Rev. <persName>William Bentley</persName> of <placeName>Salem</placeName> ,
                            <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> , there is a description of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers (using CONSTELLATIO NOVA
                        in that word order) and attributing the coins to the authority of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . This error was obviously caused by
                        the similarity of the 1785 and early 1786 <placeName>Vermont</placeName> reverses to the NOVA CONSTELLATIO obverses. </p>

               <p> As to how the examples of or designs for NOVA CONSTELLATIO coins came to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>
                        in time to be copied for the private production of those coppers, one need only realize that at least three of the 1783 NOVA
                        CONSTELLATIO <persName>Robert Morris</persName> patterns did actually go to Britain. The 5 unit 1783 copper pattern was described
                        in an entry on May 15, 1784, in the diary of <persName>Samuel Curwen</persName> (originally from <placeName>Salem</placeName> ,
                            <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> ) who as a sincere Tory was living in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and was presented with the coin by "a young <persName>Bartlet</persName> [ <hi rend="italic">sic</hi> ]," a
                        merchant from <placeName>Salem</placeName> , <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> , who had just come from <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . <ref target="#CH5-n21">21</ref> Whether the messenger was a relative of <persName>Josiah Bartlett</persName> , a signer of the Declaration of Independence for New Hampshire and a dedicated and politically
                        powerful patriot, is not ascertained. <persName>Josiah Bartlett</persName> was in <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> at the
                        time. </p>
               <p> One of the two 100 unit 1783 U.S. patterns with a decorated edge first appeared in a Scottish auction in 1884, and was previously
                        unpublished and new to numismatists. It had been found in a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> pawn shop. The
                        100 unit 1783 U.S. pattern with a plain edge surfaced as part of the <persName>John G. Murdoch</persName> collection when it was
                        auctioned by <persName>Sotheby</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in 1903, and was
                        previously unpublished and unknown to American numismatists. <ref target="#CH5-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p> The three above described 1783 U.S. patterns which first appeared in Britain after being struck in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> had not remained with the 500 unit and 1000 unit patterns which the family of Charles Thomson, the first
                        Secretary of the Continental Congress, had retained and which came into the numismatic market in 1872 through <persName>John W.
                            Haseltine</persName> . <persName>Crosby</persName> , in 1875, knew that a 5 unit U.S. pattern had existed and that a 100 unit U.S.
                        pattern probably existed, but had no information on any of the three 100 unit pieces. </p>
               <p> Thus a decorated edge 100 unit U.S. pattern and the plain edge 100 unit U.S. pattern could easily have been sent to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> by <persName>Robert Morris</persName> or by anyone to whom he had given their
                        possession. These and the 5 unit piece were the lowest denominations in the pattern series and thus were of insignificant intrinsic
                        value and importance. There seemed to be no effort for the ownership of the <pb n="95"/> 1783 U.S. patterns to be retained by the <placeName>United States</placeName> as <persName>Charles Thomson</persName> and his heirs handled the 500 and 1000 unit pieces as
                        personal belongings without concern or challenge. The period when the 100 unit pieces could have been sent to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> could easily have been more or less contemporary with the sending of the 5 unit piece to
                        Curwen in 1784. </p>

               </head>
               <p> The 1785 IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> coinage is tied into the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage and is helpful in
                        showing the English source of the private coinage as well as reinforcing the conclusion that the 1783 dated NOVA CONSTELLATIO pieces
                        were produced in 1785 ( <ref target="#fig-39">fig. 9</ref> ). Three varieties of NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage obverse dies were
                        used in combination with the known IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> die ( <persName>Crosby</persName> obverses 2 and 3 of
                        1783 and obverse 3 of 1785) for experimental copper coinage and not made for production purposes. </p>

               </figure>
               <p> On the known 1785 IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> die (referred to by <persName>Crosby</persName> as the reverse), the
                        graceful seated female figure of an independent <placeName>Columbia</placeName> or free <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> holding a flag is a very skillfully cut device and carries out the same symbolism as the LIBERTAS JUSTITIA legends
                        on the private copper reverses. To convey the idea of LIBERTAS, there is substituted a liberty cap at the top of the flag staff and for
                        JUSTITIA, there is substituted an equal arm balance held in the left hand of the female figure. The dies for NOVA CONSTELLATIO pieces
                        with the LIBERTAS JUSTITIA reverses must have been cut prior to the pieces with the known IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName>
                        reverse because the former were copies of the 1783 U.S. patterns and the latter were not. Apparently the IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> pieces were made with the hope of obtaining a coining contract from the <placeName>United States</placeName> .
                        The known IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> die was brought or sent to the <placeName>United States</placeName> about 1787
                        and was used at Machin's Mills <pb n="96"/> in combination with an American made counterfeit British halfpenny as well as a crude <placeName>Vermont</placeName> obverse die. These resultant copper coins were poorly struck, perhaps deliberately to avoid simple
                        recognition. </p>
               <p> The superb quality of the known IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> reverse die was far beyond the skill of any American diecutter
                        and thus was obviously of English production as the only alternative. Being used in coinage combination with some NOVA CONSTELLATIO
                        obverses, one must conclude that the cutting of those NOVA obverses was also done in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> . <ref target="#CH5-n23">23</ref>
                  <persName>Crosby</persName> felt so strongly about it that he attributed that die work to <persName>Thomas Wyon</persName> . </p>
               <p> Heretofore only one IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> die has been recognized in genuine IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> coinage. In investigating that coinage for its NOVA CONSTELLATIO relationship, it was observed that another genuine
                        IMMUNE <placeName>COLUMBIA</placeName> die had also been used. One of those uses was in combination with a genuine NOVA CONSTELLATIO
                        die which was also heretofore unrecognized. The differences between each of these two newly recognized dies, and the dies similar to
                        them, are set out in Appendix 1, along with the characteristics of the false dies attributed to Dr. <persName>Francis S.
                            Edwards</persName> . </p>
               <p> The newly recognized genuine NOVA CONSTELLATIO die has not been observed in combination with any LIBERTAS JUSTITIA or LIBERTAS ET
                        JUSTITIA reverse die. </p>
               <p> The existence of two genuine IMMUNE COLUMBIA dies and the existence of a new NOVA CONSTELLATIO die seems to require a restudy of all
                        such strikings in copper, silver and gold, whether over host coins or not, whether with or without decorated edges, and including casts,
                        electrotypes, forgeries made from cut dies, forgeries made from dies created by transfer from genuine or false coins, or a combination
                        of both. Hopefully this research will soon be undertaken. <ref target="#CH5-n24">24</ref>

                  <pb n="99"/> to conduct the business. The capital for each partner was set at £5,000 in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> currency in specie at 7 shillings 6 pence per <placeName>Mexican</placeName> Dollar for a total of £15,000
                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> currency. Each <persName>Morris</persName> signed the

                        in June 1784, and the name of the firm changed to Constable, Rucker, &amp; Co. Unfortunately the letter book and accounts from late 1784
                        through 1786 seem to be missing and only a few documents from that period have survived; none relate to coinage. Rucker left for France
                        about September 1784, and promptly thereafter established himself in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> where
                        he worked for the firm until his death in 1788, when he was visiting <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName>

                  <item n="(B)"> One or more examples of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO 1783 U.S. patterns (probably not a drawing of one) was sent to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> for copying. This occurred in late 1784 or the early part of 1785, after
                            the North American mint project was abandoned. </item>
                  <item n="(C)"> The NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage was minted in <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> , <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and not Greenwich, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> , or
                            elsewhere. </item>
                  <item n="(D)"> NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage dated 1783 was not coined or circulated in 1783 or 1784. No one would strike copper
                            coinage in 1783 or 1784 and hold it for distribution until late 1785. </item>
                  <item n="(E)"> The date 1783 on the first NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage was copied from a pattern coin submitted to the <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> diesinkers rather than using the current date of 1785 when the dies were cut. </item>
                  <item n="(F)"> The amount of NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers coined was "many tons" but can be only roughly estimated now from average
                            die life, host coin use and survivorsrhip of examples. </item>
                  <item n="(G)"> The NOVA CONSTELLATIO 1783 die variety 1-A is the work of a different diesinker and coiner than other such coinage dated
                            1783 and all 1785 dated coinage. </item>
                  <item n="(H)"> The NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage dated 1783 was struck by the middle of 1785 and the coinage dated 1785 followed in
                            due course as production continued. Mossman shows that planchet weight deviation for 1783 dated coinage was reduced by the time the
                            1785 dated coinage was prepared. </item>

                  <item n="(K)"> The American publicity on NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage in May 1786, only attempted to repeat the English publicity
                            of March 1786, introducing inaccuracies and adding nothing pertinent. </item>
                  <item n="(L)"> The timing of English publicity on NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage showed that it was in American circulation in

                            merchant or gentleman who ordered the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers was unreliable because <persName>Bushnell</persName>

                  <item n="(P)"> The 1786 NOVA CONSTELLATIO coinage was the work of a much inferior diesinker and coiner than the pieces dated 1785,
                            leading to the belief that such 1786 coinage was either anticipating an order as part of the private coinage enterprise or was

                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> , as an independent republic, issued copper coins during a period when the <placeName>United
                            States</placeName> were struggling without a Federal coinage. <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers predate the much needed state
                        coppers produced before the establishment of an American Federal mint. Several excellent references on <placeName>Vermont</placeName>
                        copper coins have been previously published. This paper will not duplicate die variety descriptions found in other sources but will
                        instead attempt to place these coins in their proper historical context. The iconography of the designs will be discussed to learn what
                        message the coins made or attempted to make. In the end, the coinage lost the meaning implied by the inscriptions. </p>

               <p> On July 4, 1609, the French explorer, <persName>Samuel de Champlain</persName> ("the father of New France"), discovered the lake
                        that was named for him. On July 30, he fought the <placeName>Iroquois</placeName> , the first of many battles for control of the
                        waterway. The lake and the <placeName>Hudson River</placeName> formed part of an important water transportation corridor between
                            <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> City, with its harbor on the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>
                        , and <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> on the <placeName>St. Lawrence River</placeName> . Forts were
                        established along this route at <placeName>Ticonderoga</placeName> and <placeName>Crown Point</placeName> . To the west stretched
                        the <placeName>Adirondack Mountains</placeName> . The land to the east of this route was dominated by the Green Mountain, named <hi rend="italic">Vert Mont</hi> in French. The name of the area became <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . The Crown Point military
                        road crossed <placeName>Vermont</placeName> between <placeName>Charlestown</placeName> , <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> ,
                        and <placeName>Crown Point</placeName> , <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> . </p>
               <p> The eastern side of the Green Mountains drains south down the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> River. The western watershed flows
                        north by Otter Creek and Lake Champlain down the Richeleau River to the St. Lawrence. A small area in the southwest corner slopes south
                        down the Hudson River. The typography, somewhat like the population, was pulled in several directions. </p>
               <p> Control of Lake Champlain was an important military objective during the French and Indian Wars. On July 8, 1758, the French defeated a
                        larger British force at Fort Ticonderoga. A year later, on July 26, 1759, the British won control of the lake. The city of Montreal fell
                        to British troops under Lord Jeffrey Amherst on September 8, 1760. With a sense of security, settlers began to move into the territory
                        now known as <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . The royal governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth, made 131 land grants between
                        1749 and 1763, known as the <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> Grants. </p>

                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> claimed the same area which they granted to others. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> ceded large tracts to wealthy owners who leased parcels to tenant
                        farmers. The <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> model, typical of New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>
                        , favored small farms operated by resident owners. The land dispute was presented to King <persName>George III</persName> who
                        recognized the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> claims in 1764 and ordered holders of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> Grants to surrender their lands or pay <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> . In 1770, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> Supreme Court invalidated all <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> Grants. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ethan Allen</persName> and his brothers had speculated heavily in lands in the eastern Champlain valley and by 1772 they
                        owned 77,000 acres. The Green Mountain Boys were organized under the leadership of <persName>Ethan Allen</persName> to resist <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> authority. The Green Mountain Boys destroyed or confiscated property,
                        administered whippings, and sent the victims back to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> . The Yankees
                        considered them to be patriots while the Yorkers called them outlaws. The actions of the Green Mountain Boys were more symbolic than
                        military victories. No armed force from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> was ever sent against them
                        and no lives were lost. Any action was generally taken against individual sheriffs, surveyors, and justices of the peace by large groups
                        of armed men where resistance would have been futile. The land holders successfully defended their claims against the agents of the
                            <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> landlords. </p>
               <p> The Champlain basin was on the Quebec side of the Proclamation Line of October 7, 1763, the boundary that separated the American
                        colonies from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> and forbade settlement west of the Appalachians. The trade
                        routes from the <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> Grants led to <placeName>Quebec</placeName> and the <placeName>St.
                            Lawrence River</placeName> and thus the area had a stronger allegiance to <placeName>Quebec</placeName> than to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> . </p>
               <p> At the time, the residents of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> outnumbered the settlers in <placeName>Vermont</placeName> by about four to one. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , which had
                        greater economic power and the strength of law, considered the use of force against <placeName>Vermont</placeName> but this was more
                        talk than action. They were generally apathetic about the <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> Grants whose residents were tenacious
                        in defense of their claims. What they lacked in numbers, they possessed in spirit. </p>

                        Benedict Arnold was commissioned as a colonel by <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> for the same purpose of raising a regiment to

                        arrived in the area without troops. The two vied for leadership and reached a compromise of necessity. On May 10, 1775, 83 Americans
                        under the joint leadership of Allen and Arnold demanded the surrender of the 45-man garrison of British troops at Fort Ticonderoga, much
                        of which burned in 1773, and had been all but abandoned. The fort was taken without a shot being fired. The next day colonial troops
                        under Seth Warner captured another weak objective at Crown Point. Arnold took Fort St. <persName>John</persName> on May 18. It was
                        the first offensive campaign of the Revolutionary War and opened the way for an American expedition against Montreal. </p>
               <p> The Champlain valley fell under the control of the Allens in the name of the Continental Congress. Two hundred British cannon, captured
                        along with other crucial military supplies, were dragged across <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> to be used by Washington in the
                        siege of <placeName>Boston</placeName> against the forces of British General William Howe. That victory was recognized with the first
                        medal authorized by the Continental Congress. Allen hoped that the Continental Congress would also recognize an obligation and support
                        the <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> Grants in their dispute with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> . </p>
               <p> Ethan Allen participated in the American expedition against Montreal. The strategy was for <persName>Allen</persName> and <persName>Colonel John Brown</persName> to land on the island before dawn and attack Montreal from opposite sides. Brown failed to
                        land his troops and the unsupported Allen, unable to retreat across the river in daylight, was easily defeated. He was captured on
                        September 25, 1775, and sent to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in chains. After two years, he was
                        returned to <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> in a prisoner exchange. The Americans eventually captured
                        Montreal in November 1775, but the offensive stalled at Quebec. Montreal was recaptured by the British in July 1776. </p>
               <p> Thirteen American colonies declared their independence on July 4, 1776. <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was not among them. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> still claimed land as far east as the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> River, while <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> claimed the land from a line 20 miles east of the Hudson
                        River. These two claims overlapped to include the area that became <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . </p>
               <p> The British strategy for the northern campaign was to split the New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> states
                        from the rest of the country. Once New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> was brought into submission, the
                        southern states would follow. <pb n="120"/>
                  <persName>General William</persName> Howe attacked <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> on August
                        27, 1776, but his intended drive north to <placeName>Albany</placeName> was thwarted by strong resistance from the troops of General
                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> . </p>
               <p> General <persName>John Burgoyne's</persName> expedition with 9,000 troops marched from Montreal to meet Howe in Albany. His troops
                        retook Fort Ticonderoga, July 5, 1777, and marched south. A rear guard action, fought at Hubbardton on July 7, 1777, was the only battle
                        in what is now <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . The British won the battle but the colonists were granted time to regroup. German
                        mercenaries under <persName>Colonel Fredrich Baum</persName> marched to <placeName>Bennington</placeName> , <placeName>Vermont</placeName> , on a foraging expedition. They were met by American troops near <placeName>Bennington</placeName> where they
                        were defeated by <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> militia under Seth Warner, August 16. Although this took place about four miles
                        west of the present border of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> , it is considered a <placeName>Vermont</placeName> battle and is
                        commemorated by monuments in <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . For the 1927 Sesquicentennial of the event, a commemorative half dollar
                        was struck honoring Ira Allen on the obverse and the battle of <placeName>Bennington</placeName> on the reverse. August 16 is a legal
                        holiday as <placeName>Vermont</placeName> honors <placeName>Bennington</placeName> Battle Day. The state clearly claims the battle
                        beyond its border. </p>
               <p> The weakened forces of Burgoyne ran into those of General <persName>Horatio Gates</persName> in battles at Freeman's Farm and Bemis
                        Heights. Rather than moving north to support Burgoyne, General Howe withdrew from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> and relocated to the Chesapeake Bay region near Yorktown. Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga October 17, 1777. The
                        northern offensive failed and the loss of a British army was a severe blow. This increased confidence in the American cause brought
                        France into the war officially in June 1778. </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was not threatened again during the Revolution. One reason may have been the lack of military
                        objectives while another was the negotiations and diplomacy of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> leaders. </p>

                        state name. The Windsor Convention, held between July 2 and 8, 1777, wrote the constitution and renamed the republic <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . The new Constitution granted the vote to all male citizens and forbade slavery. </p>

               <p> Residents of the <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> Grants had divided loyalties. A majority had moved to the area from <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and strongly identified with that state to the south. Those who had paid <persName>Governor
                            Wentworth</persName> for land supported the claims of authority made by <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> to the east. Many
                        Americans who remained loyal to the British during the Revolution, would have identified with the government of the neighbor to the
                        north. Almost no one favored the authority of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , to the west,
                        although that state had the strongest legal claim. While being torn in all directions, perhaps independence was the inevitable choice. </p>
               <p> American independence was not secured by the Declaration of Independence but had to be defended in battle, verified by a treaty with
                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and consolidated under a written Constitution. In much the same way,
                        the sovereignty of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> only started with the declaration of independence. They fought for that
                        independence against the British and the authority of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> . They
                        produced a written constitution and governed under its provisions. <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was aggressive in expanding
                        territory under its control, annexing towns across their borders with both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> and New Hampshire. </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> bills of credit, issued in 1781, featured a design showing a chain with thirteen links and a
                        fourteenth unconnected link, symbolic of the proximity to, but lack of, connection to the Union. Other attempts to authorize paper money
                        failed to get the approval of the <placeName>Vermont</placeName> Assembly. Much trade was conducted by barter and attempts were made
                        to establish a cash value for various commodities. In the conduct of business, the monetary standard used was frequently based on the
                        value of a bushel of wheat. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Thomas Chittenden</persName> , involved with the organizing conventions, was elected first governor in 1778. He lost the
                        election in 1789 to <persName>Moses Robinson</persName> but was returned to office in 1790, where he served until 1797. </p>
               <p> Ethan Allen, with the support of his brothers Ira and <persName>Levi</persName> , and <persName>Thomas Chittenden</persName> ,
                        entered negotiations with Great Britain. The publicly stated reason was to mediate a prisoner exchange but these controversial Haldimond
                        negotiations also involved the prospect of British recognition of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> and acceptance of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> as a British province. </p>
               <p> If <placeName>Vermont</placeName> had been one of the American states, such contact with the enemy would have been treason, but as an
                        independent republic, they had the right to negotiate an independent peace. The Haldimond negotiations may have been an attempt to
                        pressure the <placeName>United States</placeName> to recognize <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . </p>
               <pb n="123"/>
               <p> One of the most active industries in the republic was the practice of law. The government and its people were frequently plagued with
                        lawsuits over property rights and the collection of debts such that the desire to "kill all the lawyers" had popular support. In 1786,
                        the self styled "Regulators" attempted to disrupt the conduct of the courts and took over a courthouse in <placeName>Rutland</placeName> . The rioters were repulsed by hastily mobilized government troops. </p>
               <p> In 1787, <persName>Alexander Hamilton</persName> introduced a bill in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> Assembly to recognize the independence of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> but it was defeated by the Senate. <persName>Ethan Allen</persName> and Governor <persName>Chittenden</persName> supported continued independence for <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . Congressional representatives from northern states felt favorably toward <placeName>Vermont</placeName> statehood while representatives from southern states supported the admission of Kentucky, a slave state. The concept
                        of balancing admission of a northern state with a southern state was established early in the history of <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . </p>
               <p> The issues that divided <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> and the <placeName>United States</placeName> were not fully resolved
                        with the end of the War of Revolution. In the event of another war, an independent <placeName>Vermont</placeName> had little defense.
                        Caught between the much stronger <placeName>United States</placeName> and <placeName>British Canada</placeName> , an ultimate
                        alignment with one of the sides was inevitable. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ethan Allen</persName> died February 12, 1789, and some of the spirit of independence died with him. On October 7, 1790,
                        a meeting in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> City set the present western boundary for <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . The land claims were settled with a payment by <placeName>Vermont</placeName> of $30,000. A levy of
                        one-half penny per acre was assessed to raise these funds. A conventio in <placeName>Bennington</placeName> ratified the Constitution
                        of the <placeName>United States</placeName> , January 6, 1791, and <placeName>Vermont</placeName> petitioned for statehood. <persName>George Washington</persName> presented the <placeName>Vermont</placeName> petition to Congress on February 9, 1791, and
                        signed the Act granting statehood nine days later. </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> , an independent republic for 14 years, became the fourteenth state in the Union on March 4, 1791. The
                        citizens celebrated under a flag with not 14 but 15 stars and stripes. Although <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> was not to be
                        admitted until June 1, 1792, they were already acknowledged as part of the Union. <q> The Republic's childhood was a continual
                            nerve-taxing rumpus, a hurly-burly of shaken fists and half drawn swords, of outraged yells and threatening bellows, of contusions
                            and lacerations which should have turned any young thing, including the infant Hercules, into a jittering neurasthenic, a depraved
                            bully, or a corpse. <ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref>

                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> copper coinage has been well described in the literature. Reprints are available for several of these
                        sources where the originals are scarce. </p>
               <p> In 1859, <persName>Montroville W. Dickeson</persName> produced the first encyclopedia of American coins, <hi rend="italic"> The

                        power. </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Dickeson wrote,</q>
                  <q> Nothing could be more beautifully expressive that the device upon these coins. A supreme overruling power had truly cast the rays of
                            approval upon the thirteen infant States of the American confederacy, in their contest for liberty and the just rights of humanity,
                            against the then, as now, leading power of the world. The rays of Omnipotence protected them, and finally led them from vassalage to
                            victory. </q>
               </p>
               <p> This eloquent interpretation of the design failed to acknowledge that <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was not part of the 13 states of
                        the Confederation. </p>
               <p> Sylvester S. Crosby included text of the significant documents in the standard reference, <hi rend="italic">Early American Coins</hi> ,
                        published in 1875. He identified eight major types and 28 die varieties. Crosby referred to <placeName>Vermont</placeName> as a state
                        although he acknowledged that it was not part of the Union until 1791. </p>

                  <persName>John M. Richardson</persName> , who wrote "The Copper Coins of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> ," for <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> of 1947, increased the number of die varieties to 35. <placeName>Vermont</placeName> die varieties are

                        the pound or about 152.2 grains. A federal resolution of July 6, 1785, set a standard of 157.5 grains for future cents, although none
                        were produced until 1787. When <placeName>Vermont</placeName> learned that their coppers exceeded the Confederation standards, the
                        weight was reduced to four penny-weight fifteen grains (111 grains). The reduced <placeName>Vermont</placeName> standard was in
                        recognition that many of the coppers then circulating were underweight. </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was then, and remains, sparsely populated. They were neither a significant producer of products for
                        sale outside the republic nor a major consumer of products produced in the <placeName>United States</placeName> . <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers circulated well within the republic but little beyond the borders. </p>
               <p> Production from the Rupert Mint was crude even by colonial standards. High quality steel needed for coin dies was not available. The
                        copper coinage suffers from lamination defects indicative of impure copper or unsophisticated smelting techniques. </p>

               </head>
               <p> The <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers of 1785 show on the obverse the sun rising over the tree covered Green Mountain with a
                        plough in the foreground. The obverse legend, <placeName>VERMONTS</placeName> RES. PUBLICA, refers to the Republic of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . One 1785 obverse die has the legend <placeName>VERMONTIS</placeName> . The 1786 obverse has the
                        legend VERMONTENSIUM RES. PUBLICA. </p>
               <p> The reverse design on these coins features the all-seeing eye with 13 long and 13 short rays pointing to 13 stars, a design quite
                        similar <pb n="126"/> to that seen on NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers. The reverse bore the legend QUARTA DECIMA STELLA meaning the fourteenth
                        star. </p>

               </figure>
               <p> Design of the first <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers is attributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                            York</placeName> goldsmith and diecutter Colonel William Coley, indicating that <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was still somewhat
                        reliant upon <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> . </p>
               <p> The obverse was an excellent symbol of local identification. The Green Mountains were the dominant feature of local geography while the
                        rising sun symbolized the emergence of the republic. <persName>Breen</persName> believed the rising sun was derived from <persName>Paul Revere's</persName> rising sun on 1779 paper money of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> but it also is possible
                        that both are derived from earlier images. <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was not then and is not now a significant producer of
                        cultivated crops. The trees represented the state economy better than the plough, which was an optimistic symbol of agriculture for a
                        state with timber as its prime export. </p>
               <p> While art should not be interpreted too literally, the sun rising over the mountains can, in retrospect, be interpreted as symbolic.
                        This is a view from the western side of the mountains, the region that led the fight against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> and for independence. </p>
               <p> Later writers would comment that the reverse legend indicated the desire of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> citizens to become the
                        fourteenth state in the American Union. Another interpretation would be that the legend was not so much a statement of desire as a
                        statement of fact. <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was the fourteenth star in the new constellation. <placeName>Vermont</placeName>
                        was a part of a loose economic union with the neighboring states. Trade across the borders was not impeded by tariffs and the currency
                        of the American states was accepted in trade in <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was not subject to the jurisdiction of the American Confederation. Some <placeName>Vermont</placeName> residents had fled from the Union to escape debt or the law. One such resident was colonial coiner <persName>Samuel Atlee</persName> who fled to <placeName>Vermont</placeName> to escape debts in the <placeName>United
                            States</placeName> . There was some justification for considering <placeName>Vermont</placeName> as an outlaw state. </p>

               </head>
               <p> On October 24, 1786, the <placeName>Vermont</placeName> Assembly passed a bill authorizing coinage with "on the one side, a head with
                        the motto auctoritate <placeName>Vermont</placeName> ensium, abridged—on the reverse, a woman, with the letters INDE: ET: LIB:—for
                        Independence and Liberty." The new design was an imitation of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coppers that clearly resembled
                        circulating British coppers. </p>
               <p> The 1786 portrait designs have an obverse bust facing left and the abbreviated legend AUCTORI VERMONT meaning By the Authority of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> . The <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coppers had the legend AUCTORI CONNEC. meaning, similarly,
                        By the Authority of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> . </p>
               <p> The obverse portrait was not identified as an individual, a situation highly unusual in coin design. The similarity with King George
                        should not be interpreted as support for the British monarch. Instead it was a symbol of conformity to the appearance of the accepted
                        circulating coppers. </p>
               <p> The reverse design had a seated figure representing "the Genius of <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> ," or
                        alternately "the Goddess of Liberty," virtually indistinguishable from the seated Britannia seen on British coppers. The shield on most
                        pieces showed the combined cross of <persName>Saint George</persName> , <placeName>Saint Andrew</placeName> and Saint <persName>Patrick seen</persName> on the familiar Union Jack flag. On one reverse die, the shield design had four sheaves of wheat, a
                        slight accommodation toward an American design. </p>
               <p> While the landscape coppers proclaimed independence by their design, the portrait coppers proclaimed independence by their legends. The
                        feeling of the citizens of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was turning from support for independence toward support for admission to
                        the Union. </p>

               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> was plagued with counterfeit and unauthorized copper coins and <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was not exempt. The last coinage was struck at the mint at Machin's Mills at <placeName>Newburgh</placeName> , <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> . Several of the collectible die varieties
                        were stuck outside of the Republic. </p>
               <p> One of the rarest counterfeits (RR-5), which copied the landscape design, is from an unidentified mint frequently included under the
                        generic term of "Bungtown" mint. </p>
               <p> Two die varieties struck at Machin's Mills defy the authorizing legislation. The imitation of British designs reached a climax with a
                        1788 obverse with the legend <persName>Georgius III</persName> Rex muled with a reverse of standard design (RR-31). Another muled a
                        standard obverse with a reverse with the almost indistinguishable legend Britannia (RR-13). The reverse die was mutilated to disguise
                        its earlier legend. </p>

               <p> Dickeson (and later <persName>Breen</persName> ) referred to these as Tory Coppers. Dickeson wrote, <q> Two years after the
                            acknowledgment of our independence by Great Britain, this coin—from the date—was thrust in some way upon republican <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . It is peculiar that there should have been such persistence in doing
                            what, at the time, could not have been agreeable <pb n="129"/> to the mass of the people; and then, in the designs—assuming a
                            connection between <persName>George</persName> III, and the Goddess of Liberty—is an act difficult to be either comprehended or
                            accommodated. </q>
               </p>
               <p> These pieces represent what may be the logical conclusion to the story of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers. The muling of dies
                        from independent <placeName>Vermont</placeName> with Britain designs does not represent a political union. Rather they indicate a
                        total disregard for the concept that the image stamped on a coin made it money. These were nothing more than round pieces of underweight
                        copper pretending to be money. </p>
               <p> The circulating copper coins of the era had no government backing. By July 1789, there was a surplus of coppers in commerce. Any that
                        were accepted in trade were severely discounted. By 1790, states repealed their authorization of coppers, partially to avoid receiving
                        coppers as taxes. The public rejection of copper coinage at a value above its weight made Federal coinage a necessity. </p>
               <p> Perhaps the unauthorized coinage represents the republic as well as does the authorized pieces. A defiance of centralized authority
                        characterized the republic and its individual citizens. </p>

               <p> Previous attempts to put <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers in a category have failed to recognize their true status. The term
                        "Colonial" coinage is not appropriate for <placeName>Vermont</placeName> pieces as well as for many of the other pieces lumped under
                        that term. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Kurth wrote</persName> , "It is customary for American collectors to refer to the copper coins of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> as 'colonial coins.' This is a deeply rooted error, due not so much to our ignorance of history as to our careless
                        habit of allowing our speech to be unduly influenced by what we repeatedly read in catalogues." The message of <persName>Kurth</persName> has been largely ignored. </p>
               <p> "Early American Coinage" works if <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> refers to the continent rather than the
                        country. However, coinage for what would become <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> is usually not included in
                        the same category. </p>
               <p> Including <placeName>Vermont</placeName> coppers with State coinage seems obvious, perhaps, but is still incorrect. Previous writers
                        have frequently mentioned that <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was not yet a state but still include <placeName>Vermont</placeName>
                        coinage with the coinage of other states. </p>
               <p> The coinage of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> truly deserves a category of its own. The coins were struck under the authority of an
                        independent sovereign republic and as such are unique among the coins that preceded coinage of the <placeName>United
                            States</placeName> Mint. </p>

               <p> When Sylvester Crosby published his seminal work on early American coinage in 1878, <ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> he called attention to
                        the "same peculiar letters [that] appear in several different dies," and concluded that "the natural inference is that all these dies
                        were made by the same person." He went on to describe an "A" "broken near the top," an "N" "irregular on the underside of the sloping
                        line," and a "P" "imperfect at the left of its foot." Crosby extended his examination to certain issues of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> and <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coppers where what appeared to be the same defective "A" and "N" letters
                        were seen. He deduced that the dies, from which those coppers with the same letters were struck, were sunk by the same individual.
                        Crosby could not determine whether the dies for these "different mints were made at one place, or whether the artist followed an
                        itinerant practice, and visited the mints as the occasion required." Crosby ended his discussion with the premise that <persName>James F. Atlee</persName> must have been responsible for many of these dies. </p>
               <p> The identification of Atlee as the engraver in question was based on the April 18, 1787, Machin's Mills indenture which reads: "and the
                        said <persName>Samuel Atlee</persName> , and <persName>James F. Atlee</persName> being possessed of certain implements for
                        carrying on said trade, do agree to lend them to the parties to these presents for and during the continuance of their copartnership
                        without any fee or reward for the same." <ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref>
                  <persName>Michael Hodder</persName> has touched upon the statements in this indenture in a 1991 research paper published in <hi rend="italic">CNL.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref> The Atlees' trade was a "manufactory of hardware" which has been traditionally accepted as a minting
                        operation. The only existing literary confirmation of <persName>James Atlee</persName> as a die puncher or engraver was contained
                        in a letter from <persName>Thomas N. Machin</persName> , the coiners grandson, to Dr. <persName>F.B. Hough</persName> of <placeName>Albany</placeName> , <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , by the reference to "Atlee, the
                        engraver..." <ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref> Also the <hi rend="italic">implements</hi> which the Atlees supplied to this partnership were
                        never defined and Crosby determined they must have been die-cutting tools, an interpretation which most later writers have accepted.
                        Crosby's assumption that Atlee was a die sinker whose broken "A" letter punch appeared across several copper series led him to attribute
                        many <placeName>Connecticuts</placeName> , <placeName>Vermonts</placeName> , <placeName>New Jerseys</placeName> , <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> -related issues and imitation British halfpence to him. Sipsey was
                        probably the first to point out that Atlee was not encountered in any literature as a silversmith, and, therefore, questioned Crosby's

                  <ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref> names <persName>James Atlee</persName> as the die engraver of many colonial coppers based primarily

                  <hi rend="bold">The Identical Matrix Punch Principle</hi>
               </head>
               <p> A research article by <persName>Peter Gaspar</persName> is of great importance in the study of die punch linking. <ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> He demonstrates that punches for sinking coin dies were being mass produced from a single matrix for
                        decades before the 1780s and therefore the occurrence of similar punches is entirely inadmissible evidence for establishing personnel or
                        equipment links among different mints. In other words, coins struck at different times and from various mints may look for all the world
                        as though they were made from dies sunk with the same punches, whereas they may only have been sunk by punches which, themselves, were
                        raised from an identical matrix. Thus punch linkages are now less meaningful evidence, because there could easily have been several sets
                        of identical punches in use at different mints, all at the same time! This punch manufacturing technology was English and there is
                        evidence that American silversmiths brought their steel punches from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> .
                            <ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref> Based on the above information, <pb n="134"/> the <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> can still be utilized as
                        a secondary tool, but as primary evidence to identify a die engraver or die sinker, its use must be interpreted with caution. One needs
                        to support any punch style evidence with other important factors such as planchet weight, die state analysis, obverse and reverse die
                        sharing, and overstriking data. </p>
               <p> There are other indications that engravers had a common source of letter punches available to them. The concept that each engraver was
                        obliged to make his own set of tools has been discarded not only by Gaspar but by other contemporary literary evidence. In his book on
                        Abel Buell, Lawrence Wroth, quotes an excerpt from the April 16, 1801 <hi rend="italic">American Mercury</hi> in which Buell offered
                        punches and dies for sale. <ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref> These references strengthen the idea that this individual did indeed make his
                        own punches instead of purchasing them from other sources such as silversmiths and/or estate sales. <ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref>

               <p> This investigator will first look at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> state coinage. Within this
                        grouping we see a broken "A" punch ( <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> ), with an intact thick right side and thin left side whose constant
                        flaw at the upper part progressively deteriorates from its partially broken ( <hi rend="italic">PBA</hi> ) state to fully broken ( <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> ) (see Table 1 below). Within the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> series, we
                        do see a progressive disintegration of the <hi rend="italic">BALPs</hi> based on die emission. As an example, as one proceeds away from
                        the early Rahway <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers, the BALP becomes more fully broken for this
                        type of <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> (figs. <ref target="#fig-48">1</ref> , <ref target="#fig-49">2</ref> ). The only major exception was
                        the different punch style in NOVA for the 26-S, 68-w, and 69-w varieties involving a thin left side, thick right side and with "wavy"
                        bases. </p>
               <p> These wavy bases require further explanation. This is the "bifurcation" phenomenon previously described in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers by Bressett <ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref> in response to an observation by
                        Barnsley <ref target="#CH7-n13">12</ref> who had reported the occurrence of two distinct styles on the bottom serifs of the R and I of
                        PLURIBUS on the Maris 67-v, presenting the appearance of a recut die. </p>

                  <p> Fig. 3: Maris 26-S showing a <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> in NOVA. Due to the "bifurcation" effect it is dissimilar to all other <hi rend="italic">BALPs</hi> in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> series except 68-w and 69-w.
                            Only the first "A" in NOVA shows the effect (i.e., curved bases). </p>
               </figure>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Bressett</placeName> explained that these changes were not the result of a recut die, but rather an artifact which
                        occurred during striking, since none of these early coppers had the benefit of a retaining collar to stop the blank from expanding.
                        Because the coins were struck on a manually operated press, the pressure was liable to vary according to the force exerted, and
                        occasionally, when subjected to excessive stress, the flan would spread more than usual in a radial direction. Under such conditions,
                        the toothed borders (on <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers) would elongate and the serifs on the
                        letters tended to curl upward toward the periphery producing a cleftlike appearance. This distortion occurs to a lesser degree on coins
                            <pb n="137"/> struck under normal pressure and is due to the fact that the periphery of the planchet spreads more rapidly than the
                        more central portions, especially when there is no collar. It is interesting to note that within the broken "A" <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers, only 26-S, 68 and 69-w exhibit the bifurcation phenomenon. </p>
               <p> The broken "A" letter punch noted above exists in two major styles—one which is fully broken ( <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> ) and the other
                        being partially broken ( <hi rend="italic">PB</hi> ). Only one distinct broken <hi rend="italic">"A"</hi> letter punch exists, within
                        the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> series as previously discussed (figs 1- <ref target="#fig-50">3</ref> ). The evidence compiled by this writer is presented in Table 1. The <hi rend="italic">PB/FB</hi> transition from an early
                        to a late Rahway emission seems to conform to all die state evidence retrieved for these die varieties. In the coppers listed in Table
                        1, it appears that the flaw in the "A" die progressed with use over time, thereby going from <hi rend="italic">PBA</hi> to <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> from the early to the late state emissions for the obverse varieties at Rahway Mills or early Elizabethtown.
                        The previously described singular matrix principle does not seem to interfere within the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> series; however we can never be certain that there was just a single letter punch involved that deteriorated
                        under constant use. </p>
               <p> One must be mindful of another theoretical circumstance, occurring at the time of die sinking, which could alter the appearance of the
                        broken "A", or any letter for that matter, in the legend of the struck coin. A variable expression of any letter can be due to the
                        chisel-like shape of the letter punch whose actual profile, as it is sunk into the die, may be modified depending on the depth to which
                        it is sunk. The deeper the punch penetrates the die, the broader one might expect the legs of the letters to appear. If a broken punch
                        is sunk below the position of a punch defect, then the flawed part of the letter in the final die may appear different. This situation
                        is not diagnostic of the different letter styles between 26-S/68-w/69-w and the other varieties listed on Table 1 concerning the first
                        "A" in NOVA. These are different "styled" puncheons. </p>
               <p> The reader should consider the following major points while reviewing Table 1: </p>
               <list rend="bulleted">
                  <item> There is no variation within the non-broken <hi rend="italic">(NB), FB</hi> or <hi rend="italic">PB</hi> "A"s when comparing
                            similar <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> varieties. As an example, during the preparation of Table
                            1, the writer compared five different Maris <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> 13-J specimens; no
                            variation occurred between the first, third, and fourth "A"s (the second A which is linked to E in <placeName>CÆSAREA</placeName>
                            is considered not applicable, since it always remains unbroken). </item>
                  <item> It is interesting to note that the earlier emission varieties have a higher percentage of being <hi rend="italic">NB/PB</hi> than
                            being in a <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> status. <pb n="138"/> As an example, compare 13-J, a known early <placeName>Rahway</placeName> variety, based on its early reverse J die state with an intermediate issue (i.e., 33-U), and finally a late <placeName>Rahway</placeName> issue (i.e., 26-S). Note how it proceeds from an <hi rend="italic">NB/PB</hi> combination to a <hi rend="italic">PB</hi> fate and finally to a <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> existence. The "A"s eventually seem to fall apart in the
                            punches with time, and make their way to a <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> state. Does the Gaspar singular matrix principle introduce an
                            extraneous <hi rend="italic">PB</hi> or <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> punch into the picture? Possibly, but it seems not to interfere
                            to any degree in this state coinage, since all other evidence to date from other research studies complies with the die emission
                            sequence of Table 1 (i.e., when comparing the findings of <persName>Hodder</persName> in his paper on the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> Reverse J die <ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> and the well-documented 33-U/15-U
                            backdating event). In this case, the 1787 33-U was struck predominantly before the 1786 15-U variety based on reverse die state
                            analysis. The <hi rend="italic">PB/FB</hi> data in Table 1 confirms this emission sequence. </item>
                  <item> The Maris 26-S variety shows a distinctive <hi rend="italic">BALP,</hi> different from all other <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> s.
                            The <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> is the first "A" in NOVA. The typical <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New
                                Jersey</placeName>
                     <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> has a thicker right side and thinner left side with straight bases. As <ref target="#fig-50">fig.
                                3</ref> depicts, both sides are thinner and both bases "wavy." This phenomenon, however, is the result of bifurcation which was
                            previously described in <ref target="#fig-50">fig. 3</ref> . </item>
                  <item> The consistency of the <hi rend="italic">NB, PB,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> "A" letter punches is intriguing. It does
                            hint a singular letter punch which broke over time. </item>
                  <item> The only major difference noted within these <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> s occurred within the first "A" of NOVA for the
                            varieties 26-S, 68-w and 69-w. The fully broken "A" here is the result of bifurcation. The typical <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>
                     <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> has a thick right side, a thin left side and the broken part is on the upper left side. The broken "A"
                            on these three varieties is similar except that the serifs on both bases show the effects of bifurcation. </item>
                  <item> The gradual deterioration in the punch flaw does not discredit the Gaspar theory in my opinion. It only shows that all punches
                            demonstrate the ravages of continued use. The numismatist must also consider that the depth to which a punch is sunk may alter the
                            expression of the break, especially if it is partial. </item>
               </list>
               <p> Refer to Table 1 and <ref target="#fig-50">fig. 3</ref> for details on these differences. Several different styled <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> s within each series have been confirmed. See figs. 1-7 for an overview of the major types. </p>

                        of several defective punches. Thus it is inaccurate to perpetuate the notion that the same punches attributed to James Atlee for the
                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> series were used again for the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> series and vice versa. The systematic punch linking just by examining these two series indicates to the
                        numismatist that more concrete evidence is needed before such a claim can be substantiated. </p>
               <p> Could these 1786 issues ( <persName>Breen</persName> 742-46) be of <placeName>Newburgh</placeName> origin and be backdated and
                        produced in 1787? Interestingly, none of these <persName>Miller</persName> varieties exhibited the broken "N" as seen on several
                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> varieties. If these were Atlee's punches one would expect to see at
                        least one broken "N" among seven <persName>Miller</persName> varieties. Since the "A"s are of a different style between the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> and <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coppers, the evidence, i.e.
                            <persName>Atlee</persName> , which links these two series is becoming more tenuous. </p>

               <list rend="bulleted">
                  <item> The 1786 IMMUNIS COLUMBIA, Heraldic Eagle type issue is probably the first issue of a broken "A" letter punch, which may have
                            been struck in pre-Rahway, in the time frame from 1785 to November 1786, when <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New
                                Jersey</placeName> coppers were first struck. The letter punch seems similar in style to the NJ BALP (i.e., thick right and thin left
                            side, being broken at the upper left). </item>
                  <item> The <hi rend="italic">NB/PB/FB</hi> "A"s are consistent within each <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New
                                Jersey</placeName> variety examined. Early Rahway was denoted by a <hi rend="italic">NB/PB</hi> status, whereas late Rahway issues
                            exhibited a <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> status. This phenomenon strengthens one theory that the "A" punch may have broken further with
                            time and use, yielding the <hi rend="italic">NB/PB/FB</hi> transition. The depth to which the punch was sunk into the die is the
                            other possible theory. </item>
                  <item>
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> Maris varieties 68-w and 69-w and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> variety Maris 26-S in their "A"s in NOVA have similar "A" punches due to the
                            "bifurcation" phenomenon. Other letters in the obverse and reverse motifs for these three varieties also indicated punches with
                            curved bases. These are not new letter punches but is the result of metal flow, since these coins were not struck within a collar. </item>
                  <pb n="145"/>
                  <item> The writer concurs with <persName>Michael Hodder's</persName> conclusion that different "A" punches do exist between the
                            "state" coinages. Hence, systematic mint attributions utilizing the broken "A" punch, or any other letter punch for that matter, as
                            the only evidence, is to be discarded, since we can never confirm the fact that any individual punch was not unique to that mint due
                            to the availability of a common supply. </item>
                  <item> Not all <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coppers have the broken "A"s as previously identified. Also, some <placeName>Connecticuts</placeName> as the <persName>Miller</persName> 1-A did not consistently contain a broken "A."
                            Currently this phenomenon, which is not seen within the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> series, is
                            under a separate investigation. </item>
                  <item> Finally, the reader should now understand that punch-linking by itself is of no real consequence as an attribution tool, but is
                            only of a secondary value. Punch linking, coupled with stronger and more reliable evidence such as overstriking, die state analysis,
                            planchet weight and diameter readings, and obverse and reverse die sharing, are the primary tools needed to create the long term
                            confident attribution in all areas of future colonial coin research. </item>

            <p> The links between the <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> , <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> firm of <persName>Boulton</persName> , Watt &amp; Company and the <placeName>United States of America</placeName> embraced the half century
                    between the 1780s and the 1830s. Most of the contact bordered on the prosaic, involving nothing more exciting than the sale of copper cent
                    and half-cent planchets to the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint. <ref target="#CH8-n1">1</ref> But there were occasional hints
                    at greater prospects—possibilities of coinage, or even the sale of a new, steam-powered coining apparatus for the ramshackle <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> Mint. </p>
            <p> Such glittering opportunities had been forecast by events during the Confederation period, for in the middle and closing years of the 1780s,
                    no fewer than three chances for a Soho-made American coinage emerged and disappeared again, leaving no concrete products in their passing. </p>
            <p> Two of the three possibilities involved the state of <persName>South Carolina</persName> , and they were fostered by the nature of our
                    first national compact, the Articles of Confederation. Drawn up in 1777 and effective from 1781, that document was a direct reaction to the
                    immediate past—or how most Americans chose to see it. According to the prevalent view, a power-mad central government in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> had attempted to curb local freedoms in America, provoking a just War for American Independence.
                    Armed with this interpretation, the majority concluded that any domestic central government which might be set up must be kept weak, so as
                    not to infringe on individual or state autonomies. The Articles of Confederation, therefore, reserved most rights to the states; and this
                    included the powers to emit bills of credit and circulate coinage. A number of the sovereign states—and the <hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi>
               <placeName>Vermont</placeName> Republic—were taking advantage of the moneying possibilities by the middle of the 1780s. When <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> decided to join the group, a link between <placeName>Charleston</placeName> and Soho would be
                    forged. </p>
            <p> On March 22, 1786, the state's legislature passed an ordinance authorizing the creation of state coins in four denominations—pence and
                    halfpence, and shillings and sixpence. The former two were to be made of copper, the latter two of silver. The halfpence were to be struck
                    "according to the standard of British half pence," while the two silver coins "shall be of the same weight as English shillings and
                    sixpences, and contain an alloy proportioned to that of the French crowns"; a logical stipulation, in light of the fact that the French had
                    settled the area around <placeName>Charleston</placeName> and still enjoyed some influence there. The standard applied to the copper
                    penny was left unstated, for no such coin currently existed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> . </p>
            <p> Some £10,000 worth of coppers were to be struck, divided equally between the two denominations. They would join £20,000 in silver <pb n="155"/> coins, in a proportion of three shillings to every sixpence struck. The man responsible for this new state coinage would be a
                    certain Charles Borel. <ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p> Borel was currently a resident of Charleston. His preferred means of expression seems to have been French—a not-insurmountable barrier in a
                    French-influenced city. He had gone into business and prospered, and it was Borel who had made the coining proposal to the state, not the
                    other way around. The Act he secured gave him the responsibility of importing the coinage from abroad (for there was never serious thought
                    of creating it in <persName>South Carolina</persName> , or even in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> ); he
                    had fifteen months to obtain it, and, if it passed muster with the Governor, Borel would receive <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>
                    paper of a value equal to the coins he had imported. While he seems to have been put to a great deal of trouble for no profit, Borel was
                    public-spirited and besides realized that a viable metallic currency would be good for business. </p>
            <p> As it was granting <persName>Borel</persName> the right to import a contract coinage, the state was also setting about creating the
                    paper medium against which the new coinage would be exchanged. This explains the existence of the excessively rare state notes bearing an
                    issue-date of May 1, 1786, engraved and printed in <placeName>Charleston</placeName> by Abernethie. </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-55">

            </figure>
            <pb n="156"/>
            <p> Four denominations were issued—for £1, £2, £3, and £10. Today, one of the £2 notes survives—in the collection of the American Numismatic
                    Society. And two of the £3 have been traced. But the other members of this fairly sizable issue have disappeared, presumably all
                    redeemed—but not by the contract coinage of <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> . </p>
            <p> We do not know why Borel thought of this industrialist: his first overture to Soho bore a date of August 19, a time when <persName>Boulton</persName> was yet to begin his first coining project, copper money intended for the East India Company's holdings in Sumatra; and
                    there is no indication of a prior acquaintance. But Soho had been tapped for the Sumatran assignment in June 1786, <ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref> and the upcoming coinage would have been common knowledge in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName>
                    financial circles by the time of Borel's letter, which was written from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> . That
                    letter was brief: it simply asked whether <persName>Boulton</persName> were interested in creating five tons of copper coins for
                    America—with no mention of silver coinage, or specific reference to <persName>South Carolina</persName> . </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Boulton's</persName> reply has not survived, but he was receptive to the project and evidently replied around the end of
                    August, discussing possible terms, asking for more information. He then left for Cornwall on personal business and in search of copper for
                    the upcoming Sumatran coinage. Borel's second and last letter was addressed to him there, on September 14. </p>
            <p> A problem had arisen. Borel wished to return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> in early October, and he wanted
                    most or all of his coppers ready at that point to carry back with him. We may sympathize with him: a clock was ticking, and if he were late,
                    his agreement could be annulled. But we may sympathize with <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> as well: the latter was desperately
                    searching for copper for the much larger Sumatran order, was attempting to create a makeshift mint at an East India Company warehouse in
                        <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> , and was learning his new craft as he went along. He could not undertake
                    Borel's work prior to the end of October. And that was too late for Borel. </p>
            <p> What happened next is both obvious and unclear. This <placeName>Charleston</placeName> merchant received no coins—at least from <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> . But <persName>Sylvester S. Crosby</persName> has him receiving coins from someone. Writing in
                    1875, Crosby quotes an article from the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Centinel </hi> of October 18, 1786, reproducing an account received from <placeName>Charleston</placeName> dated September 29: <ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref>
               <q> [The <persName>South Carolina</persName> ] Government has received information that <persName>Mr. Borel</persName> has
                        compleated his contract of coinage for this State, in <placeName>Switzerland</placeName> , and may be soon expected here by the way
                        of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> . The stipulation was for <pb n="157"/> 30,0001. in silver and copper, to
                        be exchanged for the paper medium. </q>
            </p>
            <p> This quote obscures more than it illuminates. The quantity noted dovetails with the requirements set down in the ordinance, and it mentions
                    silver coinage as well as copper. But the timing is impossible. Even if we were to concede that Borel had given up on <persName>Boulton</persName> and immediately sought someone else, the news could not possibly have crossed the Atlantic between the date of his
                    second letter to the coiner and the publication of the news in Charleston—or its republication in <placeName>Boston</placeName> . And
                        <placeName>Switzerland</placeName> ? Was Borel from Neuchâtel? </p>
            <p> It seems unlikely that Crosby's sources were correct—and indeed this would not be the only instance of something mentioned by that author
                    but not seen elsewhere. In any case, a new man was about to make his entrance, and he, at least, believed that Borel had abandoned his plans
                    without bringing them to fruition. This new man wanted an opportunity to take up precisely where the old had left off. This new man was a
                    fellow-Charlestonian named <persName>John H. Mitchell</persName> . </p>
            <p> We know a fair amount about this second businessman and his dealings with <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> because an eventual
                    descendant with an antiquarian bent published <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Mitchell-Boulton</persName> Correspondence, 1787-1792: Relative to Coinages for <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>
                        and the <placeName>United States</placeName> . </hi> While <persName>Clarence B. Mitchell</persName> made occasional exclusions
                    on behalf of the good name of his ancestor, we nonetheless have a reasonably detailed account of the second connection between <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> and the state of <persName>South Carolina</persName> —one which can be expanded by <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> materials not included in the 1931 book. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>John H. Mitchell</persName> was nothing if not enterprising, and he always thought in grandiose terms. At a time when he had
                    not yet informed the Governor or the General Assembly of his plans (let alone secured their agreement to them), he was already in contact
                    with <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> , soliciting the latter's participation in a revived Carolina coining project. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Mitchell</persName> made his proposal through two of <persName>Boulton's</persName> business associates at the end of
                    July 1787. The prospectus was tempting: <persName>Mitchell</persName> wanted no fewer than £20,000 worth of copper halfpence—nearly ten
                    million coins. He sent along proposed designs on August 4: they closely copied the <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> state seal, but
                    the current date would be substituted for the date 1775 on the obverse. A second letter was sent out on the thirteenth, asking for specimens
                    based on the designs sent nine days previously. If at all possible, <persName>Boulton</persName> was to prepare patterns so that <persName>Mitchell</persName> could send <pb n="158"/> them along with his formal proposal to Governor Pinckney. If <persName>Boulton's</persName> coins and <persName>Mitchell's</persName> overtures could leave on a ship scheduled to sail on the twentieth,
                    there was a chance that they would reach <placeName>Charleston</placeName> in time for the Governor to lay them before the legislature.
                    But <persName>Mitchell</persName> could not remit his proposal until the end of August (and even then, he had to be content with
                    inclusion of a few specimens from the Sumatra coinage: <persName>Boulton</persName> had not been able to create the new patterns in
                    time). And timing was everything: a tardy reception of <persName>Boulton's</persName> coins and <persName>Mitchell's</persName>
                    prospectus might make it less likely that the state would embrace either. </p>

            <p> But they would struggle against greater odds than that: just as <persName>John H. Mitchell</persName> was counseling celerity upon
                        <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> , the new Constitution being drawn up in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> posed a far
                    greater threat. To be sure, it must be ratified by most of the states, but such passage was very likely, given a changed climate of opinion
                    concerning the blessings of liberty versus the attractions of order. </p>

            <p> At present, the climate was warming to the proposed new federal compact—which would take a very dim view of the very sort of state coinage
                    which Messrs. <persName>Mitchell</persName> and <persName>Boulton</persName> were seeking to create. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Mitchell</persName> encountered the chilly atmosphere as soon as he arrived back in <placeName>Charleston</placeName> in
                    the spring of 1788: <ref target="#CH8-n5">5</ref>
               <q> I waited on the Governor the day after my arrival, who informed me that my proposals were read to the House of Assembly and the French
                        Crown [ <persName>Jean-Pierre Droz</persName> 's famous pattern écu, with its lettered edge struck in collar: <persName>Boulton</persName> had engaged Droz for his own coinage and would enlist his services for <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> as
                        well] shewn them which met entirely with their approbation. But they could do nothing in the business until the new Constitution was
                        either adopted or exploded—which cannot be ascertained until the Convention had met to consider of it, which was appointed to be the
                        thirteenth of the next month, so that I cannot expect an answer before the middle of July, which as soon as I receive shall transmit
                        you. </q>
            </p>
            <p> The ratifying convention duly met; within a few days, it embraced the new federal compact (thereby showing as much enthusiasm for getting
                    into the Union as it would one day demonstrate in getting out of it). As the Constitution forbade coinage by (or circulated under the aegis
                    of) the states, this second <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> proposal was null. </p>
            <p> But <persName>John H. Mitchell</persName> was a persistent and optimistic man. Rebuffed on the state level, he turned to the federal;
                    and he carried <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> part of the way with him. </p>
            <p> In September 1789, <persName>Mitchell</persName> visited the temporary national capital, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> City. There, he had a long meeting with President <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> concerning a new national coinage—and he incorporated Soho into his speculations. <persName>Mitchell</persName> was back in <placeName>Charleston</placeName> by early October, sending <persName>Boulton</persName> a quick survey on the ninth and a more extended report on the following day. The proposal he sketched was for an
                    enormous quantity of coinage—not less than £200,000 worth of money, divided equally between gold, silver and copper. And this would merely
                    be the first installment, as "I have the preference of supplying Congress with their first Coinage," and that body clearly saw "the
                    impracticability of coining in America, <pb n="161"/> when they can get it so much better made in Europe and cheaper." <ref target="#CH8-n6">6</ref> But speed was again essential. Like <persName>Borel, Mitchell</persName> had a strict deadline; Congress would reassemble
                    on the first Monday of 1790, and <persName>Boulton's</persName> proposal must be received by then at the latest. </p>
            <p> His correspondent was somewhat skeptical, based on past experience with the ebullient <placeName>Charlestonian</placeName> . But the
                    money involved was simply too large to be ignored, and he dutifully prepared an estimate, sending it to <placeName>Charleston</placeName>
                    on November 25, 1789, only a few days after hearing the news. With luck, it would reach <persName>Mitchell</persName> in time to be
                    laid before Congress; but what would happen then was anyone's guess. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Boulton</persName> restricted his remarks to copper coinage, upon which he was becoming something of an expert. He could make
                    it for the Americans for £46.13.4 per ton, including freight to <placeName>Bristol</placeName> . That would be the price if the Americans
                    got their own copper; if he had to get it for them, it would cost them another £84 per ton, at current rates. <persName>Mitchell</persName> would have to come up with his own designs, perhaps in consultation with General <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> . <persName>Boulton</persName> thought that the arrangement employed on the Fugio
                    coppers was attractive (an irony: <persName>Boulton</persName> was very nearly involved in the production of that coin too, in treaty
                    with the rascally James Jarvis at the very time he was corresponding with <persName>John Mitchell</persName> ). But he believed the
                    Fugio designs could be improved upon, perhaps with the addition of Washington's head or an allegorical figure. </p>
            <p> As for the matter on both men's minds: how was <persName>Mitchell</persName> , or Congress, to pay for the coins? <persName>Boulton's</persName> suggestions betray the shaky nature of his industrial empire, as more and more of its capital was being invested in a
                    still-unproductive Soho Mint. For he would accept whatever local products he could get by way of payment—indigo, rice, wheat or tobacco.
                    They could be consigned to him or to his <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> agent, <persName>William
                        Matthews</persName> , and the proceeds raised from their sale would be credited against what the Republic owed for its coins. </p>
            <p> You will recall that <persName>Mitchell</persName> wanted an answer by the first of the year. This was unrealistic even in times of
                    good sailing weather. In the event, he had to wait until March 17 for <persName>Boulton's</persName> reply. It was not all that he had
                    hoped, but he submitted it to Congress nonetheless, assuming that <persName>Boulton's</persName> reputation would give his tardy
                    proposal more consideration than another's timely one. But he reckoned without certain members of the new national government. </p>
            <p> Chief among them was <persName>Thomas Jefferson</persName> , Secretary of State and the leader of an emerging anti-Federalist bloc.
                        <persName>Jefferson</persName> was <pb n="162"/> somewhat anti-British, distinctly pro-French; <ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref> but
                    his conclusions concerning <persName>John H. Mitchell</persName> and the <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> magnate who stood behind
                    him transcended parties and pettiness. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Jefferson</persName> received <persName>Mitchell's</persName> proposal (but not <persName>Mitchell</persName> : the
                    latter had unwisely remained at <placeName>Charleston</placeName> ) about the seventh of April. Within a week, his reply, the "Report on
                    Copper Coinage," had been written and submitted to President <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> . Coming at a
                    very crucial time, it would fix the identity of the coinage circulated in the <placeName>United States</placeName> from that day forward. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Jefferson's</persName> report of April 14, 1790, acknowledged that <persName>Boulton</persName> could coin in the manner
                    which he and <persName>Mitchell</persName> claimed: Soho's coinage really was the finest in the world, far superior to anything else on
                    either side of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> . It agreed with <persName>Boulton's</persName> tenets, that the technological
                    and artistic perfection which Soho could provide were the surest defenses against counterfeiting; to be successful and secure, any future
                    American coinage must embrace these same qualities. </p>
            <p> But technical expertise, artistic perfection, and the security against forgery that they made possible must yield to national interest and
                    national security. This <persName>Mitchell/Boulton</persName> proposal was admirable, provided it could be carried out in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . If it had to be effected in Great Britain, it must be declined. </p>
            <p> It could not be so entertained because it was far too risky. Just then, the world was at peace; but the previous record of the eighteenth
                    century and the drift of current events in France strongly argued that peace was a temporary thing, not to be relied upon by the <placeName>United States</placeName> . And in a time of war, vessels laden with coin for <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> would inevitably make tempting targets for adversaries of every stripe. <ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> Even in times of
                    peace, such cargoes would always run the risk of mutiny and piracy by the crews to whom they were entrusted—and a surreptitious landing and
                    quick dispersal of such coinage at any of hundreds of points along the long Eastern Seaboard could not have been prevented, given the
                    rudimentary state of law enforcement and communications at this time. </p>
            <p> But <persName>Jefferson's</persName> report went deeper than security considerations. As he succinctly observed "Coinage is peculiarly
                    an attribute of sovereignty. To transfer it's <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> exercise into another country, is to submit it to another
                    Sovereign. <ref target="#CH8-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p> How could <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> , whose nationality was still in process of formation, conceivably
                    transfer coinage to the safekeeping of another nation, especially one against which a war of liberation had so recently been fought? <persName>Jefferson's</persName> reply to the <persName>Mitchell/Boulton</persName> proposal listed other arguments against the
                    idea, and very good ones <pb n="163"/> indeed. But he had already delivered an unanswerable blow to the scheme. There would be no national
                    coinage involving <persName>John H. Mitchell</persName> , or <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> . </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Mitchell</persName> heard the bad news in early May 1790, and he wrote his proposed partner almost immediately, attempting to
                    put the best face on a miserable situation. He observed that <persName>Jefferson</persName> had by no means closed the door to a <persName>Boulton</persName> connection with <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> : indeed, the Secretary had
                    said that whenever a Federal Mint was established: <ref target="#CH8-n10">10</ref>
               <q> The superiority, the merit, and means of the Undertaker [ <persName>Boulton</persName> ] will suggest him as the proper person to
                        be engaged in the establishment and conduct of a mint, on a scale which, relinquishing nothing in the perfection of the coin, shall be
                        duly proportioned to our purposes. </q>
            </p>
            <p> From <persName>Mitchell's</persName> point of view, all was most certainly not lost, and if <persName>Boulton</persName> "thought
                    it practicable to establish one of your machines here, you may be assured we shall get the conducting of the whole of the coinage business
                    in this country." <ref target="#CH8-n11">11</ref> But <persName>Boulton</persName> was unprepared for such a move: his squabbles with
                        <persName>Jean-Pierre Droz</persName> had dissolved into the acrimony of legal proceedings; he was in process of securing a patent
                    for his minting machinery; and he was now aware that whatever the American potential might be, <persName>John H. Mitchell</persName>
                    was not the man to secure it. The latter was a dreamer, more interested in turning a profit (by means of a complicated scheme, if possible)
                    than in reforming a coinage. The correspondence between the two men continued, but <persName>Boulton</persName> would henceforth
                    restrict it to the more prosaic articles of the Anglo-American trade. </p>
            <p> Some years later, <persName>Boulton's</persName> nephew visited the <placeName>United States</placeName> on business, and he made a
                    point of dropping by <placeName>Charleston</placeName> to visit his uncle's old acquaintance. He found him charming as always, but still
                    possessing "the unlucky talent of trying to preserve the splendour of a Gentn [Gentleman] without adequate means." <ref target="#CH8-n12">12</ref> In short, not the man to act as midwife to an American coinage by <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> . </p>
            <p> Just as this relative was penning his observations about <persName>Mr. Mitchell</persName> , an interesting event was taking place in
                        <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . An Act passed the previous year had ordered the creation of a federal Mint, and it was now
                    striking its first coins in a new decimal system of dollars and cents. These maiden efforts were not handsome, and there were not very many
                    of them; but they were incontrovertibly American. And once the first of them entered commerce, the connections between <persName>Boulton</persName> , Watt &amp; Company and the <placeName>United States</placeName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> changed for all time. </p>

            <p> Coinage with a portrait of <persName>George Washington</persName> has been accepted as part of the early American coinage, although
                    none had any official status. Some <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> coins did circulate in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> , and others were in use as currency in the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> as late as the middle of the nineteenth century. The first to appear was the <persName>Georgius Triumpho</persName>
                    copper token of 1783. Four types dated 1783 were struck but after 1815. There is one piece, dated 1784; three pieces of the
                    Confederatio-Immune <placeName>Columbia</placeName> series of the 1785-86, some being dated; American-made <persName>Peter
                        Getz</persName> half dollars dated 1792; and finally a group of English commercial issues dated 1791, 1792, 1793 and 1795. One exception is
                    the American-made <persName>Peter Getz</persName> half dollars dated 1792. <ref target="#CH9-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p> A classification system has been devised for the series, designated <placeName>WA</placeName> , combining: date of issue; variety
                    designation; metal (blank- copper, Ag-silver, Au-gold, Br-brass, Bz-bronze, Pb-lead, Pt-platinum, WM-white metal); known overstrikes
                    (indicated by lower case o). <ref target="#CH9-n2">2</ref> A list of the varieties appears in Table 1. </p>
            <p> The historical background of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> coinage has been researched and commented
                    on by <persName>Crosby</persName> , <persName>Breen</persName> , <persName>Julian</persName> , <ref target="#CH9-n3">3</ref>
                    and <persName>Taxay</persName>

            <p> Baker 7, Vlack 30-Z. <ref target="#CH9-n5">5</ref> The Georgivs Triumpho coins were struck in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> , probably in <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> . Historically they were believed to be an ambiguous combination of a
                    rude head of <persName>George III</persName> (copied from the 1774-76 and 1781-82 Irish halfpence, <persName>Seaby</persName>
                    H236-40, <ref target="#CH9-n6">6</ref> and a <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> -made counterfeit British halfpenny style die. The legends
                    were evasive regardless of the outcome of the Revolutionary War: in praise of <persName>King George</persName> if the British won, in
                    praise of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> if the Americans won. The familiar devices would ensure
                    circulation either way. </p>
            <pb n="167"/>
            <p> However, closer attention to the facts shows that by 1783, <persName>King George</persName> had no possible triumph coming. The legend
                    VOCE POPOLI (Italianate spelling of VOCE POPULI "By the voice of the people") would have been colossal irony if the Americans had not
                    already won. </p>
            <p> The head on the vast majority of evasion halfpence was intended to be <persName>King George III</persName> also. The head on the
                    Triumpho piece was also intended to be both <persName>George III</persName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> . The fabric resembles <placeName>Bungtown</placeName> tokens. <ref target="#CH9-n7">7</ref> The date, 1783, is
                    significant as it is the date of the Treaty of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> which formally concluded the
                    Revolutionary War. A recent article by <persName>Ringo</persName> shows die punch linkage of the Georgivs Triumpho with several 1775
                    English counterfeit halfpence, and the Nova Constellatio variety 1-A. <ref target="#CH9-n8">8</ref> Even the figure of Britannia on a 1775
                    counterfeit and the Triumpho have a common hub. This data further confirms the issuance date of the Georgivs Triumpho as soon after 1783. </p>
            <p> It is reported that the Triumpho piece served as a host coin for the Elizabethtown-mint <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New
                        Jersey</placeName> copper, which was put in circulation during the period between June 1788 and June 1789, when that Mint was operational.
                    Table 29 of Mossman indicates that two <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers, Maris 35-W and 56-n, are
                    overstruck on Georgivs Triumpho pieces, while a 1783 Nova Constellatio 1-A is overstruck by a <persName>Maris</persName> 72-z (see die
                    linkage above). <ref target="#CH9-n9">9</ref> The reliability of the identification of the undertype of these pieces has been raised by both
                        <persName>Ringo</persName> and <persName>Mossman</persName> because they have not seen the coins. </p>
            <p> The weight of the Georgivs Triumpho coins is approximately 110 to 135 grains, similar to the Nova Constellatio coppers. <ref target="#CH9-n10">10</ref> The coin's reverse is a fence-like frame with 13 vertical, a direct allusion to the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> . Completing the design, the corners of the cage are sealed by four <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lys,</hi> alluding to the
                    French aid in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . This undoubtedly means that the obverse device attempted to

            <p> For some years, especially since 1952, a so-called specimen of the "Ugly Head" in silver has been discussed in the literature toward the
                    possibility that this fabrication is genuine. <ref target="#CH9-n15">15</ref> Its <pb n="169"/> pedigree is <persName>Cy
                        Hunter</persName> , <persName>Arthur Conn</persName> , <persName>Gould</persName> , <persName>Fuld</persName> (1952), <persName>Gould</persName> , <persName>Groves</persName> . In June 1952, the author purchased this piece from Maurice Gould of <placeName>Boston</placeName> for what today would be a nominal sum. The authenticity of the coin (or token) seemed unclear, so I took this
                    coin to the 1952 ANA Convention in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> for verification. This was long
                    before non-destructive X-ray techniques were available. Four dealers, <persName>Messrs. John Ford</persName> , <persName>Walter Breen</persName> , <persName>Richard Picker</persName> and <persName>Harvey Stack</persName> , studied the piece, and all
                    agreed it was some kind of an electrotype. At that point, it was returned to <persName>Gould</persName> and a full refund was made. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Gould</persName> was not convinced, expressing his opinion in the 1954 article cited above. After <persName>Gould's</persName> death, the piece was acquired for the <persName>Donald Groves</persName> collection, and was the subject of a
                    presentation made at the 1984 COAC held at the ANS, and later published in the Proceedings volume (above, n. 15). The thesis, that the coin,
                    ascertained to contain 56% silver, was struck on a cast planchet, is faulty. It is telling that <persName>Walter Breen</persName> did
                    not list this "silver" piece in his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia</hi> (although he was fully aware of its existence). </p>
            <p> Let's examine how this piece was made. Undoubtedly it is a full electrotype, using silver, which plates out as well as copper in the
                    conductive wax mold. The flan thickness varies from .80 mm to 2.05 mm; ruling out any possibility that the coin was struck, even on a cast
                    planchet. If a one-inch die, with separate obverse and reverses, were struck, the alignment of the dies from side to side off parallel by
                    1.25 mm would yield a striking that was extremely weak on one side—which is not the case with the "silver" piece. The X-ray analysis of the
                    piece is misleading, as the obverse and reverse surfaces would be pure silver (electroplating alloys are unlikely), while the soft metal
                    fill into the shells with a mixture of lead and tin would account for their presence. The X-ray data presented by Partrick is the average of
                    the overall metal composition. Theoretically, the composition of the surface only, and of the center only, could be determined, but it is
                    doubtful that it would be worth the expense. </p>

               </head>
               <p> The Confederatio-Immune <placeName>Columbia</placeName> coinage of 1785-86 yielded three very rare <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> pieces. </p>
               <p> As noted in <persName>Breen</persName> , <persName>Thomas Jefferson</persName> , in "Propositions Respecting the Coinage of
                        Gold, Silver, and Copper," May 13, 1785, (written while he was in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> ),
                        recommended the device of an Indian <pb n="170"/> dian trampling on a crown, with MANUS INIMICA TYRANNIS "This hand is hostile to
                        Tyrants." <ref target="#CH9-n16">16</ref> A deleted paragraph of the Report of the Grand Committee of Continental Congress suggested the
                        name "decad" for the larger copper coin, valued at 1/100 Spanish milled dollar, and for its device a sketch of the union of 13 stars in
                        a circle with a serrated border representing rays, surrounded by CONFEDERATION 1785. <ref target="#CH9-n17">17</ref>
               </p>
               <p> That paragraph was deleted from the printed report either by acting chairman <persName>Hugh Williamson</persName> , or by vote of
                        the committee. <persName>Jefferson</persName> knew of the Committee's inner workings, and he would have known of the proposed
                        designs (if indeed he was not the instigator), as well as <persName>Wyon's</persName> facilities. <persName>Jefferson</persName> was the most logical go- between for transmitting the recommended designs and inscriptions presumably to <persName>Wyon</persName> , even for patterns for a possible contract coinage, should satisfactory mint equipment not be available.
                        If <persName>Wyon</persName> was the engraver, how did the dies reach the <placeName>United States ca</placeName> . 1785-86? </p>
               <p> There are various patterns, involving seven obverse dies and six reverses, most of which were eventually muled with each other in some
                        14 combinations. Of interest here is <persName>Breen</persName> Obverse 4 showing the uniformed bust right, GEN. <placeName>WASHINGTON</placeName> . This comes combined with the reverse later used on <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New
                            Jersey</placeName> copper coinage (broad shield in center, E PLURIBUS UNUM around, <persName>Maris</persName> 4-C, <ref target="#CH9-n18">18</ref>
                  <persName>Baker</persName> 11). It also occurs with the same obverse 4 combined with <persName>Breen</persName> reverse D,
                        with circle of 13 large stars within long rays; <persName>Crosby</persName> obverse 2, one die supposedly brought to <placeName>U.S.</placeName> by <persName>Mould</persName> . As stated below this "fact" is unlikely. The third <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> muling, the rarest of the series, has the obverse of <persName>Breen</persName>
                        4, with reverse G showing an eagle displayed, on his breast a shield argent, six pales gules, a chief azure; a bundle of arrows in his
                        right talon, and an olive branch in left hand; about his head, 13 stars, around, * E • PLURIBUS • UNUM • 1786. <persName>Breen</persName> based his assumptions as to the engraver of these dies on the fact that Mould worked in <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> , from which he concluded he worked for <persName>Wyon</persName> (a stretch of course)—his presence in
                            <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> was in 1783, thus making it nearly impossible for him to obtain vintage 1785 or 1786 dies. <ref target="#CH9-n19">19</ref> Certainly this die was not conveyed by <persName>Walter</persName> Mould to the Morristown Mint and
                        muled with another coarse obverse. There is no reason to reject the fact that <persName>Maris</persName> reverse C was not engraved
                        at the Morristown mint. Certainly it is crude enough and not worthy of <persName>Wyon's</persName> expertise. As <persName>Hodder</persName> points out, some of <persName>Breen's</persName> suppositions are based on slim foundations, but have become
                        unsupported facts. These three pieces, per <persName>Breen's</persName> notation, are 4/ <persName>Maris</persName>
                  <pb n="171"/> C; 4/D and 4/G. There are deceptive Bolen copies of some Confederatio's, but none with the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> bust. Certainly further evidence is required before concluding that <persName>Wyon</persName> of <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> made most of the dies for these three issues, which were extensively muled
                        together. All the Confederatio patterns are denoted "decads" as proposed by the Continental Congress, valued at 1/100 per Spanish
                        dollar. This nomenclature was deleted from the final report, although some designs were proposed. <ref target="#CH9-n20">20</ref>

               <p> As mentioned previously, most of the balance of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> coinage is English
                        tokens of the extensive "Conder" series. <ref target="#CH9-n22">22</ref> The initial pieces are the "small eagle" and "large eagle"
                        cents of 1791, engraved by <persName>John Gregory Hancock</persName> , Jr. (1775-1815) of <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> . He
                        was a juvenile prodigy and became one of the finest artists in the history of eighteenth century British diemaking. <ref target="#CH9-n23">23</ref>
                  <persName>Ford</persName> (below, n. 29) states that <persName>Hancock</persName> was an employee of Obadiah Westwood of <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> , who ran a large private mint there. <persName>Hancock</persName> received the honorific
                        assignment of making dies for two types of cents, portraying <persName>George Washington</persName> . These were to be samples of a
                        proposed Federal contract ordered by <persName>W. and Alex. Walker</persName> of <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> . </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Walker</persName> shipped a cask (conjecturally one hundred weight = 112 lbs, about 4,000 cents, estimated to be 2,500
                        Large Eagle and 1,500 Small Eagle) to the firm's <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> associates, <persName>Thomas
                            Ketland</persName> &amp; Sons, for distribution to cabinet officials, senators, congressmen and other VIPs. <ref target="#CH9-n24">24</ref>
                        These pieces arrived during the debate of the <persName>Morris</persName> bill, which initially proposed the coins to portray
                        President <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> , and most committee members objected to any private coinage
                        contract. This doomed the British proposal, but the 1791 cents went into circulation. Large Eagle cents are found uncirculated; Small
                        Eagle cents rarely uncirculated; both issues very elusive in red uncirculated condition. The portrait was modeled after <persName>Du Simitiere's</persName> drawing. There is a series of all unique patterns or die trials of this group, the largest
                        holding being offered in the <persName>Garrett</persName>
                  <pb n="175"/> sales. The regular issues all have the edge lettered <placeName>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</placeName> , while many of
                        the trials have typical "Conder" type edges from other English eighteenth century tokens or plain edges. The ten or so patterns of the
                        Large and Small Eagle cents known are listed below. This series of 1791 and 1792 was discussed in some detail by <persName>Breen</persName> in a serial article in 1973. <ref target="#CH9-n25">25</ref>

               <p> An oddly struck pattern, apparently showing the regular <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> obverse date
                        1791, with a Large Eagle die trial reverse struck on a very large flan of 32.3 mm diameter. The flan is very thin, about 1 mm, and the
                        edge of the beading of the obverse and reverse is at least 1 mm in from the edge. The coin has been canceled by a small burred roller
                        leaving about 6 mm groves, and then apparently machine canceled. In the outside area between the beads and the rim, appears PLURBUS E
                        UNUM in raised letters, in mirror image and hand cut. There is no trace of the shield on the eagle's breast, although the cancellation
                        may have obscured it. There is a ribbon in the eagle's beak, but only an incused M from UNUM and E on the right side are apparent.
                        Struck in copper, but the obverse is fire gilt, with much worn away, while traces of gilt appear about the edge of the reverse. Traces
                        of lettering on the edge, with only ABLE discernable. Weight 127.5 grains. Ex. <persName>A. Hepner</persName> , <persName>Jerry Tralins</persName> , <persName>A.M.

               </head>
               <p> The Getz coinage, engraved by <persName>Peter Getz</persName> of <placeName>Lancaster, PA</placeName> , was made in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in accordance with the <persName>Morris</persName> Coinage proposal of December 21, 1791.
                            <persName>John Ford</persName> summarized the then current knowledge about the Getz coinage in 1975. <ref target="#CH9-n29">29</ref> His information is abridged herewith. <persName>Per Don Taxay</persName> , <persName>Robert Birch</persName> (of
                        the 1792 Birch cent fame) supervised Getz's work on the dies and sank the punches for the date and legends. <ref target="#CH9-n30">30</ref> All the regular Getz coins (copper or silver) have a common obverse and reverse, except for a unique piece showing a large
                        eagle ( <persName>Baker</persName> 23). All authorities ( <persName>Breen</persName> , <persName>Taxay</persName> , <persName>Ford</persName> , <persName>Fuld</persName> ) agree that the 1791 <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> issues of <persName>Westwood-Hancock</persName> served as a model for the Getz issues. </p>
               <p> It is unanimous that the only coins struck in the <placeName>United States</placeName> in this period are the Getz issues. The half
                        dollars accurately represent the devices and legends required by the <persName>Morris</persName> bill of December 21, 1791. This is
                        the original bill that <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> objected to since it proposed his likeness.
                        After several modifications, it was signed into law by <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> as Statute One
                        on April 2, 1792. </p>
               <p> Whether silver or copper issues were struck first has had several diverse advocates. <persName>Taxay</persName> stated that the
                        silver half dollars were struck first (which is unlikely) so that they could be presented to members of the Senate when the <persName>Morris</persName> bill was discussed. <persName>Baker</persName> felt that copper pieces were struck for presentation
                        to the <persName>Morris</persName>
                  <pb n="184"/> committee during their deliberations. <persName>Breen</persName> tended to agree with <persName>Baker</persName>
                        and estimated some 100 copper pieces were struck for the 29 Senators and 65 Representatives, serving from December 1791 to March 1792.
                            <persName>Breen</persName> based his conclusion that copper came first on comments in <persName>Snowden</persName> , but
                        his opinion is not unanimous. However, <persName>Hodder</persName> concludes that the copper was struck first on the basis of lack
                        of die rust on stars of the reverse, while silver pieces all have rust to varying degrees. <ref target="#CH9-n31">31</ref> In addition,
                        he feels that the window of striking from December of 1791 to early April 1792 is narrow enough to make multiple strikings a mute point.
                        First impressions were taken in the basement of <persName>John Harper's</persName> saw factory, located at the corner of Sixth and
                        Cherry Streets, <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . The second strikings were made on a press constructed by <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> , who was for many years the Chief Coiner of the Mint. The <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> press was in an
                        old coach house on Sixth Street, above Chestnut Street, also in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . The precise location on Sixth
                        is not clear. The 1792 half dismes and dismes were also struck in <persName>Harper's</persName> basement, albeit on a smaller
                        press. Which came first is academic and resembles the classic "chicken and egg" puzzle. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Jack Collins</persName> is currently compiling pedigree data on all Getz pieces, with illustrations wherever possible.
                            <ref target="#CH9-n32">32</ref> It is estimated by <persName>Ford</persName> and <persName>Fuld</persName> that 40-50
                        plain edge copper pieces and 5-6 ornamented edge copper pieces exist. The silver pieces are estimated at 12-15 plain edge pieces, 4-5
                        with circles and squares, 2 known specimens with twin olive leaves, and 3 overstrikes, a single overstrike on the 1697 British
                        halfcrown, an overstrike on a Spanish colonies 4 reales, and another on a French half Ecu for a total of about 21-25 pieces. The copper
                        pieces may be for cents and the silver pieces for half dollars, but only one denomination would be practical in the same size and
                        design. </p>
               <p> The weights of the Getz pieces show variations from 193 to 248.75 grains for the silver specimens and 208 to 273 grains for the copper
                        cents. The <persName>Morris</persName> bill specified 208 to 264 grains, so the Getz issues fall within that limit. Copper Getz
                        pieces from that period are not grossly abused. Even uncirculated specimens exist. Regarding the silver specimens, many are known holed
                        (for neck or watch hangers?) and many are badly worn from being carried in the pocket. Uncirculated silver pieces are rarely, if ever,
                        encountered. Of note is that while the ratio of silver to copper survivors is estimated to be almost 1 to 2, somehow silver ones seem to
                        be more elusive than that. </p>

                        recorded vary from 220 to 273 grains. The high grade (called uncirculated by Chapman) specimen from the <persName>Bushnell</persName> collection, 1252, was sold to <persName>William S. Baker</persName> thence to the PHS. Four <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> pieces turned up in 1973 or 1974 with a <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> dealer.
                        They were then purchased by a well known Texas dealer, all of which subsequently were shown to have been "deaccessioned" from the PHS.
                        These were returned to the museum in 1975 when their purchasers became aware of the theft. </p>

               <p> The silver Getz half dollar, with identical dies to the preceding. All made with plain edge and apparently most struck on "thick" flans
                        of about 32 mm with several on large flans of 35 mm, and a few are smaller. Probably made in period January to March 1792, as per
                        previous discussion. Many are known with a plugged hole over the head and wear is consistent with being carried as pocket pieces.

                        having been acquired by <persName>John Ford</persName> , Jr. It was sold by two European dealers who apparently obtained it from

                        at the Manchester Numismatic Society of "a <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> half <pb n="188"/> dollar,

                        half-crown was noted. If this is the case, the possible province of ex PHS is remote as <persName>Baker</persName> collection was
                        not donated until the late 1880s. However, when the extensive Dr. <persName>Clay</persName> collection was sold in 1871, no half

                            been sold as regular silver specimens. <persName>Hodder</persName> is convinced, and we tend to agree, that all or certainly
                            most silver Getz pieces are struck over foreign silver coins, rather than virgin planchets. <ref target="#CH9-n40">40</ref> Plain
                            edge pieces are those with edges planed down, but this does not explain the occurrence of the twin olive leaf edge or the circle and

                            overstrike present, but the proof of this position awaits further study of other silver specimens. Another possibility is that the
                            silver was struck at two periods, i.e. December 1791 and February-March 1792, and one used plain planchets, while the others were

               <p> Although no direct evidence exists as to the origin of this series, die punch linkage and style directly link the 1792 British issues to
                            <persName>J.G. Hancock</persName> and Westwood's Mint. Clearly they must have been manufactured between the time of the 1791
                        cents and before knowledge of rejection of monarchical portraits by Congress. <persName>Breen</persName> conjectures that for the
                        eagle reverse with no denomination, the strikings in copper, silver and gold represented cent, half dollar and ten dollar samples, while
                        Newman believes the gold and silver specimens were too different from any circulating coin to be usable. <ref target="#CH9-n43">43</ref>
                        Some copper pieces may have circulated after 1793, as they are found with various amounts of wear. Crosby believed all to be medals, but
                        this is not logical. </p>
               <p> The General of the Army pieces made at the same time are almost all well worn—perhaps a single keg partially filled with these coins was
                        transported to the States. Certainly most silver specimens have been holed, and could have been worn as necklaces or even funeral
                        medals. All in all a most interesting series. </p>

               <p> The first recorded owner (after perhaps George Washington) was <persName>Gustavus A. Myers</persName> of <placeName>Richmond, VA</placeName> . <ref target="#CH9-n45">45</ref> In an effort to learn more of this unique pieces, he had published in <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries,</hi> 12 ( <placeName corresp="#nomisma_London">London</placeName> , 1855), p. 203, the
                        following: "I have a gold coin in my <pb n="195"/> possession, a rough sketch of which I enclose; and which, although much worn, is
                        still the full value of the American eagle, namely, ten dollars. On inquiring at the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint, in
                            <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , a few years since, I found that, in the collection there of specimens of all the federal
                        coins, none like this existed. It attracted much curiosity; but nothing of its history could be learned. A very intelligent officer of
                        the institution informed me, that he conjectured it was stamped in Birmingham. The name of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> President, appearing upon it, renders it an object of greater interest; as it is
                        generally understood, and believed, that while that distinguished man was president of the <placeName>United States</placeName> ,
                        learning that a coinage was about to be stamped at the mint, bearing his effigy, he immediately arrested the preceding <hi rend="italic">[sic].</hi> A few copper coins had however been struck, which were never issued; and which I believe are still preserved in the
                        collection to which I have above referred. No gold or silver coin of the same stamp was ever struck in the <placeName>United
                            States of America</placeName> . The coin in my possession was evidently intended for circulation. Its style of execution is rather rough,
                        and the motto upon the scroll in the eagle's beak, ‘Unum e pluribus,' is not correct: that upon the federal money having been, ‘E
                        pluribus unum.' If you through any of your readers, afford me any information touching the subject of my inquiry, your will greatly
                        oblige <persName>G.A. Myers</persName> , <placeName>Richmond, Virginia</placeName> ( <placeName>U.S.A</placeName> .)." </p>
               <p>To which the following footnote was appended:</p>
               <p> "(This American piece was struck at <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> by <persName>Hancock</persName> , an engraver of dies of
                        considerable talent. Of these pieces there are several varieties: one, without date on the obverse; on reverse, American eagle, shield
                        on breast, olive branch in one claw, arrows in the other; <placeName>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</placeName> ;' below '1791.' Another,
                        date under head, '1791;' reverse, eagle as above, but larger; in beak a scroll. ‘UNUM E PLURIBUS;' above, ‘ONE CENT,' no stars, cloud or
                        date. Another profile of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> to the right, fillet round the head, no dress;
                        legend as above; date ‘1792,' reverse, eagle with shield olive and arrows; above, ‘CENT,' Edges of all the same. These are all of copper
                        and were said to have been patterns for an intended coinage, but not approved.)" </p>
               <p> There are some obvious errors in <persName>Myers's</persName> letter, as in 1795, the eagle weighed 270 grains, so that this piece
                        is light. <persName>Newman</persName> , by inference, concludes that the gold "eagle" was presented to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> , by <persName>Westwood's</persName> representative. It was common practice to
                        make sample presentations to heads of state or committees when attempting to secure a contract. Certainly it is hard to contradict <pb n="196"/>
                  <persName>Newman</persName> 's thesis that this was <placeName>Washington's</placeName> pocket piece. With one struck in gold,

                        THE/UNITED STATES/1789 This reverse die is different from the undated similar piece that follows. On this <pb n="197"/> variety, the 1

                        directly under the I of AMERICAN, and the 1 of 1789 touches the dash line at the bottom. <persName>Breen</persName> identifies
                        reverse as having top star just left of center of the second E of GENERAL. This variety is in copper, plain edge. Weight about 185

                        Perkins offered it at $5,000. Attempts to have it donated to the ANS failed. Later that year, <persName>Albert Collis</persName>

                        clearly refers to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> . Along with the Getz half dollar (WA.1792.2), these
                        were all hoped to be contenders for the first <placeName>U.S</placeName> . coinage starting in 1793. Obverse is a head of Liberty
                        facing right, with loose kinky hair, around, PARENT OF SCIENCE &amp; INDUSTRY; below, in exergue, 1792. The truncation is not signed BIRCH
                        as on the regular Copper Birch cent. The reverse, following design of the <persName>Morris</persName> bill, has ONE/CENT in center

                        well have been intended to compromise between those who wanted the portrait of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> on our coinage, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> who was strongly opposed to
                        it. It is likely that this piece preceded the other Birch cents. Little is known of Birch. <persName>Taxay</persName> associated

Birch of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> ; <persName>Alexander Vattemare</persName> and <persName>James Ross Snowden</persName> connected him to 1792 patterns, but there are no records (not unusual) of payments to <persName>Birch</persName> by the Mint. <persName>Carl W.A.

                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> by <persName>William Russell Birch</persName> . The white metal

                        coins became known, he conjectures that the reverse die was reengraved to the regular Birch cent reverse. In any event, an extremely

               <p> The SUCCESS tokens are undated, but as summarized by <persName>Breen</persName> were made in the period 1792-95, very possibly for
                            <placeName>Washington's</placeName> second inauguration in March 1793. J. Doyle DeWitt followed <persName>Woodward</persName> 's theory that <persName>Jacob Perkins</persName> of <placeName>Newburyport, MA</placeName> , made them to
                        be "worn" at the inauguration. <ref target="#CH9-n50">50</ref> But there are no existent holders and they are rarely seen holed or
                        mounted. </p>
               <p> The most convincing evidence as to their period is the All-Seeing eye design, with 15 stars for the 15 states on the reverse, an obvious
                        illusion to the old NOVA CONSTELLATIO device of 1783-85. The outside limit would be the admission of the sixteenth state, Tennessee, on
                        June 1, 1796, bracketing the issue from 1792-95. There is no other background on the tokens in the contemporary literature. <persName>Baker</persName> assumed made in the U.S., but pieces found in both English and American collections, so provenance is
                        unclear. That they circulated <pb n="211"/> is evidenced by the well-worn survival of most pieces. <persName>DeWitt</persName>
                        mentions copper restrikes, but these have not been encountered. There are three obverse dies and one reverse for the larger piece (no
                        denomination is assignable) and only single dies for the smaller piece. The large size is 25.4 mm, small size 19.4 mm. </p>

               <p> The Getz dollar, undoubtedly a medal. A most interesting piece, rediscovered about 1960 and described by <persName>Fuld</persName>
                        and <persName>Newman</persName> . <ref target="#CH9-n51">51</ref> This piece was listed by <persName>Snowden</persName> as
                        being in the Mint collection. Actually it was lent by <persName>H. Drumheller</persName> of <placeName>Schuylkill,
                            PA</placeName> , and only temporarily deposited at the Mint. It remained untraced for the next 100 years until it came into possession of
                            <persName>Louis R. Karp</persName> ( <persName>James</persName> , Inc.) of <placeName>Louisville, KY</placeName> , in
                        1960. </p>
               <p> The piece itself is die struck over a Mexican 8 reales, with the obverse hub of the Getz 1792 "half dollar" ( <persName>Baker</persName> 288) with the date restamped 1796, and the reverse of the Getz 1792 "small" eagle die. The dies are half dollar size,
                        but struck on a dollar size coin. <persName>Hodder</persName> identified the undertype as a dollar struck after 1772, when the
                        "squares" edge ornamentation was introduced. <ref target="#CH9-n52">52</ref> It is most certainly of the reign of <persName>Charles III</persName> (1772-89) or <persName>Charles IV</persName> (1789-1808). The undertype is only visible above the CA. on
                        the reverse, where the remains of EX, and the base of the left pillar of the undertype may be seen. The heavy file marks are the result
                        of planing down the original type, accounting for the 55 grain loss from the weight of the pillar coin. The rays about the edge are
                        struck using a hand stamping tool, and some show overlapping after striking. It is important to realize that the bust on the 1796 piece
                        is identical to the 1792 die, and not the 1797 Masonic medal die. The period of issue is not firm (Getz died at age 36 as the result of
                        an accident in <pb n="214"/> 1804). One Getz 1792 issue is known struck over a 1794/5 large cent flan, another over a 1795-96 cent, so
                        that an issue date of 1796 is not improbable. The 1796 date is not an altered die, but a completely new impression in the die. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Newman</persName> and <persName>Fuld</persName> concluded that this is a medal and never intended to be a coin.

               <p> The large group of non-contemporary issues of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> , mostly dated 1783, will
                        be described in this separate section. Numbers are assigned with "NC" included to confirm their nature. In the period 1958-1961, <persName>Robert A. Vlack</persName> and the author made a concerted effort to study all possible die varieties of the 1783 <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> cent series. Only three out of a total of 33 varieties have been
                        discovered in the ensuing 35 years. Vlack wrote this data in great detail in the <hi rend="italic">CNL</hi> of July 1978 and numbering
                        and composite rarities will be assigned based on that treatise. <ref target="#CH9-n54">54</ref>
               </p>
               <p> As <persName>Breen</persName> stated, the mystery of these 1783 cents remained so for over 100 years. Specialists in Colonials and
                        Washingtonia have collected these pieces since the 1850s. The advent of restrikes in the late 1850s brought even more interest to the
                        "original" 1783 pieces. Allusions to the restrikes in such popular works as <persName>Dickeson</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH9-n55">55</ref> and <persName>Snowden</persName> brought credence to the series. Even <persName>Crosby</persName> included them among "those struck in the eighteenth century" (p. 349). </p>
               <p> That view did not survive among the skeptics who realized that the reverse of the <placeName>Unity States</placeName> cents was
                        copied from the 1796-1807 <placeName>U.S.</placeName> large cents, and the wording <placeName>UNITY STATES</placeName> smacks of
                        the evasion wording commonly used with the Bungtown series of the 1790s. There is the obvious point that the resemblance to regular
                        coinage was meant to deceive the illiterate and an attempt to evade the counterfeiting laws (as of 1806, these laws only applied to
                        copper and silver coinage). The rough planchets with gridwork near the borders possibly was intended to partially obscure the word
                        UNITY. The first author to clearly question the origin of the 1783 cent series was <persName>Frank C. Higgins</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH9-n56">56</ref> but earlier <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> and <persName>DuBois</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH9-n57">57</ref> and <persName>John H. Hickcox</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH9-n58">58</ref> clearly questioned the origins of some of the 1783 series. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Fuld</persName> made 15 points as proof of the origin of these cents, presumed to have been made by <persName>Boulton</persName> and <persName>Watts's Soho</persName> Mint at <placeName>Birmingham</placeName> . <persName>Fuld</persName> delineated the proof that the 1783 cents (with the exception of the Georgivs Triumpho coin) were made in the 1815-20
                        period. <ref target="#CH9-n59">59</ref> These include: no portrait of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>
                        similar to the <pb n="217"/> 1783 cents was available in <placeName>Europe</placeName> at that time; the word "cent" was not
                        conceived or used for coinage until 1786; the model for the <persName>Unity States</persName> reverse was not used until at least
                        1796; the type of border denticles used on this coinage was not adopted on English coinage until 1806; the corded edge seen on some
                        coinage was first used on coins in 1806 and on tokens in 1812; the bust on the military bust cents strongly resembles Field <persName>Marshal Wellington</persName> pieces struck after 1810 for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> ;
                        the design for the seated Liberty reverse was used for Britannia by <persName>Kuchler</persName> at Soho Mint starting in 1797; the
                        date 1783 has its own significance of the signing the Treaty of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> ending the
                        Revolution; the hubbing process for making virtually identical dies for the military and draped bust cents was technically unfeasible
                        until well after 1805; <persName>Lord's</persName> detector of 1853 <ref target="#CH9-n60">60</ref> indicates these coins were
                        still in circulation in 1853; no English token books of the 1790s mentions these coins (tokens?); the two sets of dies for restriking in
                        1851 and 1860 are much more likely being 20 to 30 years after manufacture, rather than 70 years; the Flimby Park overstrike coin could
                        not have occurred before 1815; the initials T.W.I. and E.S. have been identified as <persName>Thomas Wells Ingram</persName> and
                            <persName>Edward Savage</persName> . Ingram issued dated calender medals in 1827-28 which were very similar to <persName>Kempson</persName> issues. <ref target="#CH9-n61">61</ref> Ingram, even if a boy genius, was born in 1799!; <persName>Frank C. Higgins</persName> as previously mentioned strongly disagreed with <persName>Crosby</persName> as to the
                        emission period of the "1783" cents. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Boulton</persName> certainly intended no fraud using the 1783 date, commemorating the Treaty of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> which ended the Revolution, and <placeName>Washington's</placeName> disbanding of the
                        Continental Armies. Starting in 1797, <persName>Boulton</persName> and <persName>Watt</persName> were making current coins and
                        planchets for the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> Mint; their Soho Mint was too much in the public eye, barring occasional coins
                        for collectors, to do anything outright fraudulent. Most people such as New York and <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> merchants
                        openly imported these "1783" <placeName>Washingtons</placeName> by the dozens or even hundreds of kegs, at a fraction of a cent
                        apiece; no law forbade import or circulation of private tokens. At 60 to the lb. <hi rend="sup">5</hi> 6,720 to the cwt. <hi rend="sup">5</hi> 134,400 per long ton, these were not only profitable, they were a familiar way of dealing with shortages of small change,
                        easier than waiting for more expensive Federal cents. Cents (lacking legal tender quality) had no real advantage over tokens. The
                        obvious occasion for such large orders in the 1815-20 period was the coin shortage of 1815-17. Most likely the merchant who ordered the
                        Draped Bust coins sent along a <placeName>Unity States</placeName> as prototype; the one who ordered military busts may have
                        furnished a Large or Small Eagle cent or sketch. </p>
               <pb n="218"/>
               <p> Further proof of their late circulation was Thompson in 1848 <ref target="#CH9-n62">62</ref> and <persName>Lord's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cincinnati Detector</hi> of 1853 <ref target="#CH9-n63">63</ref> indicated they were still in circulation. They
                        circulated long and hard, and are commonly found in good or fair condition today. </p>

               <p> The draped bust cent as preceding, struck over an English colliery token. This overstrike was purchased by <persName>Fuld</persName> in 1959 from Schulman, Apr. 3, 1959, 1173, ex <persName>Winsor</persName> 244; <persName>Mills</persName>
                        135; the Brand Collection. Resold as MHS II 99. As detailed by <persName>Fuld</persName> , the identification of the undertype was
                        not trivial, but turned out to be a coal colliery token of I. WALKER, FLIMBY PARK COLLIERY, with a large D in the center of the reverse.

               <p> Draped Bust cent, rare die variety. <persName>Vlack</persName> 15-K. This unusual piece discovered about 1960, shows a die break
                        from under the <pb n="221"/> 7, through 83 and to the rim. Top three leaves close to N of INDEPENDENCE, mostly weak denticles. The main
                        toga fold curves over the 7 and ends over the center of the 1. The I of INDEPENDENCE points very slightly left of a bead. The 7 points
                        at a bead. The C is defective on top. Many of the letters may be recut, especially the NGTON and IND and ND. The 3 has a period directly
                        in back in its apex, and is very close. The two observed specimens have the die break from rim between the 7 and 8 curving through the 8
                        and 3 and ending at the rim between the 3 and period. Some defective beads. Reverse K has liberty cap just missing right side of base of
                        A of STATES. Olive branch lightly engraved, denticles weak at 6 o'clock, is reworked from reverse J with absence of period-like break at
                        branch, and no curls along the back of the neck. Die break as a chip occurs in back of D. The left of A is heavy, probably from a rusted
                        die. This reverse is used with the <placeName>Melbourne</placeName> muling, 1783.M1. Weight 127-128 grains. To date, only three
                        specimens observed. Extremely rare, R-7. Reported are B&amp;M, Nov. 3, 1995, 3058 ex B&amp;M, Jan 23, 1986 (Cole), 1297 (unattributed), <persName>Mike Ringo</persName> ; B&amp;M, Nov. 18, 1994, 3057; <persName>Fuld</persName> (1967), <persName>Picker</persName>

                        (later of 70 Red Lion Street), purchased a quantity of scrap metal from the rubbish of the just closed Soho mint. Peck 387 states that

                        grains. Obverse 17 has all three top leaves fully visible, the right leaf point right of center of N of INDEPENDENCE. The main toga fold
                        curves over the 7 and ends over the extreme right edge of the upright of the 1. The A has a flat top and is pointing to a bead. The I of
                        INDEPENDENCE has a bead over its center. The upright of the 7 points slightly right of a bead. The O is recut along its bottom, and the
                        1 and 7 also show recutting. The 1 of 1783 reengraved with a center line down the numeral. Reverse 1 very similar to reverse A, but
                        lettering more fully cut, heavy olive branch. The cap is very close to the right leg of A, but does not touch. The I has a bead over its
                        right center, and the A, which has a flat top, is pointing between beads. The right upright of <pb n="224"/> the U slants left. Reverse
                        die breaks develop across the tops of ATES extending to the water line. Later, another break occurs from the right side of the base of T
                        in UNITED touching the right serif of the T, extending to the rim. Rumors persist that plain edge pieces exist, but none have ever been
                        verified. This is by far the most common restrike. R-1. One specimen has corded edge over a reeded edge, reported by <persName>Collins</persName> . </p>
               <p> These dies may have been unused from the original 1818-20 period, but there is no "original" to match to these restrikes. The dies for
                        this piece were preserved and were resold by Kelly, Aug. 25, 1950 (ANA), 1049. ex <persName>B.G. Johnson</persName> , They were
                        purchased by a collector, Ruder from Ohio, who retired to <placeName>Florida</placeName> . When his collection was dispersed, Stacks
                        of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> had a transfer die made from the dies and struck uniface copies
                        with an advertising reverse in 1988. The original dies were then donated, in Ruder's name, to the Smithsonian Institution (see figs.
                        67-68, courtesy of the Numismatic Division, SI. The Stack's restrikes are fig. 69). </p>

                        touching the base of the I. The beads are very fine and close. There is a long crossbar to the G which is close to, but not touching the
                        left serif of T. The C is defective on top, and the A at the right base. The obverse comes fairly regularly with extensive die cracks. A
                        break, from the time, to the point of the bust through the space between period and W. Another from the rim through the center of the

                        From NNC 60th Sale, Lot 473 (1968). No duplicate has been reported. Combination la/A. This piece, although called extremely fine, was
                        very dark with verdigris on the reverse. Described in the sale as "We can find no evidence on this coin of the obv. or rev. die cracks
                        that are usually identified with the Small Bust variety. Instead, there is a break in the r. obverse field which follows an irregular
                        course down from under the second E to a ‘thread' projecting like a short ribbon end from the bottom corner of the lower bow. A
                        break-like defect, parallel to the middle of the crack just described, lies in the field above it adjacent to two similar, smaller and
                        less obvious defects. Also, the 7 in date has a spur projecting diagonally to the left from its top right corner, and the two base
                        points of the W are connected by a short break." These breaks might account for the scarcity of this obverse die. Present location not
                        known. Unique at the present time. </p>

                        recutting. The die is similar to Obverse 7. Die break at the rim below 8 extending to the right side of the 7. Another through the lower
                        portion of NDE. Reverse G has three berries on the branch. The I points at the space between beads, and the A points at a bead. The T of
                        the initials is over the left side of a bead. The S of the initials is over a bead, is slightly higher than the E, with the lower curve
                        of the S pointing to the center of a period. The reverse is similar to Reverse E. The cap ends below the left leg of A, and is distant.

               <p> Draped bust with button, 1783, <persName>Baker</persName> 5, <persName>Vlack</persName> 20-P. Originally listed by <persName>Baker</persName> from the <persName>Crosby</persName> Sale, Lot 284 as unique. Although still rare, there are four
                        distinct die varieties of this piece with 3 obverse and three reverse dies. A fifth variety has been described that has a button on the
                        drapery, but is probably a contemporary counterfeit and does not resemble the other types. The rarity of the four pieces shows that
                        combination 20-Q is the rarest, while the other three combinations, 20-P, 21-Q and 22-R, rate about the same, with about 6 to 10 each
                        known, the 20-Q is quite rare. The contemporary counterfeit, 24-T, listed earlier is apparently unique. The general description of all
                        pieces is as follows: Bust in a Roman mantle, facing left, laureated, with button on drapery above date. Legend, <placeName>WASHINGTON</placeName> &amp; INDEPENDENCE • 1783 •. Reverse, design same as on WA.NC.1783.7 through 1783.17. A seated figure of Liberty,
                        with an olive branch in her extended right hand, and supporting in her left, the staff and liberty cap. Legend, <placeName>UNITED STATES</placeName> ; in exergue, T.W.I. E.S. Obverse 20 has the A pointing slightly to the right of a bead, and the I of
                        INDEPENDENCE has a bead about over its center. A heavy bead sometimes shows near the rim below the 8, and another slightly right of the
                        1. Die break from the rim through the last N of <placeName>WASHINGTON</placeName> to the bottom of the &amp; sign, to the first leaf of
                        the wreath. Another from the rim to between the W and A. A minor break also connects the H and I along the bottom. Reverse P has the cap
                        extending between the A and T and touches the T. The center of the I and A points left of a bead. The T of the initials is over a bead.
                        The S of the initials is over a bead, is slightly higher then the E, with the lower curve of the S pointing to the center of the period.
                            <hi rend="italic"> There is no period after the S. The D in UNITED has a period in its center. </hi> Die break along the bottom of N

                        and T, is very close, but does not touch the T. The center of the I points left of a bead, and the A right of a bead. The T of the

                        Die breaks—a small break from the rim to the top of the &amp; sign. Another from the center of the right upright of the last N of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> to the bottom of the &amp; sign. Break from the rim between the E and N,

               <p> Double Head cent, assigned <persName>Vlack</persName> 29-Y by Ringo. <ref target="#CH9-n71">71</ref> This piece has flat rims
                        giving it the appearance of being in lower relief. The planchet is 1 mm larger (28 mm) and the edge is rounded rather than squared off.
                        Possibly struck outside a collar, weight 131.8 grains. Die differences are the central point of the star below the bust points between
                        two beads, instead of at a bead as on 28-Y. The centers of the two right legs on the N's each point at a bead, they point between the
                        beads on the 28-Y. The cord above the epaulet on the new obverse is longer, and the ends curve outward with a triangular projection
                        inside. On the 28-Y, the cord is shorter with straight ends, and there is a bead inside it. The bow in the hair is detached from the
                        braid, and the frill on the coat is made up of two separate sections. Possibly a trial strike before 1783.NC.24, and only one reported.

                     <p> When the <persName>Hilles specimen</persName> of the 1792 silver Getz piece was sold by B&amp;M in March 1995, an interesting
                                letter from <persName>Margaret Hilles Shearman</persName> offering the coin at $2,500 on Sept. 11 1955, was reported by
                                    <persName>Eric P. Newman</persName> (see fig. A). Mrs. <persName>Shearman</persName> , 82 at the time, wrote to
                                Mr. <persName>Newman</persName> at the suggestion of Stuart Mosher of the Smithsonian Institution. Mr. <persName>Newman</persName> replied to her letter, but there was no answer. </p>

            <p> Between 1776 and 1787, Congress authorized the creation of 11 medals in gold or silver to be presented to major heroes in the Revolutionary
                    War. <ref target="#CH10-n1">1</ref> Up to that time, few medals had been struck in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> , and these mostly under emergency conditions and with varying quality. Through the practice of giving medals to the
                    leaders of allied Indian tribes, British and French medals had become common in the colonies. <ref target="#CH10-n2">2</ref> As <placeName>France</placeName> was <placeName>America's</placeName> leading ally in the struggle, and the recognized master of medallic
                    art in the period, it was there that Congress turned for the production of these medals. </p>
            <p> The production was overseen by an American representative in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> , who transmitted the
                    wishes of Congress, and whatever details on the battle were available, to the Académie des Inscriptions, which decided on appropriate Latin
                    legends and allegorical themes. A common theme on most was the use of the phrase COMITIA AMERICANA to translate "American Congress." The
                    design of the medal was then commissioned to individual artists, who used whatever portraits might be available and engraved the dies, using
                    hubs for the central motifs and individual letter punches for the legends. The artists involved in these medals were <persName>
                        Pierre Simon Benjamin Duvivier, Nicolas Marie Gatteaux </persName> , and <persName>Augustin Dupre</persName> , three of the leading
                    medalists for French coins, jetons, and royal medals of the period. The medals were struck at the French mint, which usually kept the dies. </p>
            <p> Many delays ensued in the design and execution of the individual medals. The first completed was that awarded to <persName>Francois
                        de Fleury</persName> and given to him in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> in 1783. Most of the others were seen for
                    the first time when they were included in a set of 11 silver medals given to <persName>George Washington</persName> in 1790 and now in
                    the collection of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Historical Society. This set lacked the medal voted for <persName>John Paul Jones</persName> , which was just being completed, and that for <persName>Henry Lee</persName> , which apparently had been
                    forgotten. Congress quickly commissioned the American engraver <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> to make a substitute medal for <persName>Lee</persName> , generally following the format of the French ones. Two medals were included in the set given to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> which had not been authorized by Congress: the Libertas Americana medal which
                    had been undertaken by <persName>Benjamin Franklin</persName> , and a portrait medal of Franklin. Soon after receiving his set, and his
                    own gold medal, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> ordered the creation of a medal to be given to foreign
                    dignitaries who had aided the infant Republic; this Diplomatic Medal was the last of the official American medals to be made in <placeName>France</placeName> . </p>
            <p> In addition to the medals presented to the designated individuals and those in the set given to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> , other examples have been <pb n="263"/> made over the years. In many cases, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> mint has kept the dies in active use from the eighteenth century to the present,
                    creating restrikes in various metals on order from customers. Beginning in 1832, it adopted the practice of stamping the edge of gold and
                    silver restrikes with an identifying mark, and, in 1841, extended this to all metals and added the name of the metal in French: OR (gold),
                    ARGENT (silver), CUIVRE (copper) and BRONZE (bronze). The date ranges for the various symbols are: "antique lamp," 1832-41; "anchor
                    intertwined with C," 1841-42; "galley prow," 1842-45; "pointing hand," 1845-60; "bee," 1860-79; "cornucopia," 1880 to present. <ref target="#CH10-n3">3</ref>

            <p> In the course of the nineteenth century, restrikes were undertaken for some of the medals in the series by the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> Mint in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . The earliest efforts were in the 1860s, when examples struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> were hubbed to make new dies of gun metal. These were then used to strike medals
                    which were basically identical with the originals, but had much less clarity. Later in the century, new dies were made in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , copied from the original medals but newly modelled and with different letter punches. Only in the <pb n="264"/>
                    case of the <persName>de Fleury, Howard</persName> , and Diplomatic Medals was there any overt indication of the origin of these
                    American restrikes. For the <placeName>United States</placeName> Bicentennial celebrations in 1976, the <placeName>U.S.</placeName>
                    Mint issued a set of 11 pewter copies of the authorized medals in a set called " <placeName>America's</placeName> First Medals"; these
                    are uniformly 38 mm in diameter and are not included in the catalogue below. </p>
            <p> The catalogue describes all examples of the medals of the Comitia Americana series currently in the collection of the American Numismatic
                    Society. They represent the gifts and bequests of two dozen individuals who have helped to build the collection through their generosity;
                    those for which provenance is listed as unknown were mostly acquired in the nineteenth century. Also included are photos of original
                    examples, those in gold awarded to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> and Gates, and the silver pieces in the
                    set given to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> in 1790.I am thankful to the various institutions and
                    individuals who made these available for publication here, especially to <persName>John W. Adams</persName> , who made available <persName>John J. Ford</persName> , Jr.'s excellent photographs of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> Historical Society pieces
                    and arranged for the permission for their publication. The medals are grouped by die combination and in approximate order of striking.
                    References are in chronological order; they are to bronze specimens unless otherwise indicated. <ref target="#CH10-n4">4</ref>

               <p> The medal was authorized by Congress on March 25, 1776, only a week after the engagement it celebrates. It took another 14 years,
                        however, before the gold striking could be presented to then President <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>
                        . The medal was produced under the supervision first of <persName>Robert Morris</persName> , then of <persName>David
                            Humphreys</persName> , and finally of <persName>Thomas Jefferson</persName> . The legends and design were worked out by the
                        Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and the dies were engraved by the chief engraver of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Mint, <persName>Benjamin Duvivier</persName> . The obverse portrait was copied from a
                        marble bust by <persName>Jean Antoine Houdon</persName> . The completed gold medal was presented to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> by <persName>Jefferson</persName> on March 21, 1790; at the same time <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> received a mahogany box containing a silver striking of this plus 10
                        other medals in this series. The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Mint has struck versions of this medal from
                        1790 through the present, using at least two obverse dies and four reverses. Copy dies were made from a French striking by the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> mint in 1863 and used to strike medals until 1884, when new dies were engraved there. </p>

                  <p> This die is known from two white metal splashers ( <persName>Garrett</persName> and no. 11 below), and from a copper
                            electrotype ( <persName>Dreyfuss</persName> ) which lacks the artist's signature. A French sketch of the obverse from 1788
                            which has an exergue line below the bust suggests that this was an early trial for the medal, as does the observation that the <persName>Garrett</persName> splasher is paired with a splasher of Reverse A. It is usually thought to have been made earlier
                            than obverse 1, possibly for approval by the Americans commissioning the piece, and rejected in favor of it. </p>

                        to the <placeName>New-York</placeName> Historical Society, where most of Gates's papers reside. The dies were used in 1801 by <persName>Adam Eckfeld</persName> to strike silver and tin examples and then were given to the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>
                        mint, where they were also used for restrikes. After 1885 a new reverse die was cut by <persName>William Barber</persName> ,

                        known struck example appears to be that from the Washington set in the Massachusetts Historical Society. </p>

               <p> 6. <persName>Henry Lee</persName> for the Capture of <placeName>Paulus Hook</placeName> , August 19, 1779. </p>
               <p> Congress resolved on September 24, 1779, to have a gold medal made for <persName>Lee</persName> for the successful attack on the
                        British fort at <placeName>Paulus Hook</placeName> (now <placeName>Jersey City</placeName> ). When the set of silver medals
                        arrived for <persName>Washington</persName> 10 years later, it was apparent that the medal for Lee had been overlooked, and the
                        American engraver <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> was commissioned to make dies for the medal. There is no evidence that the
                        medal was ever struck or delivered to <persName>Lee</persName> , but lead trial strikings were produced. A new obverse die appears
                        to have been made in 1874 for use in uniface strikings, but it cracked immediately. A new reverse die was made in 1874, and a repaired
                        version of the obverse was introduced some time thereafter. </p>

               </head>
               <p> It wasn't until 1787 that Congress voted a gold medal to <persName>John Paul Jones</persName> for his capture of the <hi rend="italic">Serapis</hi> off the coast of <placeName>Scotland</placeName> in 1779. <persName>Thomas Jefferson</persName>
                        arranged to have the medal made by <persName>Augustin Dupré</persName> from a portrait bust by <persName>Houdon</persName> .
                            <persName>Jones</persName> , who was on service to <persName>Catherine II</persName> of <placeName>Russia</placeName>
                        at the time, offered to fund the production of four gold medals (one for himself, one for <persName>Catherine</persName> , one for
                            <persName>Louis XVI</persName> and one for the <placeName>United States</placeName> ) and requested that no silver or bronze
                        be made pending his possible commissioning of additional gold pieces. In the end, only those for <persName>Jones</persName> and
                            <persName>Catherine</persName> seem to have been struck, and no example was included in the silver set given to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> in 1790. In 1863, gun metal dies were made in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> from restrikes sent from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> . These appear to have broken
                        soon and a new set was made by the same method. When these were no longer usable, totally new dies were cut. In 1939, the original dies
                        were brought from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> to the <placeName>United States</placeName> Naval Academy,
                        and at least one gold restrike has been made from them since then. </p>

                            Howard</persName> . The plans for the <persName>Morgan</persName> medal were finally approved by the Académie des Inscriptions in

                            Washington</persName> . The gold original was lost, and in 1836 Congress authorized the cutting of new dies to make an example for <persName>Morgan's</persName> heirs.

               <p> In October of 1781, Congress authorized a gold medal for <persName>Greene</persName> for his bold attack on the British forces at
                            <placeName>Eutaw Springs</placeName> , <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> . The medal was the last to be authorized by
                        Congress but, despite the fact that it was one of the first completed, was awarded posthumously to <persName>Greene's</persName>
                        widow in 1787. The dies were engraved by <persName>Augustin Dupré</persName> , who contracted to strike 24 examples; the medal does
                        not seem to have been restruck by the French mint. New dies were made at the <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> in 1890,
                        perhaps after an attempt at hubbing from an old specimen. </p>

               </head>
               <p> The Libertas Americana was made totally on the initiative of <persName>Benjamin Franklin</persName> as a celebration of the
                        victories at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName> in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781; it was never sanctioned by Congress. <persName>Franklin</persName> developed the legends and imagery through consultation with English and French scholars and artists and engaged
                            <persName>Augustin Dupré</persName> to engrave the dies. In 1783, he presented two gold specimens to <persName>Louis
                            XVI</persName> and <persName>Marie Antoinette</persName> and silver ones to French ministers and the Grand Master of <placeName>Malta</placeName> ; he sent a silver one to the President of Congress, <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName> , and
                        promised copper ones for the members of Congress. He had a four-page brochure advertising the medal printed in French and English. A
                        silver example was included in the set of medals presented to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> in 1790.
                        There is no evidence for the subsequent use of the dies or of the creation of new ones for restrikes; the piece in the set for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> shows a further progression in the die break than other pieces catalogued

               <p> The <persName>Franklin</persName> medal was not authorized by Congress; it is not known whose initiative lay behind it or how much
                        of a role <persName>Franklin</persName> himself had in the choice of designs or legends. The earliest designs, by <persName>Franklin's</persName> friend <persName>Augustin Dupré</persName> , are dated 1783; the two reverses bear the dates
                        1784 and 1786 respectively. An example with the second reverse was included in the set given to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> in March of 1790, after <persName>Franklin's</persName> return to <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> and a month before his death. The dies have remained at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> mint, where they have been used for restrikes. The obverse die was replaced some
                        time around the middle of the nineteenth century; the second version reverse die was replaced some time in the past century. </p>

               </head>
               <p> By Presidential order, gold medals were authorized in 1790 for the <persName>Marquis de la Luzerne</persName> , French Minister to
                        the <placeName>United States</placeName> from 1779 to 1784, and in 1791 to the Count <persName>de Moustier</persName> , French
                        Minister to the <placeName>United States</placeName> from 1787 to 1791. The production was handled by <persName>William</persName> Short, the American chargé d'affaires in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> , who commissioned
                            <persName>Augustin Dupré</persName> to make the dies and strike two gold medals. The French Revolution caused a delay by
                        keeping <persName>Dupré</persName> busy with dies for the new coinage. Another delay was caused by the breaking of one of the dies
                        in hardening, after it had produced lead trials; the broken die is in the collection of the <placeName>Boston</placeName> Public
                        Library as is the obverse hub. In 1792, the gold medals were given out to the agent of <persName>Luzerne</persName> , who had
                        recently died in exile, and to <placeName>Moustier</placeName> , who was soon to emigrate; their whereabouts are unknown. Six bronze
                        medals were delivered to Short at the same time. <persName>Charles Barber</persName> made new dies of the medal in 1876, copied
                        from lead trials of the original. </p>
