            <p>This monograph is chiefly due to the initiative of <name type="pname">Mr. O. P. Eklund</name>, whose specializing in "Minor Coinages" is well known, and who early realized the importance of the tokens issued by the haciendas of Mexico. The careful catalogue which comprises the major part of this publication is his work, save for some slight additions or modifications. A volume of rubbings of all the pieces which had come to his notice, including the collection formed by him and later acquired by <name type="pname">Mr. Howard D. Gibbs</name>, supplemented his manuscript. This was later amplified by the pieces acquired by The American Numismatic Society.</p>
            <p>The pieces illustrated on the plates are part of the cabinet of The American Numismatic Society. Reference to the catalogue is made by number. Pieces bearing monograms are designated by letters on the plates, as they are not included in the alphabetical catalogue. Those described in the monograph, <hi rend="italic">Los Tlacos Coloniales</hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>, 1935), by Señor Manuel Romero de Terreros are so designated, and the ones he illustrates are asterisked.</p>
            <p>The complicated coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> has intrigued many numismatists and collectors. The War of Independence (1811–21), the era of Maximilian, and the Revolution of 1913–16, have all left indelible marks upon the country's coinage, and previous monographs published by The American Numismatic Society have considered some of the problems connected with this coinage. Our present concern is with the group of Mexico's coins, generally known as "Hacienda Tokens," which, because of the extended chronological period over which their issues extend, shares in the complexity. It provides an admirable illustration of the importance of a minor coinage in reflecting the life of a people. Inasmuch as definition is the best corrective for complexity, it will be well for us to digress long enough to obtain a comprehension of what the word "hacienda" involves. An excursus into the geography and agrarian economy of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> may be found not without value for other phases of that country's monetary history.</p>
            <p>In 1923, The American Geographical Society published in its Research Series (No. 12) a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">The Land Systems of

We are under obligation to <name type="pname">Dr. McBride</name> for illuminating quotations which will afford the reader a better understanding of the situation than may be had by other than direct recourse to his book, which is now out of print.

            <p>One important statement must be made as a preliminary. The hacienda system which <name type="pname">Dr. McBride</name> has described so helpfully is gone. It has passed—just as the cowboy and the life of the range which figured so controllingly in the development of the West in our own country no longer exist. The political changes which have brought this about are not part of our study, but it is interesting to note that the transition is still going on and its course is providing a profitable field of observation to economists.</p>
            <p>In reading what <name type="pname">Dr. McBride</name> has written, we must keep in mind that where he uses the present we must supply the past tense even though his book was written only twenty-five years ago.</p>
            <p>"The haciendas of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> are the most conspicuous feature of the land system of the country. They give to agricultural <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> its distinctive cast, and, by their great size, create the impression that the entire land is divided into vast rural estates. These properties, indeed, are the only type of agricultural holding immediately visible to the traveler in many parts of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>, just as the <hi rend="italic">haciendado</hi> is the only type of agriculturist whose interests reach beyond the immediate neighborhood of his home.</p>
            <p>"Many of the haciendas are of very great extent; it is estimated that 300 of them contain at least 25,000 acres each; 116 have not less than 62,500 acres; 51 have approximately 75,000 acres; while 11 are believed to have 250,000 acres apiece.<ref target="#CH1-n1*">*</ref> The Mexican hacienda seldom contains less than 25,000 acres—whether situated in the arid plans of the north, where land is worth little or nothing, or in the densely settled areas of the Mesa Central, where the price of land is high even in comparison with that of agricultural lands in other countries.</p>
            <pb n="3"/>
            <p>"The great size of these holdings is due, in part, to the fact that the typical hacienda aspires to be self-sustaining, and the variety of a countryside is taxed to render it independent. Hence, for the many different products required, different kinds of land must be included within its limits. In the first place, a large acreage of valley land is needed for the production of grain. These hundreds of thousands of acres of arable land form the nucleus of the estate. An <hi rend="italic">haciendado</hi> would not, however, be satisfied to hold valley lands alone; for, in his economy, the products of the hills are only less important than those of the lowlands. Thus, the farm requires a supply of water, for irrigation as well as for the live stock; the hacienda must, therefore, include some stream, which should be controlled up to its headwaters in order to insure the undisputed use of the supply. Again, grazing land is needed for the herds of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats; this is found upon the parklike mountain sides and the alpine meadows. Timber, also, is a prime necessity and is derived either from the deciduous trees that grow along the lower mountain slopes or from the pine forests that clothe the tops of the higher ridges. The products even of the waste land are likewise essential, since from this are obtained stone and lime for building purposes, clay for adobe huts, coarse grass for thatched roofs, salt, and the wild fruits and herbs which are gathered for household use. The administration of such extensive properties necessarily presents great difficulties.</p>
            <p>"The haciendas are settlements complete in themselves. Indeed, few of these estates have less than a hundred, while many of them have as many as a thousand, inhabitants. In Michoacán there are two haciendas, Huaracha and Buenavista, each of which maintains over two thousand persons; while in <name type="place">Morelos, Mexico, Puebla, Durango, Veracruz, Queretaro</name>, and <name type="place">Chihuahua</name> there are others in which the number is not much smaller. Furthermore, the haciendas are all named; they appear on the maps, and they are important units of public administration, often being incorporated as <hi rend="italic">municipios</hi>. They include all the customary accessories of an independent community, such as a church, a store, a post office, a burying ground and sometimes a school or a hospital. Workshops are maintained, not only for the repair but even for the manufacture of machinery
<pb n="4"/>
and of the numerous implements required upon the estate. Over this aggregation the owner presides in a more or less patriarchal manner, the degree of paternal care or of tyranny varying with the character of the individual and with that of his superior employees."</p>
            <p>In an earlier chapter of his book, <name type="place">Dr. McBride</name> explains that the tillable soil is chiefly to be found in the tableland section of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>, known as the <hi rend="italic">Mesa Centrale,</hi> and that, with relatively unimportant exceptions, the exigencies of rainfall and soil impose conditions which make haciendas impossible elsewhere. In more modern times irrigation has somewhat affected these conditions. The <hi rend="italic">Mesa Centrale</hi> is the most thickly populated section of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>. It surrounds the capital city, and we are told that its climatic conditions are admirable, since "altitude counteracts latitude with such nicety that the mean temperature over the entire plateau is nearly uniform." Most of the haciendas are to be found in this section, and they provide the agricultural supplies not only for themselves but for the remainder of the country, where climatic conditions are less favorable. From the quotations already cited, something of the independent nature of these huge land holdings will have been shown, and it will be apparent that conditions favorable to the untroubled operation of such large units encouraged conservatism on the part of the owners. The employment of native laborers and the faults of the peonage system led to occasional insurrections and explain some of the happenings in Mexico's history.</p>
            <p>It is not surprising to find, under such conditions, that the owners of the haciendas found it necessary to have a circulating medium of low denomination, and that this medium should vary widely in form and reflect some of the independence that marks the life of the hacienda. It is this very diversity which has attracted the attention of numismatists to these tokens.</p>
            <p>There are, and always have been, wide differences in the haciendas—a condition inevitable because of their varying adaptability to the raising of agricultural products of a wide range, as well as to problems of labor and water supply. The employment of Indians and the growth of the peonage system played a considerable part in their development. Some of the haciendas found their land suitable for cattle-raising, and those for which this became the princi-
<pb n="5"/>
pal objective are called <hi rend="italic">rancheros</hi>. We shall see that there is much plausibility for the identification claimed for some of the monograms which appear on the tokens as marks used for branding cattle. Another modification, due to the employment of native workers, finds its cause dating back before the Spanish conquest, when tribal holdings of property were vested in the chief. Some of the Indian pueblos resisted encroachment, and survived in the form of collective holdings. Some of the tokens, as we shall see, are issues of such <hi rend="italic">municipalidades,</hi> although not all such are to be considered of Indian origin.</p>
            <p>In view of all these conditions, and of others not considered, we shall look in vain for uniformity in the tokens. In fact, part of their attractiveness is their resistance to classification. There were some hacienda tokens in the famous Fonrobert Collection sold in Berlin in 1878, and that catalogue was for a long period practically the only source for numismatists seeking information regarding them. Under date of 1932, a short article, "Mexikanische Hacienda-Marken,"<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> by Friedrich Freiherr von Schrötter, recorded specimens in the Berlin Museum with a fairly representative selection illustrated on a single, excellent plate.</p>
            <p>The difficulties in the way of identifying these pieces are illustrated by the author's describing as different (his Nos. 28 and 31) two pieces with the same monogram (compare with our illustration Plate IX). Although not from the identical die, and differing in their flan outlines (one is heart-shaped and the other oval), the monogram is unquestionably the same, and the difference in shape probably indicates issues separated by a short interval in output. Had the author been in possession of a larger body of material on which to base his conclusions, he would probably have modified some of them.</p>
            <p>In 1935, a privately printed "Ensayo Numismatico" by Manuel Romero de Terreros, entitled <hi rend="italic">Los Tlacos Coloniales,</hi> appeared—the first indication, so far as we know, that the importance of these tokens had been appreciated by Mexican scholars. This is limited to pieces believed to have been struck before 1821. The author gives a valuable summary of the legislation regarding coinage in copper
<pb n="6"/>
and a description of over two hundred varieties of these tokens, as well as illustrations of fifty-eight. Unfortunately, some of his selections for illustration do not lend themselves to half-tone reproduction. This study, however, is the first serious effort to treat the hacienda tokens. The information it supplies concerning them is truly impressive and of great value, and certainly deserves a wider distribution and appreciation than it has received. With the kind permission of the author, many of the pieces have been included here.</p>
            <p>A second publication by the same author is entitled "Las Monedas de Necesidad del Estado de Michoacán."<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> The concern here is not with hacienda tokens as such, but with the issues of a single state of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>, most of which are octavos and quartos put out by municipalities and haciendas between 1825—that is, shortly after the close of the War of Independence—and 1871, just before the death of Juarez. The effort seems to have been to provide for the need of small change which was being insufficiently supplied by the governmental strikings. This study gives helpful information regarding the issuing authorities, a careful description of more than one hundred and fifty varieties, and four plates illustrating forty pieces. In addition, there is an illuminating map showing the location of many of the places named. It is to be hoped that a similar treatment of the issues of other states will follow.</p>
            <p>The collection of hacienda tokens at the Museum of The American Numismatic Society owes a great deal to the initiative and interest of the late Howland Wood, the far-seeing curator of its collections from 1913 to 1938, who did much to stimulate interest in this series. He transmitted his appreciation of their importance to his successor, and to others. After his death in 1938, an opportunity came to the Museum to acquire the considerable collection of hacienda pieces formed over a long period of years by <name type="pname">Mr. H. L. Hill</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</name>, under especially favorable circumstances. These represented, in most cases, pieces in fine condition, and comprised a sizable proportion of dated issues. The acquisition was made possible through subscriptions from <name type="pname">Messrs. E. T. Newell</name>,
<pb n="7"/>
               <name type="pname">F. C. C. Boyd, H. E. Gillingham, Elliot Smith</name> and <name type="pname">Moritz Wormser</name>, which supplemented a balance in the Avery Fund. The accession raised the Society's holdings to a much higher level; and since that time a few further additions have increased its importance. The gift by <name type="pname">Mr. Alexander Orlowski</name> of tokens acquired during a visit to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> was one outstanding addition, and a small lot acquired in the market added several desirable varieties. The Society has now a thoroughly representative collection, although it can never hope to secure one that can claim anything like completeness.</p>
            <p>A glance at the plates will show that hacienda tokens have great variety as to form; that they provide an impressive mass of material for study of their historical bearing should also be obvious. Wear, probably due to circulation, imperfect striking, countermarking and other vicissitudes reduce their attractiveness to a minimum, but the strong individuality which marks many of these pieces is ample compensation for their lack of aesthetic appeal.</p>
            <p>Circulation of the tokens was forbidden in 1917, and a provision that all salary payments must be made in legal tender was written into the Constitution of 1924.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> We are told that these tokens are rarely to be found in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> now, and there seems strong probability that most of them have been melted down or have disappeared for other reasons. The many and great changes in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> during the period in which they circulated are reflected in these substitutes for coin. After 1871, the growth in commercial prosperity brought about the introduction of modern business tokens, which it is difficult to separate from the pieces issued by the haciendas. While their legends are more explicit, the later issues have none of the attractiveness of the pre-revolutionary pieces. It is to the period between 1821 and 1847 that most of the selection of municipal issues on Plates XXI and XXII belong, a selection which supplements rather than repeats the one made by <name type="pname">M. Romero de Terreros</name> for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2995955">Michoacán</name>. One circumstance of prime importance emphasized by <name type="pname">Romero de Terreros</name> will bear repetition here. The Spanish colonial government did not begin the coinage of low denominations in copper until 1814. There seems to have been an aversion to the use of copper on the part of the natives, and earlier
<pb n="8"/>
efforts to introduce a minor coinage in this metal had resulted in failure. These issues are found sometimes during the reign of Ferdinand VII, used a second time through the application of a counterstamped monogram or incised initials, and serve to date the second use as later than we might otherwise have thought.</p>
            <p>The foregoing will enable the reader to realize that the most interesting period for these hacienda tokens is the colonial, that is, up to 1821. Any classification based on the names that appear on the tokens meets complications because of the large number of pieces bearing monograms, some of which are so involved that unanimity in reading them, and therefore ease in their identification, is out of the question. Furthermore, the monogram of the same hacienda will change in form on successive issues to an extent which makes a conclusion that they represent the same holding an assumption rather than a conviction. Then, too, some family names are fairly common in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>, as elsewhere, and the given names of the haciendas are likely to be repeated (e.g., Buena Vista). Distinguishing between what is "municipalidad" and what is "hacienda" is all but impossible for one who does not have a thorough knowledge of Mexican geography and history. Fortunately for our purposes, a number of the tokens are dated or are datable, and it has been decided to arrange the plates so that the chronological consideration is the one emphasized. This permits a grouping which lessens or seems to lessen the confusion and enables a break-down into sub-groups, and makes further study easier. It must be made clear through repetition that this listing is not complete or comprehensive. It will have to be modified as further evidence is brought forward and closer dating becomes possible. For that reason, the steps leading to the conclusions expressed are frankly laid before the reader, and any rigidity of statement or of contention is avoided where doubt exists. Bringing order out of the complexities of this series can be effected only by the further cooperation of interested collectors.</p>
            <p>Because of the variations in the practices of the <hi rend="italic">haciendados</hi> and other issuers of these tokens, it is almost impossible to be consistent in making an arrangement of them. Since some of the tokens show an earlier design which has not been entirely obliterated, indicating a second using of the piece, and because countermarking occurs, so
<pb n="9"/>
that a name may be superimposed on a monogram or a monogram over the name, the wide variance in the unregulated procedure must be taken into consideration in using the plates. These have been arranged to show what homogeneity there is so far as the dates are concerned, so far as the shapes are concerned, and so far as the monograms are concerned. There are also plates showing the tokens put forth after 1821 by the <hi rend="italic">municipalidades</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pueblos,</hi> as well as ones bearing the word <hi rend="italic">puente</hi> (bridge).</p>
            <p>When a given piece permits the reading of a name, its location in the alphabetical list and thence the reference to its place on the plates of this monograph is simple. The pieces bearing monograms only are less susceptible to arrangement and consequently are not included in the alphabetical list. With a few exceptions, the earlier ones have been segregated on PLATES II to IV. Some which seem to be later issues will be found on PLATE XIX. Many of them will be easily decipherable to our Mexican confrères even though they may be puzzling to us. In some cases conjectural identifications have been given which may require later correction. This may also be true of statements regarding locations of the issuing agencies.</p>
            <p>It is comparatively easy to identify and separate the store cards and business tokens made after 1870 on the basis of workmanship or material. Hard rubber, celluloid, wood and thin brass with a consistent style of lettering are used for pieces which are usually distinguishable from pre-revolutionary issues by anyone who has even a nodding acquaintance with hacienda tokens. The great number of these pieces is sufficient reason for our not including them here, even though there are some which bear the name "hacienda." Some of the wooden pieces may be older than we consider them here. The likelihood of their having been preserved is even slighter than that of their metal counterparts, but those that are dated indicate the general period of their circulation as between 1870-1880.</p>
            <p>Because of the many uncertainties which invest the earlier hacienda tokens, it has been deemed desirable to begin our commentary on the pieces with those of comparatively late dates (illustrated on PLATE XX) and it might be well to state why this is so. In 1814, Calleja, the Spanish Viceroy, ordered the coining of two, one and one-half quartos of copper (i.e., one-half, one-quarter and
<pb n="10"/>
one-eighth reales), and in the following December their acceptance was assured by the passage of a law regulating their circulation and limiting the amount acceptable as legal tender. Quartillos of silver had been struck from 1794 to 1816; these for some reason seem not to have met the needs supplied by the copper pieces. With the outbreak of the War of Independence, we find that the difficulty of moving bullion from the mines to the mint of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> City became too great a risk, and branch mints were established in six localities—Chihuahua, Durango, Guadalajara, Guanajunto, Sombrerete and Zacatecas. Provisional coinages were also struck at Nueva Viscaya, Oaxaca, Real del Catorce and Valladolid. For the insurgent forces, almost the entire coinage of <name type="place">Morelos</name> in Oaxaca was in copper, although it involved a promise of <name type="place">Morelos</name> of redemption in gold and silver upon the resumption of the mines. Although there are octavos dating within the period of the War of Independence, they appear to have been destined to meet local needs, and their scarcity seems a dependable indication that their quantity was small. The inability of <name type="place">Morelos</name> to redeem his promises may have contributed to the disfavor in which copper seems to have been held.</p>
            <p>It is not easy to gauge the extent to which the coinage of hacienda tokens was affected by the changed condition. Certainly there are few pieces dated between 1814 and 1821, whereas the municipal issues seem to have been widely struck.</p>
            <p>As an outcome of the War of Independence, municipal tokens developed a considerable degree of uniformity. Many bear numerals indicating their value as one-eighth real, and occasionally we find the word <hi rend="italic">tlaco</hi> appearing on them. Their workmanship or die-cutting will not serve as a dependable dating criterion, for some of the earlier ones are much better than those dating years later. It is instructive to study groups such as that for Colima, called a <hi rend="italic">Villa</hi> on one issue (PLATE XX) or that of <name type="place">Ameca</name>, a <hi rend="italic">pueblo</hi> (Plate XX). For each of these groups, the progression of dates and the attendant changes give a clear indication of the troubled state of the country, even after peace had returned. It is because of this that Romero de Terreros has justly called certain pieces struck in the state of Michoacán "coins of necessity," although he is careful to explain that this does not imply anything in the nature of a siege piece such as
<pb n="11"/>
frequently was the case with this classification in Europe.</p>
            <p>The first piece of the group bearing the name of Colima <ref target="#fig-218">(PLATE XX, No. 106)</ref> is dated 1813, is uniface, and otherwise differs but slightly from the hacienda tokens which preceded it. It was during this year that <name type="place">Morelos</name> was active; on December 22, he suffered a serious reverse at Valladolid. Haste may therefore explain the form of the square piece dated 1814 (<ref target="#fig-221">PLATE XX, No. 107</ref>). By 1816, there was a return to the earlier form, except that it is no longer uniface, but bears on the reverse a monogram to be read as "Colima," and this form seems to have persisted until 1824, for which year we have three differing issues.</p>
            <p>The other series illustrated on PLATE XX consists of uniface coins of <name type="place">Ameca</name>, a <hi rend="italic">pueblo,</hi> that is, an Indian controlled holding, situated in the district of Jalisco, with a population given as 1500. Here, there is a sharp contrast between the workmanship of the earliest piece, dated 1814, (No. 25) and those which follow. The inscription is noteworthy—P.D. <name type="place">Ameca</name> QUITILLA D 1814. In the field, there is a façade of a building surmounted by a cross and flanked by two conventionalized trees (?), with "3" on the left and "8" on the right. The piece is uniface. The coin dated 1833 (No. 31) has coarse lettering, while one dated 1853 (No. 30) is even cruder and the inscription reads from the rim. There are two issues dated 1855 with lettering that is still crude. An undated issue (No. 26), whose workmanship would seem to place it as later, bears the designation "TLACO DE <name type="place">AMECA</name>."</p>
            <p>The historical value of some of these tokens is illustrated by <ref target="#fig-239">No. 197 (PLATE XXII)</ref>, a coin of Hermosillo in the Province of Sonora at the north.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> A concession to coin silver quartillos in this town was obtained in 1828.</p>
            <p>The earliest dated specimens of this silver coinage are from 1832, and pieces are known for the following six years. The "L. S." on the obverse is read as an abbreviation for "Leonardo Santoyo," the concessionaire, who was connected with the mining interests of the district. It is noteworthy that the coinage in copper did not start until 1851. It is not improbable that equally impor-
<pb n="12"/>
tant historical data may be recorded by others of these <hi rend="italic">tlacos,</hi>
               <hi rend="italic">tlacos,</hi>
 but without detailed knowledge of their local significance, we must await their consideration by Mexican numismatists.</p>
            <p>Two of the <name type="place">Ameca</name> pieces (<ref target="#fig-227">PLATE XX, Nos. 30</ref> and <ref target="#fig-226">31</ref>) bear initials which are read as for personal names. The implication is that these are in the nature of store cards.</p>
            <p>Breaking up the tokens which come before 1821 into smaller groups would be extremely difficult without the help which we get from the dated pieces, although groupings according to characteristics of flan or of execution of their lettering become fairly obvious and, within limits, reasonably dependable once we have the dated pieces for a key. In the arrangement of the plates we have tried to bring this out. It would greatly simplify our study if we could say that the pieces having naturalistic or irregular shapes, such as leaves, flowers, hearts, and other simple but distinctive forms, many of which are undated, are preceded by those bearing monograms only, and that, in general, the monograms precede those bearing the names in full, but there are too many exceptions to make such a generalization. Fortunately, we have a few dated pieces which tend to confirm this, but there seems to have been too much overlapping to make any such classification certain. Many of these exceptions are probably due to scanty mechanical facilities for making the tokens in the widely separated centers in which they originated. For example, in the period between 1800 and 1806, there is a certain homogeneity in the pieces which are shown on PLATE X and, although we are without clear indication of their locale, these haciendas probably will be found to have lain within an area which was served by a single die-cutter. Such a one may have received his training from some jeweller, or even through an apprenticeship in the mint of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> City. A second group within this period (PLATE XII) is of a much clumsier fabric and heavier workmanship, and here we have an indication that two of the pieces came from Celaya <ref target="#fig-123">(No. 470)</ref> and Queretaro <ref target="#fig-122">(No. 362)</ref>, respectively, two cities not widely separated. It would not be surprising to find that the two haciendas whose tokens follow (<ref target="#fig-125">Nos. 72</ref> and <ref target="#fig-124">297</ref>) were located in the same neighborhood. It will be seen that trying to date pieces on the
<pb n="13"/>
basis of workmanship is far from certain except within broad limits. Inasmuch as the tokens of a typical hacienda must have been in use over a considerable number of years, we can expect definiteness as to time of issue from the dated pieces only.</p>
            <p>With this in mind, let us look at the plates in some detail, beginning with the one (PLATE I) which bears the earliest dated pieces which we have been able to find. Before starting, however, one peculiarity of dating should be noted. One piece illustrated on this <ref target="#fig-8">plate (No. 381)</ref> is doubly unusual. First, both obverse and reverse bear inscriptions, although the reverse does not enable us to localize the token's place of origin. The obverse reads, in addition to the name of the issuing owner, "ANO 84." Comparison with other pieces will remove any necessity of laboring the point that this must be 1784 and that it cannot be 1884. We are enabled likewise to read the date which appears on the first token on <ref target="#fig-25">Plate III (A)</ref> as 1750. A contrast to this contraction of the date is to be found on <ref target="#fig-6">Plate I (B)</ref> where the date is given in Roman numerals—MDCCLXXIII. The monogram at the center has not been identified. The irregularity in the shape of the flan supports the traditional assignment of the shaped pieces as early.</p>
            <p>Turning to the first piece on <ref target="#fig-25">Plate III (A)</ref>), dated 1750, we find ourselves in possession of another very valuable piece of information for on the reverse of this piece we read "8 R." We also note that there are two smaller pieces bearing this same monogram (one without date), and that instead of that date, they bear on their obverses "4" <ref target="#fig-26">(B)</ref> and "2" <ref target="#fig-27">(C)</ref>, respectively, and that, in addition, they are graduated in size, making a series. These numerals cannot be fractions of the real as were the municipal tokens previously mentioned (page 10), for the "8 R" piece is much larger than that of "2 R." If the intention were to indicate a fractional one-eighth of a real, the most valuable piece would have been the half-real which should have been the larger. Not only do we have a parallel to Nos. 391-395 described by Romero de Terreros (Cf. Note to No. 391), but we have a date which goes far toward establishing the period in which the practice common to the two series was in use. In other words, we have a clear indication that these tokens had a valuation in reals, and this
<pb n="14"/>
permits the identification of similar numerals on other pieces, many of which are also identical in fabric. The PERES piece (No. 376) to which we have had occasion to refer because of its date "802," has a "4" above the name, and gives us indication that this valuation in reals continued to that date. We may even go further, for the piece shown <ref target="#fig-126">(PLATE XII, A)</ref> is one which has a format closely similar to the group on PLATE X and has the figure "8" counterstamped within the large "O" above the monogram. This confirms the evidence of the PERES token, for this piece, too, should be dated between 1800 and 1806, or not much before or after those years. Similarly, the inscription on the token LARA on <ref target="#fig-33">PLATE III (No. 218)</ref> becomes significant, for we can point to analogies which enable us to read the letter after the figure "4" as a lower-case "r" rather than "x" which it more nearly resembles. This, then, indicates four reals, and we have the probability that there were larger and smaller denominations for this hacienda. Likewise, the oval token with a trefoil with a "2" beneath it <ref target="#fig-30">(PLATE III, E)</ref> falls into this group. Of the other tokens, one with "2 Rs" (D) bears no other indication of its origin, while the last, with a cursive "r" (G) within a chain border has an "8" on its reverse, although smaller than any of the "2 R" tokens on this plate.</p>
            <p>The date following the earliest one we have found is 1767 <ref target="#fig-3">(PLATE I, A)</ref>. This is engraved or incised on the reverse, while the obverse bears four letters whose significance we are unable to recognize. Can the four pellets on the obverse be an indication that it was valued at four reals? In addition to the date, the reverse bears the name or syllable "Sol" as well as the letter "N" preceding the date. The tilde over the N dictates its reading as an abbreviation for "Anno," or "Año." The "Sol" is to be taken as an abbreviation for a name such as "Solis" <ref target="#fig-43">(PLATE IV, 431)</ref> or some other name whose first syllable is identical. Although this is not the best representative of the cast tokens (others are illustrated on PLATE II), there is a considerable number of tokens which show the same large and crude letters and which afford other evidence of their having been cast. Almost without exception, they are uniface.</p>
            <pb n="15"/>
            <p>The next coin on <ref target="#fig-4">PLATE I, (No. 133)</ref> bears the date 1770. Compared with the token we have just been considering, its workmanship is refined and finished. It, too, is representative of a fairly large class; it is surprising to find workmanship of this order at such an early date, as well as the use of punch dies. Pieces of this class frequently have small units of a decorative nature which are repeated to form a pattern or border, and examination discloses that some of their inscriptions are made by using individual letter punches (some of the repeated letters display identical flaws or other peculiarities which are unmistakable). No evidence has been observed of a graduated series or of two or more denominations in this class. The reverse inscription on <ref target="#fig-8">PLATE I, 381</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Para la Plaza</hi>) is probably indicative that it circulated in the market place of some city or town, as the catalogue notes.</p>
            <p>Filling out PLATE I are contrasting tokens dated 1791, the first with a monogram <ref target="#fig-9">(C)</ref>, the second with CATALANES and what looks like a cask <ref target="#fig-10">(No. 90)</ref>—both struck from dies. The piece with VAQUEDANO <ref target="#fig-11">(No. 467)</ref> bears a target-like center and the date 1796. The last <ref target="#fig-12">(D)</ref> dated 1799, has a monogram in an octagonal impression. All three are die-struck.</p>
            <p>With possible exceptions in the top row, PLATE II consists of tokens which have been cast, bearing monograms or single letters as the sole indication of their origin. The resistance to wear on the monogram is a consequence of the boldness of the lettering. If the first five pieces do not belong to the same hacienda, their close similarity demonstrates the difficulty of distinguishing them.</p>
            <p>It would be rash to venture a dating for these cast pieces. Their boldness or occasional crudity may be nothing more than a result of having been made in rural districts removed from the convenience of cities. Casting these tokens would be a simple process, once the technique had been mastered, whereas the preparation of a die such as is obvious on most of the pieces on PLATES III and IV is far more complicated an operation. One would think that the tokens for which dies were used (PLATES III and IV) were later than these cast pieces on PLATE II. If this be so, some of the cast tokens may be earlier than 1750, the date for the first piece on PLATE III. Nor may we lose sight of the tokens on PLATE V which
<pb n="16"/>
bear neither name nor monogram—merely the "type". Some of these may have used the punning principle common to other coinages, so that No. C may have indicated the same hacienda as did <ref target="#fig-165">No. 227 (PLATE XVI)</ref>. There seems to be no convention or rule which may be applied to the reading of the monograms, but this is a condition that might have been expected in marks for branding cattle, which is what some of these are believed to have been. Similar combinations or variations in the letters occur on the much later branding irons of the western ranches of our country.</p>
            <p>PLATE V is given to tokens bearing types but without the owners’ names—they are indicated on the plate by letters. No. A clearly depicts a hunter holding a jack-rabbit. It seems that the intention of obliterating the monogram on the reverse was unsuccessful. On the reverse of No. F there is a counterstamp which seems to consist of the letters “P” and “Q” with a tilde over them. The object on No. E is a formalized branding-iron. Why the mere date 1802 should have been used for No. H is something for which we should like to have an explanation. Romero de Terreros also illustrates No. D. He describes the design as two Indians dancing. There are two figures facing a medial axis, a plant with two long branches continuing in an arch over each of the figures and extending nearly to the base line. The die outline is notched while the flan is irregularly octagonal. The tiny piece (No. G) with an eagle on the nopal plant may not be a hacienda token.</p>
            <p>On PLATE VI seven tokens are grouped which bear some form of the word <hi rend="italic">puente</hi>, which means a bridge. We cannot tell whether these were used for tolls or whether they were issued by haciendas situated near bridges from which they took their names. Some bear rude representations of bridges. In the catalogue, these have been placed under the letter P. This procedure is followed also for the tokens put out under the designation of <hi rend="italic">Esquina</hi>—or <hi rend="italic">Esquila</hi>.</p>
            <p>On PLATES VII to IX, tokens with variously shaped flans are grouped; most of these are other than circular. The group, which is arranged alphabetically for convenience, is representative, but not exhaustive. Heart-shaped tokens seem the most favored (one on Plate V may be added to the seven here). Leaves and fruits are distinguishable, even a ram or goat (<hi rend="italic">Chiuato</hi>). The flans of most
<pb n="17"/>
of these, whether originally cast or punched out of sheets of metal, have in a second operation had a die applied to them. The lettering is usually bold rather than crude, and some ingenuity is shown in its spacing. A dated piece is helpful occasionally, such as the crescent-formed token <ref target="#fig-88">No. 300 (PLATE VIII)</ref> which reads 1804, while on PLATE I we have noted the date 1773 in Roman numerals. Two pieces at the bottom of PLATE VII have incised letters <ref target="#fig-77">(Nos. 117</ref> and <ref target="#fig-79">120</ref>). Some of the dies have scalloped edges, while the flans at the top of PLATE VII have pie-crust rims which must have been acquired by casting. One exception to the statement that these oddshaped tokens are usually uniface is to be found in <ref target="#fig-99">No. 413 (PLATE IX)</ref>, where the design admirably fits its oval and both obverse and reverse dies are well executed. The reverse of <ref target="#fig-69">No. 53 (PLATE VII)</ref> bears an incised letter T. <ref target="#fig-73">No. 63 (PLATE VII)</ref> may be a bridge token, or perhaps the structure is intended to represent a church. The given name of an individual occasionally accompanies the more usual family name, and this will be found true on succeeding plates. Odd shapes were selected for these tokens because of their distinctiveness; they accomplished their purpose.</p>
            <p>The tokens on PLATE X to XII form a fairly homogeneous group. With one or two exceptions, they are similar in size, style and fabric, although as to fabric there is a light and heavy form. The dated pieces range between 1801 and 1806. Many are uniface. The thin-flanned ones are marked by a daintiness of lettering and design, while the heavier pieces have a boldness quite in keeping with their greater thickness. On the thinner-flanned tokens, branches with flowers or berries vie with animal figures (<ref target="#fig-114">PLATE XI, 198</ref> and <ref target="#fig-116">275</ref>). On the Olbera issue (<ref target="#fig-113">PLATE X, 286</ref>) we note a pennon or spear used with a cannon. On the Molina piece (<ref target="#fig-107">PLATE X, 264</ref>) there is a monogram as well as this name and the date 1801.</p>
            <p>On PLATES XI and XII we find a contrast. The Aguilar token (<ref target="#fig-119">PLATE XI, 10</ref>) is broad, thick and heavy, and the lettering is bold. This piece and several others have inscriptions on both sides. The given name is on the obverse and the family name on the reverse in more than one instance, with the name of the place of issue added on two coins, <name type="place">Queretaro</name> (No. 362) and Celaya (No. 470). The Butron token <ref target="#fig-121">(No. 71)</ref> on PLATE XI seems to have had
<pb n="18"/>
this name applied to some other token of the fabric we have been considering. Unfortunately, the earlier design is not distinguishable. Monogrammed pieces of both forms are placed at the bottom of PLATE XII. Note that the Munos <ref target="#fig-116">(No. 275)</ref> and Munoz <ref target="#fig-118">(No. 277)</ref> pieces on PLATE XI seem to have nothing in common.</p>
            <p>PLATES XIII and XIV may be considered together. They offer further contrasts to PLATES X to XII. Most have smaller flans which bear dates with a slightly more extended range, 1800–1814. With the exception of Nos. 103 and A, they are uniformly die-struck and many have borders of repeated units, some of which are very effective as well as ingenious. The majority are uniface; some are counterstamped with dates or numerals, the latter a possible indication of value. The Cocula token (No. 103) is dated 1808 and bears two counterstamps, one of which is a crown. The second is applied symmetrically and adds the name Vandino which can hardly be a Spanish name.</p>
            <p>The three plates (XV-XVII) devoted to the tokens bearing names in full (or nearly so), like those devoted to the irregularshaped pieces, offer some significant phenomena. They are arranged alphabetically, despite the necessary deviations in the interest of plate symmetry. It will be noted that there are a few pieces not circular in shape. Attention might be called to similarities in treatment, as, for example:</p>
            <p>a. CAREDES, CVRIL and LOZO (<ref target="#fig-155">PLATE XV, 79</ref>, <ref target="#fig-157">129</ref> and <ref target="#fig-163">241</ref>) share with DE PRIETO (<ref target="#fig-175">PLATE XVI, 344</ref>), a technique which seems to indicate that either the token or the die with which it was struck had been cast.</p>

            <p>On No. 451 (PLATE XVII), there is a very interesting transliteration. On the token we read CAVEZERA. Dr. <name type="pname">A. F. Pradeau</name> kindly informs by letter that this is a substitute for <hi rend="italic">cabecera</hi>, a word meaning “county seat”; and that <name type="place">TLAJOMULCO</name> (Cf. <ref target="#fig-187">PLATE XVII, 451</ref>), with about four thousand inhabitants, is a station in the State of <name type="place">Jalisco</name> on the railroad between <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name> and <name type="place">Guadalajara</name>.</p>
            <p>PLATE XVIII is intended to demonstrate similarity of names or monograms. <name type="pname">Señor Romero de Terreros</name> illustrates and identifies a piece with a large and crude “G” and a small “a” as GARCIA. Here (Nos. 177 and 178) we have two roughly circular pieces with a toothed-die impress and the inscription GAR/SIA. Between them is a diamond-shaped token (No. 179), with smaller and
<pb n="20"/>
better formed letters reading GARSIA/TAGLE. In the bottom row of this Plate we have (No. 232) a piece reading <name type="place">R. DEL. CHICO</name>. ANO. D. 1808, and within the circle at the center, the name <name type="pname">LOPEZ</name> with ornaments above and below. The token (No. G) shows a monogram which can hardly be read other than as <name type="pname">LOPEZ</name>, and the preceding piece (No. F) with its neighbor to guide one, should be probably read similarly. On the same line, we have an octagonal token with the name ERA/RA. Counterstamped beneath, in smaller letters, is the name <name type="pname">LOPEZ</name>. As this is unquestionably a common name in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3996063">Mexico</name>, there may or may not have been a connection between these four pieces.</p>
            <p>The monogrammed tokens on the second line on this plate will bear study because of their similarities. No. 324 which has a heartshaped die-imprint is apparently unrelated to any of the heart-shaped tokens on PLATE IX.</p>
            <p>PLATES XXI and XXII provide an amplification of what appears on PLATE XX (cf. pp. 10 to 12). Most of these are octavos; <ref target="#fig-240">Nos. 136 (PLATE XXII)</ref> and <ref target="#fig-236">412 (PLATE XXI)</ref> are quartillos. Many are without indication of value. <ref target="#fig-232">No. 364 (PLATE XXI)</ref> is counterstamped. Some are without dates; those bearing dates vary from 1813 (<ref target="#fig-229">PLATE XXI, 14</ref> and <ref target="#fig-231">489</ref>) to 1853 (<ref target="#fig-241">PLATE XXII, 452</ref>). The workmanship on both coins and dies varies widely—well-preserved specimens are uncommon. Several other designs are ambitious beyond the power of the die-cutter, for example, No. 309. Apparently, these are all issues of Municipalities with little or no direct connection with the Hacienda token. They are illustrated, herein, to make this distinction clear.</p>

            <p>Money of the American Confederation Period was the subject of the eleventh Coinage of the Americas Conference, sponsored annually by the American Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing Council as a forum for the dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of <name type="place">North and South America</name>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all who have an interest in the topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants travelling to the <name type="place">New York</name> area to come to know the Society's collections and library better during the days surrounding the conference.</p>
            <p>A number of special exhibits were mounted on the theme of COAC 1995 and remained on view at the Society for several months. Two exhibits featured material from the Society's collection: a survey of <name type="place">U.S.</name> made counterfeit halfpence and a special display of medals of the Confederation period. Individual exhibitors included <name type="pname">Daniel Freidus</name> (<name type="place">Vermonts</name>) and <name type="pname">Mike Ringo</name> (counterfeits of the period); on display also were important items from the Donald Groves Collection.</p>

            </head>
            <p>It is with great pleasure that I introduce the papers delivered at the 1995 Coinage of the Americas Conference. This was the eleventh such annual event, first gathered in 1984, for the expressed purpose of presenting an in-depth focus on a specific topic in American numismatics. The 1995 program, "Coinage of the American Confederation Period," embraces a brief but extremely active numismatic era in American history. We are not just concerned with coins as a metallic medium of exchange, but rather we visualize numismatics as an eclectic science which draws upon history, politics, economics, art, biography, linguistics, metallurgy, physics and chemistry. Without doubt, the papers in these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> reflect this broader definition of numismatics as we explore the diverse coinages current in the Confederation period.</p>
            <p>The Confederation period was a time of change and challenge as the young, recently freed country, strove to establish its own national identity. The new nation had no currency of its own and of necessity continued to rely on the same foreign coins which had freely circulated here since the earliest colonial times. As a consequence of the economic stagnation which followed the Revolution, the country was crippled by a major post-war depression when all gold and silver virtually disappeared from commerce. In distinct contrast, the small change medium remained abundantly stocked with token coppers, especially counterfeit English halfpence which had been in circulation for years. As a reaction against these many spurious light weight coins, several states minted their own good quality, token coppers during the Confederation period with the expectation that popular rejection of the light weight, inferior
<pb n="x"/>
issues would drive them from circulation. For this reason, the many state copper which enrich the numismatics of this period came into being.</p>
            <p>These <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> are a collection of papers which describe several aspects of the profuse coinage minted in the period after the Revolution and prior to the establishment of the Federal <name type="place">mint</name>; to 1993, some 693 different die varieties of domestic coppers have been identified with the list ever expanding as new discoveries are made.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> The immense variety and sheer numbers of Confederation coppers have stimulated much attention and research, and rightly so. Investigators have been hampered and frustrated in their efforts since there are no surviving artifacts used in the manufacture of these coins. Thus, all our information must be extrapolated from the examination of the existing coins themselves and from literary evidence published in contemporary newspaper accounts and other documents. But this lack of immediately available data should not deter us from the continued pursuit of information about this numismatic era. Many years ago, <name type="pname">Damon G. Douglas</name>, well known for his research into the Fugio cents, stated it very succinctly. "The copper coinages of that critical period in American history, the first decade after the Revolution, still present unexhausted fields for fruitful research."<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, there are many challenges before us for continued numismatic research but we must remain humble in the fact that we do not have all the answers about these intriguing coinages. I believe it is safe to say that there is more that we don't know than we do know. As a result, investigators must possess the wisdom to separate appealing speculation and unsubstantiated numismatic tradition from confirmed fact. In regard to Confederation coppers, except for a few notable exceptions, we know painfully little about the mints, the mintmasters, their business associates and practices, and just how the money entered circulation. I expect that new genealogical discoveries and documentary evidence will disclose important clues as to the lives and activities of some of the individuals whose roles in these Confederation coinages have remained enigmatic. There are still untapped literary sources yet to be discovered, as exemplified in these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> by <name type="pname">Eric Newman's</name> identity of the party responsible for the Nova Constellatio tokens. <name type="place">Mint</name> attributions for many of these coppers are still unsettled; in the past, many mints were assigned based solely on the basis of deductive reasoning, some of whose logic has collapsed under closer scrutiny. Newer technology such as computer image enhancement, improved photography, and high energy,
<pb n="xi"/>
non-destructive, planchet analysis may assume a leading role in deciphering some of these mysteries.</p>
            <p>Numismatists in general are just beginning to appreciate the counterfeit English halfpence as the most prevalent copper of the period. This new awareness has unfortunately spawned a temptation to view any crude counterfeit English halfpenny as an American product based on no firmer evidence than a rough appearance. While there is literary evidence to support American "blacksmith" type counterfeits,<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> we cannot identify them as to type and it remains inaccurate to assign every barbarous counterfeit halfpence to this side of the Atlantic. Contemporary newspaper accounts<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> reveal that local entrepreneurs did cast counterfeit halfpence which, by their nature, leave no telltale evidence as to site of origin. Thus, many cast counterfeit halfpence found in this country today may well be of domestic origin, a fact we can neither prove nor disprove. Except for the proven <name type="pname">Machin's</name> Mills imitations, it becomes problematic to designate other struck counterfeit halfpence as American when one considers the sophisticated and complicated infrastructure required to mint coppers. The sheer magnitude of such an operation to smelt ore, to prepare, roll, and anneal planchets, to engrave dies, and to strike coins, would have been a major business venture available to but a few in pre-industrial <name type="place">America</name>. But these considerations should not deter one from continued inquiry into the counterfeit English halfpence, both domestic and imported. In fact, two important papers in these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> deal with these fascinating, but humble, coppers, coins whose importance is just now earning recognition as important players in early American numismatics.</p>
            <p>Another interesting American series, generally of English origin but contemporary to the Confederation period, includes the Washington pieces. While these tokens enjoyed no official status, it was obvious that many circulated. We are pleased to have a complete catalogue of Washingtonia by <name type="pname">George Fuld</name> included in these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi>.</p>
            <p>To this point the emphasis has been placed on the money circulating between the end of the Revolution and the advent of the Federal <name type="place">mint</name>. Whereas the coins in our cabinets today are the survivors of the economy of those times, we have another body of contemporary history documented by the medals struck to commemorate significant events of the period. As <name type="pname">Frederic H. Betts</name> wrote in the introduction to his brother's posthumously published book, "One is to look upon a cabinet of Medals 'as a treasure, not of money, but of knowledge'... ."<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> With the sensitivity that the
<pb n="xii"/>
holistic approach to the study of numismatics includes an appreciation of all the events and factors that shaped the history of the era under study, <name type="pname">Alan M. Stahl</name> has provided us an inventory of the <hi rend="italic">Comitia Americana</hi> medals authorized by Congress to honor the heroes of pre-Federal <name type="place">America</name>.</p>
            <p>I wish to thank all the participants in this year's Coinage of the Americas Conference for their contributions of time, effort, and knowledge. The editorial assistance I received in preparation of these <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> from <name type="pname">James C. Spilman</name> and <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name> is gratefully acknowledged. Finally, we all express our gratitude to the staff of the American Numismatic Society for making this symposium possible as a medium through which we can share our interest in this fascinating and engaging period of American history with numismatists everywhere.</p>

               <p>The American Confederation, extending from 1781 until 1789, can be considered the period of our national adolescence. These seven years spanned the time frame between our emergence as a nation from the cocoon of infant colonialism until our start on the road to maturity as a Federal Republic. It was a "betweentimes" when our country went through all the growing pains expected from a post-pubescent, gangly teenager, such as the evolution of character and self-reliance, the development of trusting relationships with peers, and the assumption of adult responsibility. It is the monetary history of this fascinating epoch which is the focus of this year's Coinage of the Americas Conference.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>One cannot speak of the Confederation period as an isolated historical event but rather one must consider the prior experience of colonialism which shaped our nation's adolescent personality. From 1607, with the first permanent settlement in <name type="place">Jamestown</name>, until 1749, with the settlement by the English military of the garrison at <name type="place">Halifax</name>, 14 British colonies were founded on the <name type="place">North American mainland</name>. These colonies were very different in composition and character from one another with distinct economic, geographic and climatic diversity. In the North, the economy was dominated by forest products, fishing and small farms, whereas in the South, large plantations worked by slaves were scattered over the countryside. The population was generally concentrated in cities along the eastern seaboard. Beyond these coastal communities, occasional towns and villages of a few dozen houses punctuated the largely forested and rural landscape. Travel, communication, and commerce between the colonies, except by sea, was very difficult and tedious. Roads were poor or nonexistent; even in the best of conditions the <name type="place">New York</name> to <name type="place">Boston</name> stagecoach could make only 40 miles a day traveling from three in the morning to ten at night.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> Rarely did people stray more than 20 miles from their birthplace. The population was largely of English extraction, generally illiterate, and lived on farms at a subsistence level of economy.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref>
                  <name type="place">British North America</name> was not a single country but rather a collection of "several distinct regional economies, most of them tied more closely to Great Britain than to each other... ." These "regional differences among the colonies were so sharp and ties between them so weak that it is misleading to speak of an 'American economy' or an 'American population' early in the colonial period."<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="3"/>
               <p>Moreover the governments were dissimilar; only <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Rhode Island</name> were true republics where all public officials were elected by the people. In three others—<name type="place">Pennsylvania, Delaware</name> and <name type="place">Maryland</name>—the lords proprietary selected the governors; and in the remaining nine (including <name type="place">Nova Scotia</name>), the governor was appointed by the monarch. The varied political structure of the colonies notwithstanding, <name type="place">England</name> looked on these North American plantations in the same way. The natural resources and economic development of every colony were to be regulated from <name type="place">London</name> and any potential profits were to be directed toward increasing the wealth and power of the mother country under a system called <hi rend="italic">mercantilism.</hi> To this end, a series of restrictive laws was passed by Parliament, collectively known as the Acts of Trade and Navigation, which were designed to ensure that the colonial economies remained subservient to that of the mother country and that English interests were protected. However onerous these controls might appear at first glance, the colonies also benefited from membership in the British Empire with a large free-trading area, naval protection, easy credit, and restricted foreign competition. The negative aspects of mercantilism included suppressed colonial manufacturing, restricted foreign markets, and the export of earned specie to pay for manufactured necessities and luxuries.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>From 1689 to 1763, the colonies became entangled in the North American extension of a series of European conflicts as continental governments continued a ceaseless drive for power. <name type="place">England's</name> war machinery was fueled to a large part by raw materials from <name type="place">North America</name>, consistent with its mercantilist policies. In addition, Parliament expected that the colonies would bear some of the financial burden of the so-called French and Indian Wars.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Until 1763, the Navigation Acts had little practical impact on the colonies since they were largely ignored or effectively circumvented by experienced smugglers. In spite of these restrictive laws on the books, the local economies expanded and prospered. But, with the peace following the final French and Indian War, the scene changed. <name type="place">England</name>, in 1763, had now emerged as the most powerful nation in <name type="place">Europe</name>, but with a massive war debt. To bolster its economy and recoup its strength, <name type="place">England</name> now turned its attention across the <name type="place">Atlantic</name> with renewed vigor and began to enforce the old Acts of Trade and Navigation in an attempt to squeeze from their plantations all their natural wealth. <name type="pname">George III</name> and his Tory government looked on the colonies not as political communities but simply as chartered companies and crown possessions where any freedoms or popular assembly existed only at the king's pleasure. For the first
<pb n="4"/>
time, <name type="place">England</name> stationed a permanent standing army in the colonies which was three times larger than that deployed on the battle front during wartime. It was evident that the presence of such troops was intended "to control rather than to protect."<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Parliament passed even more unpopular laws which were designed to benefit English rather than colonial interests. As if this increased control was not bad enough, the colonial economies were crippled by an oppressive post-war depression when foreign trade and revenue from exports virtually ceased. The use of paper money in the colonies, which since 1690 had been helpful in financing local initiatives, was severely regulated in 1751 and again in 1764 by laws specifically engineered to ensure that English merchants be paid in hard currency rather than unstable paper. Parliament, still operating under the tenants of mercantilism, was always ready to manipulate the colonies for <name type="place">England's</name> benefit but rarely inclined to assist their overseas dominions for their sake alone. Now sugar, tea and other imports were heavily taxed as an additional revenue measure. If it had been enforceable, the Stamp Act would have severely encumbered all local enterprises. Common law rights to trial by peers in the colonies were abrogated. Taxation without representation became the rallying cry as the Stamp Act Congress asserted that the colonists had the same native rights as all free Englishmen. The maturing colonies had outgrown their dependence on <name type="place">England</name> and resented this increased control over their lives which <name type="place">London</name> was now exerting in the postwar period after 1763. Unfortunately the British government "lacked the wisdom and the political genius" to recognize the liberties of its overseas citizens as defined and protected under the English Constitution and blindly perceived no need to reconfigure their imperial organization to accommodate these natural freedoms. The colonies did have some vocal support in Parliament, notably from <name type="pname">William Pitt</name> and <name type="pname">Edmund Burke</name>. <name type="pname">Pitt's</name> advocacy was duly acknowledged by a medallet struck in his honor. While <name type="pname">George III</name> interpreted the rebellious actions of the colonists as "insufferable disobedience" "requiring disciplining," <name type="pname">Pitt</name>, in his wisdom, recognized that if violence ever erupted, any peaceful resolution or reconciliation would be difficult. His conciliatory efforts were constantly thwarted by a king dominated Tory Parliament. Push came to shove on April 19, 1775, at the Battles of <name type="place">Lexington</name> and <name type="place">Concord</name> when the British attempted to seize colonial munitions. A skirmish escalated into a full fledged war just as Pitt had predicted. By the summer of 1776, there was no vestige of royal authority in any of the colonies which had become openly hostile toward all forms of centralized power. Their basic conflict was not
<pb n="5"/>
primarily to gain political and economic independence from <name type="place">England</name> but rather the colonists wished to retain those historical freedoms of free Englishmen which they had enjoyed from the beginning and now were threatened by an insensitive and autocratic monarchy and Tory Parliament.<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> While many colonial Tories remained loyal and hoped for a reconciliation, other factions pressed for complete autonomy.<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>This is an incomplete thumbnail sketch of the economic and political scene in <name type="place">North America</name> at the outbreak of the Revolution, a conflict whose causes were multifactoral and cannot be explain ed by any single circumstance. All of a sudden a unique situation was at hand in <name type="place">North America</name>. For the first time, 13 diverse, suspicious, self-sufficient colonies were forced into a position where they had to cooperate with one another to repel a tyranny which would have destroyed them individually. It was an easy task to burn the midnight oil and draft a Declaration of Independence which asserted their autonomy from an oppressive metropolitan regime. But after this proclamation which severed the bonds of colonialism was signed, sealed and delivered, these 13 colonies, who had had minimal prior interaction, still viewed each other with such mistrust they could come to no immediate consensus as to how they would govern themselves. It took until March 1781 for them to agree upon a form of self-rule which was set forth in the Articles of Confederation. And even after this polity was drafted, it was not ratified until just seven months before Cornwallis surrendered.</p>
               <p>The Articles of Confederation were conceived as an instrument to bind the states in a firm league of friendship, but it did not establish a single nation. The collective states under the Articles of Confederation were unwilling to abdicate to a central government any more authority than they were willing to accept from their colonial masters. The financial, foreign policy and war powers set forth in the Articles of Confederation were jealously guarded by the states since nine votes out of thirteen were required for passage of most measures. While the individual states did retain the sole authority to levy taxes, they did agree to share with Congress the parallel authority to establish a mint and emit paper money. To finance the war effort, the states were unwilling to assert their prerogative and levy taxes, but instead pursued an alternative solution with a printing press and issued reams of unsecured paper money. Congress, without any taxing authority, had no alternative but to circulate bills of credit very early in the war to meet government expenses.</p>
               <p>The monetary principles expressed in the Articles of Confederation reflected the paranoia which had been conditioned from years
<pb n="6"/>
of English control over colonial fiscal policy. Throughout the colonial experience, hard money supplies fluctuated depending upon the strength of the individual colonial economies. Even at best, small denominational silver was always in demand for local trade. During periods of war, when the export of raw materials and supplies was brisk, earned specie became more plentiful as the economy prospered. These times of plenty were followed by cycles of postwar recession as the export market contracted and hard money became in short supply as trade languished. During such intervals of economic slowdown, when circulating hard money was scant, alternative solutions were devised to ensure adequate currency so that local commerce could continue. Such successful measures included the use of wampum in the 1600s, the development of regulated commodity monies, the minting of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> silver, and more commonly, the emission of paper currency by colonial governments either as unsecured bills of credit, as fiscal instruments backed by the value of land, or notes emitted against anticipated tax receipts.</p>
               <p>During the Revolution, hard money was particularly scarce, driven out of circulation by an excess supply of depreciated, unsecured paper money. Directly following the war, there was a sudden abundance of specie from those areas occupied by foreign troops who had been paid in hard money. This surplus was short-lived since the country went on a buying-spree and soon the specie was returned to <name type="place">Europe</name> to pay for many imported commodities and luxuries which had been in short supply during the war. As would be anticipated from prior experience, in 1784 a devastating postwar depression followed the Revolution with effects which were nearly as crippling to the country as those witnessed in 1929.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Exports faltered, credit was expensive, merchants were burdened with a glut of unsaleable imported goods, hard money was just not available, and many experienced financial ruin. Barter, as a medium of exchange, was revived in several areas; bankruptcies were commonplace. In <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, returning war veterans, unpaid for their years of military service, were now obliged to meet their tax bills in non-existent hard currency or face financial ruin with threats of foreclosure and debtors prison. An armed encounter between these disgruntled farmers in western <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and the militia ensued in the notorious Shays's Rebellion. To the north, the state of <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> itself was bankrupt and in other legislatures there was agitation for cheap paper money to release citizens from the burden of personal debt.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Some historians have characterized the postwar Confederation with such labels as "the critical period"<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> of American history or
<pb n="7"/>
"the period of peril"<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> since they speculated that the new nation was on the brink of anarchy and dissolution. Another commented that Shays's Rebellion frightened <name type="pname">George</name>
                  <name type="place">Washington</name> out of retirement into politics.<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> At any rate, the times were difficult. It did not take long to realize that this new government established under the Articles of Confederation was completely inept to lead the emerging nation and the need to mend its multiple defects soon became evident. This would have been an impossible task since a major flaw in the structure of this code required that any amendment must receive the unanimous approval of all the states. Instead, the entire document was discarded in favor of the Constitution of 1787. This new Federal government has stood the test of time, enduring now for more than 200 years. But this final union did not occur until the young nation resolved its serious problems of adolescent bickering and mutual mistrust. With these internal conflicts dispelled, the 13 colonial infants could now emerge "from many into one" and with this new spirit they launched themselves into young adulthood where united they faced the new and different challenges of the next century.</p>

               <p>During the Revolution, the states and Continental Congress had resorted to bills of credit to finance the war but these notes rapidly became valueless. Now in the postwar period, most legislatures witnessed an agitation to resume printing bills of credit so at least there would be some form of currency for local commerce and the alleviation of private debt. Many states, having learned their lessons from unsecured paper money during the war, resisted this temptation to solve their fiscal ills by notes unbacked by specie. Some of the more successful paper that held its value did continue to circulate.</p>
               <p>As in the prior colonial period, dependency continued on Spanish and French gold and silver, Dutch silver and Portuguese gold. Since there had been a chronic coin shortage in <name type="place">England</name> for many years, the export of specie coins, even to its own overseas plantations, had always been forbidden.</p>

               <p>Nonetheless, this restriction was successfully circumvented and English gold and silver did make its way to this side of the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>. The values of these diverse foreign currencies, in terms of local monies of account, were commonly published in tables to assist the public in commercial transactions. <ref target="#fig-1">Fig. 1</ref>, printed in 1784 and representative of such broadsides, is of particular interest since it also enumerates the value of English far things and halfpence in relation to <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> copper.<ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> Even into the early Federal period, after the decimal system had been officially adopted, the states still continued to calculate the value of their coins in the old colonial monies of account system denominated in pounds, shillings, and pence. Typical of such conversion tables is <ref target="#fig-2">fig. 2</ref>, published in 1793 by <name type="pname">Samuel Sauer</name> (Somer) of Germantown, <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, which reckoned the value of common specie coins of the day in the several colonial monies of account as well as in terms of the new Federal denominations.<ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> Although the 1793 table is dated after the Confederation Period, it was selected to demonstrate the concurrent use of the new Federal and old colonial notations, a practice which continued well into the next century. The cyclical shortage of hard money previously described, while definitely troublesome, did not necessarily suspend commerce since many large transactions, both local and overseas, could be satisfactorily transacted using bills of exchange.<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref>

               <p>The Spanish American milled dollar, first minted in <name type="place">Mexico City</name> in 1535, was the most important silver coin on this continent from the first settlements until the middle of the last century. Over its 351 year history, the eight reales piece remained the world's silver standard due to its uniformity. Its fractional pieces, including the bits, levies, and picayunes, formed the backbone of our silver small change medium. Although never recognized with legal tender status due to its lower silver content, the pistareen, a debased two reales coin from mainland <name type="place">Spain</name>, was another very important player in our colonial and Confederation periods (<ref target="#fig-3">fig. 3</ref>). Spanish, Portuguese, English and French gold commonly traded as high denominational
<pb n="12"/>
specie coins for the first 250 years of our history (<ref target="#fig-4">fig. 4</ref>). Since the early Federal Mint could not keep up with the demands of the coinage requirement for the <name type="place">United States</name>, these foreign gold and silver specie coins continued as legal tender in this country until demonetized by the Act of February 21, 1857.<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref>

               <p>During the Confederation, the copper small change medium was plentiful in direct contrast to the hard coin money which was in short supply during the devastating post-Revolutionary War depression. Whereas the circulating gold and silver money was from the countries described above, the copper money was regal English since there was no prohibition against the export of Tower halfpence and farthings. In fact, from 1695 to 1775, about 17% of the copper output from the <name type="place">Tower Mint</name> was exported to the North American colonies, amounting to some £69,000. In 1749 alone, 10 tons of cop-
<pb n="13"/>
pers, about a quarter of the year's production of farthings and halfpence, were included in a large sum of money sent to <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> by Parliament as partial repayment of the debt incurred during the French and Indian Wars. The only legitimate copper of the Revolutionary period was the <name type="place">Virginia</name> halfpenny minted for the colony in <name type="place">England</name>. These coppers were delivered just weeks before the War broke out and so were withheld from general circulation until hostilities ceased (<ref target="#fig-5">fig. 5</ref>).</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Since the currency value of regal English coppers was about double the intrinsic value of the metal plus the minting costs, significant profits were available not only to the king but also to the counterfeiters who surfaced in great numbers to make their fortunes. These clandestine forgers had little to fear from the authorities since the punishment, if apprehended, amounted to a virtual slap on the wrist. At first bogus coppers were sand cast but soon these illegal operations began striking counterfeits in presses from engraved dies. By 1753 in <name type="place">England</name>, it was estimated that about half the circulating copper was counterfeit. The large numbers of regal English coppers,
<pb n="14"/>
sent legally to the colonies, were quickly followed by the spurious ones. Soon commerce was flooded with these light weight, counterfeit issues which were accepted by a generally uncritical public whose only concern was that they receive full value in commerce for their token coppers. The importation of these coppers, interrupted by the Revolution, resumed again after the War and figured even more prominently during the Confederation (figs. <ref target="#fig-6">6</ref>, <ref target="#fig-7">7</ref>).</p>

               <p>Since the counterfeit copper industry in <name type="place">England</name> was so profitable, as evidenced by the vast numbers which circulated on both sides of the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>, it was only natural for this illegal activity to spread into British <name type="place">North America</name>. Original research on counterfeit <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence was presented in the symposium by <name type="pname">Charles W. Smith</name>. Many counterfeit English halfpence of domestic manufacture have been identified, the largest source believed to have been <name type="pname">Machin's</name> Mills in <name type="place">Newburgh, New York</name> (<ref target="#fig-8">fig. 8</ref>). Similarly, Irish halfpence and farthings were extensively counterfeited. Both the false and regal issues were exported to <name type="place">America</name> in large numbers as substantiated by a 1787 report from <name type="place">New York</name>. In fact, 1781 and 1782 bogus Irish
<pb n="15"/>
halfpence were commonly used as planchets for several <name type="place">Vermont</name> state issues (<ref target="#fig-9">fig. 9</ref>). The exportation of these counterfeit halfpence from <name type="place">Ireland</name> and <name type="place">England</name> into British <name type="place">North America</name> is examined in detail by <name type="pname">John M.

               <p>In 1786, one estimate asserted that nearly half the coppers in circulation for the previous 20 to 30 years were counterfeit. The new Articles of Confederation empowered both the state and national governments to coin money and, under this authority, <name type="place">Connecticut</name> in 1785, <name type="place">New Jersey</name> in 1786, and <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> in 1787 commenced to mint their own copper coinages with the expressed goal of ridding commerce of the vile, base coppers, which were perceived as inflicting financial injury, especially upon the poor. The plan was to mint state authorized coppers of consistent quality with the expectation that the citizens would only accept these new, true weight coppers while rejecting the counterfeit halfpence which comprised the bulk of the money.</p>
               <p>Although not a member of the Confederation, <name type="place">Vermont</name> also adopted the same practice in 1785 and issued its own coppers. The early history of this republic and the background of its mint are the subject of a paper by <name type="pname">Pete Smith</name>. The attractive landscape coppers, whose reverse motif is similar to the Nova Constellatio issues, were products of the Rupert <name type="place">mint</name> in 1785 and 1786. Later bust issues are thought to have been inspired or directly copied from <name type="place">Connecticut</name> designs. Certain bust right issues were struck over unnegotiable 1785 Nova Constellatio coppers and counterfeit Irish halfpence.</p>
               <p>In 1786 the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> Assembly strove to improve the quality of the small change medium by authorizing three million legal tender
<pb n="16"/>
coppers of 150 grains each, for which privilege the licensees would return a 10% royalty to the state. The official contract was shared by two mints but several clandestine operations have also been identified making a total of 139 <name type="place">New Jersey</name> die varieties with a total combined coinage of about four million pieces. The earlier issues from <name type="place">Rahway</name> and <name type="place">Morristown</name> were typically of high quality but soon there appeared lighter weight coppers which discredited the integrity of the full weight coinage (<ref target="#fig-10">fig. 10</ref>). These inferior coppers included the 1788-dated issues attributed to <name type="place">Morristown</name> and others, overstruck on light weight host coins, believed to be from <name type="place">Elizabethtown</name>. Recent work by Hodder has added much to our understanding of this complex series.<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref>

               <p>There are 355 die varieties of <name type="place">Connecticut state</name> coppers included within 26 distinct bust types dated from 1785 to 1788 with an estimated total production of about seven million. The only authorized mint was the Company for Coining Coppers of <name type="place">New Haven</name> which struck coppers from dies engraved by <name type="pname">Abel Buell</name>. Their franchise may have passed legally to James Jarvis and Co. on June 1, 1787, who continued to <name type="place">mint Connecticut</name> coppers on stock designated for the Federal Fugio contract. Besides these two mints, at least five or six prolific clandestine operations existed which increased their profit margin by ignoring the 5% royalty payable to the state and by minting coppers considerably below the prescribed

144 grains (<ref target="#fig-11">fig. 11</ref>). The end result was that the abundant light weight counterfeit <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers just added to the glut of inferior coppers already in circulation rather than to replace them with a proper coinage. Thus the attempt to rid commerce of light weight coppers only resulted in more inferior coins being added to the copper medium which already was far larger than the economy required. <name type="pname">James A. Goudge</name> presented a discussion of certain die varieties within this very popular Confederation series.</p>

               <p>Whereas the three previous states awarded franchises to private individuals, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> constructed a state-run mint which produced excellent coppers of consistent quality in 1787 and 1788.

               <p>In addition to the coppers actually minted by the several states already mentioned, many pattern issues were also struck during the Confederation by competing contractors in anticipation that a coveted franchise would be awarded to the winner. Other issues during this period include the familiar Immunis Columbia pieces and the several <name type="place">New York</name> coppers.<ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> Other speculative coinages were

               <p>Numismatists have long observed the appearance of similar letter punches within the various state series, particularly noting those with obvious flaws or breaks. It has been intriguing to speculate that such broken punches, when identified, belonged to an individual die sinker. Thus, the temptation has evolved to treat these observed defects like the signature of the engraver and the attempt made to assign a particular artist or <name type="place">mint</name> of origin to many of the state issues described above. This approach has not withstood the test of time and its deficiencies are reviewed in detail by <name type="pname">John Lorenzo</name> in regard to <name type="pname">James Atlee</name> and the broken "A" letter punch.</p>
               <p>Soon after the peace treaty, a large number of copper tokens arrived in this country from <name type="place">England</name> which circulated widely. These Nova Constellatio coppers were lighter than the state issues yet to come and were frequently used as host coins on which to overstrike <name type="place">Vermont, Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers. <name type="pname">Eric P. Newman</name> has newly discovered facts concerning these important coppers. Another large series of tokens dated from 1783 to 1795, primarily of English origin and collectively termed the <name type="place">Washington</name> coppers, appeared immediately after the Revolution. <name type="pname">George Fuld</name> has prepared an extensive study of the Washingtonia minted during the Confederation period.</p>
               <p>We have seen how the state mints failed to drive the light weight counterfeit coppers out of circulation and in most cases just contributed to the plethora of inferior coins. So, as one might expect, when the Federal government tried its hand at the same game, it also failed miserably. The Fugio coppers, the first United Stated authorized coin, were minted under a contract awarded to <name type="pname">James Jarvis</name>, the minter of most of the 1787 <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series (<ref target="#fig-13">fig. 13</ref>). Only a small percentage of the authorized amount was ever minted and these were released in the summer of 1789 in <name type="place">New York</name> at a
<pb n="19"/>
time known as the Coppers Panic when coppers ceased to circulate, an episode in the numismatic history of the Confederation worth noting.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-13">

               <p>In 1789, the nation still remained in the clutches of a serious postwar depression. Although earned money from exports was scarce and there was a dearth of circulating specie, the small change medium was still flooded with inferior grade coppers. Merchants were overwhelmed with large quantities of this mostly counterfeit, token coinage, which were only negotiable in small sums. It had no legal tender status, it could not be exchanged for gold or silver; in short, no one wanted it. In the summer of 1789, public confidence in this token copper medium collapsed and overnight the exchange rate plummeted from 20 to 48 coppers to the <name type="place">New York</name> shilling. It was an economic calamity for the poor whose entire wealth was invested in this unstable medium. Copper coins were not even valued as scrap metal because the world price for copper had fallen to an all time low. This coppers panic primarily involved the area within the economic orbit of <name type="place">New York</name> and <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers were received preferentially because of their legal tender status and soon traded again at 24 to the shilling. As the world price for copper dramatically rose into the next decade, faith in copper coins returned and the once discredited issues were called back into circulation while new ones were minted by the Federal government.</p>
               <p>In the meanwhile, the New Constitution of 1787 had been ratified since it was recognized that a more stable federal system would be necessary if this new republic were to survive as a single country rather than as a collection of 13 bickering siblings. A priority on the national agenda was to respond to the need for a standardized national currency. Included in this plan was the blueprint for a Federal <name type="place">Mint</name> which opened in 1793 to provide for the monetary needs of the new republic. It took several years before the output
<pb n="20"/>
of the new Federal <name type="place">Mint</name> could satisfy the demand for money and so foreign gold and silver remained legal tender until 1857. In the interval, the state coppers and other pre-Federal coins and tokens took up the slack in the small change medium and continued to circulate in some parts of the country as late as 1856. Many worn Confederation coppers succumbed to a less noble fate and ended up as scrap metal for sleigh bells, buttons and frying pans. Other monetary changes were also slow since old habits die hard. For many years people continued to calculate in the old colonial money of account notations of <hi rend="italic">£, s</hi>., and <hi rend="italic">d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This overview of Confederation coinages has been just that; a summary of the first episode of our national numismatic heritage. Considering the economic and political complexities of the period, it becomes easy to understand the factors that gave rise to this vast copper coinage which so enriched this era and continues to stimulate interest and research today.</p>

                  <p>Reduced to its simplest terms, a bill of exchange is created when one party purchases from another party a portion of his credit balance which is held by a third party.

Therefore, American merchant B purchases from American merchant A a portion of the latter's credit balance held by Londoner A. American B remits this bill of exchange, purchased from American A, to <name type="place">London</name> merchant B to pay for his goods.

               </head>
               <p>Even the most casual collector is fascinated by a counterfeit coin. Perhaps part of this fascination is based upon the fact that a counterfeit coin has a story to tell that goes far beyond government production quotes and conversion of moneys of account. It has a personal component to its history and seems to struggle to speak out with an individual voice. I have often heard colleagues remark, when inspecting a <name type="pname">George</name> III counterfeit halfpenny, "If only this coin could talk!" In my opinion, to a certain extent, coins can tell us much about themselves if we ask the right questions and listen carefully and critically.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The purpose of this study is to look at the contemporary counterfeit <name type="pname">George</name> III halfpenny from a scientific and statistical point of view. There exists a growing and exciting literature on both the taxonomy (classification by style and die type) and socio-economic basis for the production of these counterfeit coins.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> Catalytic to these recent studies is the continuous flow of excellent scholarship documented by the Proceedings volumes of the Coinage of the Americas Conference, sponsored annually by the Ameican Numismatic Society, <hi rend="italic">ANS Museum Notes</hi> (now <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics)</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Colonial Newsletter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I became interested in the British <name type="pname">George</name> III contemporary counterfeit halfpenny series about ten years ago, but it was only in 1992/93, when on sabbatical at the <name type="place">University of Oxford</name>, that I began to look at this series from a new perspective. In the summer of 1992, I was offered a number of counterfeit examples by a local coin dealer in <name type="place">Oxford</name>. I mentioned to him that this coin series not only circulated in his country, but it also circulated during the colonial and confederation periods in my country. An interesting conversation followed in which he informed me that the most common date in the counterfeit series was 1775, but that was not the case for the regal series they were imitating. He was also of the opinion that the counterfeits were substantially lighter in weight, on average, than the halfpence produced by the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name>. A cursory examination of my handful of coppers supported his observations.</p>
               <p>Compelled by scientific curiosity to get a more quantitative picture of the series, I approached a colleague in the Department of Materials, where I was studying, to sponsor me for a library card (reader's ticket) for the numismatic library in the <name type="place">Ashmolean Museum</name>, which he kindly did. For many weeks thereafter, I spent my spare time systematically going through the numismatic literature
<pb n="25"/>
trying to answer the simple question, "Of the six years 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773, 1774, and 1775, what is the relative frequency of occurrence of the counterfeit halfpence?" There were some tantalizing hints but apparently no one had carried out a careful date analysis study <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> I found detailed information about the production of the series by the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name>, but mostly anecdotal information about the counterfeits. By mid-winter, my spare-time interest had grown into a project. It had also expanded in scope to include a plan to assemble a collection of counterfeit examples while in <name type="place">England</name>, and a comparative assembly collected back in the <name type="place">U.S.</name> from sources not directly traceable to English sources. In addition, I soon came to realize there were examples with dates outside the regal interval (1770-75), interesting questions on weight and size, and virtually no information on elemental composition as it applies to mining and smelting sources. These topics address issues of production and distribution. Guided by the old scientific adage, to measure is to know, I set out to try to find answers to this ever-growing list of questions. The results of some of my studies are incorporated in this paper.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Study Methodology</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Collecting, analyzing, and presenting data, in a broad sense, is what is meant by statistics. It is a very practical way to understand a large population, by looking at a smaller sub-group of the population, called a sample. For instance, by shaking out a few piles of M&amp;Ms from a bag, we can pretty much assure ourselves (infer from the sample) that the number of red M&amp;Ms in the bag is the same as the number of green M&amp;Ms in the bag, even though we have not examined the entire contents of the bag (the population). However, for the sample to be a fair representation of its population, care must be exercised in how the sample is taken. (We wouldn't want to hire a color-blind M&amp;M statistician!) We also need to know whether the population we are sampling is biased. (Did someone get to the bag before it was sampled and eat some of the green M&amp;Ms?) These are major issues in any statistical study and since we know that a coin collection can be a highly biased group of examples, not at all characteristic of the general population from which it was assembled, the challenges of using a fair sampling technique and assuring that the population is unbiased, are formidable.</p>
               <p>Collections, by their very nature, are assembled with specific goals in mind. I have a friend who collects shillings. It makes a beautiful collection but it is certainly not representative of the general population of British coinage, or even the population of British monarchs.
<pb n="26"/>
He also specializes in coins of <name type="pname">Charles I</name> and thus his shilling collection incorporates this interest (is biased in this regard) and therefore does not evenly represent the population of all British shillings.</p>
               <p>To minimize both sampling error and population bias in this study, I have taken the following measures. First, I assembled a collection of 300 counterfeit examples under controlled situations, sampled as fairly as I could—without regard to grade, date, or cost. I would look at the <name type="pname">George</name> III counterfeits available at coin shops or market stalls throughout <name type="place">England</name> and I would either buy all that were offered or buy none. The point being, I did not pick and choose by grade, date, or any other criteria. In addition I regularly purchased examples from two coin dealers who acquired large lots for me using this all or none technique. The only criterion for rejecting examples was based upon damage, excessive corrosion or coins with unreadable dates. Since I was interested in date analysis as well as weight and size, damaged coins (holed, bent, or deeply pitted) were of no use. It took two years to assemble The Study Collection used for this project. At the same time, and in a similar way, I put together a smaller collection of regal examples.</p>
               <p>I have also inventoried a medium size private English collection and a large private <name type="place">U.S.</name> collection, each assembled, to my satisfaction, in an unbiased manner.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Upon returning to the <name type="place">U.S.,</name> I assembled an inventory of examples of <name type="pname">George</name> III contemporary counterfeit halfpence with no known direct English sources. This was very difficult and after considering nearly 300 coins, I have chosen to include 60 examples in this inventory. These include coins from the archaeological record (sites prior to 1857 in <name type="place">northern New England</name>), coins through bequest to historical societies (small groups with no systematic effort to "round out" the holding), and purchased coins for which I was able to trace at least three owners in the <name type="place">U.S.</name> previous to me having no known mail order component to their collecting hobby, and no military service in <name type="place">Europe</name>.</p>
               <p>A statistical study of these collections, as well as others, and a discussion of the elemental metallic composition of both counterfeit and regal examples will be presented in the sections that follow.</p>

               <p>We begin this section with a look at the regal production of <name type="pname">George</name> III halfpence. In response to both a lack of sufficient silver coinage in circulation and "after <name type="place">London</name> Tradesmen had petitioned for a supply of new copper coin, in order to throw counterfeits out of circulation,"<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> resumed minting of copper in
<pb n="27"/>
1770. This "Experiment of a Temporary Relief to the Public"<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> continued for six years. The output of halfpence from the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> during this period, in long tons, was: 1770, 9.0; 1771, 55.0; 1772, 50.5; 1773, 39.7; 1774, 24.0; and 1775, 22.8 for a total of 200.95 long tons. In terms of percentage of total production, the values are: 1770, 4.5%; 1771, 24.0%; 1772, 25.1%; 1773, 19.8%; 1774, 11.9% and 1775, 11.3%. These values are illustrated as a histogram in <ref target="#fig-14">fig. 1</ref>. We see from these numbers that the regal production of <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence was concentrated in the years 1771, 1772, and 1773, with over 70% of the output during that period.</p>
               <p>We turn now to the date distribution of counterfeit <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence with the same date range as the regal issue, namely 1770-75. However, one must keep in mind that the date on a counterfeit coin represents only the earliest hypothetical date of circulation and not necessarily its actual earliest date of circulation or its date of production. We will return to this point at the end of this section.</p>
               <p>We first consider The Study Collection identified above. This is a medium size collection of 300 coins assembled in such a way as to represent, as closely as practical, the extant population in <name type="place">England</name> today. The distribution by date for The Study Collection is 1770, 4; 1771, 13; 1772, 10; 1773, 55; 1774, 51; 1775, 167 or by percent 1770, 1.3%; 1771, 4.3%; 1772, 3.3%; 1773, 18.3%; 1774, 17.0%; and 1775, 55.7%. These values are illustrated as a histogram in <ref target="#fig-15">fig. 2</ref> and stand in dramatic contrast to the regal production values in fig. 1, in at least two significant ways. The most obvious difference is that over 50% of the counterfeit pieces are dated 1775. Secondly, nearly 90% of the counterfeit pieces are concentrated in the last three dates. One, of course, might say that we should not expect the production of counterfeit examples to correlate in any way with the production of regal examples. However, this is not what the merchants of <name type="place">London</name> had expected when they petitioned the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> for a new coinage. They expected precisely the opposite effect, namely, that the new coinage would drive the counterfeit coinage from circulation! This was definitely not what happened.</p>
               <p>Contemporary accounts of the profound extent of counterfeit production are numerous. <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> of Soho, in a letter to <name type="pname">Lord Hawkesbury</name> dated April 14, 1789, states:
<q>In the course of my journeys I observe that I received upon an average two-thirds counterfeit halfpence for change at toll-gates, etc. and I believe the evil is carried into circulation by the lowest class of manufacturers who pay with it the principal part of the wages of the poor people they employ. They purchase from subterraneous coiners 36 shillings worth of copper (coins in nominal value) for 20 shillings, so that the profit derived from the cheating is very large.</q>

               <p>In a letter to <name type="pname">King George III</name>, ca. 1800, the <name type="place">Earl of Liverpool</name> writes:
<q>It is certain that the quantity of counterfeit copper coins greatly exceeds the quantity of legal copper coins: the Officers of the <name type="place">Mint</name> were of the opinion, in the year 1787, that even then they exceeded the legal copper coins. Their number has certainly increased ever since: the quality of these counterfeit copper coins is in truth beyond calculation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To estimate the amount of counterfeit coinage in circulation, the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> examined a sample in 1787 and found that only 8% had a tolerable resemblance to the kings coin, the remainder being characterized from blantantly inferior to trash.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Before discussing the implication of the date distribution of counterfeit examples dated 1770-75 within their contemporary historic context, Table 1 sets forth below the results of four additional date distribution studies.</p>

               <p>The Study Collection requires no further description at this point. The large <name type="place">U.S.</name> Private Collection (third column) was put together over a 15-year period using English coin dealers as the source of examples. This collection was essentially set aside as it was accumulated and only recently (July 1995) a systematic statistical analysis by date and weight was carried out. The date distribution
<pb n="31"/>
of this collection stands in remarkable agreement with that of The Study Collection.</p>
               <p>The medium size English collection was inventoried in 1993 and was put together by a private collector over a period of about 10 years. As can be seen, the date distribution of this collection is in good agreement with respect to the previous two collections.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">Bramah</name> Survey of 1929 is the name I give a "grab sample" of <name type="pname">George</name> III halfpence described by <name type="pname">Ernest Bramah</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> To get an estimate of the ratio of regal coins to counterfeit coins and a distribution by date, <name type="pname">Bramah</name> states, without elaboration, "For sake of comparison an analysis is here given of an assortment of the issue, got together promiscuously." Whatever "got together promiscuously" means, I consider it a "grab sample" from the extant population in 1929 and include it in Table 1, feeling its historic uniqueness outweighs its slightly less than scientific sampling methodology. The full details of The <name type="pname">Bramah</name> Survey are included as Appendix A. This survey, given its sample size, is in good agreement with The Study Collection.</p>
               <p>The Yale Collection was inventoried by <name type="pname">C. Wyllys Betts</name>, and included as part of an address to the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society in April 1886, entitled "Counterfeit Half Pence Current in the American Colonies and their Issue from <name type="place">Mints of Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name>."<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> Three points must be made clear to understand its inclusion in Table 1. First, the number of coins in the collection is not specified by Betts, only the number of die varieties. Secondly, Betts, in discussing the Yale Collection states, "The Yale Collection, which is the chief source of information on this subject (i.e., ca. 1886), contains counterfeits of the following dates...." Betts then enumerates the collection by date but does not state that they are all British counterfeits. Third, we are not informed how the Yale Collection was put together, that is, the sampling methodology employed. However, we see a remarkable agreement between the date distribution for the Yale Collection and The Study Collection, especially when the size of the Yale Collection is taken into consideration. Thus I have included it in Table 1 for its unique and important historic perspective.</p>
               <p>The rightmost column in Table 1 is an inventory of the Defaced <name type="place">London</name> Halfpenny Hoard. Enumeration of the entire hoard, found in an archaeological site in <name type="place">London</name> in 1981, is described in Appendix B. The 129 dated <name type="pname">George</name> III counterfeit examples are included in Table 1. As can be seen, Table 1 establishes the relative frequency, by date, for the British <name type="pname">George</name> III contemporary halfpenny series.</p>
               <p>The Study Collection, as well as all the other collections, shows
<pb n="32"/>
50% or more of the examples are dated 1775: a remarkable result that invites interpretation. If we assume that the collections are fair samples of the population of coins produced, we are led at once to at least two hypotheses: 1) either counterfeit coin production nearly tripled from 1774 to 1775 and then abruptly stopped; or, 2) counterfeit coin production did not change substantially in 1775, but continued for several years employing the date 1775. Several indications support the second hypothesis. If we imagine, for the moment, we are in charge of a mint making counterfeit coins toward the end of 1775 or early in 1776 and our last reverse die finally fails, in order to continue production we must have new dies cut. However, we do not know if the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> plans to produce coins dated 1776. (It is not even clear if the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> knew in 1775 if it would produce copper coins dated 1776.) We can order our new dies dated 1775, we can request a die design that hedges the issue by using a 5 that looks like a 6, or we can speculate and order dies with the new year, 1776. In fact, it appears all three options were exercised.</p>
               <p>Counterfeit halfpence dated 1776 are only about one-half as scarce as those dated 1770 (discussed below). Far more common are examples with a 5 that looks like a 6, as illustrated in <ref target="#fig-16">fig. 3</ref>. Here the top bar of the 5 is tilted up and the base of the 5 curls around until it almost, but not quite, forms a closed loop. This leads one to ask, if the production of counterfeit halfpence did continue past 1775, then when did production cease? There does not seem to be a definite answer to this question but, as can be seen from <ref target="#fig-17">fig. 4</ref>, dies with the date 1775 were still being used as late as 1797! Fig. 4 shows a counterfeit <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpenny struck over an English token (<name type="place">Middlesex</name> 363, J.Palmer/Mail Coach)<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref> of 1797. These overstrikes are quite scarce (perhaps less than 12 known) but nonetheless provide a vivid example of the fact that the date on a counterfeit coin does not indicate its year of production.</p>

               <p>With the substantial number of coins represented in the first three collections listed in Table 1 (about 2,000 examples), one can form a reasonable impression of the types and relative frequency of coin production errors. Of the 205 error coins examined, the most frequent error, 39%, is the double strike. This type of error occurs, as the name implies, when a struck coin is not fully ejected from the press and the dies are brought together again, making a second impression on the coin. Brockages account for 29% of the error examples. A brockage occurs when a struck coin is not ejected from the press, but a blank is fed in and struck between one of the dies and the previously struck coin.</p>

               <p>Reverse brockages are nearly twice as frequent as obverse brockages, 63% compared to 37%, respectively. This may indicate that it was common practice to load the coin press with the reverse die on the bottom and the obverse die on top. Thus, when a coin is struck but not ejected, because it sticks unseen to the upper die, it presents its reverse to the next blank fed in, with the reverse die facing the other side of the blank from below. Remarkably, 90% of all brockages examined were full brockages, meaning the blank is fully registered over the lower die. This might indicate that some type of blank centering fixture was employed in the press feed technology and as long as the initial coin remains stuck to the die, a full brockage results. This is further borne out by the fact that off-center strikes are unusual, accounting for only 6% of all production errors. In counting off-center strikes, I did not include examples less that 5% off-center, assuming that amount of misalignment was probably within contemporary production standards. Incomplete blanks or clipped examples account for about 10% of all production errors. This results if the operator of the blank cutter fails to advance the copper sheet more than a full blank diameter or unknowingly reaches the end or the edge of the sheet. A menagerie of multiple errors, uniface examples, tab or edge pinches, and a few triple strikes make up the remainder of the error types. I was quite surprised to find five press loading errors: four examples of coins with an obverse on both sides from two different dies (not a brockage, but two fully struck obverse impressions) and one double reverse example, with each die dated 1771.</p>
               <p>The above analysis, expressed as percentages, is based upon a population of 205 error examples. However, it would be inaccurate to conclude that because I examined about 2,000 coins, one coin in ten is a production error. Collectors tend to hold on to novel examples and even actively seek them out. Since I had control of the sampling methodology for The Study Collection, it is only from that source that I can venture an estimate of absolute error frequency. Of the 300 coins in The Study Collection, eleven are error examples: four double strikes, three off-centers, two brockages, and two incomplete blanks for an absolute frequency estimation of about 4%.</p>
               <p>Using the dated examples of error coins, one can test the hypothesis that the generation of an error coin is an accidental happenstance. Another way of saying this is if the hypotheses is true that the generation of an error coin is a random event, then the percentage of error coins, by date, should track with the percentage
<pb n="36"/>
of all coins by date. Using the dated double strikes, off-centers, and brockages, this hypothesis does appear to be true: 1770, 0%; 1771, 10%; 1772, 2%; 1773, 15%; 1774, 18%; and 1775, 55%; from a sample size of 152 dated errors. (Of the 205 error coins 152 were dated; all obverse brockages, and several off-centers and double strikes were without date impressions.) The match to the percentages in Table 1 for the population as a whole is not perfect, but for the small sample size it is still very good. The year 1771 stands out as errorful. This might be a consequence of the fact that, although counterfeiting of <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpenny series began in 1770, large scale counterfeit operations lagged by about a year, based on the number of die varieties and extant examples from 1771 as compared to 1770. Thus technical problems associated with enhanced production first showed up in 1771.</p>
               <p>It should be noted that I have not included die cutting errors, such as misspelled legends, reversed letters, etc. in the above error analysis. Unlike a double strike or an off-center, each of which is unique, a miscut die produces innumerable identical examples. This type of error must be analyzed using entirely different statistical techniques than those employed in this project. A study of this type is planned.</p>

               <p>One can see that as the practice of counterfeiting continued, lighter examples were accepted by merchants and tolerated by consumers. The trend to lighter coppers continued beyond the <name type="pname">George</name> III halfpenny series into the remaining decades of the eighteenth century with the proliferation of all types of commercial tokens as well as the evasive halfpenny series, the latter being of even lighter weight on average than the 1775 counterfeits.<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>At first glance it might seem to be a simple matter of careful measurement to determine whether a smaller than average blank or thinner than average sheet stock was employed in making a light weight coin. However, the thickness of a coin, considering the various aspects of the design, is not a well defined concept and the diameter of the blank is not the same as the diameter of the coin produced from it. In fact, coins struck without a collar, as the <name type="pname">George</name> III, 1770-75 <name type="pname">halfpenny</name> series was, are not round.</p>
               <p>Metal movement during striking depends upon the coin design, among other factors. The metal in the field areas of the design, where the dies come closest together, is pushed radially outward more than in areas of high relief, like the device area. On a weakly struck coin, one can often see this effect in that the roller marks from the sheet mill on the undisturbed surface of the blank at the bust area show a rough, pocked texture, even though the field areas are smoothly struck. Thus, unless the coin design is concentric on both obverse and reverse, coins struck without a collar are not round. The Fugio series, having essentially concentric designs on both obverse and reverse, tend to be round although struck without a collar. Coins of the <name type="pname">George</name> III, 1770-75 <name type="pname">halfpenny</name> series are wider than they are high. That is, when held with the date horizontal, the horizontal diameter of the coin is larger than its vertical diameter by as much as several percent. This is because the field areas on both obverse and reverse are oriented left/right and the metal pushes out more in the horizontal direction than it does in the vertical direction. The extent to which this noncircularity takes place depends upon the operating pressure of the coin press and the softness of the blank, but the direction is determined by the coin's design. The softness of copper can be controlled during coin production. Mechanical working of copper, called work hardening, for example while drawing an ingot into a bar or rolling a bar into a sheet, makes it harder. Heating the copper, called annealing, resoftens it. A bar of copper might be annealed several times during processing to make the sheet from which the blanks are punched. Since punching is easier to carry out with hardened copper, the sheet is not annealed during the final stage of rolling just prior to blanking. The blanks are annealed before striking to soften the copper in order to help assure a well-defined image.</p>

               <p>If short cuts are taken, like infrequent annealing, cracks, delaminations, and shallow strikes result and inferior coins are produced.</p>
               <p>We now consider the hypothesis that counterfeiters used inferior production equipment and naive technologies as compared to the equipment and technologies used by the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name>. These technologies might include, but are not limited to, inferior coin presses resulting in reduced and irreproducible striking pressure and improper annealing procedures during rolling, blanking, and before striking. To test this hypothesis let us consider two pairs of correlation plots.</p>
               <p>
                  <ref target="#fig-18">Fig. 5</ref> shows a correlation plot of the weight of each coin in The Study Collection against its corresponding vertical diameter, i.e., its size. We see, not surprisingly, a strong correlation between weight and size. The interesting feature in this figure is that the solid circles are examples dated 1775, while the open circles are examples dated 1770-74. Note that the lighter 1775 coins are smaller. If coiners were unable to control the rolling process, producing copper sheet of varying thickness from edge to edge or from sheet to sheet, we might expect far more scatter of the data and little correlation between size and weight, even when smaller diameter blank cutters were employed. The solid diamonds in this figure show the correlation of weight versus vertical diameter for a small collection of regal examples. Even though the weight range of the regal examples is narrower than that of the counterfeits, the scatter in the size is essentially the same. This scatter is a measure of the variability of the production process and this figure implies, among other things, that the technical level of the counterfeiters in controlling their rolling technologies was comparable to that of the <name type="place">Royal Mint's</name> ability to control its rolling technologies. I assumed in this analysis that the production of blank cutter tools, being a straightforward lathe operation, was completely controlled as far as choosing the diameter of the cutter is concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <ref target="#fig-19">Fig. 6</ref> shows a correlation plot of the weight of each coin against its corresponding noncircularity. Noncircularity is defined as the ratio of the difference between the horizontal diameter and the vertical diameter, to the vertical diameter, expressed as a percent. Again, the 1775 examples are shown as solid circles and the 1770-74 examples are shown as open circles. Weight and noncircularity are not as correlated as weight and size. Here the scatter is a measure of the variability of press pressure and adherence to the practice of annealing the blanks prior to striking. The solid diamonds in this
<pb n="41"/>
figure show the correlation of weight versus noncircularity for regal examples. We see a narrower weight range for the regal examples but essentially the same scatter in noncircularity. This implies that the ability of the counterfeiters to control their press and annealing technologies was similar to the <name type="place">Royal Mint's</name> control of their press and annealing technologies. Thus the hypothesis that the counterfeiters used inferior production equipment and naive technologies is apparently not supported by extant coin samples. It also suggests that the lighter coins were intentionally manufactured lighter as production of counterfeit coins continued through the latter part of the eighteenth century in what appears to be well-controlled and systematic use of production technologies.</p>
               <p>Because the various counterfeiting operations were not necessarily coordinated, there was no attempt to work within a specified range of size or weight, beyond what would be accepted into circulation. <name type="place">The Royal Mint</name> did a much better job in this regard, adhering well to a prespecified weight range, 140.9-167.9 grain; average 153.4 grain and size range, nominally 28.5 mm-30.0 mm; average 29.1 mm. In all other respects the counterfeiters appear to have been technically as skilled and perhaps as well equipped as the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name>. To quote <name type="pname">C. Wilson Peck</name>, discussing facsimile <name type="pname">George III</name> counterfeit halfpence, "...it is a fatal mistake to judge a specimen solely on its general appearance, as the workmanship and weight of some of the counterfeits are almost as good as the genuine ones and it is only by comparing the details (of the designs) that the spurious piece is discovered."<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref>

               </head>
               <p>As described above, a small inventory of counterfeit examples was assembled in the <name type="place">U.S.</name> from sources with no known direct English connections. The operative word here is direct. One would like to think, that by being sufficiently careful in sampling, a collection so assembled would represent examples of counterfeit <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpence that actually circulated in <name type="place">New England</name> during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. No doubt some examples in the inventory fall into that category but it is not clear what fraction of the inventory they represent and thus it would be naive to label the entire inventory as such. These coins are simply a collection assembled using a different sampling technique; the history of each coin being scrutinized as far back as practical to verify the criterion "not <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> from English sources." This stands in contrast to the random sampling technique employed in assembling The Study Collection from verified English sources. It also represents
<pb n="42"/>
a collection assembled from a different population of extant coins.</p>
               <p>In both <name type="place">North America</name> and <name type="place">England</name> these coins circulated for several decades. In <name type="place">England</name>, contemporary records tell us that attempts were made to pull counterfeit coppers out of circulation. However, these efforts were not very successful and, because copper coinage was essential for small scale commerce, from 1814 onward, the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> agreed to accept at face value the 1719-75 issues of contemporary counterfeits "as could not be excluded without skilled scrutiny."<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> In <name type="place">North America</name> these coppers were circulating along with state coppers. <name type="pname">Crosby</name>, in discussing coppers circulating in <name type="place">New York</name>, notes "A very great number of pieces in imitation of British halfpence...generally called by the name <name type="place">Birmingham</name> Coppers...are made there and imported in casks under the name of HardWare or wrought copper."<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The purpose of assembling a collection in the <name type="place">U.S.</name>, using this type of controlled sampling, was to determine if it would somehow differ from The Study Collection assembled directly from English sources. One might expect that it would differ, but how it differs and to what extent, are the major issues of interest. It could be argued that since the ultimate source of these coppers is, after all, English manufactories, the population would not differ significantly in <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place">North America</name> once released into circulation. However, one must test this hypothesis in order to know and, as can be seen from Table 3, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

               <p>At least two major differences exist between these collections. Perhaps the most significant being the larger percentage of 1771 examples in the "U.S. Collection"; the other being the reduced
<pb n="43"/>
representation of 1775 examples. (The exchange of the order of 1773 and 1774 examples in frequency of occurrence is probably not statistically significant in a population this size.)</p>
               <p>To understand the reasons for these differences is a challenge, however some historic issues may bear on this puzzle. On the one hand we know that in <name type="place">England</name> the production of counterfeits accelerated in 1771, following commencement of the <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpenny series in 1770. We also know that new laws regarding counterfeiting were passed in that year under Statute 11, <name type="pname">George III</name>, Chapter 40, page 231, stating that coining of false copper money, once punishable as a misdemeanor, was now deemed a felony. Punishment was also extended to buyers and sellers of counterfeit coins.</p>
               <q>If any person after 24th June 1771, shall buy, sell, take, receive, pay or put off any counterfeit copper coin, not melted down or cut in pieces, at or for a lower rate or value than the same by its denomination, imports, or was counterfeited for, he shall be adjudged guilty of felony.<ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref>
               </q>
               <p>It is quite possible that, at least temporarily, the combined effects of a substantial upturn in production accompanied by new laws attempting to govern trafficking may have resulted in increased export to <name type="place">North America</name>. It was not until 1798 that a law was passed explicitly forbidding export (Statute 38 <name type="pname">George III</name>, Chapter 67, page 81, 1798, "false coin, including copper, could not be exported or put on board any ship"). The extent to which these two events enhanced export activity is yet to be fully documented.</p>
               <p>We are certain that a profound decrease in export occurred in 1775, and for a considerable period thereafter, as the War for Independence brought the mercantile economy of the colonies to an abrupt halt. This may account for the reduced percentage of examples with this date in the "U.S. Collection."</p>
               <p>For completeness, I should add that regal halfpence and farthings were scarce in North American commerce. Bad money drove out good and regal coinage of all denominations was taken back to <name type="place">England</name> at every opportunity. Furthermore, the farthing as a denomination had no North American counterpart (except for limited production of the half cent in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>) and apparently did not circulate here in any meaningful way.<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">George III</name> counterfeit halfpence exist with dates other than 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773, 1774 and 1775, although these coins are rare. Because of the rarity of coins dated outside the regal interval, their relative importance would have been completely lost if they had been included in the statistical analysis by date above. Furthermore, because of their relatively small sample size, a statistical analysis by date of this population would carry little validity. Fortunately, for small subpopulations of this type, analysis can proceed using the technique of comparative evaluation. For this purpose I have chosen the least frequent date, 1770, as the basis for comparison, giving it a value of 100. Thus a coin outside the regal interval which occurs one fourth as frequently as counterfeit coins dated 1770, would have a comparative rarity of 25%.</p>
               <p>We begin by defining the population of <name type="pname">George III</name> counterfeits to which this comparative rarity analysis will be applied. This is most easily done by exclusion. Since certain well-defined numismatic populations stand separate from the topic of this study, they should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be included. These groups are the <name type="pname">Mould-Atlee Tory</name> Coppers dated 1771, 1772, 1774, 1775, 1776 and 1777, the Machins Mills Coppers dated 1776, 1778, 1787, 1788 (and of course the <name type="place">Connecticut and New York</name> mules in this series which do not have the Britannia reverse), and the <name type="place">Bungtown</name> Coppers dated 1784 and 1786.<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The results of the comparative rarity analysis are shown in Table 4. Overspecification is avoided by using broad comparative rarity ranges.</p>

               <p>It should be mentioned that an explicit study of the dates 1781 and 1785 has been carried out by <name type="pname">Eric P. Newman</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref> My studies support his conclusion in that I did not find a single example dated 1785 in any of the private or museum collections I examined in <name type="place">England</name>. The date 1781 is found both in English and American collections.</p>
               <p>I am fairly sure that other dates will be added to Table 4. Any omissions are purely the result of the limited nature of this study and the collections that I have thus far inventoried.</p>
               <p>It is difficult to draw any strong conclusions from Table 4 but a few points of interest should be noted. The dates 1776 and 1777 were discussed above as possibly stemming from the incorrect assumption by counterfeiters that the 1770-75 series would continue. The date 1781 coincides with the resumption of striking of Irish <name type="pname">George</name> III halfpence by the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> after a five year lapse and perhaps anticipation that the British series would resume resulted in an output of counterfeits with that date. Some evasive coppers are also dated 1781. For the less frequently occurring dates, I have no explanation beyond the remarkable tolerance of a large sector of the population to offer and accept coppers without regard to design detail.<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref>

               </head>
               <p>It is not difficult to find opinions in the numismatic literature, some rather strongly stated, that counterfeit halfpence are frequently encountered in copper of inferior quality, that is, highly impure or intentionally debased. In this section I will show that this is not the case and discuss some of the possible reasons why. It is certainly true that many examples come to us in a very poor state of preservation, perhaps from having been in the ground for a long period of time. Moreover, there is no lack of examples with delamination flaws and occasional silicaceous inclusions, but these are not primarily debasement issues.</p>
               <p>I have had the opportunity to measure the elemental composition of both regal and counterfeit <name type="pname">George</name> III halfpence using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and I have found that the vast majority of the counterfeit examples measured were not only of good quality copper, but over 60% were, for all practical purposes, the same quality copper as the regal examples measured. However, having said that, I do not wish to give the impression that the analysis of elemental composition is a simple task or that my studies in this area, at the time of this writing, are complete.</p>
               <pb n="46"/>
               <p>I became interested in the elemental composition of the <name type="pname">George III</name> halfpenny series in the context of what has become known as the melting hypothesis. The melting hypothesis simply states that it was possible to make a profit as a counterfeiter by melting regal halfpennies and producing light weight counterfeits from the copper so derived.<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref> For example, if the average weight of counterfeits produced is 100 grains instead of the nominal regal weight of about 150 grains, one could melt 5 regals to make 7 counterfeits (even with some wastage) for an apparent profit, at face value, of 40%. Because this rough estimate does not account for capital investment, labor, or supplies (equipment, dies, fuel, etc.) it is clearly an overestimate. However, it has been further proposed that to support a reasonable margin of profit, scrap metal was added to the melt along with the regal halfpence. This is where compositional analysis can help clarify the situation. Using scrap metal to increase the volume of the melt sounds simple (just toss in the odd horseshoe, a handful of used glazing lead, and some broken bronze marine hardware) but there are several metallurgical and economic reasons why this was not done as a standard large-scale practice, although it probably was tried on occasion out of desperation or ignorance.</p>
               <p>Copper ores are complex, often containing small amounts of other metals such as lead, iron, zinc, tin, silver, arsenic, antimony and nickel, along with silicon, calcium, sulfur, carbon and oxygen. In fact, rich copper ores might only contain 5 percent copper. Smelting, the process that extracts the metallic copper from the ore, is a rather violent thermo-chemical process. In the eighteenth century copper ores containing sulfur were roasted in air to make copper oxide and then reduced to metallic copper using carbon monoxide, derived from charcoal, in a high temperature environment. For example, chalcocite, Cu<hi rend="sub">2</hi>S, is first roasted in air, Cu<hi rend="sub">2</hi>S + 2O<hi rend="sub">2</hi> = 2CuO + SO<hi rend="sub">2</hi> to produce copper oxide, CuO, and then reduced to copper, Cu, following the equation CuO + CO = Cu + CO<hi rend="sub">2</hi>. Oxygen containing copper ores were reduced directly to copper using carbon monoxide in a similar manner. Malachite, Cu<hi rend="sub">2</hi>CO<hi rend="sub">3</hi>, for example, follows the equation, Cu<hi rend="sub">2</hi>CO<hi rend="sub">3</hi> + CO = Cu + 2CO<hi rend="sub">2</hi>. In the smelting process, certain elements from the ore, such as silver and nickel, readily disolve in molten copper and thus tend to be concentrated, while others, like zinc, are usually lost entirely in the fumes. Iron, often in the form of iron pyrite in the ore, is oxidized and makes up a major portion of the discarded rock-like slag. Arsenic and antimony behave chemically similar to copper in the smelting process and thus occur in the smelted copper in approximately the same ratio as they appeared in the ore. Tin and lead are lost to some extent
<pb n="47"/>
but, because they tend to alloy with copper, they are usually present in the smelted copper if present in the ore. Thus the level of purity of smelted copper tends to be high, without further refining technologies being employed. Smelted copper might contain a few percent of tin or lead, a few tenths of a percent of arsenic and antimony, and trace amounts of silver, nickel, iron, and zinc, the exact proportions depending on the ore source, the smelting process and the skill of the workers. This is essentially the composition of the regal halfpence of <name type="pname">George III</name> and the vast majority of the counterfeits. However, the details of the ore smelting process alone do not account for the fact that apparently counterfeiters did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> employ substantial additions of scrap metals to the melt. We must look for other reasons to understand this observation.</p>
               <p>Iron melts at 1540°C, a substantially higher temperature than the melting point of copper at 1150°C. In addition, only small amounts of iron will normally alloy with copper, so tossing the odd horseshoe or bucket of nails into the melt simply just will not work: they won't melt.</p>
               <p>Brass, an alloy of copper with zinc, was expensive in eighteenth century Britain, due to the difficulty in producing zinc and the complicated technique of making brass directly from a mixture of smithsonite, ZnCO<hi rend="sub">3</hi>, and granular copper. Because of its ease of machining, the industries of clockmaking, watchmaking, and the production of scientific instruments kept the demand for brass, and thus the price, high well into the nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>Bronze, the most common alloy of copper, incorporates tin, or tin together with lead, to produce a hard corrosion-resistant material. Bronze was by far the most important non-ferrous alloy for industrial purposes in eighteenth century Britain and available in large quantities due to the native deposits of its constituent ores. However, the scrap price for bronze, like the scrap price for brass, was substantially greater than the scrap price for copper.</p>
               <p>Lead, due to the availability of its ore and ease of smelting, was less expensive than scrap copper and thus a possible candidate as a debasing component. But, because of its very low melting temperature, 327°C, as well as other metallurgical issues, it is difficult to get substantial amounts of lead to alloy with copper as a homogeneous mix. The way this is accomplished in practice is to add tin, along with lead, and usually starting from the ores, not the metals <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> However, this results in a bronze that can be brittle and very difficult to roll into sheet.</p>
               <p>Tin, at about the same scrap price as copper, offered no economic advantage as a debasing material. In addition, copper-tin bronzes
<pb n="48"/>
approach the hardness of a coin die, hardly a desirable feature.</p>
               <p>We can conclude from this brief discussion of metallurgical issues that extensive debasement of copper was either technically impossible or economically out of the question. But, even if all the regal halfpence were melted to make counterfeits, it would not begin to account for the magnitude of counterfeits in circulation in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</p>
               <p>We are therefore left with both an explanation of the relatively high quality copper used by eighteenth century counterfeiters (it was both the practical and economical material of choice) and a conclusion concerning debasement of copper for coinage. Debasement was probably carried out to a limited degree, perhaps experimentally, perhaps out of ignorance, or perhaps out of desperation, but it was not carried out as a large-scale common practice. Thus, it is not surprising that after measuring 10% of the coins in The Study Collection, I found the composition of the majority of them the same as the composition of the regals I measured. When I did find departures that were significant, it was higher than usual iron content, perhaps indicating melting in iron containers and/or ore sources with very high iron pyrite content, and higher tin/lead values, perhaps indicating some use of scrap bronze. However, in no case did the departure (debasement) from the composition of copper used for the regal issues exceed more than 10%.</p>
               <p>And what about those delaminations and silicaceous inclusions occasionally found in counterfeit coins? These result from taking shortcuts in the production processes and quality control; for example, the careful elimination of slag from the melt and other oxides from the ingot before drawing the ingot into a bar. Not annealing the bar at different stages in the drawing process and/or rolling process to prevent work hardening and crack propagation, will lead to delamination. These are not primarily debasement issues. My studies in this area are not yet complete and much work remains to be done. It is not even clear in detail what mines and smelters were suppliers to the Royal Mint during this period, let alone who the counterfeiters were and where they obtained their materials. But one can conclude that the counterfeiters did not use copper of inferior quality. Perhaps they used less than the best available, but definitely, it was not extensively debased as a large scale practice.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The English <name type="pname">George III</name> contemporary counterfeit halfpenny series represents a unique chapter in Anglo-American numismatics. The number of these coins circulating in both economies was enormous as well as functionally essential to small scale commerce. What at first appears to be the product of amateur efforts turns out to be a large scale, technically competent, well-managed enterprise, rivaling if not matching the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> by almost every measure of engineering competence of the time.</p>
               <p>From the data presented herein, I would suggest the following interpretations.</p>
               <p>Responding to formal petition from the business community, the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> resumed production of copper coinage in 1770. Counterfeiting of this new series began in earnest the following year and continued for over two decades. From examples extant today, the counterfeiters' efforts, taken together, appear to have outperformed the Mint by somewhere between 5/1 and 8/1, producing facsimile light weight coinage of comparable composition. It is likely that the sources of copper ore and the smelting operations employed by the counterfeiters were the same as those employed by the <name type="place">Mint</name>. It is probable that in some years the contracts by various counterfeiting operations for materials and services could have exceeded those of the <name type="place">Mint</name>. Production technologies and equipment also appear to have been comparable. In two areas the <name type="place">Royal Mint</name> was exceedingly successful: the very high degree of die-making craftsmanship and artistry, and the ability to stay within production constraints of weight and size. In all other respects, the counterfeiters of the late eighteenth century were working at the state of the art of production engineering in what stands as one of the largest clandestine manufacturing operations in pre-industrial revolution <name type="place">England</name>.</p>

                  <p>"This corroborates Montagu's experience—that the year 1775, and particularly for halfpence, was the most prolific of forgeries. Those who may be inclined to be skeptical about these proportions might submit their own specimens to a careful scrutiny and comparison. There are two ready tests of genuineness: weight and appearance. The former is the less important, for although true specimens are of full weight, unfortunately, so is a certain proportion of forgeries, though there are farthings of such flimsy fabric that they will float on water. But appearance imposed a harder task and the various efforts to reproduce the official expression of <name type="pname">George III</name>, and the correct pose and visage of the lady on the reverse, have resulted in a gallery of unintentional caricatures that makes a good collection of these pieces a very entertaining series."</p>

            <p>A substantial portion of the counterfeit halfpence in circulation in the <name type="place">United States</name> in the 1780s was imported.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> This paper will examine some of the evidence as to how they were imported, by whom they were imported, and from where they were imported. Since the Second World War, there have been numerous discoveries of coins on shipwrecks, particularly of Spanish treasure fleets.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> Lacking was a hulk of a ship carrying not Spanish silver treasure, but rather counterfeit halfpence.</p>
            <p>Such a shipwreck—or to be more accurate, the coins from such a shipwreck—has in fact been found. Around 1930, the Coast Guard dredged the Indian River inlet on the coast of <name type="place">Delaware</name>. Shortly after this, massive numbers of copper coins began to be washed up on the beaches near <name type="place">Rehoboth Beach</name>, in particular on "<name type="place">Coin Beach</name>." Children filled buckets with these copper coins. I read about this in a book on treasure and shipwrecks,<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> and I wrote to <name type="pname">Julius Reiver</name> inquiring whether he had any more information about the coins and the wreck. Not only did <name type="pname">Jules</name> send me information about the wreck, he sent four coins to me in the post, of which he wanted to keep the best for himself and the other three he donated to the American Numismatic Society. None of these coins is in good condition, but enough detail remains so that it is clear that all four are counterfeit British halfpence. Until then all I had read about the coins from the wreck was that they were "British and Irish halfpence." <name type="pname">Jules</name> wrote to me as follows:
<q>Before World War II I had a tremendous bout with hay fever every year. It started the middle of August, and diminished slightly, until the first frost. Living at the seashore brought great relief, because of the lower pollen content of the ocean air. So I went to <name type="place">Rehoboth</name> every year... .</q>
               <q>I spent a fair amount of time at <name type="place">Coin Beach</name>. Using no equipment but a broken tree limb or a stick washed up on the beach, I dug into a lot of sand. Never did a decent coin appear. The salt water had corroded every coin. I probably gave away many of the coins. Years later, when I became interested in British coins, I found some of the coins I had found, and did get some others from friends... .</q>
               <q>I think that I remember seeing the remains of the ship just barely in the water (at low tide). The wreck was good for something else. There were quite a few girls in <name type="place">Rehoboth</name> in the summer. It was a simple way to get a first date. "How about going to <name type="place">Coin Beach</name> and see what we can find?"... . I do remember that the best time to search
<pb n="57"/>
was just after a storm. The surf churned things up and brought new sand to the top.<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From what shipwreck do these coins come from? Traditionally, they have been assigned to the <hi rend="italic">Faithful Steward</hi>, which sank in 1785. <name type="pname">John Potter</name>, in his <hi rend="italic">Treasure Diver's Guide,</hi> suggests that some of the coins found on "<name type="place">Coin Beach</name>" may have come from a sailing ship, the <hi rend="italic">Three Brothers,</hi> which sank in 1775. Another important shipwreck in the area is <hi rend="italic">HMS De Braak,</hi> which sank in 1798. <hi rend="italic">De Braak,</hi> however, can be eliminated because it sank inside <name type="place">Delaware Bay</name>, not outside it. Dr. <name type="pname">Spencer Peck</name> has published a narrative of the shipwreck of the <hi rend="italic">De Braak</hi> which says that when she sank, "her boat [was] alongside for the Captain who intended to go ashore at Lewes Town." <hi rend="italic">De Braak</hi> must have already rounded <name type="place">Cape Henlopen</name> to be anchored off Lewes.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> If the report of the find of a British guinea dated 1782 on "<name type="place">Coin Beach</name>" is accurate, then that eliminates the <hi rend="italic">Three Brothers.</hi> Of the various possibilities, the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>
               </hi> is clearly the likeliest. This is because of the date of the latest coin found so far (1782); the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>
               </hi> sank at a peak period of importations of counterfeit halfpence into the <name type="place">United States</name>; and finally because of the Irish halfpence which were found, which fit very neatly with the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>,</hi> because it had departed from an Irish port, namely <name type="place">Londonderry</name>. It is also worthy of note that <name type="pname">Robert Marx's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Shipwrecks of the <name type="place">Western Hemisphere</name>,</hi> which is often more accurate than <name type="pname">Potter</name>,<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> does not list the <hi rend="italic">Three Brothers</hi> at all, so the <hi rend="italic">Three Brothers</hi> may just be a "ghost shipwreck."<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Neil Rothschild</name> has made some very interesting comments about the wrecks in this area. He has dived off the Indian River inlet, which is no mean feat, because during the change of tide the currents are quite swift in and out of the inlet:
<q>I have dived and photographed a number of wrecks off the Indian River Inlet. I have never found a coin, although I have to admit I have never seriously looked for coins. I can say that there are a large number of wrecks off Indian River; wooden schooners of anonymous identity and many unidentified wrecks piled up on the Fenwick shoals, a shallow area 10 miles or so off the Inlet. There are literally wrecks piled up on top of wrecks. Most of the wrecks date from the mid-1800s and earlier. Most have been demolished by the wave action, with only a few wooden ribs or metal parts left.<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Rothschild's</name> point is an important one: this is an area with numerous wrecks which are intermingled. It is not a matter of ab-
<pb n="58"/>
solute certainty that the coins on <name type="place">Rehoboth Beach</name> come from the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>.</hi> But the balance of the probabilities is that the coins are from the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The swift currents in and out of the inlet which <name type="pname">Rothschild</name> has experienced help explain why the coins were swept onto the beach following 1930. When the Coast Guard dredged the inlet, it strengthened the strong currents, and the currents then swept the coins onto the beach.</p>
            <p>I have looked through numerous <name type="place">United States</name>, Irish, and British newspapers for accounts of the shipwreck of the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>
               </hi>; most do report the wreck, but they also all report the same shipwreck narrative, verbatim. In the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, newspapers followed a practice which the French and Germans call <hi rend="italic">colportage:</hi> the verbatim copying of articles from other newspapers, sometimes giving the other newspapers credit, sometimes not. For example, it is not unusual for a Berlin newspaper like the <hi rend="italic">Vossiscbe Zeitung</hi> to report news from Silesia by saying, "The <hi rend="italic">Schlesische Zeitung</hi> reports..." and then give a word-for-word quote from the <hi rend="italic">Schlesische Zeitung.</hi> Nowadays this would be called plagiarism, although our newspapers still have many verbatim accounts if they re-use the reports of wire services, if they buy features from national syndicates, or if they reprint press releases without rewriting them. If there is an air disaster nowadays, the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> will publish one story, the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> another, and the <hi rend="italic">New York Post</hi> still another, and if you buy all three papers you will have three stories from slightly different perspectives. This is not the case with the reporting of the shipwreck of the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>
               </hi> in three <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> papers, the <hi rend="italic">Daily Universal Register</hi> of <name type="place">London, England</name> (which became the <hi rend="italic">Times)</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal,</hi> which all contain this identical account of the disaster which befell the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>
               </hi> Connoly <name type="pname">M'Causland</name>,<ref target="#CH4-n9">9</ref> Master, from <name type="place">Londonderry</name>, bound to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>:
<q>On the 9th day of July last, said vessel sailed from <name type="place">Londonderry</name>, having on board 249 passengers of respectability, who had with them property to a very considerable amount. They had had a favourable passage, during which nothing of moment occurred, the greatest harmony having prevailed among them, until the night of Thursday, the 1st instant September, when at the hour of ten o'clock, it was thought adviseable to try for soundings, and to their great surprise found themselves in four fathoms water, though at dark there was not the smallest appearance of land. The consternation and astonishment
<pb n="59"/>
which then prevailed, is easier conceived than described, every exertion was used to run the vessel off shore, but in a few minutes she struck the ground, when it was found necessary to cut away her masts, &amp;c. all of which went overboard. On the morning of the 2d, we found ourselves on Mohoba-bank, near Indian river, about four leagues to the southward off Cape-Henlopen. Every effort was made to save the unhappy sufferers, who remained in the wreck during the night, although distant from shore only about 100 yards. The same evening she beat to pieces.</q>
               <q>The sea running extremely high, the boats were with difficulty disengaged from the wreck, but before they could be got manned they dashed ashore, therefore all relief was cut off, except by swimming or getting ashore on pieces of the wreck, and we are sorry to add, that of the above, only 68 persons were saved, among whom were the master, his mate and 10 seamen. During the course of the day, the inhabitants came down to the beach in numbers, and used every means in their power to relieve the unfortunate people on board, among whom were about 100 women and children, of whom only 7 women were saved. Several persons who escaped from the wreck are since dead from the wounds they received, and others are miserably bruised.</q>
               <q>With great pleasure we learn, that several humane and public spirited gentlemen of this city [<name type="place">Philadelphia</name>] are raising a SUBSCRIPTION, for the relief of the unhappy people who were saved from the wreck of the Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>; and there can be no doubt of their meeting with great [support?] from the benevolent Inhabitants, who have never been backward in affording assistance to the distressed.</q>
               <q>About the same time a French brig from Ostend, bound to the same port, foundered in sight of the above ship, but the crew taking to their boats, were saved. We have not learned her name, or any other particulars.<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The "French brig from Ostende" is almost certainly the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">St. Louis</name>,</hi> captained by <name type="pname">Havel</name>, bound from <name type="place">Dunkirk</name> to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, reported lost in <hi rend="italic">New-Lloyd's List</hi> of November 15, 1785.<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref> Dunkirk is the first French port south of <name type="place">Ostende</name>.</p>
            <p>Although the contemporary press reprinted the same verbatim account, there were certain nuances in how they reported it. <hi rend="italic">New-Lloyd's List</hi>
               <pb n="60"/>
noted the disaster with commercial terseness: "The <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>,</hi>
               <name type="pname">M'Causland</name>, from <name type="place">Londonderry</name> to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, is totally lost in the <name type="place">Delaware</name>, and 200 People perished."<ref target="#CH4-n12">12</ref>
               <hi rend="italic">The Belfast News-Letter</hi> printed the article on the front page, at the top left corner, and noted that this was not the first such disaster to an Ulster ship: about two years ago the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Packet</hi> from Belfast had been lost at "Sine-puxent," near <name type="place">Cape Henlopen</name>, and around the same time and at the same place the ship <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">America</name>
               </hi> from Newry was lost.<ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>"Sine-puxent" may refer either to <name type="place">Sinepuxent Bay, near Ocean City, Maryland</name>, or to <name type="place">Sinepuxent Beach</name>, which is on the barrier <name type="place">island south of Ocean City</name>. The location is approximately 40 miles south of <name type="place">Cape Henlopen</name>.</p>
            <p>When the ship <hi rend="italic">Friendship,</hi> captained by <name type="pname">Miller</name>, arrived in <name type="place">Londonderry</name> from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> on November 15, 1785, after a passage of five weeks, <name type="place">Londonderry</name> learned that the citizens of <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> had donated a thousand pounds to aid the shipwrecked passengers.<ref target="#CH4-n14">14</ref> It is not specified, however, whether that was British sterling, Irish sterling, or <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> currency.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal</hi> of November 24-26th, 1785, commented, "The vast emigrations from the Northern parts of this kingdom, is a circumstance truly alarming, scarce a packet or any other intelligence comes over from America, but we hear of numerous families arriving there to settle in that continent, many of whom bring off considerable properties, in order to carry on the linen and other manufactures." After reviewing the danger from Indians, the <hi rend="italic">Dublin Journal</hi> continued, "Even the dangers of the deep are also to be dreaded, as is evident from the loss of the vessel from <name type="place">Londonderry</name>, with 249 passengers of respectability that were going to reside in that part of the <name type="place">Western Hemisphere</name>."<ref target="#CH4-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Even as the passengers on the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>
               </hi> met their tragic end, more immigrants were disembarking from other ships. For example, the <hi rend="italic">Daily Universal Register</hi> reported from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> with a dateline of September 14th: "Monday last arrived the ship <hi rend="italic">Congress,</hi> Capt. <name type="pname">M'Clenaghan</name>, from <name type="place">Londonderry</name>, with near five hundred passengers; a number of which she landed at <name type="place">Newcastle</name>."<ref target="#CH4-n16">16</ref>
            </p>
            <p>I have come across two alternative shipwreck narratives. One account is by the diver <name type="pname">Robert</name> "Frogfoot" <name type="pname">Weller</name>, which is clearly based on the contemporary account quoted above, but with some impossible embellishments. One embellishment is that the male passengers "tried to swim through the surf with their mouths full of silver sovereigns," a non-existent coin. Weller also asserts that there was then a lighthouse at <name type="place">Cape Henlopen</name>, although this is not
<pb n="61"/>
mentioned in the contemporary narrative. <name type="pname">Weller</name> says that the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>
               </hi> was carrying 360,000 copper pennies, which is quite believable once we read "halfpence" instead of "pennies." <name type="pname">Weller</name> mentions among the coins which have been found, copper British and Irish halfpence (he calls them "pennies") dated 1776 to 1782. Most of those coins would be counterfeits, judging by the dates, since 1775 is the last genuine date for British halfpence. <name type="pname">Weller</name> also says that "recently" (i.e. shortly before 1990) some gold coins had been found as well.<ref target="#CH4-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Philip Zbar Trupp</name> gives a rather different shipwreck narrative. He says that the number of passengers on board was 360 (contemporary newspapers say 249); that the captain was <name type="pname">William McCausland</name> (contemporary newspapers call him <name type="pname">Connoly M'Causland</name>); and that 298 passengers drowned (contemporary newspapers say 68 out of 249 survived, which would mean that 181 drowned). <name type="pname">Trupp</name> says that the passengers and the crew were on deck celebrating the first wedding anniversary of a passenger, <name type="pname">John McGreg</name>, and were intoxicated when the ship ran aground. These contradictions with the newspaper account lead me to set <name type="pname">Trupp's</name> account aside, until confirmation in a contemporary source turns up.<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Trupp</name> does have interesting information about the coins recovered on the beach. He says that schoolchildren filled buckets with the coins and that one reporter wrote that the coins were "as numerous as clam shells." He mentions that a recent treasure hunter found one hundred coins in five days, of which fifteen were gold. The coins included guineas dated from 1766 to 1782, British and Irish halfpence, some with holes drilled through them, and Spanish reales. The drilling of holes through coins is often done to cancel counterfeit coins, and is probably the purpose here; having then been rejected in <name type="place">Ireland</name>, the cancelled counterfeit halfpence were shipped out to try their luck in the <name type="place">New World</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The name of the ship, the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>,</hi> is an interesting choice. It appears to recall a phrase in a sermon by a Protestant prelate, <name type="pname">Edwin Sandys</name>, the <name type="place">Archbishop of York</name> (1516-88): "God hath made him rich, that he as a faithful <name type="pname">steward</name> might bestowe those rich blessings vpon the familie... of God."<ref target="#CH4-n20">20</ref> The phrase is a good choice, not only for the Protestant associations, but also because Archbishop Sandys's two sons, Sir <name type="pname">Edwin Sandys</name> (1561-1629) and <name type="pname">George Sandys</name> (1578-1644), helped to settle the colony of <name type="place">Virginia</name>. When <name type="pname">George Sandys</name> was in <name type="place">Virginia</name> in 1621-31, he spent the time translating Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses,</hi> which must be one of first works of classical scholarship done in what is now the <name type="place">United States</name>.</p>
            <pb n="62"/>
            <p>Unlike the Spanish treasure fleets, it was not profitable to export counterfeit halfpence as the sole or chief freight of a ship. There had to be a pre-existing, profitable trade upon which the counterfeit halfpence could piggyback. Such trades had to be two ways, because only a very profitable one-way trade can afford to have ships return in ballast. Such a two-way trade existed with northern Ireland because of the boom in flax growing and linen weaving; the <name type="place">United States</name> exported flaxseed, flour, and tobacco to <name type="place">Ireland</name> and imported linen, provisions and immigrants.</p>
            <p>Although immigrants were the most profitable freight, their destination was determined by the flax trade; in the eighteenth century, when most flaxseed was exported from the Delaware bay ports, the immigrant ships would go to <name type="place">Philadelphia, Newcastle</name>, and <name type="place">Wilmington</name>. This pattern could change if a different port offered a profitable return freight: on the last reported arrival in <name type="place">Londonderry</name> of the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>,</hi> in April 1785, she had sailed not from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, but from <name type="place">Rhode Island</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref> On the other hand the <hi rend="italic">Congress,</hi> captained by <name type="pname">M'Clenaghan</name>, which arrived at <name type="place">Londonderry</name> at the same time and may have been a sister ship of the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>,</hi> had sailed from <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After 1790, when the flaxseed trade shifted to <name type="place">New York</name>, most of the immigrant trade shifted with it. By the first years of the nineteenth century, <name type="pname">Charles W. Janson</name> claimed that much of the American trade to <name type="place">Ireland</name> was smuggling. The Americans would bring some legitimate goods: flaxseed, tobacco, and lumber, but they would chiefly smuggle in contraband, namely tea in chests, nankeens in bales, tobaccos in rolls, bandannas and other silk handkerchiefs, and spices. The return freight was immigrants.<ref target="#CH4-n23">23</ref> The most popular port to emigrate from was <name type="place">Londonderry</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <name type="place">Londonderry</name>'s linen weaving industry experienced a boom during the period 1783-1813; it declined after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The <hi rend="italic">Ordnance Survey</hi> commented, "It may indeed, be safely asserted, that, taking both into consideration, viz., the prosperity of the trading interest, and the spirit of gay and social intercourse of its principal inhabitants, the latter years of the period—were among the brightest that the City had yet enjoyed."<ref target="#CH4-n25">25</ref>

            <p>Irishmen of all faiths began emigrating to <name type="place">North America</name> in 1718; there were Catholics and Anglicans among them, but most probably were <name type="place">Presbyterians</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n26">26</ref> Before <name type="pname">R.J. Dickson's</name> 1988 study, earlier works tended to use the American War of Independence or the year 1800 as a caesura, with eighteenth century Irish immigrants being described as <name type="place">Presbyterians</name> (the "Scots-Irish") and nineteenth century Irish immigrants being described as Catholics. This distinction
<pb n="63"/>
was an attempt, generally successful, by the American descendants of Irish <name type="place">Presbyterian</name> immigrants to describe their ancestors as "colonists," and thus equal to the "WASPS," and distinct from the later Irish Catholic "immigrants." This distinction was not known to the eighteenth century immigrants themselves. It does seem as though most Irishmen in this period saw themselves as Irishmen first, and Catholics or <name type="place">Presbyterians</name> second; it was only in the nineteenth century, during the bitter debate over Catholic emancipation, that divisions between Presbyterians and Catholics deepened.<ref target="#CH4-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In this context it is important to remember that the plantation of Ulster and the plantation of <name type="place">North America</name>—the creation of Protestant commonwealths in <name type="place">Northern Ireland</name>, in <name type="place">Bermuda</name>, in <name type="place">Virginia</name>, in <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>—were simultaneous, parallel events. The <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi> gives two book titles using the word "plantation" in 1610: <hi rend="italic">A Direction for the Plantation in Ulster</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A true and sincere Declaration of the Purpose and Ends of the Plantation begun in <name type="place">Virginia</name>.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH4-n28">28</ref> The history of Ulster and the history of British <name type="place">North America</name> have been intertwined from the very beginning.</p>
            <p>Although the <name type="place">Presbyterians</name> took a prominent part of the defense of <name type="place">Londonderry</name> during its siege by <name type="pname">James II</name>, the legal settlement which followed the Glorious Revolution did not work to their benefit. The Church of <name type="place">England</name>, with an Anglican rite, became the established church in <name type="place">England</name>; the Church of <name type="place">Scotland</name>, with a <name type="place">Presbyterian</name> rite, became the established church in <name type="place">Scotland</name>; but the Church of <name type="place">Ireland</name>, the established church in <name type="place">Ireland</name>, followed the Anglican ritual. In 1689, "An Act for Exempting Their Majesties' Protestant Subjects Dissenting from the Church of <name type="place">England</name>, from the Penalties of Certain Laws," commonly known as the Toleration Act, was passed by the English Parliament; but this did not apply to Ireland, which was governed by a separate parliament. In 1704, the Irish parliament passed "An Act to Prevent the Further Growth of Popery," commonly known as the Test Act. This required holders of public offices to take the sacrament of communion in their local Anglican parish. This compelled twenty-four members (out of thirty-eight) of the Corporation of <name type="place">Londonderry</name> to resign, because they were <name type="place">Presbyterians</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n29">29</ref>

            <p>In the colonial period the rate of emigration to <name type="place">North America</name> was about three thousand a year. <name type="place">Londonderry</name> was the chief port for the Irish emigrants. In July 1729, a <name type="place">Londonderry</name> businessman reported that twenty-five ships had left the port that summer; each ship had 140 passengers on board. In 1759, three thousand people left from the ports of <name type="place">Londonderry</name> and <name type="place">Coleraine</name>. A report to the
<pb n="64"/>
Irish Customs Commissioners said that in 1772 and 1773 about six thousand emigrants had left from <name type="place">Londonderry</name>. The <hi rend="italic">Maryland Journal</hi> of October 16, 1773, said that 3,500 people had left from <name type="place">Londonderry</name> in the previous twelve months.<ref target="#CH4-n30">30</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The chief destinations for these emigrants were <name type="place">South Carolina, Nova Scotia</name>, and above all, <name type="place">Philadelphia. Pennsylvania</name> became the Scots-Irish center in <name type="place">America</name> because of its favorable geographic position. The emigrants would land at either <name type="place">Lewes</name> or <name type="place">Newcastle in Delaware</name>, or at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. In the 1770s, the cost of passage from <name type="place">Londonderry</name> to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> was three guineas (£3 and 3 shillings).<ref target="#CH4-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After the hiatus of the Revolution, emigration recommenced at once, and 1784 was a record year: over ten thousand emigrated from <name type="place">Ireland</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n32">32</ref> The cost of passage from <name type="place">Londonderry</name> to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> was £3 10 shillings in the 1780s, although it rose to £10 10 shillings by 1801.<ref target="#CH4-n33">33</ref> The conditions on the ships were terrible; <name type="pname">Charles Janson</name> observed in 1807 that "Guinea-men with slaves were never crowded like the American ships from <name type="place">Londonderry</name> to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> with Irish passengers. A small ship of 215 tons took on board five hundred and thirty passengers, who first paid the captain above 5000 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for their passage.

Furthermore, there was almost no vinegar to keep the vessel clean. <name type="pname">Robert Cunningham</name> was fined £500 <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Currency and then remanded to gaol when he failed to pay the fine.<ref target="#CH4-n35">35</ref> The poor condition of the ships may in part explain the wreck of the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>.</hi> It may also explain the questionable actions of the captain and the crew, who rescued themselves, but left the women and the children to drown.</p>
            <p>Many Federalists looked upon the influx of the Irish with great dismay.

<pb n="65"/>
the United Irishmen uprising of 1798 was largely Protestant too. Wolfe Tone, the leader of the United Irishmen rebellion, temporarily emigrated to the <name type="place">United States</name> in the 1780s. A very extreme United Irishman was Dr. <name type="pname">James Reynolds</name>, who fled from <name type="place">Belfast</name> to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in 1794. He hanged an effigy of <name type="pname">George</name> III from the yardarm and gave rum to the crew so that they might "drink the confusion of despots and the prosperity of liberty all the world over."<ref target="#CH4-n38">38</ref> The Federalists introduced a naturalization act to slow the increase in Irish voters, but the Alien and Sedition Acts failed, and the Irish voters went over en bloc to the Democratic-Republicans. <name type="pname">Philip Livingston</name> claimed that it was the poor Irish and the French in the Sixth and Seventh Ward of <name type="place">New York City</name> which enabled <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> to carry <name type="place">New York City</name>, and hence <name type="place">New York State</name>, in the presidential election of 1800.<ref target="#CH4-n39">39</ref>

               <p>Where were these coins manufactured? There is a natural tendency to ascribe any counterfeit British coin to "<name type="place">Birmingham</name>." It certainly is possible that the large number of counterfeit coppers in circulation in <name type="place">Ireland</name> in this period was made in <name type="place">Birmingham</name> and then exported via <name type="place">Liverpool</name> across the Irish Sea to <name type="place">Dublin</name> and <name type="place">Belfast</name> and <name type="place">Londonderry</name>. By 1820, <name type="place">Belfast's</name> source of hardware (namely metal products, not counterfeit coins) was <name type="place">Scotland</name>, so some of the halfpence in <name type="place">Ireland</name> could have come from there; but the main port for cross channel trade with <name type="place">Belfast</name> was <name type="place">Liverpool</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n47">47</ref> There certainly was much coastwise shipping of counterfeit halfpence. The <hi rend="italic">Daily Universal Register,</hi> which later became the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> said on October 12, 1786: "A large coinage of <hi rend="italic">halfpence</hi> has been discovered in the west of <name type="place">England</name>, on board a vessel, where that coin, amounting to 1000 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was found concealed. It is suspected to be a <hi rend="italic">consignment</hi> from the dock-yard men at <name type="place">Plymouth</name> to those of <name type="place">Bristol</name>, ingeniously <hi rend="italic">wrought</hi> out of waste copper sheathing."<ref target="#CH4-n48">48</ref>
               </p>
               <p>But <name type="place">Ireland</name>, too, had its own copper coinage manufactories. In 1790, by the best estimates, the population of <name type="place">Ireland</name> was larger than the population of the <name type="place">United States</name>. <name type="pname">Kenneth H.

<pb n="68"/>
surprising that <name type="place">Ireland</name>, densely settled with a skilled population, should be a center for manufacturing counterfeit halfpence and other coins, tokens and medals in its own right. There had to be the skills to make coins in <name type="place">Ireland</name>, or <name type="pname">James II</name> would not have been able to issue his gun money. There was a rash of issuers of tokens in <name type="place">Ireland</name> in the 1720s and 1730s—it is a parallel phenomenon with Wood's coinage controversy—and these tokens were very likely made somewhere in <name type="place">Ireland</name>. Their fabric and their style are totally unlike British coins of the day. These tokens have a dumpy fabric and they use animals as obverse coin types, with an inscription on the reverse (<ref target="#fig-25">fig. 6</ref>).<ref target="#CH4-n52">52</ref> Another Irish coin and medal manufacturer was <name type="pname">John V.

               <p>Curiously, there is a copper of the period which appears to be specifically directed toward a <name type="place">Londonderry</name> audience.

                  </hi> is also important in that it brings out that the circulation of British and Irish halfpence was commingled. Britain had sought to impose a steadily rising nominal value and inversely related falling intrinsic value on coinage as one moved from the metropolis to the periphery. Irish sterling was valued at 8 1/3% over English sterling; <name type="place">New York</name> currency was valued at 77.8% over English sterling. The distinct <name type="place">British</name> and <name type="place">Irish</name> coin types for halfpence should have kept each variety circulating within its home island, or if not that, halfpence would at least flow from <name type="place">London</name> outward. But this did not happen. By the late eighteenth century, the scarcity of regal coppers and the prevalence of counterfeits caused the exchange differential to break down so that counterfeit Irish halfpence circulated in <name type="place">Britain</name> to a small degree, counterfeit British halfpence circulated in <name type="place">Ireland</name> to a slightly larger degree, and both
<pb n="70"/>
counterfeit British and Irish halfpence circulated extensively in the <name type="place">United States</name> and what would become <name type="place">Canada</name>, with British halfpence outnumbering Irish anywhere from 3:1 to 20:1. This is clear from the evidence of hoards and excavations. <name type="place">The City of London</name> (1981) hoard contained three Irish counterfeit halfpence out of a total of 325 counterfeit halfpence, although if the exchange differential had held up properly by rights there should be no Irish halfpence in <name type="place">England</name>.<ref target="#CH4-n56">56</ref>

                  <name type="pname">Janson</name> made a basic error in supposing that English guineas could have only come over in the hands of Englishmen.

               <p>When I first began researching the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>,</hi> I thought that the shipwreck might give us some easy answers; in particular, I was hoping that there might be a 1785 counterfeit halfpence among the coins found.<ref target="#CH4-n68">68</ref> Alas, no, although I have not given up hope. As is so often the case, this research answers a few questions, but it also opens up even more questions for further research.</p>
               <pb n="73"/>
               <p>First, it shows us one method whereby the counterfeit halfpence were imported: they were brought in by immigrants, not wholly dissimilar to the drug mules of today. Secondly, it focuses our attention on <name type="place">Ireland</name>, as a center of circulation, distribution and probably manufacture of counterfeit halfpence. Thirdly, it reminds us that there was a parallel counterfeiting operation in gold alongside the better known counterfeiting operations in copper. Fourthly, there seems to have been a breakdown in the differential between British and Irish coppers, so that they circulated at par. British halfpence circulated in <name type="place">Ireland</name>, as did Irish halfpence in <name type="place">Britain</name>, and both circulated, apparently indiscriminately, in the <name type="place">United States</name> and <name type="place">Canada</name>. And finally, the <hi rend="italic">Faithful <name type="pname">Steward</name>
                  </hi> provides us with some counterfeit halfpence with a clear terminus ante quem. It was in reaction to these floods of imports that the states began to take steps to coin their own coppers.</p>
               <p>Much effort has gone into determining which coppers are "American," and which are not. This question is not as important as is usually thought. Although each of the four major copper circulating jurisdictions involved—<name type="place">Britain, Ireland</name>, the <name type="place">United States</name> and <name type="place">Canada</name>—sought at times to cut itself off from the others, the coinage systems were so similar and the trade so extensive that the copper coinage of the four areas was extensively commingled. When we study counterfeit halfpence, we are not studying separate <name type="place">U.S.</name>, British, Irish and Canadian coins, but a quadripartite system with extensive interlocks. Coppers flowed where there was a demand: to the <name type="place">United States</name> in the 1780s, to Britain during the 1790s, to <name type="place">Ireland</name> during 1800-1820 and finally to <name type="place">Canada</name>.</p>

The coins found at Mantoloking do appear to be contemporary counterfeits, not the gaming counters known as "spade guineas" with the motto "In Memory of the Good Old Days." The gaming counters bear the dates 1788 (for half guinea sized counters) and 1797 (for guinea sizes). Furthermore, the bust on the gaming counters is much cruder than the bust on the counterfeits found at Mantoloking. Both of the books by Nesmith have a photograph of the counterfeits found at Mantoloking.</p>

            <p>The NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage embodies the radiant enthusiasm of the <name type="place">United States</name> as a new nation and features the goal of liberty and justice which inspired the achievement of independence. The design and the legends were derived from the 1783 U.S. patterns arranged for the <name type="place">United States</name> by <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name> as Superintendent of Finance and developed primarily by <name type="pname">Benjamin Dudley</name> as the master craftsman.<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> The rays emanating from the Eye of Providence toward a constellation of 13 stars were adapted from the emblem designed by <name type="pname">Francis Hopkinson</name> and first used on the face of the $40 denomination of Continental Currency paper money issued pursuant to the April 11, 1778 Resolution of the Continental Congress.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref> The legend, NOVA CONSTELLATIO, was the Latin form of the words "a new constellation" used in the June 14, 1777 Resolution of the Continental Congress as to the design of the flag.</p>
            <p>Because of a lack of substantial historical data on the background of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers, the early numismatic researchers and writers steadily presented new ideas and findings in the hope of reaching sound conclusions. <name type="pname">Joseph B. Felt</name>, in 1839, mentioned the coins as did <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> and <name type="pname">Dubois</name> in 1842. <name type="pname">Charles B. Norton</name> advertised and described one in 1857. In 1858 <name type="pname">John H. Hickcox</name> described both dates of the issue. <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> and <name type="pname">DuBois</name> as well as Norton attributed the issue to <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, misinterpreting Felt. <name type="pname">Montroville W. Dickeson</name>, in 1859, listed some of their varieties, but in 1875, <name type="pname">Sylvester S. Crosby</name> presented a classification of their dies and combinations which has not been superseded.<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref>

               </head>
               <p>Initially it seems desirable to justify the use of the name NOVA CONSTELLATIO rather than CONSTELLATIO NOVA. Prior to 1973, numismatic writers, collectors and dealers routinely had used NOVA CONSTELLATIO in that word order (<name type="pname">Alexandre Vattemare</name> in 1861 being an exception).<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> Because in 1973, I had republished a short item quoting a 1786 English newspaper article which used "CONSTELLATIO NOVA,"<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> seized upon this word order and supported it in an erudite presentation.<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref> This word order change was adopted by a steady stream of others (including myself) on the assumption that it was the proper or preferred Latin adjectival placement and that the position of the eye might control the word order.<ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> My present opinion is that there is unequivocal evidence to the contrary and the change might have been an exercise in scholarly fun rather than being influenced by pedantic thinking. If Breen had been aware of all of the evidence, he probably would have changed his mind on the basis of reasons which follow.</p>

               <p>The legend NOVA CONSTELLATIO in its circular form on one side of the 1000 unit 1783 U.S. silver pattern has one rosette centered in the angular space in front of the word NOVA and after the word CONSTELLATIO, whereas a similar sized space after the word NOVA and in front of the word CONSTELLATIO is blank. This clearly shows the intended word order as NOVA CONSTELLATIO. In one variety of the 500 unit 1783 U.S. silver pattern there is an angular space of about 120 degrees in front of NOVA and after CONSTELLATIO compared to a less than 10 degree angular space after NOVA and in front of CONSTELLATIO. Just as on the 1000 unit piece there is one ornament in front of NOVA and following CONSTELLATIO and no ornament following NOVA and in front of CONSTELLATIO. In the other variety of the 500 unit silver pattern, a
<pb n="82"/>
circle of stars replace the legend NOVA CONSTELLATIO. The 100 unit piece has a similar spacing relationship of the legend to that of the first variety of the 500 unit piece but one stop or period closely follows CONSTELLATIO while another stop is directly between NOVA and CONSTELLATIO. The 5 unit 1783 U.S. copper pattern has a very large angular displacement in front of NOVA and after CONSTELLATIO and an ornament after CONSTELLATIO and before NOVA much larger that the stop in the space in front of CONSTELLATIO and after NOVA. The spacing and ornamentation on all denominations of the 1783 <name type="place">U.S.</name> patterns clearly show the word order selected was NOVA CONSTELLATIO and not CONSTELLATIO NOVA (<ref target="#fig-31">fig. 1</ref>).</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Samuel Curwen's</name> diary entry of May 15, 1784, used NOVA CONSTELLATIO to describe the 1783 <name type="place">U.S.</name> copper pattern presented to him. <name type="pname">Rathmell Wilson</name> in a May 28, 1872 letter to <name type="pname">John W. Haseltine</name> used NOVA CONSTELLATIO in describing the full provenance of the two 1783 <name type="place">U.S.</name> silver patterns he had acquired.<ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref>

               </figure>
               <p>The subsequent private coinage of copper pieces dated 1783, which generally copy the design of the 1783 U.S. patterns, confirms the NOVA CONSTELLATIO word order by having a star or quatrefoil in front of NOVA and after CONSTELLATIO or CONSTELATIO, whereas there is only a single stop or period of much smaller size following NOVA and in front of CONSTELLATIO or CONSTELATIO (<ref target="#fig-32">fig. 2</ref>). This is also true of the <name type="pname">Crosby</name> variety 1-B of that coinage dated 1785. As to the other varieties dated 1785, there is no ornamentation or punctuation between the two words. The angular
<pb n="83"/>
sweep between the two words on all such coppers dated 1783 and 1785 is more or less equal, eliminating that factor from being determinative of word order. It has been pointed out that the position of the central eye might determine the word order but that is overruled by the spacing and the ornamentation (<ref target="#fig-33">fig. 3</ref>).</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-33">
                  <graphic url="COAC11_083.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>The evidence of intended word order on the private coppers happens not to be as strongly convincing as that on the 1783 U.S. patterns, but the two groups cannot be treated differently when one is copied from the other.</p>
               <pb n="84"/>
               <p>Latin grammar allows a choice of word order.</p>
               <p>To show that the NOVA CONSTELLATIO word order was normal it is well to point out that in other American coinage of the same period, NOVA precedes the noun in the legends NOVA EBORAC and NOVA CAESAREA. NOVA EBORACA COLUMBIA is used in that order on the Brasher doubloon gold coinage. In commonly used geographical names, NOVA ANGLIA and NOVA SCOTIA reinforce NOVA as properly and commonly being the first word. If I believed in the reversed word order the title to this study might be "COMMENTARII NOVI on CONSTELLATIO NOVA."</p>

               </head>
               <p>The first known publicity concerning NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers in <name type="place">England</name> appeared in <hi rend="italic">The <name type="place">London Chronicle</name>, The Morning <name type="place">Chronicle</name> and <name type="place">London</name> Advertiser</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">The Public Advertiser</hi> for March 11-14, 1786, as follows:<ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref>
                  <q>The American Congress have lately made a copper coinage, which is now in general circulation: one side of the halfpenny bears the circular inscription, "Libertas et Justitia" round a central cypher U.S. On the reverse is a Sun rising amidst Thirteen Stars, circularly inscribed "Constellatio Nova."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This technically described those coppers dated 1785, because ET does not appear on the pieces dated 1783. An immediate contradiction of portions of the March 11-14, 1786 commentaries followed in <hi rend="italic">The Morning Chronicle and <name type="place">London</name> Advertiser</hi> for March 16, 1786:<ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref>
                  <q>A correspondent observes, that the paragraph which has lately appeared in several papers, respecting a copper coinage in <name type="place">America</name> is not true. The piece spoken of, bearing the inscription "Libertas et Justitia, &amp; C" was not made in America, nor by direction of Congress. It was coined in Birmingham, by order of a Merchant in <name type="place">New York</name>, many tons were struck from this dye, and many from another; they are now in circulation in America, as counterfeit half pence are in <name type="place">England</name>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>No further rebuttal in English newspapers seems to have occurred so that the accuracy of the corrections seems to have been accepted.</p>
               <p>The original English announcement and its contradiction raised several perplexing problems.</p>
               <p>(a) If the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers dated 1783 had been in circulation when dated or a reasonable time thereafter the
<pb n="85"/>
matter would not have been newsworthy in March 1786.</p>
               <p>(b) Two pairs of dies were recognized and since at that time only types of design rather than specific die varieties were all that were referred to, there is no indication as to whether these two types were intended to be distinguished by (1) block letters in U.S dated 1783, or script letters in US dated 1785; or (2) pointed rays or widening bifurcated (blunt) outer rays, each type of rays occurring with both dates.</p>
               <p>(c) The name of the merchant in <name type="place">New York</name> was not disclosed.</p>

            <p>OBSERVING in your last Magazine a representation of a copper, the coin of the renowned Protector, I beg leave to transmit to the public, through the same very entertaining channel, a description of a <hi rend="italic">halfpenny</hi> lately struck by the <name type="place">United States of America</name>, which, although of a late date, will, I presume, be thought no less curious, being the first of a kind I have seen in this kingdom.</p>
            <p>Considering the principles that actuated the revolt of the English colonies in America, and that which brought about the Protectorship in place of a royal government, the representations of the two coins would have been proper companions, had they met on the <hi rend="italic">same plate</hi>: but, should you favor my halfpenny with a place in your next, I shall esteem it no less fortunate to find them in the <hi rend="italic">same volume</hi> in your repository. On one side, encircled within
<pb n="86"/>
a wreath of LAUREL, exceedingly well executed, are the letters U S in cypher, surrounded with an inscription, LIBERTAS ET JUSTITIA; date 1785. On the reverse, in the center, is a CONSTELLATION, from which issue THIRTEEN illuminated RAYS and between each ray is a small STAR, expressive of the THIRTEEN UNITED STATES; round these rays and the stars is the following inscription: NOVA CONSTELLATIO. The new American halfpenny is in weight as three to two of the English coin.</p>
            <p>The <name type="place">United States</name>, as appears by the inscription on the front of their coin, have erected the standard of liberty and justice. But, from what we have lately heard concerning American politics, both one and the other, I fear, are known only by name throughout that vast, and once flourishing, continent.</p>

               </head>
               <p>During the year 1785, and prior thereto, no American newspaper or other reports relating to NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage have been located. The earliest publicity in <name type="place">America</name> made reference to, but did not mention, NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers by name. It is dated March 13, 1786, and emanated as news in <name type="place">Worcester</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>. It was on the subject of counterfeit halfpence and the need for <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> to authorize its own copper coin. It stated that <name type="place">New York</name>, <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name> had authorized copper coinage and "numbers of them are now in circulation; they are in general well made, and of good copper, those of <name type="place">New York</name> in particular."<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref> Since there was no coinage officially authorized by <name type="place">New York</name>, this comment must have been referring to NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers which were superior in quality to those of <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name>. There was no copper coinage relating to <name type="place">New York</name> in circulation in 1786, or prior thereto, the rare 1786 NEO-EBORACENSIS copper being struck as a trial in too small a quantity to have been put into general circulation.</p>
               <p>The use of the expression "now in circulation" indicated a recent introduction and that is corroborated for <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name> in late 1785 by their first dates of mintage. The so-called <name type="place">New York</name> coppers would not have been included with <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers if the <name type="place">New York</name> coppers had not been introduced at about the same time. This is additional evidence that NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers first appeared in general circulation in late 1785 and coincides with the date of the first English publicity.</p>
               <pb n="88"/>
               <p>All subsequent American reports on the NOVA CONSTELLATIO subject during 1786 are directly or indirectly based upon the English newspaper articles previously quoted and none are from information originally gathered in <name type="place">America</name>. Each such rehash of English news resulted in several literal errors. These American articles began about two months after the first of the English news reports, a period sufficient for the English newspapers to reach the American press. The apparent errors consisted of substituting <name type="place">Greenwich</name> for <name type="place">Birmingham</name> as the source of the coppers and substituting "forty tons" for "many tons" as to the amount of coinage from one die pair.</p>

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Daily Advertiser</hi> of <name type="place">New York</name>, on May 26, 1786, then copied the corrected English news of March 16, 1786, naming <name type="place">Birmingham</name> as the source and "many tons" as the amount of coinage.</p>
               <p>There probably are more news articles on the subject to be found in the American press, but the above group fully demonstrates some
<pb n="89"/>
carelessness. Not only did American newspapers copy the English press with no investigation, but they copied one another in <name type="place">America</name> in the same manner, and were sometimes unaware of what they had previously printed.</p>
               <p>They left intact the corrected English news source of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage. They also indicated the coins were something new and therefore newsworthy.</p>
               <p>It has been pointed out by <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> and by <name type="pname">Philip L. Mossman</name> that 40 tons of copper coin from one pair of dies would be over 5,000,000 pieces, an impossible feat. Was this to stimulate reader-ship by asserting that there was a large specific weight of coppers rather than "many tons?" In the <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi>, the second definition of the word "forty" is "Used indefinitely to express a large number." As an example of such use, <name type="pname">Shakespeare's</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> (Act III, Scene i, lines 243-44) is cited in which Coriolanus is bragging about his fighting ability by saying "On faire ground I could beat fortie of them." In American colloquial usage the expression "like forty" is cited as meaning "with immense force or vigor" or "like anything." A quotation from <name type="pname">Harriet Beecher Stowe's</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> (1852) reads, "I has principles and I sticks to them like forty." These prominent usages show that "forty" is not always used as a specific number but can be used as a substantial indefinite amount. The American newspapers were apparently using such a slang meaning.</p>
               <p>It is surprising that all specific American comment on the NOVA CONSTELLATIO coinage took place during the month of May 1786, and then seems to have been forgotten. The next mention of the coin in print in <name type="place">America</name> seems to have occurred in 1789, when <name type="pname">John Beale Bordley</name> of <name type="place">Maryland</name> proposed a new coinage system for the <name type="place">United States</name> and in describing what had been in circulation included the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO copper coin under the name "<name type="place">U.S.</name>" and gave its weight as 145 grains.<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> The part of that coinage dated 1785 was not mentioned as date differences were not then considered of sufficient importance.</p>

               <p>In 1995, <name type="pname">Mike Ringo</name> presented his discovery that certain identical number and letter punches were used in preparation of the dies for <name type="pname">Crosby</name> variety 1-A of the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers, for the 1783 GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO copper (<ref target="#fig-36">fig. 6</ref>) and for some English and Irish counterfeit halfpence.<ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref> This is particularly evident in the deformed 3 in the date of the two first mentioned pieces. He also shows that stylistically some of these coins
<pb n="90"/>
have similar features. There is virtually no possibility that the dies for the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coppers would have been prepared in <name type="place">America</name> because pieces of satirical coinage in the category of evasion halfpence which were extensively produced in <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place">Ireland</name> with humorous and unofficial legends had no American <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre.</hi>

               </figure>
               <p>Some difference of opinion has existed as to what message the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coppers were intended to convey. It is obvious that the 1783 date corresponds with the date of the Treaty of <name type="place">Paris</name> ending the American Revolution but it was then an amusing and obvious <hi rend="italic">double entendre</hi> to be vague in indicating which <name type="pname">George won</name>, <name type="pname">George</name>
                  <name type="place">Washington</name> or <name type="pname">George III</name>. The reverse device is also deliberately ambiguous. The enclosure of 13 vertical bars is intended to be subtle with the <hi rend="italic">fleur de lys</hi> on each of the four corners of the enclosure. This design represents the 13 former English colonies and the assistance the French gave to the <name type="place">United States</name> during the American Revolution. Behind the enclosure is a female figure with a sprig in one hand and a staff in the other. If it were a figure of free <name type="place">America</name> there should be a liberty cap on the top of the staff and if a representation of Britannia a trident on top of the staff. The top end of the staff has a slight bulge leaving a choice as to whether the enclosure is protecting a figure of free <name type="place">America</name> or is restraining Britannia.</p>
               <p>The interrelationship of the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coinage and the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage is important evidence of the English production of both coinages. If the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coinage is of English manufacture then this is another reason not to challenge the English source of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage since some of their characteristics are the same.</p>
               <p>The GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coppers were said to have circulated first in <name type="place">Georgia</name>, then <name type="place">Virginia</name>, next in <name type="place">Jamaica</name> and later in <name type="place">Florida</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref> No factual support for these comments has been found
<pb n="91"/>
for their first promulgation and, therefore, they should not be accepted without further justification.</p>
               <p>It is of interest to note that the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coinage spells its motto VOCE POPOLI in Italianate style instead of using VOCE POPULI which is more appropriately spelled on the 1760 Irish halfpenny tokens. Similarly by error an L is omitted in CONSTELATIO in the 1783 obverse variety 3, such die being reused on the 1785 obverse variety 1.</p>
               <p>The date 1783 on the GEORGIVS TRIUMPHO coins appears to be used to correlate with the legends and devices rather than be the date of their production and circulation just as the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers dated 1783 appears to be copied from the 1783 U.S. patterns rather than be the date of their production and circulation.</p>

               </head>
               <p>When variety 1-A of NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers is compared to other 1783 varieties it can be noted that variety 1-A is independent in punches and in quality of workmanship. There is a major die defect in the NOVA CONSTELLATIO obverse variety 1, there being a large raised line running under TI and into the adjacent O and having small dentils extending from one side of it. Of the many examples of this coin which are known, all have this defect. It appears to have been caused by a hardened gang punch for small dentils having fallen accidentally on an unhardened completed NOVA die. The resulting shape of the defect is not curved sufficiently to have been caused by a gang punch usable for the die on which it fell, but the punch seems to have been made for some larger coin or medal.</p>
               <p>The NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage other than 1783 variety 1-A is of superior die and planchet quality. This improvement indicates a change of artisans and may have been demanded by the purchasers or by happenstance. This could have easily occurred in <name type="place">Birmingham</name> where many diesinkers were at work. The past assertions that <name type="pname">Thomas Wyon</name> or a member of that highly skilled Wyon family working in <name type="place">Birmingham</name> was responsible for the improvement seems justified but so far is without the extent of proof which researchers seek.</p>
               <p>In 1965, <name type="pname">Robert A. Vlack</name> stated that the <name type="pname">Thomas Wyon</name> attribution was valid because identical letter punches were used on other British made dies known to be cut by <name type="pname">Thomas Wyon</name> for American coppers with various other legends and dated 1785, 1786 or without date. Bushnell merely uses the name <name type="pname">Wyon</name>. <name type="pname">Crosby</name> credits <name type="pname">Thomas</name>

               <p>In what he calls "An Exercise in Fact and Supposition," <name type="pname">Everett T.

He also alleges that the reverse of the 1785 <name type="place">Vermont</name> copper coinage and the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers had "almost identical device punches," a self destructive comment. While die punches might have been brought from <name type="place">England</name> to <name type="place">America</name> this statement was the result of wishful thinking arising from an effort to Americanize the production of the latter coinage.<ref target="#CH5-n19">19</ref> Unfortunately, supposition was apparently favored over fact in these situations.</p>

                  <name type="place">Vermont</name> copper coinage also furnishes evidence relating to the period when the first NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage was brought from <name type="place">England</name> to <name type="place">America</name>. <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers were originally authorized on June 15, 1785, but the legislation was modified on October 27, 1785, to reduce the weight of copper content (<ref target="#fig-37">fig. 7</ref>). The first <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers were struck with the lower weight standard. That coinage did not take place until after October 27, 1785, but the first dies could have been prepared at any time after the original June authorization. The <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers commenced with Green Mountain obverses, three varieties dated 1785, followed by another three dated 1786. The reverse dies featured <name type="place">Vermont</name>'s desire to be recognized as the fourteenth state, using "STELLA. QUARTA. DECIMA." in that order as shown by the placement of stops between the words on the reverses of coppers dated 1785 (not 1786). The device had the Eye of Providence with 13 sets of rays and 13 stars, but it might have been better promotion for
<pb n="93"/>

It is important to note that the three reverses of the 1785 <name type="place">Vermont</name> Green Mountain coppers (<name type="place">Bressett</name> A, B, and C) have widening bifurcated rays and the two reverses of the 1786 <name type="place">Vermont</name> Green Mountain coppers (<name type="place">Bressett</name> D and E) have pointed rays (<ref target="#fig-38">fig. 8</ref>). There were no widening bifurcated or blunt rays on the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO U.S. patterns prepared by Benjamin Dudley, only pointed rays, and, therefore, the <name type="place">Dudley</name> patterns could not have influenced the first <name type="place">Vermont</name> reverse designs unless there were abandoned alternate <name type="place">Dudley</name> drawings (no drawing of any design is known).</p>

               <p>The widening bifurcated long rays on the three reverses of the 1785 <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers are similar to the widening bifurcated long rays on obverse 3 of the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers (identical to obverse 1 of the 1785 NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers). A major difference between them however is that the three reverses of the 1785 <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers have 13 short bifurcated rays whereas the obverse of 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO variety 3 has 26 short separated linear rays.</p>
               <p>The chronology of the use of the widening rays on the first <name type="place">Vermont</name> coinage makes it reasonable to conclude that William Coley of <name type="place">New York</name>, the first <name type="place">Vermont</name> diesinker, saw an example of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage with widening bifurcated rays before making the 1785 <name type="place">Vermont</name> dies rather than vice versa. This must have occurred in the latter part of the year 1785, a time frame which coordinates with the March 1786 English newspaper accounts of the appearance of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage in <name type="place">America</name> and which takes into account the normal delays of a personal trip or sending mail or dispatches by trans-Atlantic shipping to <name type="place">England</name>. It follows that the pointed ray design on the 1786 <name type="place">Vermont</name> Green Mountain coppers was copied from one of the 1783 or 1785 NOVA CONSTELLATIO pieces with a pointed ray design.<ref target="#CH5-n20">20</ref>

               <p>As to how the examples of or designs for NOVA CONSTELLATIO coins came to <name type="place">England</name> in time to be copied for the private production of those coppers, one need only realize that at least three of the 1783 NOVA CONSTELLATIO <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name> patterns did actually go to Britain. The 5 unit 1783 copper pattern was described in an entry on May 15, 1784, in the diary of <name type="pname">Samuel Curwen</name> (originally from <name type="place">Salem</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>) who as a sincere Tory was living in <name type="place">England</name> and was presented with the coin by "a young <name type="pname">Bartlet</name> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]," a merchant from <name type="place">Salem</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>, who had just come from <name type="place">America</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n21">21</ref> Whether the messenger was a relative of <name type="pname">Josiah Bartlett</name>, a signer of the Declaration of Independence for New Hampshire and a dedicated and politically powerful patriot, is not ascertained. <name type="pname">Josiah Bartlett</name> was in <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> at the time.</p>
               <p>One of the two 100 unit 1783 U.S. patterns with a decorated edge first appeared in a Scottish auction in 1884, and was previously unpublished and new to numismatists. It had been found in a <name type="place">London</name> pawn shop. The 100 unit 1783 U.S. pattern with a plain edge surfaced as part of the <name type="pname">John G. Murdoch</name> collection when it was auctioned by <name type="pname">Sotheby</name> in <name type="place">England</name> in 1903, and was previously unpublished and unknown to American numismatists.<ref target="#CH5-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The three above described 1783 U.S. patterns which first appeared in Britain after being struck in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> had not remained with the 500 unit and 1000 unit patterns which the family of Charles Thomson, the first Secretary of the Continental Congress, had retained and which came into the numismatic market in 1872 through <name type="pname">John W. Haseltine</name>. <name type="pname">Crosby</name>, in 1875, knew that a 5 unit U.S. pattern had existed and that a 100 unit U.S. pattern probably existed, but had no information on any of the three 100 unit pieces.</p>
               <p>Thus a decorated edge 100 unit U.S. pattern and the plain edge 100 unit U.S. pattern could easily have been sent to <name type="place">England</name> by <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name> or by anyone to whom he had given their possession. These and the 5 unit piece were the lowest denominations in the pattern series and thus were of insignificant intrinsic value and importance. There seemed to be no effort for the ownership of the

1783 U.S. patterns to be retained by the <name type="place">United States</name> as <name type="pname">Charles Thomson</name> and his heirs handled the 500 and 1000 unit pieces as personal belongings without concern or challenge. The period when the 100 unit pieces could have been sent to <name type="place">England</name> could easily have been more or less contemporary with the sending of the 5 unit piece to Curwen in 1784.</p>

               <p>The 1785 IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> coinage is tied into the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage and is helpful in showing the English source of the private coinage as well as reinforcing the conclusion that the 1783 dated NOVA CONSTELLATIO pieces were produced in 1785 (<ref target="#fig-39">fig. 9</ref>). Three varieties of NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage obverse dies were used in combination with the known IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> die (<name type="pname">Crosby</name> obverses 2 and 3 of 1783 and obverse 3 of 1785) for experimental copper coinage and not made for production purposes.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>On the known 1785 IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> die (referred to by <name type="pname">Crosby</name> as the reverse), the graceful seated female figure of an independent <name type="place">Columbia</name> or free <name type="place">America</name> holding a flag is a very skillfully cut device and carries out the same symbolism as the LIBERTAS JUSTITIA legends on the private copper reverses. To convey the idea of LIBERTAS, there is substituted a liberty cap at the top of the flag staff and for JUSTITIA, there is substituted an equal arm balance held in the left hand of the female figure. The dies for NOVA CONSTELLATIO pieces with the LIBERTAS JUSTITIA reverses must have been cut prior to the pieces with the known IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> reverse because the former were copies of the 1783 U.S. patterns and the latter were not. Apparently the IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> pieces were made with the hope of obtaining a coining contract from the <name type="place">United States</name>. The known IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> die was brought or sent to the <name type="place">United States</name> about 1787 and was used at Machin's Mills
<pb n="96"/>
in combination with an American made counterfeit British halfpenny as well as a crude <name type="place">Vermont</name> obverse die. These resultant copper coins were poorly struck, perhaps deliberately to avoid simple recognition.</p>
               <p>The superb quality of the known IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> reverse die was far beyond the skill of any American diecutter and thus was obviously of English production as the only alternative. Being used in coinage combination with some NOVA CONSTELLATIO obverses, one must conclude that the cutting of those NOVA obverses was also done in <name type="place">England</name>.<ref target="#CH5-n23">23</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Crosby</name> felt so strongly about it that he attributed that die work to <name type="pname">Thomas Wyon</name>.</p>
               <p>Heretofore only one IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> die has been recognized in genuine IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> coinage. In investigating that coinage for its NOVA CONSTELLATIO relationship, it was observed that another genuine IMMUNE <name type="place">COLUMBIA</name> die had also been used. One of those uses was in combination with a genuine NOVA CONSTELLATIO die which was also heretofore unrecognized. The differences between each of these two newly recognized dies, and the dies similar to them, are set out in Appendix 1, along with the characteristics of the false dies attributed to Dr. <name type="pname">Francis S. Edwards</name>.</p>
               <p>The newly recognized genuine NOVA CONSTELLATIO die has not been observed in combination with any LIBERTAS JUSTITIA or LIBERTAS ET JUSTITIA reverse die.</p>
               <p>The existence of two genuine IMMUNE COLUMBIA dies and the existence of a new NOVA CONSTELLATIO die seems to require a restudy of all such strikings in copper, silver and gold, whether over host coins or not, whether with or without decorated edges, and including casts, electrotypes, forgeries made from cut dies, forgeries made from dies created by transfer from genuine or false coins, or a combination of both. Hopefully this research will soon be undertaken.<ref target="#CH5-n24">24</ref>

               <p>The fact that <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name> was neither a merchant nor in <name type="place">New York</name> has been clearly pointed out.<ref target="#CH5-n26">26</ref>

(1752-1816) was a well educated descendant of an aristocratic seventeenth century American family which had built and lived in a mansion house named <name type="place">"Morrisiana"</name> on the north shore of the junction of the <name type="place">Harlem</name> and East Rivers in what now is the Borough of the Bronx in the City of <name type="place">New York</name>. <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name> was devoted to the cause of independence and served as a representative of <name type="place">New York</name> to the Continental Congress (1777-79) in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, where he remained to practice law. In February 1780, he wrote and had published in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, a series of essays on finance. When <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name> became Superintendent of Finance of the <name type="place">United States</name> from 1781 through 1784, <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name> became his assistant and was the ghost writer of the January 15, 1782 coinage report of <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name>. <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name> was listed in the first <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> city directory of 1785, as living on Market Street, between Second and Third, and at no time from 1783 through 1785, was he living in <name type="place">New York</name>. He even represented the State of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> in the <name type="place">United States</name> Constitutional Convention of 1787, and participated in the debates. He was known primarily as a public servant, an economist, and a lawyer but never as a merchant.</p>

He developed a desire to buy <name type="place">Morrisiana</name> and return to <name type="place">New York</name>, but having insufficient funds to do so, he undertook to negotiate a loan for a down payment from <name type="pname">James McComb</name> of <name type="place">New York</name>, who was a business partner of <name type="pname">William Edgar</name>. <name type="pname">Edgar</name> and <name type="pname">William Constable</name>, both friends of Gouverneur <name type="pname">Morris</name>, had married sisters. Gouverneur <name type="pname">Morris</name> completed the purchase of <name type="place">Morrisiana</name> from his brother, Staats Long <name type="pname">Morris</name>, subject to a mortgage, on April 4, 1787, and moved to <name type="place">New York</name>.

               <p>After NOVA CONSTELLATIO coins, along with other halfpence size coppers, had lost their normal circulating value beginning in the middle of 1787, several varieties of NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers were used as planchets or as host coins for <name type="place">Vermont</name>, <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coinage dated 1787 and 1788. Such use has been extensively detailed in <name type="pname">Philip L. Mossman's</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">Money of the American Colonies and Confederation.</hi> It is curious to note that <name type="pname">John H. Hickcox</name>, writing in 1858, stated as to the NOVA CONSTELLATIO

pieces dated 1783, "they were frequently struck over other coppers," when he apparently intended to say exactly the opposite.</p>

               <list rend="inline">
                  <item n="(A)">NOVA CONSTELLATIO is the correct name of both the 1783 U.S. Patterns and the private copper coinage, and not CONSTELLATIO NOVA.</item>
                  <item n="(B)">One or more examples of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO 1783 U.S. patterns (probably not a drawing of one) was sent to <name type="place">England</name> for copying. This occurred in late 1784 or the early part of 1785, after the North American mint project was abandoned.</item>
                  <item n="(C)">The NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage was minted in <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, <name type="place">England</name> and not Greenwich, <name type="place">England</name>, or elsewhere.</item>
                  <item n="(D)">NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage dated 1783 was not coined or circulated in 1783 or 1784. No one would strike copper coinage in 1783 or 1784 and hold it for distribution until late 1785.</item>
                  <item n="(E)">The date 1783 on the first NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage was copied from a pattern coin submitted to the <name type="place">Birmingham</name> diesinkers rather than using the current date of 1785 when the dies were cut.</item>
                  <item n="(F)">The amount of NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers coined was "many tons" but can be only roughly estimated now from average die life, host coin use and survivorsrhip of examples.</item>
                  <item n="(G)">The NOVA CONSTELLATIO 1783 die variety 1-A is the work of a different diesinker and coiner than other such coinage dated 1783 and all 1785 dated coinage.</item>
                  <item n="(H)">The NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage dated 1783 was struck by the middle of 1785 and the coinage dated 1785 followed in due course as production continued. Mossman shows that planchet weight deviation for 1783 dated coinage was reduced by the time the 1785 dated coinage was prepared.</item>
                  <item n="(I)">The first publicity of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage circulating in <name type="place">America</name> took place in <name type="place">England</name> on March 11-14, 1786, and was a fresh news dispatch, letter or personal delivery from America, having taken normal winter trans-Atlantic shipping time before arrival.</item>
                  <item n="(J)">The inclusion in the English article concerning the alleged authorization by the American Congress of the NOVA CONSTELLATIO copper coinage was immediately corrected by someone in <name type="place">England</name> who was very familiar with the English source of the private coinage.</item>
                  <pb n="102"/>
                  <item n="(K)">The American publicity on NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage in May 1786, only attempted to repeat the English publicity of March 1786, introducing inaccuracies and adding nothing pertinent.</item>
                  <item n="(L)">The timing of English publicity on NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage showed that it was in American circulation in reasonable quantity in late 1785.</item>
                  <item n="(M)">The <name type="place">Vermont</name> copper coinage reverses on pieces dated 1785 were substantially copied about October 1785 from NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage (1783 3-C and 1785 1-B) brought or shipped to <name type="place">New York</name> at that time. The <name type="place">Vermont</name> reverses on Green Mountain pieces dated 1786 were copied a few months later from other NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coinage.</item>
                  <item n="(N)">The <name type="place">New York</name> merchant best qualified to be the person who ordered the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private copper coinage was <name type="pname">William Constable</name> of <name type="place">New York</name> City,<ref target="#CH5-n28">28</ref> the principal operating executive of the firm of <name type="pname">Constable</name>, <name type="pname">Rucker</name> and Co. in which <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name> and <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name> were partners, each having a 25% ownership interest.</item>
                  <item n="(O)">The belief of <name type="pname">Charles I. Bushnell</name> that <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name> was the merchant or gentleman who ordered the NOVA CONSTELLATIO private coppers was unreliable because <name type="pname">Bushnell</name> was unaware that <name type="pname">Gouverneur Morris</name> had any fractional beneficial interest in the operations of <name type="pname">Constable Rucker</name> &amp; Co.</item>
                  <item n="(P)">The 1786 NOVA CONSTELLATIO coinage was the work of a much inferior diesinker and coiner than the pieces dated 1785, leading to the belief that such 1786 coinage was either anticipating an order as part of the private coinage enterprise or was prepared for an unauthorized or counterfeit issue.</item>

                  <name type="place">Vermont</name>, as an independent republic, issued copper coins during a period when the <name type="place">United States</name> were struggling without a Federal coinage. <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers predate the much needed state coppers produced before the establishment of an American Federal mint. Several excellent references on <name type="place">Vermont</name> copper coins have been previously published. This paper will not duplicate die variety descriptions found in other sources but will instead attempt to place these coins in their proper historical context. The iconography of the designs will be discussed to learn what message the coins made or attempted to make. In the end, the coinage lost the meaning implied by the inscriptions.</p>

               <p>On July 4, 1609, the French explorer, <name type="pname">Samuel de Champlain</name> ("the father of New France"), discovered the lake that was named for him. On July 30, he fought the <name type="place">Iroquois</name>, the first of many battles for control of the waterway. The lake and the <name type="place">Hudson River</name> formed part of an important water transportation corridor between <name type="place">New York</name> City, with its harbor on the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>, and <name type="place">Montreal</name> on the <name type="place">St. Lawrence River</name>. Forts were established along this route at <name type="place">Ticonderoga</name> and <name type="place">Crown Point</name>. To the west stretched the <name type="place">Adirondack Mountains</name>. The land to the east of this route was dominated by the Green Mountain, named <hi rend="italic">Vert Mont</hi> in French. The name of the area became <name type="place">Vermont</name>. The Crown Point military road crossed <name type="place">Vermont</name> between <name type="place">Charlestown</name>, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>, and <name type="place">Crown Point</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>.</p>
               <p>The eastern side of the Green Mountains drains south down the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> River. The western watershed flows north by Otter Creek and Lake Champlain down the Richeleau River to the St. Lawrence. A small area in the southwest corner slopes south down the Hudson River. The typography, somewhat like the population, was pulled in several directions.</p>
               <p>Control of Lake Champlain was an important military objective during the French and Indian Wars. On July 8, 1758, the French defeated a larger British force at Fort Ticonderoga. A year later, on July 26, 1759, the British won control of the lake. The city of Montreal fell to British troops under Lord Jeffrey Amherst on September 8, 1760. With a sense of security, settlers began to move into the territory now known as <name type="place">Vermont</name>. The royal governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth, made 131 land grants between 1749 and 1763, known as the <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Grants.</p>

                  <name type="place">New York</name> claimed the same area which they granted to others. <name type="place">New York</name> ceded large tracts to wealthy owners who leased parcels to tenant farmers. The <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> model, typical of New <name type="place">England</name>, favored small farms operated by resident owners. The land dispute was presented to King <name type="pname">George III</name> who recognized the <name type="place">New York</name> claims in 1764 and ordered holders of <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Grants to surrender their lands or pay <name type="place">New York</name>. In 1770, the <name type="place">New York</name> Supreme Court invalidated all <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Grants.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Ethan Allen</name> and his brothers had speculated heavily in lands in the eastern Champlain valley and by 1772 they owned 77,000 acres. The Green Mountain Boys were organized under the leadership of <name type="pname">Ethan Allen</name> to resist <name type="place">New York</name> authority. The Green Mountain Boys destroyed or confiscated property, administered whippings, and sent the victims back to <name type="place">New York</name>. The Yankees considered them to be patriots while the Yorkers called them outlaws. The actions of the Green Mountain Boys were more symbolic than military victories. No armed force from <name type="place">New York</name> was ever sent against them and no lives were lost. Any action was generally taken against individual sheriffs, surveyors, and justices of the peace by large groups of armed men where resistance would have been futile. The land holders successfully defended their claims against the agents of the <name type="place">New York</name> landlords.</p>
               <p>The Champlain basin was on the Quebec side of the Proclamation Line of October 7, 1763, the boundary that separated the American colonies from <name type="place">Canada</name> and forbade settlement west of the Appalachians. The trade routes from the <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Grants led to <name type="place">Quebec</name> and the <name type="place">St. Lawrence River</name> and thus the area had a stronger allegiance to <name type="place">Quebec</name> than to <name type="place">New York</name>.</p>
               <p>At the time, the residents of <name type="place">New York</name> outnumbered the settlers in <name type="place">Vermont</name> by about four to one. <name type="place">New York</name>, which had greater economic power and the strength of law, considered the use of force against <name type="place">Vermont</name> but this was more talk than action. They were generally apathetic about the <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Grants whose residents were tenacious in defense of their claims. What they lacked in numbers, they possessed in spirit.</p>

               </head>
               <p>By 1775, there was growing colonial resistance to the authority of <name type="place">England</name>. The British General, <name type="pname">Thomas Gates</name>, who was ordered into <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> to capture colonial military supplies stored at Concord, was met by the colonial militia at the Battle of <name type="place">Lexington</name> fought on April 19, 1775. It was the opening engagement of the American Revolution.</p>
               <pb n="119"/>
               <p>Ethan Allen received instructions from <name type="place">Connecticut</name> to lead the Green Mountain Boys against Fort Ticonderoga. Benedict Arnold was commissioned as a colonel by <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> for the same purpose of raising a regiment to take the fort. Allen, although without a military commission, had willing troops under his command, while Arnold, who had a commission, arrived in the area without troops. The two vied for leadership and reached a compromise of necessity. On May 10, 1775, 83 Americans under the joint leadership of Allen and Arnold demanded the surrender of the 45-man garrison of British troops at Fort Ticonderoga, much of which burned in 1773, and had been all but abandoned. The fort was taken without a shot being fired. The next day colonial troops under Seth Warner captured another weak objective at Crown Point. Arnold took Fort St. <name type="pname">John</name> on May 18. It was the first offensive campaign of the Revolutionary War and opened the way for an American expedition against Montreal.</p>
               <p>The Champlain valley fell under the control of the Allens in the name of the Continental Congress. Two hundred British cannon, captured along with other crucial military supplies, were dragged across <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> to be used by Washington in the siege of <name type="place">Boston</name> against the forces of British General William Howe. That victory was recognized with the first medal authorized by the Continental Congress. Allen hoped that the Continental Congress would also recognize an obligation and support the <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Grants in their dispute with <name type="place">New York</name>.</p>
               <p>Ethan Allen participated in the American expedition against Montreal. The strategy was for <name type="pname">Allen</name> and <name type="pname">Colonel John Brown</name> to land on the island before dawn and attack Montreal from opposite sides. Brown failed to land his troops and the unsupported Allen, unable to retreat across the river in daylight, was easily defeated. He was captured on September 25, 1775, and sent to <name type="place">England</name> in chains. After two years, he was returned to <name type="place">America</name> in a prisoner exchange. The Americans eventually captured Montreal in November 1775, but the offensive stalled at Quebec. Montreal was recaptured by the British in July 1776.</p>
               <p>Thirteen American colonies declared their independence on July 4, 1776. <name type="place">Vermont</name> was not among them. <name type="place">New York</name> still claimed land as far east as the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> River, while <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> claimed the land from a line 20 miles east of the Hudson River. These two claims overlapped to include the area that became <name type="place">Vermont</name>.</p>
               <p>The British strategy for the northern campaign was to split the New <name type="place">England</name> states from the rest of the country. Once New <name type="place">England</name> was brought into submission, the southern states would follow.
<pb n="120"/>
                  <name type="pname">General William</name> Howe attacked <name type="place">New York</name> on August 27, 1776, but his intended drive north to <name type="place">Albany</name> was thwarted by strong resistance from the troops of General <name type="place">Washington</name>.</p>
               <p>General <name type="pname">John Burgoyne's</name> expedition with 9,000 troops marched from Montreal to meet Howe in Albany. His troops retook Fort Ticonderoga, July 5, 1777, and marched south. A rear guard action, fought at Hubbardton on July 7, 1777, was the only battle in what is now <name type="place">Vermont</name>. The British won the battle but the colonists were granted time to regroup. German mercenaries under <name type="pname">Colonel Fredrich Baum</name> marched to <name type="place">Bennington</name>, <name type="place">Vermont</name>, on a foraging expedition. They were met by American troops near <name type="place">Bennington</name> where they were defeated by <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> militia under Seth Warner, August 16. Although this took place about four miles west of the present border of <name type="place">Vermont</name>, it is considered a <name type="place">Vermont</name> battle and is commemorated by monuments in <name type="place">Vermont</name>. For the 1927 Sesquicentennial of the event, a commemorative half dollar was struck honoring Ira Allen on the obverse and the battle of <name type="place">Bennington</name> on the reverse. August 16 is a legal holiday as <name type="place">Vermont</name> honors <name type="place">Bennington</name> Battle Day. The state clearly claims the battle beyond its border.</p>
               <p>The weakened forces of Burgoyne ran into those of General <name type="pname">Horatio Gates</name> in battles at Freeman's Farm and Bemis Heights. Rather than moving north to support Burgoyne, General Howe withdrew from <name type="place">New York</name> and relocated to the Chesapeake Bay region near Yorktown. Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga October 17, 1777. The northern offensive failed and the loss of a British army was a severe blow. This increased confidence in the American cause brought France into the war officially in June 1778.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Vermont</name> was not threatened again during the Revolution. One reason may have been the lack of military objectives while another was the negotiations and diplomacy of <name type="place">Vermont</name> leaders.</p>

               <p>At the <name type="place">Westminister</name> Convention, on January 15, 1777, the citizens of the disputed territory declared their independence and named the republic New <name type="place">Connecticut</name>. Pinched between <name type="place">New York</name> and New Hampshire, they may have believed that "New" was a requirement for their state name. The Windsor Convention, held between July 2 and 8, 1777, wrote the constitution and renamed the republic <name type="place">Vermont</name>. The new Constitution granted the vote to all male citizens and forbade slavery.</p>
               <p>There had been previous boundary disputes between <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">New York</name>, <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place">New York</name>, and <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> and New Hampshire.</p>

               <p>Residents of the <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Grants had divided loyalties. A majority had moved to the area from <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and strongly identified with that state to the south. Those who had paid <name type="pname">Governor Wentworth</name> for land supported the claims of authority made by <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> to the east. Many Americans who remained loyal to the British during the Revolution, would have identified with the government of the neighbor to the north. Almost no one favored the authority of <name type="place">New York</name>, to the west, although that state had the strongest legal claim. While being torn in all directions, perhaps independence was the inevitable choice.</p>
               <p>American independence was not secured by the Declaration of Independence but had to be defended in battle, verified by a treaty with <name type="place">England</name> and consolidated under a written Constitution. In much the same way, the sovereignty of <name type="place">Vermont</name> only started with the declaration of independence. They fought for that independence against the British and the authority of <name type="place">New York</name>. They produced a written constitution and governed under its provisions. <name type="place">Vermont</name> was aggressive in expanding territory under its control, annexing towns across their borders with both <name type="place">New York</name> and New Hampshire.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Vermont</name> bills of credit, issued in 1781, featured a design showing a chain with thirteen links and a fourteenth unconnected link, symbolic of the proximity to, but lack of, connection to the Union. Other attempts to authorize paper money failed to get the approval of the <name type="place">Vermont</name> Assembly. Much trade was conducted by barter and attempts were made to establish a cash value for various commodities. In the conduct of business, the monetary standard used was frequently based on the value of a bushel of wheat.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Thomas Chittenden</name>, involved with the organizing conventions, was elected first governor in 1778. He lost the election in 1789 to <name type="pname">Moses Robinson</name> but was returned to office in 1790, where he served until 1797.</p>
               <p>Ethan Allen, with the support of his brothers Ira and <name type="pname">Levi</name>, and <name type="pname">Thomas Chittenden</name>, entered negotiations with Great Britain. The publicly stated reason was to mediate a prisoner exchange but these controversial Haldimond negotiations also involved the prospect of British recognition of <name type="place">Vermont</name> and acceptance of <name type="place">Vermont</name> as a British province.</p>
               <p>If <name type="place">Vermont</name> had been one of the American states, such contact with the enemy would have been treason, but as an independent republic, they had the right to negotiate an independent peace. The Haldimond negotiations may have been an attempt to pressure the <name type="place">United States</name> to recognize <name type="place">Vermont</name>.</p>
               <pb n="123"/>
               <p>One of the most active industries in the republic was the practice of law. The government and its people were frequently plagued with lawsuits over property rights and the collection of debts such that the desire to "kill all the lawyers" had popular support. In 1786, the self styled "Regulators" attempted to disrupt the conduct of the courts and took over a courthouse in <name type="place">Rutland</name>. The rioters were repulsed by hastily mobilized government troops.</p>
               <p>In 1787, <name type="pname">Alexander Hamilton</name> introduced a bill in the <name type="place">New York</name> Assembly to recognize the independence of <name type="place">Vermont</name> but it was defeated by the Senate. <name type="pname">Ethan Allen</name> and Governor <name type="pname">Chittenden</name> supported continued independence for <name type="place">Vermont</name>. Congressional representatives from northern states felt favorably toward <name type="place">Vermont</name> statehood while representatives from southern states supported the admission of Kentucky, a slave state. The concept of balancing admission of a northern state with a southern state was established early in the history of <name type="place">America</name>.</p>
               <p>The issues that divided <name type="place">Great Britain</name> and the <name type="place">United States</name> were not fully resolved with the end of the War of Revolution. In the event of another war, an independent <name type="place">Vermont</name> had little defense. Caught between the much stronger <name type="place">United States</name> and <name type="place">British Canada</name>, an ultimate alignment with one of the sides was inevitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Ethan Allen</name> died February 12, 1789, and some of the spirit of independence died with him. On October 7, 1790, a meeting in <name type="place">New York</name> City set the present western boundary for <name type="place">Vermont</name>. The land claims were settled with a payment by <name type="place">Vermont</name> of $30,000. A levy of one-half penny per acre was assessed to raise these funds. A conventio in <name type="place">Bennington</name> ratified the Constitution of the <name type="place">United States</name>, January 6, 1791, and <name type="place">Vermont</name> petitioned for statehood. <name type="pname">George Washington</name> presented the <name type="place">Vermont</name> petition to Congress on February 9, 1791, and signed the Act granting statehood nine days later.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Vermont</name>, an independent republic for 14 years, became the fourteenth state in the Union on March 4, 1791. The citizens celebrated under a flag with not 14 but 15 stars and stripes. Although <name type="place">Kentucky</name> was not to be admitted until June 1, 1792, they were already acknowledged as part of the Union.
<q>The Republic's childhood was a continual nerve-taxing rumpus, a hurly-burly of shaken fists and half drawn swords, of outraged yells and threatening bellows, of contusions and lacerations which should have turned any young thing, including the infant Hercules, into a jittering neurasthenic, a depraved bully, or a corpse.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref>

                  <name type="place">Vermont</name> copper coinage has been well described in the literature. Reprints are available for several of these sources where the originals are scarce.</p>
               <p>In 1859, <name type="pname">Montroville W. Dickeson</name> produced the first encyclopedia of American coins, <hi rend="italic">The American Numismatical Manual of the Currency or Money of the Aborigines, and Colonial, State, and <name type="place">United States</name> Coins, with Historical and Descriptive Notices of each Coin or Series.</hi> He included coinage of <name type="place">Vermont</name> in the section on Colonial Coins. He described the obverse as including an eye, symbolic of Supreme power.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Dickeson wrote,</q>
                  <q>Nothing could be more beautifully expressive that the device upon these coins. A supreme overruling power had truly cast the rays of approval upon the thirteen infant States of the American confederacy, in their contest for liberty and the just rights of humanity, against the then, as now, leading power of the world. The rays of Omnipotence protected them, and finally led them from vassalage to victory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This eloquent interpretation of the design failed to acknowledge that <name type="place">Vermont</name> was not part of the 13 states of the Confederation.</p>
               <p>Sylvester S. Crosby included text of the significant documents in the standard reference, <hi rend="italic">Early American Coins</hi>, published in 1875. He identified eight major types and 28 die varieties. Crosby referred to <name type="place">Vermont</name> as a state although he acknowledged that it was not part of the Union until 1791.</p>
               <p>Hillyer Ryder wrote "The Colonial Coins of <name type="place">Vermont</name>," included in <hi rend="italic">The State Coinage of New <name type="place">England</name>
                  </hi> (1920). This was essentially a study of the die varieties and listed 31 such varieties. In calling <name type="place">Vermont</name> "the first State to authorize a coinage," he perpetuated the state coinage fallacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">John M.

               <p>The General Assembly of the Freemen of the State of <name type="place">Vermont</name> originally (June 15, 1785) set the weight of <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers at one third ounce (160 grains) or 48 per pound. The standard for British halfpence was 46 to the pound or about 152.2 grains. A federal resolution of July 6, 1785, set a standard of 157.5 grains for future cents, although none were produced until 1787. When <name type="place">Vermont</name> learned that their coppers exceeded the Confederation standards, the weight was reduced to four penny-weight fifteen grains (111 grains). The reduced <name type="place">Vermont</name> standard was in recognition that many of the coppers then circulating were underweight.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Vermont</name> was then, and remains, sparsely populated. They were neither a significant producer of products for sale outside the republic nor a major consumer of products produced in the <name type="place">United States</name>. <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers circulated well within the republic but little beyond the borders.</p>
               <p>Production from the Rupert Mint was crude even by colonial standards. High quality steel needed for coin dies was not available. The copper coinage suffers from lamination defects indicative of impure copper or unsophisticated smelting techniques.</p>

               <p>The <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers of 1785 show on the obverse the sun rising over the tree covered Green Mountain with a plough in the foreground. The obverse legend, <name type="place">VERMONTS</name> RES. PUBLICA, refers to the Republic of <name type="place">Vermont</name>. One 1785 obverse die has the legend <name type="place">VERMONTIS</name>. The 1786 obverse has the legend VERMONTENSIUM RES. PUBLICA.</p>
               <p>The reverse design on these coins features the all-seeing eye with 13 long and 13 short rays pointing to 13 stars, a design quite similar
<pb n="126"/>
to that seen on NOVA CONSTELLATIO coppers. The reverse bore the legend QUARTA DECIMA STELLA meaning the fourteenth star.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Design of the first <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers is attributed to <name type="place">New York</name> goldsmith and diecutter Colonel William Coley, indicating that <name type="place">Vermont</name> was still somewhat reliant upon <name type="place">New York</name>.</p>
               <p>The obverse was an excellent symbol of local identification. The Green Mountains were the dominant feature of local geography while the rising sun symbolized the emergence of the republic. <name type="pname">Breen</name> believed the rising sun was derived from <name type="pname">Paul Revere's</name> rising sun on 1779 paper money of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> but it also is possible that both are derived from earlier images. <name type="place">Vermont</name> was not then and is not now a significant producer of cultivated crops. The trees represented the state economy better than the plough, which was an optimistic symbol of agriculture for a state with timber as its prime export.</p>
               <p>While art should not be interpreted too literally, the sun rising over the mountains can, in retrospect, be interpreted as symbolic. This is a view from the western side of the mountains, the region that led the fight against <name type="place">New York</name> and for independence.</p>
               <p>Later writers would comment that the reverse legend indicated the desire of <name type="place">Vermont</name> citizens to become the fourteenth state in the American Union. Another interpretation would be that the legend was not so much a statement of desire as a statement of fact. <name type="place">Vermont</name> was the fourteenth star in the new constellation. <name type="place">Vermont</name> was a part of a loose economic union with the neighboring states. Trade across the borders was not impeded by tariffs and the currency of the American states was accepted in trade in <name type="place">Vermont</name>.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Vermont</name> was not subject to the jurisdiction of the American Confederation. Some <name type="place">Vermont</name> residents had fled from the Union to escape debt or the law. One such resident was colonial coiner <name type="pname">Samuel Atlee</name> who fled to <name type="place">Vermont</name> to escape debts in the <name type="place">United States</name>. There was some justification for considering <name type="place">Vermont</name> as an outlaw state.</p>

               </head>
               <p>On October 24, 1786, the <name type="place">Vermont</name> Assembly passed a bill authorizing coinage with "on the one side, a head with the motto auctoritate <name type="place">Vermont</name>ensium, abridged—on the reverse, a woman, with the letters INDE: ET: LIB:—for Independence and Liberty." The new design was an imitation of <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers that clearly resembled circulating British coppers.</p>
               <p>The 1786 portrait designs have an obverse bust facing left and the abbreviated legend AUCTORI VERMONT meaning By the Authority of <name type="place">Vermont</name>. The <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers had the legend AUCTORI CONNEC. meaning, similarly, By the Authority of <name type="place">Connecticut</name>.</p>
               <p>The obverse portrait was not identified as an individual, a situation highly unusual in coin design. The similarity with King George should not be interpreted as support for the British monarch. Instead it was a symbol of conformity to the appearance of the accepted circulating coppers.</p>
               <p>The reverse design had a seated figure representing "the Genius of <name type="place">America</name>," or alternately "the Goddess of Liberty," virtually indistinguishable from the seated Britannia seen on British coppers. The shield on most pieces showed the combined cross of <name type="pname">Saint George</name>, <name type="place">Saint Andrew</name> and Saint <name type="pname">Patrick seen</name> on the familiar Union Jack flag. On one reverse die, the shield design had four sheaves of wheat, a slight accommodation toward an American design.</p>
               <p>While the landscape coppers proclaimed independence by their design, the portrait coppers proclaimed independence by their legends. The feeling of the citizens of <name type="place">Vermont</name> was turning from support for independence toward support for admission to the Union.</p>

                  <name type="place">America</name> was plagued with counterfeit and unauthorized copper coins and <name type="place">Vermont</name> was not exempt. The last coinage was struck at the mint at Machin's Mills at <name type="place">Newburgh</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>.

               <p>One of the rarest counterfeits (RR-5), which copied the landscape design, is from an unidentified mint frequently included under the generic term of "Bungtown" mint.</p>
               <p>Two die varieties struck at Machin's Mills defy the authorizing legislation. The imitation of British designs reached a climax with a 1788 obverse with the legend <name type="pname">Georgius III</name> Rex muled with a reverse of standard design (RR-31). Another muled a standard obverse with a reverse with the almost indistinguishable legend Britannia (RR-13). The reverse die was mutilated to disguise its earlier legend.</p>

               <p>Dickeson (and later <name type="pname">Breen</name>) referred to these as Tory Coppers. Dickeson wrote,
<q>Two years after the acknowledgment of our independence by Great Britain, this coin—from the date—was thrust in some way upon republican <name type="place">America</name>. It is peculiar that there should have been such persistence in doing what, at the time, could not have been agreeable

to the mass of the people; and then, in the designs—assuming a connection between <name type="pname">George</name> III, and the Goddess of Liberty—is an act difficult to be either comprehended or accommodated.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These pieces represent what may be the logical conclusion to the story of <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers. The muling of dies from independent <name type="place">Vermont</name> with Britain designs does not represent a political union. Rather they indicate a total disregard for the concept that the image stamped on a coin made it money. These were nothing more than round pieces of underweight copper pretending to be money.</p>
               <p>The circulating copper coins of the era had no government backing. By July 1789, there was a surplus of coppers in commerce. Any that were accepted in trade were severely discounted. By 1790, states repealed their authorization of coppers, partially to avoid receiving coppers as taxes. The public rejection of copper coinage at a value above its weight made Federal coinage a necessity.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the unauthorized coinage represents the republic as well as does the authorized pieces. A defiance of centralized authority characterized the republic and its individual citizens.</p>

               <p>Previous attempts to put <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers in a category have failed to recognize their true status. The term "Colonial" coinage is not appropriate for <name type="place">Vermont</name> pieces as well as for many of the other pieces lumped under that term.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Kurth wrote</name>, "It is customary for American collectors to refer to the copper coins of <name type="place">Vermont</name> as 'colonial coins.' This is a deeply rooted error, due not so much to our ignorance of history as to our careless habit of allowing our speech to be unduly influenced by what we repeatedly read in catalogues." The message of <name type="pname">Kurth</name> has been largely ignored.</p>
               <p>"Early American Coinage" works if <name type="place">America</name> refers to the continent rather than the country. However, coinage for what would become <name type="place">Canada</name> is usually not included in the same category.</p>
               <p>Including <name type="place">Vermont</name> coppers with State coinage seems obvious, perhaps, but is still incorrect. Previous writers have frequently mentioned that <name type="place">Vermont</name> was not yet a state but still include <name type="place">Vermont</name> coinage with the coinage of other states.</p>
               <p>The coinage of <name type="place">Vermont</name> truly deserves a category of its own. The coins were struck under the authority of an independent sovereign republic and as such are unique among the coins that preceded coinage of the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint.</p>

               </head>
               <p>When Sylvester Crosby published his seminal work on early American coinage in 1878,<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> he called attention to the "same peculiar letters [that] appear in several different dies," and concluded that "the natural inference is that all these dies were made by the same person." He went on to describe an "A" "broken near the top," an "N" "irregular on the underside of the sloping line," and a "P" "imperfect at the left of its foot." Crosby extended his examination to certain issues of <name type="place">Vermont</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers where what appeared to be the same defective "A" and "N" letters were seen. He deduced that the dies, from which those coppers with the same letters were struck, were sunk by the same individual. Crosby could not determine whether the dies for these "different mints were made at one place, or whether the artist followed an itinerant practice, and visited the mints as the occasion required." Crosby ended his discussion with the premise that <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name> must have been responsible for many of these dies.</p>
               <p>The identification of Atlee as the engraver in question was based on the April 18, 1787, Machin's Mills indenture which reads: "and the said <name type="pname">Samuel Atlee</name>, and <name type="pname">James F. Atlee</name> being possessed of certain implements for carrying on said trade, do agree to lend them to the parties to these presents for and during the continuance of their copartnership without any fee or reward for the same."<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name> has touched upon the statements in this indenture in a 1991 research paper published in <hi rend="italic">CNL.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref> The Atlees' trade was a "manufactory of hardware" which has been traditionally accepted as a minting operation. The only existing literary confirmation of <name type="pname">James Atlee</name> as a die puncher or engraver was contained in a letter from <name type="pname">Thomas N. Machin</name>, the coiners grandson, to Dr. <name type="pname">F.B. Hough</name> of <name type="place">Albany</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>, by the reference to "Atlee, the engraver..."<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref> Also the <hi rend="italic">implements</hi> which the Atlees supplied to this partnership were never defined and Crosby determined they must have been die-cutting tools, an interpretation which most later writers have accepted. Crosby's assumption that Atlee was a die sinker whose broken "A" letter punch appeared across several copper series led him to attribute many <name type="place">Connecticuts</name>, <name type="place">Vermonts</name>, <name type="place">New Jerseys</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>-related issues and imitation British halfpence to him. Sipsey was probably the first to point out that Atlee was not encountered in any literature as a silversmith, and, therefore, questioned Crosby's assignment of Atlee as the likely die engraver.<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> Sipsey's references to <name type="pname">Cary Dunn, Abel Buell</name> and <name type="pname">Daniel van Voorhis</name> as possible silversmiths as suppliers of various puncheons to these state coinages

still needs to be developed. The exact role of <name type="pname">James Atlee</name> in this early enterprise remains the subject of continuing investigation.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name>, in his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia,</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref> names <name type="pname">James Atlee</name> as the die engraver of many colonial coppers based primarily on the letter punch evidence first described by <name type="pname">Crosby</name> as noted above. This paper's main purpose is to examine critically the value of such evidence and demonstrate why it is dangerous to interpret these defective letter punches as <name type="pname">James Atlee</name>'s signature. As a corollary to this position, this current research will also point out the pitfalls in using letter punches as primary evidence for mint attribution of Confederation coppers. <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name>, in his referenced paper, discusses a conversation he had with <name type="pname">Breen</name>,<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref> who indicated that unless you consider all the coinages which contain a broken "A," the confirmation of <name type="pname">James Atlee</name> as the die engraver will not be apparent. This article will disprove the hypothesis that all the coinages with this broken "A" letter punch (<hi rend="italic">BALP</hi>) have a common basis.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A research article by <name type="pname">Peter Gaspar</name> is of great importance in the study of die punch linking.<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> He demonstrates that punches for sinking coin dies were being mass produced from a single matrix for decades before the 1780s and therefore the occurrence of similar punches is entirely inadmissible evidence for establishing personnel or equipment links among different mints. In other words, coins struck at different times and from various mints may look for all the world as though they were made from dies sunk with the same punches, whereas they may only have been sunk by punches which, themselves, were raised from an identical matrix. Thus punch linkages are now less meaningful evidence, because there could easily have been several sets of identical punches in use at different mints, all at the same time! This punch manufacturing technology was English and there is evidence that American silversmiths brought their steel punches from <name type="place">England</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref> Based on the above information,
<pb n="134"/>
the <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> can still be utilized as a secondary tool, but as primary evidence to identify a die engraver or die sinker, its use must be interpreted with caution. One needs to support any punch style evidence with other important factors such as planchet weight, die state analysis, obverse and reverse die sharing, and overstriking data.</p>
               <p>There are other indications that engravers had a common source of letter punches available to them. The concept that each engraver was obliged to make his own set of tools has been discarded not only by Gaspar but by other contemporary literary evidence. In his book on Abel Buell, Lawrence Wroth, quotes an excerpt from the April 16, 1801 <hi rend="italic">American Mercury</hi> in which Buell offered punches and dies for sale.<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref> These references strengthen the idea that this individual did indeed make his own punches instead of purchasing them from other sources such as silversmiths and/or estate sales.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref>

               </head>
               <p>This investigator will first look at the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> state coinage. Within this grouping we see a broken "A" punch (<hi rend="italic">BALP</hi>), with an intact thick right side and thin left side whose constant flaw at the upper part progressively deteriorates from its partially broken (<hi rend="italic">PBA</hi>) state to fully broken (<hi rend="italic">FBA</hi>) (see Table 1 below). Within the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> series, we do see a progressive disintegration of the <hi rend="italic">BALPs</hi> based on die emission. As an example, as one proceeds away from the early Rahway <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers, the BALP becomes more fully broken for this type of <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> (figs. <ref target="#fig-48">1</ref>, <ref target="#fig-49">2</ref>). The only major exception was the different punch style in NOVA for the 26-S, 68-w, and 69-w varieties involving a thin left side, thick right side and with "wavy" bases.</p>
               <p>These wavy bases require further explanation. This is the "bifurcation" phenomenon previously described in <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers by Bressett<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref> in response to an observation by Barnsley<ref target="#CH7-n13">12</ref> who had reported the occurrence of two distinct styles on the bottom serifs of the R and I of PLURIBUS on the Maris 67-v, presenting the appearance of a recut die.</p>

                  <p>Fig. 3: Maris 26-S showing a <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> in NOVA. Due to the "bifurcation" effect it is dissimilar to all other <hi rend="italic">BALPs</hi> in the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> series except 68-w and 69-w. Only the first "A" in NOVA shows the effect (i.e., curved bases).</p>
               </figure>
               <p>
                  <name type="place">Bressett</name> explained that these changes were not the result of a recut die, but rather an artifact which occurred during striking, since none of these early coppers had the benefit of a retaining collar to stop the blank from expanding. Because the coins were struck on a manually operated press, the pressure was liable to vary according to the force exerted, and occasionally, when subjected to excessive stress, the flan would spread more than usual in a radial direction. Under such conditions, the toothed borders (on <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers) would elongate and the serifs on the letters tended to curl upward toward the periphery producing a cleftlike appearance. This distortion occurs to a lesser degree on coins
<pb n="137"/>
struck under normal pressure and is due to the fact that the periphery of the planchet spreads more rapidly than the more central portions, especially when there is no collar. It is interesting to note that within the broken "A" <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers, only 26-S, 68 and 69-w exhibit the bifurcation phenomenon.</p>
               <p>The broken "A" letter punch noted above exists in two major styles—one which is fully broken (<hi rend="italic">FB</hi>) and the other being partially broken (<hi rend="italic">PB</hi>). Only one distinct broken <hi rend="italic">"A"</hi> letter punch exists, within the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> series as previously discussed (figs 1-<ref target="#fig-50">3</ref>). The evidence compiled by this writer is presented in Table 1. The <hi rend="italic">PB/FB</hi> transition from an early to a late Rahway emission seems to conform to all die state evidence retrieved for these die varieties. In the coppers listed in Table 1, it appears that the flaw in the "A" die progressed with use over time, thereby going from <hi rend="italic">PBA</hi> to <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> from the early to the late state emissions for the obverse varieties at Rahway Mills or early Elizabethtown. The previously described singular matrix principle does not seem to interfere within the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> series; however we can never be certain that there was just a single letter punch involved that deteriorated under constant use.</p>
               <p>One must be mindful of another theoretical circumstance, occurring at the time of die sinking, which could alter the appearance of the broken "A", or any letter for that matter, in the legend of the struck coin. A variable expression of any letter can be due to the chisel-like shape of the letter punch whose actual profile, as it is sunk into the die, may be modified depending on the depth to which it is sunk. The deeper the punch penetrates the die, the broader one might expect the legs of the letters to appear. If a broken punch is sunk below the position of a punch defect, then the flawed part of the letter in the final die may appear different. This situation is not diagnostic of the different letter styles between 26-S/68-w/69-w and the other varieties listed on Table 1 concerning the first "A" in NOVA. These are different "styled" puncheons.</p>
               <p>The reader should consider the following major points while reviewing Table 1:</p>
               <list rend="bulleted">
                  <item>There is no variation within the non-broken <hi rend="italic">(NB), FB</hi> or <hi rend="italic">PB</hi> "A"s when comparing similar <name type="place">New Jersey</name> varieties. As an example, during the preparation of Table 1, the writer compared five different Maris <name type="place">New Jersey</name> 13-J specimens; no variation occurred between the first, third, and fourth "A"s (the second A which is linked to E in <name type="place">CÆSAREA</name> is considered not applicable, since it always remains unbroken).</item>
                  <item>It is interesting to note that the earlier emission varieties have a higher percentage of being <hi rend="italic">NB/PB</hi> than being in a <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> status.
<pb n="138"/>
As an example, compare 13-J, a known early <name type="place">Rahway</name> variety, based on its early reverse J die state with an intermediate issue (i.e., 33-U), and finally a late <name type="place">Rahway</name> issue (i.e., 26-S). Note how it proceeds from an <hi rend="italic">NB/PB</hi> combination to a <hi rend="italic">PB</hi> fate and finally to a <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> existence. The "A"s eventually seem to fall apart in the punches with time, and make their way to a <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> state. Does the Gaspar singular matrix principle introduce an extraneous <hi rend="italic">PB</hi> or <hi rend="italic">FBA</hi> punch into the picture? Possibly, but it seems not to interfere to any degree in this state coinage, since all other evidence to date from other research studies complies with the die emission sequence of Table 1 (i.e., when comparing the findings of <name type="pname">Hodder</name> in his paper on the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> Reverse J die<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> and the well-documented 33-U/15-U backdating event). In this case, the 1787 33-U was struck predominantly before the 1786 15-U variety based on reverse die state analysis. The <hi rend="italic">PB/FB</hi> data in Table 1 confirms this emission sequence.</item>
                  <item>The Maris 26-S variety shows a distinctive <hi rend="italic">BALP,</hi> different from all other <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi>s. The <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> is the first "A" in NOVA. The typical <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                     <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> has a thicker right side and thinner left side with straight bases. As <ref target="#fig-50">fig. 3</ref> depicts, both sides are thinner and both bases "wavy." This phenomenon, however, is the result of bifurcation which was previously described in <ref target="#fig-50">fig. 3</ref>.</item>
                  <item>The consistency of the <hi rend="italic">NB, PB,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> "A" letter punches is intriguing. It does hint a singular letter punch which broke over time.</item>
                  <item>The only major difference noted within these <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi>s occurred within the first "A" of NOVA for the varieties 26-S, 68-w and 69-w. The fully broken "A" here is the result of bifurcation. The typical <name type="place">New Jersey</name>
                     <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> has a thick right side, a thin left side and the broken part is on the upper left side. The broken "A" on these three varieties is similar except that the serifs on both bases show the effects of bifurcation.</item>
                  <item>The gradual deterioration in the punch flaw does not discredit the Gaspar theory in my opinion. It only shows that all punches demonstrate the ravages of continued use. The numismatist must also consider that the depth to which a punch is sunk may alter the expression of the break, especially if it is partial.</item>

               <p>The broken "N" and "P" are the two other letter punches which were not resurrected from Crosby by Walter <name type="pname">Breen</name>. Crosby described an "N" irregular on the underside of the sloping line, and a "P" imperfect at the left of its foot, the serif being broken from that side.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref> These additional letter punches were also examined to give the reader a complete examination of these broken punches originally introduced by Crosby and to portray their remarkable consistency within the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> series and their inconsistent appearances on the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name> coinages.

               <p>When we refer to the <name type="pname">Frederick B.

While most of the 1785 coins were probably struck at the New Haven mint, a number of later issues, particularly those which were quite light in weight, were undoubtedly struck at Machin's Mills near <name type="place">Newburgh</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>.<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref> Breen attributed the 1786 bust right issues to James Atlee. He lists the following <name type="pname">Miller</name> varieties to Atlee based on die-punch linking other evidence:</p>

               <p>Table 3 identifies the only <name type="pname">Miller</name> varieties possessing a <hi rend="italic">BALP.</hi> These are: 1786 <name type="pname">Miller</name> 1-A, and the 1787 <name type="pname">Miller</name> 1.1-A, and 1.4-WW as having broken "A"s. The broken "A"s were not similar to the broken "A"s found on the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers. Compare figs. 1, 2 and <ref target="#fig-51">4</ref>. These are the same cross-pictorial conclusions Hodder had viewed during his write-up of the 1787 IMMUNIS COLUMBIA.<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The comparison of the <hi rend="italic">BALP</hi> with other state coinages (<name type="place">New Jersey</name> and <name type="place">Vermont</name>) proved dissimilar; all the so-called broken "A"s are not the same, indicative of several defective punches. Thus it is inaccurate to perpetuate the notion that the same punches attributed to James Atlee for the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> series were used again for the <name type="place">Connecticut</name> series and vice versa. The systematic punch linking just by examining these two series indicates to the numismatist that more concrete evidence is needed before such a claim can be substantiated.</p>
               <p>Could these 1786 issues (<name type="pname">Breen</name> 742-46) be of <name type="place">Newburgh</name> origin and be backdated and produced in 1787? Interestingly, none of these <name type="pname">Miller</name> varieties exhibited the broken "N" as seen on several <name type="place">New Jersey</name> varieties. If these were Atlee's punches one would expect to see at least one broken "N" among seven <name type="pname">Miller</name> varieties. Since the "A"s are of a different style between the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers, the evidence, i.e. <name type="pname">Atlee</name>, which links these two series is becoming more tenuous.</p>

               </head>
               <p>This investigator is able to make the following points about the so-called Atlee broken "A" punch:</p>
               <list rend="bulleted">
                  <item>The 1786 IMMUNIS COLUMBIA, Heraldic Eagle type issue is probably the first issue of a broken "A" letter punch, which may have been struck in pre-Rahway, in the time frame from 1785 to November 1786, when <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers were first struck. The letter punch seems similar in style to the NJ BALP (i.e., thick right and thin left side, being broken at the upper left).</item>
                  <item>The <hi rend="italic">NB/PB/FB</hi> "A"s are consistent within each <name type="place">New Jersey</name> variety examined. Early Rahway was denoted by a <hi rend="italic">NB/PB</hi> status, whereas late Rahway issues exhibited a <hi rend="italic">FB</hi> status. This phenomenon strengthens one theory that the "A" punch may have broken further with time and use, yielding the <hi rend="italic">NB/PB/FB</hi> transition. The depth to which the punch was sunk into the die is the other possible theory.</item>
                  <item>
                     <name type="place">New Jersey</name> Maris varieties 68-w and 69-w and <name type="place">New Jersey</name> variety Maris 26-S in their "A"s in NOVA have similar "A" punches due to the "bifurcation" phenomenon. Other letters in the obverse and reverse motifs for these three varieties also indicated punches with curved bases. These are not new letter punches but is the result of metal flow, since these coins were not struck within a collar.</item>
                  <pb n="145"/>
                  <item>The writer concurs with <name type="pname">Michael Hodder's</name> conclusion that different "A" punches do exist between the "state" coinages. Hence, systematic mint attributions utilizing the broken "A" punch, or any other letter punch for that matter, as the only evidence, is to be discarded, since we can never confirm the fact that any individual punch was not unique to that mint due to the availability of a common supply.</item>
                  <item>Not all <name type="place">Connecticut</name> coppers have the broken "A"s as previously identified. Also, some <name type="place">Connecticuts</name> as the <name type="pname">Miller</name> 1-A did not consistently contain a broken "A." Currently this phenomenon, which is not seen within the <name type="place">New Jersey</name> series, is under a separate investigation.</item>
                  <item>Finally, the reader should now understand that punch-linking by itself is of no real consequence as an attribution tool, but is only of a secondary value. Punch linking, coupled with stronger and more reliable evidence such as overstriking, die state analysis, planchet weight and diameter readings, and obverse and reverse die sharing, are the primary tools needed to create the long term confident attribution in all areas of future colonial coin research.</item>

            <p>The links between the <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, <name type="place">England</name> firm of <name type="pname">Boulton</name>, Watt &amp; Company and the <name type="place">United States of America</name> embraced the half century between the 1780s and the 1830s. Most of the contact bordered on the prosaic, involving nothing more exciting than the sale of copper cent and half-cent planchets to the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint.<ref target="#CH8-n1">1</ref> But there were occasional hints at greater prospects—possibilities of coinage, or even the sale of a new, steam-powered coining apparatus for the ramshackle <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint.</p>
            <p>Such glittering opportunities had been forecast by events during the Confederation period, for in the middle and closing years of the 1780s, no fewer than three chances for a Soho-made American coinage emerged and disappeared again, leaving no concrete products in their passing.</p>
            <p>Two of the three possibilities involved the state of <name type="pname">South Carolina</name>, and they were fostered by the nature of our first national compact, the Articles of Confederation. Drawn up in 1777 and effective from 1781, that document was a direct reaction to the immediate past—or how most Americans chose to see it. According to the prevalent view, a power-mad central government in <name type="place">London</name> had attempted to curb local freedoms in America, provoking a just War for American Independence. Armed with this interpretation, the majority concluded that any domestic central government which might be set up must be kept weak, so as not to infringe on individual or state autonomies. The Articles of Confederation, therefore, reserved most rights to the states; and this included the powers to emit bills of credit and circulate coinage. A number of the sovereign states—and the <hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi>
               <name type="place">Vermont</name> Republic—were taking advantage of the moneying possibilities by the middle of the 1780s. When <name type="place">South Carolina</name> decided to join the group, a link between <name type="place">Charleston</name> and Soho would be forged.</p>
            <p>On March 22, 1786, the state's legislature passed an ordinance authorizing the creation of state coins in four denominations—pence and halfpence, and shillings and sixpence. The former two were to be made of copper, the latter two of silver. The halfpence were to be struck "according to the standard of British half pence," while the two silver coins "shall be of the same weight as English shillings and sixpences, and contain an alloy proportioned to that of the French crowns"; a logical stipulation, in light of the fact that the French had settled the area around <name type="place">Charleston</name> and still enjoyed some influence there. The standard applied to the copper penny was left unstated, for no such coin currently existed in <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
            <p>Some £10,000 worth of coppers were to be struck, divided equally between the two denominations. They would join £20,000 in silver

coins, in a proportion of three shillings to every sixpence struck. The man responsible for this new state coinage would be a certain Charles Borel.<ref target="#CH8-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Borel was currently a resident of Charleston. His preferred means of expression seems to have been French—a not-insurmountable barrier in a French-influenced city. He had gone into business and prospered, and it was Borel who had made the coining proposal to the state, not the other way around. The Act he secured gave him the responsibility of importing the coinage from abroad (for there was never serious thought of creating it in <name type="pname">South Carolina</name>, or even in <name type="place">America</name>); he had fifteen months to obtain it, and, if it passed muster with the Governor, Borel would receive <name type="place">South Carolina</name> paper of a value equal to the coins he had imported. While he seems to have been put to a great deal of trouble for no profit, Borel was public-spirited and besides realized that a viable metallic currency would be good for business.</p>
            <p>As it was granting <name type="pname">Borel</name> the right to import a contract coinage, the state was also setting about creating the paper medium against which the new coinage would be exchanged. This explains the existence of the excessively rare state notes bearing an issue-date of May 1, 1786, engraved and printed in <name type="place">Charleston</name> by Abernethie.</p>

            <p>Four denominations were issued—for £1, £2, £3, and £10. Today, one of the £2 notes survives—in the collection of the American Numismatic Society. And two of the £3 have been traced. But the other members of this fairly sizable issue have disappeared, presumably all redeemed—but not by the contract coinage of <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>.</p>
            <p>We do not know why Borel thought of this industrialist: his first overture to Soho bore a date of August 19, a time when <name type="pname">Boulton</name> was yet to begin his first coining project, copper money intended for the East India Company's holdings in Sumatra; and there is no indication of a prior acquaintance. But Soho had been tapped for the Sumatran assignment in June 1786,<ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref> and the upcoming coinage would have been common knowledge in <name type="place">London</name> financial circles by the time of Borel's letter, which was written from <name type="place">London</name>. That letter was brief: it simply asked whether <name type="pname">Boulton</name> were interested in creating five tons of copper coins for America—with no mention of silver coinage, or specific reference to <name type="pname">South Carolina</name>.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> reply has not survived, but he was receptive to the project and evidently replied around the end of August, discussing possible terms, asking for more information. He then left for Cornwall on personal business and in search of copper for the upcoming Sumatran coinage. Borel's second and last letter was addressed to him there, on September 14.</p>
            <p>A problem had arisen. Borel wished to return to <name type="place">America</name> in early October, and he wanted most or all of his coppers ready at that point to carry back with him. We may sympathize with him: a clock was ticking, and if he were late, his agreement could be annulled. But we may sympathize with <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> as well: the latter was desperately searching for copper for the much larger Sumatran order, was attempting to create a makeshift mint at an East India Company warehouse in <name type="place">London</name>, and was learning his new craft as he went along. He could not undertake Borel's work prior to the end of October. And that was too late for Borel.</p>
            <p>What happened next is both obvious and unclear. This <name type="place">Charleston</name> merchant received no coins—at least from <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>. But <name type="pname">Sylvester S. Crosby</name> has him receiving coins from someone. Writing in 1875, Crosby quotes an article from the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Centinel</hi> of October 18, 1786, reproducing an account received from <name type="place">Charleston</name> dated September 29:<ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref>
               <q>[The <name type="pname">South Carolina</name>] Government has received information that <name type="pname">Mr. Borel</name> has compleated his contract of coinage for this State, in <name type="place">Switzerland</name>, and may be soon expected here by the way of <name type="place">London</name>. The stipulation was for
<pb n="157"/>
30,0001. in silver and copper, to be exchanged for the paper medium.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This quote obscures more than it illuminates. The quantity noted dovetails with the requirements set down in the ordinance, and it mentions silver coinage as well as copper. But the timing is impossible. Even if we were to concede that Borel had given up on <name type="pname">Boulton</name> and immediately sought someone else, the news could not possibly have crossed the Atlantic between the date of his second letter to the coiner and the publication of the news in Charleston—or its republication in <name type="place">Boston</name>. And <name type="place">Switzerland</name>? Was Borel from Neuchâtel?</p>
            <p>It seems unlikely that Crosby's sources were correct—and indeed this would not be the only instance of something mentioned by that author but not seen elsewhere. In any case, a new man was about to make his entrance, and he, at least, believed that Borel had abandoned his plans without bringing them to fruition. This new man wanted an opportunity to take up precisely where the old had left off. This new man was a fellow-Charlestonian named <name type="pname">John H. Mitchell</name>.</p>
            <p>We know a fair amount about this second businessman and his dealings with <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> because an eventual descendant with an antiquarian bent published <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Mitchell-Boulton</name> Correspondence, 1787-1792: Relative to Coinages for <name type="place">South Carolina</name> and the <name type="place">United States</name>.</hi> While <name type="pname">Clarence B. Mitchell</name> made occasional exclusions on behalf of the good name of his ancestor, we nonetheless have a reasonably detailed account of the second connection between <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> and the state of <name type="pname">South Carolina</name>—one which can be expanded by <name type="place">Birmingham</name> materials not included in the 1931 book.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">John H. Mitchell</name> was nothing if not enterprising, and he always thought in grandiose terms. At a time when he had not yet informed the Governor or the General Assembly of his plans (let alone secured their agreement to them), he was already in contact with <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>, soliciting the latter's participation in a revived Carolina coining project.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> made his proposal through two of <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> business associates at the end of July 1787. The prospectus was tempting: <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> wanted no fewer than £20,000 worth of copper halfpence—nearly ten million coins. He sent along proposed designs on August 4: they closely copied the <name type="place">South Carolina</name> state seal, but the current date would be substituted for the date 1775 on the obverse. A second letter was sent out on the thirteenth, asking for specimens based on the designs sent nine days previously. If at all possible, <name type="pname">Boulton</name> was to prepare patterns so that <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> could send
<pb n="158"/>
them along with his formal proposal to Governor Pinckney. If <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> coins and <name type="pname">Mitchell's</name> overtures could leave on a ship scheduled to sail on the twentieth, there was a chance that they would reach <name type="place">Charleston</name> in time for the Governor to lay them before the legislature. But <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> could not remit his proposal until the end of August (and even then, he had to be content with inclusion of a few specimens from the Sumatra coinage: <name type="pname">Boulton</name> had not been able to create the new patterns in time). And timing was everything: a tardy reception of <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> coins and <name type="pname">Mitchell's</name> prospectus might make it less likely that the state would embrace either.</p>

            <p>But they would struggle against greater odds than that: just as <name type="pname">John H.

To be sure, it must be ratified by most of the states, but such passage was very likely, given a changed climate of opinion concerning the blessings of liberty versus the attractions of order.</p>

            <pb n="160"/>
            <p>At present, the climate was warming to the proposed new federal compact—which would take a very dim view of the very sort of state coinage which Messrs. <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> and <name type="pname">Boulton</name> were seeking to create.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> encountered the chilly atmosphere as soon as he arrived back in <name type="place">Charleston</name> in the spring of 1788:<ref target="#CH8-n5">5</ref>
               <q>I waited on the Governor the day after my arrival, who informed me that my proposals were read to the House of Assembly and the French Crown [<name type="pname">Jean-Pierre Droz</name>'s famous pattern écu, with its lettered edge struck in collar: <name type="pname">Boulton</name> had engaged Droz for his own coinage and would enlist his services for <name type="place">South Carolina</name> as well] shewn them which met entirely with their approbation. But they could do nothing in the business until the new Constitution was either adopted or exploded—which cannot be ascertained until the Convention had met to consider of it, which was appointed to be the thirteenth of the next month, so that I cannot expect an answer before the middle of July, which as soon as I receive shall transmit you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ratifying convention duly met; within a few days, it embraced the new federal compact (thereby showing as much enthusiasm for getting into the Union as it would one day demonstrate in getting out of it). As the Constitution forbade coinage by (or circulated under the aegis of) the states, this second <name type="place">South Carolina</name> proposal was null.</p>
            <p>But <name type="pname">John H. Mitchell</name> was a persistent and optimistic man. Rebuffed on the state level, he turned to the federal; and he carried <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name> part of the way with him.</p>
            <p>In September 1789, <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> visited the temporary national capital, <name type="place">New York</name> City. There, he had a long meeting with President <name type="place">Washington</name> concerning a new national coinage—and he incorporated Soho into his speculations. <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> was back in <name type="place">Charleston</name> by early October, sending <name type="pname">Boulton</name> a quick survey on the ninth and a more extended report on the following day. The proposal he sketched was for an enormous quantity of coinage—not less than £200,000 worth of money, divided equally between gold, silver and copper. And this would merely be the first installment, as "I have the preference of supplying Congress with their first Coinage," and that body clearly saw "the impracticability of coining in America,
<pb n="161"/>
when they can get it so much better made in Europe and cheaper."<ref target="#CH8-n6">6</ref> But speed was again essential. Like <name type="pname">Borel, Mitchell</name> had a strict deadline; Congress would reassemble on the first Monday of 1790, and <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> proposal must be received by then at the latest.</p>
            <p>His correspondent was somewhat skeptical, based on past experience with the ebullient <name type="place">Charlestonian</name>. But the money involved was simply too large to be ignored, and he dutifully prepared an estimate, sending it to <name type="place">Charleston</name> on November 25, 1789, only a few days after hearing the news. With luck, it would reach <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> in time to be laid before Congress; but what would happen then was anyone's guess.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Boulton</name> restricted his remarks to copper coinage, upon which he was becoming something of an expert. He could make it for the Americans for £46.13.4 per ton, including freight to <name type="place">Bristol</name>. That would be the price if the Americans got their own copper; if he had to get it for them, it would cost them another £84 per ton, at current rates. <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> would have to come up with his own designs, perhaps in consultation with General <name type="place">Washington</name>. <name type="pname">Boulton</name> thought that the arrangement employed on the Fugio coppers was attractive (an irony: <name type="pname">Boulton</name> was very nearly involved in the production of that coin too, in treaty with the rascally James Jarvis at the very time he was corresponding with <name type="pname">John Mitchell</name>). But he believed the Fugio designs could be improved upon, perhaps with the addition of Washington's head or an allegorical figure.</p>
            <p>As for the matter on both men's minds: how was <name type="pname">Mitchell</name>, or Congress, to pay for the coins? <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> suggestions betray the shaky nature of his industrial empire, as more and more of its capital was being invested in a still-unproductive Soho Mint. For he would accept whatever local products he could get by way of payment—indigo, rice, wheat or tobacco. They could be consigned to him or to his <name type="place">London</name> agent, <name type="pname">William Matthews</name>, and the proceeds raised from their sale would be credited against what the Republic owed for its coins.</p>
            <p>You will recall that <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> wanted an answer by the first of the year. This was unrealistic even in times of good sailing weather. In the event, he had to wait until March 17 for <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> reply. It was not all that he had hoped, but he submitted it to Congress nonetheless, assuming that <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> reputation would give his tardy proposal more consideration than another's timely one. But he reckoned without certain members of the new national government.</p>
            <p>Chief among them was <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>, Secretary of State and the leader of an emerging anti-Federalist bloc. <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was
<pb n="162"/>
somewhat anti-British, distinctly pro-French;<ref target="#CH8-n7">7</ref> but his conclusions concerning <name type="pname">John H. Mitchell</name> and the <name type="place">Birmingham</name> magnate who stood behind him transcended parties and pettiness.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> received <name type="pname">Mitchell's</name> proposal (but not <name type="pname">Mitchell</name>: the latter had unwisely remained at <name type="place">Charleston</name>) about the seventh of April. Within a week, his reply, the "Report on Copper Coinage," had been written and submitted to President <name type="place">Washington</name>. Coming at a very crucial time, it would fix the identity of the coinage circulated in the <name type="place">United States</name> from that day forward.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Jefferson's</name> report of April 14, 1790, acknowledged that <name type="pname">Boulton</name> could coin in the manner which he and <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> claimed: Soho's coinage really was the finest in the world, far superior to anything else on either side of the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>. It agreed with <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> tenets, that the technological and artistic perfection which Soho could provide were the surest defenses against counterfeiting; to be successful and secure, any future American coinage must embrace these same qualities.</p>
            <p>But technical expertise, artistic perfection, and the security against forgery that they made possible must yield to national interest and national security. This <name type="pname">Mitchell/Boulton</name> proposal was admirable, provided it could be carried out in <name type="place">America</name>. If it had to be effected in Great Britain, it must be declined.</p>
            <p>It could not be so entertained because it was far too risky. Just then, the world was at peace; but the previous record of the eighteenth century and the drift of current events in France strongly argued that peace was a temporary thing, not to be relied upon by the <name type="place">United States</name>. And in a time of war, vessels laden with coin for <name type="place">America</name> would inevitably make tempting targets for adversaries of every stripe.<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> Even in times of peace, such cargoes would always run the risk of mutiny and piracy by the crews to whom they were entrusted—and a surreptitious landing and quick dispersal of such coinage at any of hundreds of points along the long Eastern Seaboard could not have been prevented, given the rudimentary state of law enforcement and communications at this time.</p>
            <p>But <name type="pname">Jefferson's</name> report went deeper than security considerations. As he succinctly observed "Coinage is peculiarly an attribute of sovereignty. To transfer it's <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> exercise into another country, is to submit it to another Sovereign.<ref target="#CH8-n9">9</ref>
            </p>
            <p>How could <name type="place">America</name>, whose nationality was still in process of formation, conceivably transfer coinage to the safekeeping of another nation, especially one against which a war of liberation had so recently been fought? <name type="pname">Jefferson's</name> reply to the <name type="pname">Mitchell/Boulton</name> proposal listed other arguments against the idea, and very good ones
<pb n="163"/>
indeed. But he had already delivered an unanswerable blow to the scheme. There would be no national coinage involving <name type="pname">John H. Mitchell</name>, or <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Mitchell</name> heard the bad news in early May 1790, and he wrote his proposed partner almost immediately, attempting to put the best face on a miserable situation. He observed that <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> had by no means closed the door to a <name type="pname">Boulton</name> connection with <name type="place">America</name>: indeed, the Secretary had said that whenever a Federal Mint was established:<ref target="#CH8-n10">10</ref>
               <q>The superiority, the merit, and means of the Undertaker [<name type="pname">Boulton</name>] will suggest him as the proper person to be engaged in the establishment and conduct of a mint, on a scale which, relinquishing nothing in the perfection of the coin, shall be duly proportioned to our purposes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From <name type="pname">Mitchell's</name> point of view, all was most certainly not lost, and if <name type="pname">Boulton</name> "thought it practicable to establish one of your machines here, you may be assured we shall get the conducting of the whole of the coinage business in this country."<ref target="#CH8-n11">11</ref> But <name type="pname">Boulton</name> was unprepared for such a move: his squabbles with <name type="pname">Jean-Pierre Droz</name> had dissolved into the acrimony of legal proceedings; he was in process of securing a patent for his minting machinery; and he was now aware that whatever the American potential might be, <name type="pname">John H. Mitchell</name> was not the man to secure it. The latter was a dreamer, more interested in turning a profit (by means of a complicated scheme, if possible) than in reforming a coinage. The correspondence between the two men continued, but <name type="pname">Boulton</name> would henceforth restrict it to the more prosaic articles of the Anglo-American trade.</p>
            <p>Some years later, <name type="pname">Boulton's</name> nephew visited the <name type="place">United States</name> on business, and he made a point of dropping by <name type="place">Charleston</name> to visit his uncle's old acquaintance. He found him charming as always, but still possessing "the unlucky talent of trying to preserve the splendour of a Gentn [Gentleman] without adequate means."<ref target="#CH8-n12">12</ref> In short, not the man to act as midwife to an American coinage by <name type="pname">Matthew Boulton</name>.</p>
            <p>Just as this relative was penning his observations about <name type="pname">Mr. Mitchell</name>, an interesting event was taking place in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. An Act passed the previous year had ordered the creation of a federal Mint, and it was now striking its first coins in a new decimal system of dollars and cents. These maiden efforts were not handsome, and there were not very many of them; but they were incontrovertibly American. And once the first of them entered commerce, the connections between <name type="pname">Boulton</name>, Watt &amp; Company and the <name type="place">United States</name> of <name type="place">America</name> changed for all time.</p>

            <p>Coinage with a portrait of <name type="pname">George Washington</name> has been accepted as part of the early American coinage, although none had any official status. Some <name type="place">Washington</name> coins did circulate in <name type="place">England</name>, and others were in use as currency in the <name type="place">United States</name> as late as the middle of the nineteenth century. The first to appear was the <name type="pname">Georgius Triumpho</name> copper token of 1783. Four types dated 1783 were struck but after 1815. There is one piece, dated 1784; three pieces of the Confederatio-Immune <name type="place">Columbia</name> series of the 1785-86, some being dated; American-made <name type="pname">Peter Getz</name> half dollars dated 1792; and finally a group of English commercial issues dated 1791, 1792, 1793 and 1795. One exception is the American-made <name type="pname">Peter Getz</name> half dollars dated 1792.<ref target="#CH9-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A classification system has been devised for the series, designated <name type="place">WA</name>, combining: date of issue; variety designation; metal (blank- copper, Ag-silver, Au-gold, Br-brass, Bz-bronze, Pb-lead, Pt-platinum, WM-white metal); known overstrikes (indicated by lower case o). <ref target="#CH9-n2">2</ref> A list of the varieties appears in Table 1.</p>
            <p>The historical background of the <name type="place">Washington</name> coinage has been researched and commented on by <name type="pname">Crosby</name>, <name type="pname">Breen</name>, <name type="pname">Julian</name>,<ref target="#CH9-n3">3</ref> and <name type="pname">Taxay</name>
               <ref target="#CH9-n4">4</ref> and is consolidated in this study. A detailed summary of the material coordinated by <name type="pname">Breen</name> follows each basic series.</p>

            <p>Baker 7, Vlack 30-Z.<ref target="#CH9-n5">5</ref> The Georgivs Triumpho coins were struck in <name type="place">England</name>, probably in <name type="place">Birmingham</name>. Historically they were believed to be an ambiguous combination of a rude head of <name type="pname">George III</name> (copied from the 1774-76 and 1781-82 Irish halfpence, <name type="pname">Seaby</name> H236-40,<ref target="#CH9-n6">6</ref> and a <name type="place">Birmingham</name>-made counterfeit British halfpenny style die. The legends were evasive regardless of the outcome of the Revolutionary War: in praise of <name type="pname">King George</name> if the British won, in praise of <name type="place">Washington</name> if the Americans won. The familiar devices would ensure circulation either way.</p>
            <pb n="167"/>
            <p>However, closer attention to the facts shows that by 1783, <name type="pname">King George</name> had no possible triumph coming. The legend VOCE POPOLI (Italianate spelling of VOCE POPULI "By the voice of the people") would have been colossal irony if the Americans had not already won.</p>
            <p>The head on the vast majority of evasion halfpence was intended to be <name type="pname">King George III</name> also. The head on the Triumpho piece was also intended to be both <name type="pname">George III</name> and <name type="place">Washington</name>. The fabric resembles <name type="place">Bungtown</name> tokens.<ref target="#CH9-n7">7</ref> The date, 1783, is significant as it is the date of the Treaty of <name type="place">Paris</name> which formally concluded the Revolutionary War. A recent article by <name type="pname">Ringo</name> shows die punch linkage of the Georgivs Triumpho with several 1775 English counterfeit halfpence, and the Nova Constellatio variety 1-A.<ref target="#CH9-n8">8</ref> Even the figure of Britannia on a 1775 counterfeit and the Triumpho have a common hub. This data further confirms the issuance date of the Georgivs Triumpho as soon after 1783.</p>
            <p>It is reported that the Triumpho piece served as a host coin for the Elizabethtown-mint <name type="place">New Jersey</name> copper, which was put in circulation during the period between June 1788 and June 1789, when that Mint was operational. Table 29 of Mossman indicates that two <name type="place">New Jersey</name> coppers, Maris 35-W and 56-n, are overstruck on Georgivs Triumpho pieces, while a 1783 Nova Constellatio 1-A is overstruck by a <name type="pname">Maris</name> 72-z (see die linkage above).<ref target="#CH9-n9">9</ref> The reliability of the identification of the undertype of these pieces has been raised by both <name type="pname">Ringo</name> and <name type="pname">Mossman</name> because they have not seen the coins.</p>
            <p>The weight of the Georgivs Triumpho coins is approximately 110 to 135 grains, similar to the Nova Constellatio coppers.<ref target="#CH9-n10">10</ref> The coin's reverse is a fence-like frame with 13 vertical, a direct allusion to the <name type="place">United States</name>. Completing the design, the corners of the cage are sealed by four <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lys,</hi> alluding to the French aid in <name type="place">America</name>. This undoubtedly means that the obverse device attempted to represent <name type="place">Washington</name> because no copies of engraved portraits were accessible. <name type="pname">Fuld</name>, in 1964, argued that the Georgivs Triumpho were fully contemporary.<ref target="#CH9-n11">11</ref>
               <name type="pname">Mossman</name> and <name type="pname">Vlack</name> reported that they circulated in <name type="place">Georgia, Virginia</name> and <name type="place">Florida</name>, but because of the distaste for the <name type="pname">George III</name>-like bust, many were mutilated and then exported to <name type="place">Jamaica</name>. This assumption is without any support and should be rejected for the time being. <name type="pname">Paul Bosco</name> repeats similar information, and adds that the coin is listed in Atkins as number 232, further reinforcing its English origin.<ref target="#CH9-n12">12</ref> It may be assumed that they circulated in <name type="place">England</name> like any other evasion halfpence.</p>

pedigree is <name type="pname">Cy Hunter</name>, <name type="pname">Arthur Conn</name>, <name type="pname">Gould</name>, <name type="pname">Fuld</name> (1952), <name type="pname">Gould</name>, <name type="pname">Groves</name>. In June 1952, the author purchased this piece from Maurice Gould of <name type="place">Boston</name> for what today would be a nominal sum. The authenticity of the coin (or token) seemed unclear, so I took this coin to the 1952 ANA Convention in <name type="place">New York</name> for verification. This was long before non-destructive X-ray techniques were available. Four dealers, <name type="pname">Messrs. John Ford</name>, <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name>, <name type="pname">Richard Picker</name> and <name type="pname">Harvey Stack</name>, studied the piece, and all agreed it was some kind of an electrotype. At that point, it was returned to <name type="pname">Gould</name> and a full refund was made.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Gould</name> was not convinced, expressing his opinion in the 1954 article cited above. After <name type="pname">Gould's</name> death, the piece was acquired for the <name type="pname">Donald Groves</name> collection, and was the subject of a presentation made at the 1984 COAC held at the ANS, and later published in the Proceedings volume (above, n. 15). The thesis, that the coin, ascertained to contain 56% silver, was struck on a cast planchet, is faulty. It is telling that <name type="pname">Walter Breen</name> did not list this "silver" piece in his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia</hi> (although he was fully aware of its existence).</p>
            <p>Let's examine how this piece was made. Undoubtedly it is a full electrotype, using silver, which plates out as well as copper in the conductive wax mold. The flan thickness varies from .80 mm to 2.05 mm; ruling out any possibility that the coin was struck, even on a cast planchet. If a one-inch die, with separate obverse and reverses, were struck, the alignment of the dies from side to side off parallel by 1.25 mm would yield a striking that was extremely weak on one side—which is not the case with the "silver" piece. The X-ray analysis of the piece is misleading, as the obverse and reverse surfaces would be pure silver (electroplating alloys are unlikely), while the soft metal fill into the shells with a mixture of lead and tin would account for their presence. The X-ray data presented by Partrick is the average of the overall metal composition. Theoretically, the composition of the surface only, and of the center only, could be determined, but it is doubtful that it would be worth the expense.</p>

               <p>The Confederatio-Immune <name type="place">Columbia</name> coinage of 1785-86 yielded three very rare <name type="place">Washington</name> pieces.</p>

dian trampling on a crown, with MANUS INIMICA TYRANNIS "This hand is hostile to Tyrants."<ref target="#CH9-n16">16</ref> A deleted paragraph of the Report of the Grand Committee of Continental Congress suggested the name "decad" for the larger copper coin, valued at 1/100 Spanish milled dollar, and for its device a sketch of the union of 13 stars in a circle with a serrated border representing rays, surrounded by CONFEDERATION 1785.<ref target="#CH9-n17">17</ref>
               </p>
               <p>That paragraph was deleted from the printed report either by acting chairman <name type="pname">Hugh Williamson</name>, or by vote of the committee. <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> knew of the Committee's inner workings, and he would have known of the proposed designs (if indeed he was not the instigator), as well as <name type="pname">Wyon's</name> facilities. <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> was the most logical go- between for transmitting the recommended designs and inscriptions presumably to <name type="pname">Wyon</name>, even for patterns for a possible contract coinage, should satisfactory mint equipment not be available. If <name type="pname">Wyon</name> was the engraver, how did the dies reach the <name type="place">United States ca</name>. 1785-86?</p>
               <p>There are various patterns, involving seven obverse dies and six reverses, most of which were eventually muled with each other in some 14 combinations. Of interest here is <name type="pname">Breen</name> Obverse 4 showing the uniformed bust right, GEN. <name type="place">WASHINGTON</name>. This comes combined with the reverse later used on <name type="place">New Jersey</name> copper coinage (broad shield in center, E PLURIBUS UNUM around, <name type="pname">Maris</name> 4-C,<ref target="#CH9-n18">18</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Baker</name> 11). It also occurs with the same obverse 4 combined with <name type="pname">Breen</name> reverse D, with circle of 13 large stars within long rays; <name type="pname">Crosby</name> obverse 2, one die supposedly brought to <name type="place">U.S.</name> by <name type="pname">Mould</name>. As stated below this "fact" is unlikely. The third <name type="place">Washington</name> muling, the rarest of the series, has the obverse of <name type="pname">Breen</name> 4, with reverse G showing an eagle displayed, on his breast a shield argent, six pales gules, a chief azure; a bundle of arrows in his right talon, and an olive branch in left hand; about his head, 13 stars, around, * E • PLURIBUS • UNUM • 1786. <name type="pname">Breen</name> based his assumptions as to the engraver of these dies on the fact that Mould worked in <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, from which he concluded he worked for <name type="pname">Wyon</name> (a stretch of course)—his presence in <name type="place">Birmingham</name> was in 1783, thus making it nearly impossible for him to obtain vintage 1785 or 1786 dies.<ref target="#CH9-n19">19</ref> Certainly this die was not conveyed by <name type="pname">Walter</name> Mould to the Morristown Mint and muled with another coarse obverse. There is no reason to reject the fact that <name type="pname">Maris</name> reverse C was not engraved at the Morristown mint. Certainly it is crude enough and not worthy of <name type="pname">Wyon's</name> expertise. As <name type="pname">Hodder</name> points out, some of <name type="pname">Breen's</name> suppositions are based on slim foundations, but have become unsupported facts. These three pieces, per <name type="pname">Breen's</name> notation, are 4/<name type="pname">Maris</name>

C; 4/D and 4/G. There are deceptive Bolen copies of some Confederatio's, but none with the <name type="place">Washington</name> bust. Certainly further evidence is required before concluding that <name type="pname">Wyon</name> of <name type="place">Birmingham</name> made most of the dies for these three issues, which were extensively muled together. All the Confederatio patterns are denoted "decads" as proposed by the Continental Congress, valued at 1/100 per Spanish dollar. This nomenclature was deleted from the final report, although some designs were proposed.<ref target="#CH9-n20">20</ref>

               <p>The <name type="place">New York</name> issue of the NON VI VIRTUTE VICI cent showing <name type="place">Washington</name> was issued in limited quantities in 1786.

               <p>As mentioned previously, most of the balance of the <name type="place">Washington</name> coinage is English tokens of the extensive "Conder" series.<ref target="#CH9-n22">22</ref> The initial pieces are the "small eagle" and "large eagle" cents of 1791, engraved by <name type="pname">John Gregory Hancock</name>, Jr. (1775-1815) of <name type="place">Birmingham</name>. He was a juvenile prodigy and became one of the finest artists in the history of eighteenth century British diemaking.<ref target="#CH9-n23">23</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Ford</name> (below, n. 29) states that <name type="pname">Hancock</name> was an employee of Obadiah Westwood of <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, who ran a large private mint there. <name type="pname">Hancock</name> received the honorific assignment of making dies for two types of cents, portraying <name type="pname">George Washington</name>. These were to be samples of a proposed Federal contract ordered by <name type="pname">W. and Alex. Walker</name> of <name type="place">Birmingham</name>.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Walker</name> shipped a cask (conjecturally one hundred weight = 112 lbs, about 4,000 cents, estimated to be 2,500 Large Eagle and 1,500 Small Eagle) to the firm's <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> associates, <name type="pname">Thomas Ketland</name> &amp; Sons, for distribution to cabinet officials, senators, congressmen and other VIPs.<ref target="#CH9-n24">24</ref> These pieces arrived during the debate of the <name type="pname">Morris</name> bill, which initially proposed the coins to portray President <name type="place">Washington</name>, and most committee members objected to any private coinage contract. This doomed the British proposal, but the 1791 cents went into circulation. Large Eagle cents are found uncirculated; Small Eagle cents rarely uncirculated; both issues very elusive in red uncirculated condition. The portrait was modeled after <name type="pname">Du Simitiere's</name> drawing.

sales. The regular issues all have the edge lettered <name type="place">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</name>, while many of the trials have typical "Conder" type edges from other English eighteenth century tokens or plain edges. The ten or so patterns of the Large and Small Eagle cents known are listed below. This series of 1791 and 1792 was discussed in some detail by <name type="pname">Breen</name> in a serial article in 1973.<ref target="#CH9-n25">25</ref>

               <p>Reverse die trial of Large Eagle cent. Copper, 190.3 grains. Very similar to adopted die, but there is no outline around the shield as on the regular issue. Top of O of ONE is closed. Every other detail is identical to the regular issue, leading to the possibility that this trial die was altered to the regular die. The reverse is blank, but rough, with scratched on numbers "41474" which may refer to the job or shop number of the piece.

               <p>An oddly struck pattern, apparently showing the regular <name type="place">Washington</name> obverse date 1791, with a Large Eagle die trial reverse struck on a very large flan of 32.3 mm diameter. The flan is very thin, about 1 mm, and the edge of the beading of the obverse and reverse is at least 1 mm in from the edge. The coin has been canceled by a small burred roller leaving about 6 mm groves, and then apparently machine canceled. In the outside area between the beads and the rim, appears PLURBUS E UNUM in raised letters, in mirror image and hand cut. There is no trace of the shield on the eagle's breast, although the cancellation may have obscured it. There is a ribbon in the eagle's beak, but only an incused M from UNUM and E on the right side are apparent. Struck in copper, but the obverse is fire gilt, with much worn away, while traces of gilt appear about the edge of the reverse. Traces of lettering on the edge, with only ABLE discernable. Weight 127.5 grains. Ex. <name type="pname">A. Hepner</name>, <name type="pname">Jerry Tralins</name>, <name type="pname">A.M. Kagin</name>, private collection.

               <p>The Getz coinage, engraved by <name type="pname">Peter Getz</name> of <name type="place">Lancaster, PA</name>, was made in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in accordance with the <name type="pname">Morris</name> Coinage proposal of December 21, 1791. <name type="pname">John Ford</name> summarized the then current knowledge about the Getz coinage in 1975.<ref target="#CH9-n29">29</ref> His information is abridged herewith. <name type="pname">Per Don Taxay</name>, <name type="pname">Robert Birch</name> (of the 1792 Birch cent fame) supervised Getz's work on the dies and sank the punches for the date and legends.<ref target="#CH9-n30">30</ref> All the regular Getz coins (copper or silver) have a common obverse and reverse, except for a unique piece showing a large eagle (<name type="pname">Baker</name> 23). All authorities (<name type="pname">Breen</name>, <name type="pname">Taxay</name>, <name type="pname">Ford</name>, <name type="pname">Fuld</name>) agree that the 1791 <name type="place">Birmingham</name> issues of <name type="pname">Westwood-Hancock</name> served as a model for the Getz issues.</p>
               <p>It is unanimous that the only coins struck in the <name type="place">United States</name> in this period are the Getz issues. The half dollars accurately represent the devices and legends required by the <name type="pname">Morris</name> bill of December 21, 1791. This is the original bill that <name type="place">Washington</name> objected to since it proposed his likeness. After several modifications, it was signed into law by <name type="place">Washington</name> as Statute One on April 2, 1792.</p>
               <p>Whether silver or copper issues were struck first has had several diverse advocates. <name type="pname">Taxay</name> stated that the silver half dollars were struck first (which is unlikely) so that they could be presented to members of the Senate when the <name type="pname">Morris</name> bill was discussed. <name type="pname">Baker</name> felt that copper pieces were struck for presentation to the <name type="pname">Morris</name>
                  <pb n="184"/>
committee during their deliberations. <name type="pname">Breen</name> tended to agree with <name type="pname">Baker</name> and estimated some 100 copper pieces were struck for the 29 Senators and 65 Representatives, serving from December 1791 to March 1792. <name type="pname">Breen</name> based his conclusion that copper came first on comments in <name type="pname">Snowden</name>, but his opinion is not unanimous. However, <name type="pname">Hodder</name> concludes that the copper was struck first on the basis of lack of die rust on stars of the reverse, while silver pieces all have rust to varying degrees.<ref target="#CH9-n31">31</ref> In addition, he feels that the window of striking from December of 1791 to early April 1792 is narrow enough to make multiple strikings a mute point. First impressions were taken in the basement of <name type="pname">John Harper's</name> saw factory, located at the corner of Sixth and Cherry Streets, <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. The second strikings were made on a press constructed by <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name>, who was for many years the Chief Coiner of the Mint. The <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> press was in an old coach house on Sixth Street, above Chestnut Street, also in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. The precise location on Sixth is not clear. The 1792 half dismes and dismes were also struck in <name type="pname">Harper's</name> basement, albeit on a smaller press. Which came first is academic and resembles the classic "chicken and egg" puzzle.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Jack Collins</name> is currently compiling pedigree data on all Getz pieces, with illustrations wherever possible.<ref target="#CH9-n32">32</ref> It is estimated by <name type="pname">Ford</name> and <name type="pname">Fuld</name> that 40-50 plain edge copper pieces and 5-6 ornamented edge copper pieces exist. The silver pieces are estimated at 12-15 plain edge pieces, 4-5 with circles and squares, 2 known specimens with twin olive leaves, and 3 overstrikes, a single overstrike on the 1697 British halfcrown, an overstrike on a Spanish colonies 4 reales, and another on a French half Ecu for a total of about 21-25 pieces. The copper pieces may be for cents and the silver pieces for half dollars, but only one denomination would be practical in the same size and design.</p>
               <p>The weights of the Getz pieces show variations from 193 to 248.75 grains for the silver specimens and 208 to 273 grains for the copper cents. The <name type="pname">Morris</name> bill specified 208 to 264 grains, so the Getz issues fall within that limit. Copper Getz pieces from that period are not grossly abused. Even uncirculated specimens exist. Regarding the silver specimens, many are known holed (for neck or watch hangers?) and many are badly worn from being carried in the pocket. Uncirculated silver pieces are rarely, if ever, encountered. Of note is that while the ratio of silver to copper survivors is estimated to be almost 1 to 2, somehow silver ones seem to be more elusive than that.</p>

               <p>The Roman Head pieces, listed next, were the subject of a <name type="pname">Breen</name> article in 1971, entitled "<name type="pname">Hancock's</name> Revenge."<ref target="#CH9-n42">42</ref> When news of <name type="place">Washington's</name> rejection of his portrait on coins reached <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, <name type="pname">John Gregory Hancock</name> (doubtless with Westwood's gleeful consent, possibly even at his instigation) undertook an extraordinary piece of revenge. As <name type="place">Washington's</name> spokesman had compared the idea of presidential portraits on coins to the practices of <name type="pname">Nero</name>, <name type="pname">Caligula</name>, and <name type="pname">Cromwell</name>, so <name type="pname">Hancock's</name> (and/or <name type="pname">Westwood's</name>) idea was to portray <name type="place">Washington</name> on a coin as a degenerate, effeminate Roman emperor. <name type="pname">Hancock's</name> satirical masterpiece, the "Roman Head" cents, manage to convey this impression—with a subtle family resemblance. Their eagle attempts to "cock a snook" with his nearer wing; the Small Eagle die's eight stars have shrunk to six. The dozen or so survivors were privately distributed among <name type="pname">Hancock's</name> and <name type="pname">Westwood's</name> friends in <name type="place">Birmingham</name>; their existence was kept secret for over 40 years lest it become an "international incident!"

               <p>The General of the Army pieces made at the same time are almost all well worn—perhaps a single keg partially filled with these coins was transported to the States.

               <p>The first recorded owner (after perhaps George Washington) was <name type="pname">Gustavus A.

possession, a rough sketch of which I enclose; and which, although much worn, is still the full value of the American eagle, namely, ten dollars. On inquiring at the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint, in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, a few years since, I found that, in the collection there of specimens of all the federal coins, none like this existed. It attracted much curiosity; but nothing of its history could be learned. A very intelligent officer of the institution informed me, that he conjectured it was stamped in Birmingham. The name of <name type="place">Washington</name> President, appearing upon it, renders it an object of greater interest; as it is generally understood, and believed, that while that distinguished man was president of the <name type="place">United States</name>, learning that a coinage was about to be stamped at the mint, bearing his effigy, he immediately arrested the preceding <hi rend="italic">[sic].</hi> A few copper coins had however been struck, which were never issued; and which I believe are still preserved in the collection to which I have above referred. No gold or silver coin of the same stamp was ever struck in the <name type="place">United States of America</name>. The coin in my possession was evidently intended for circulation. Its style of execution is rather rough, and the motto upon the scroll in the eagle's beak, ‘Unum e pluribus,' is not correct: that upon the federal money having been, ‘E pluribus unum.' If you through any of your readers, afford me any information touching the subject of my inquiry, your will greatly oblige <name type="pname">G.A. Myers</name>, <name type="place">Richmond, Virginia</name> (<name type="place">U.S.A</name>.)."</p>
               <p>To which the following footnote was appended:</p>
               <p>"(This American piece was struck at <name type="place">Birmingham</name> by <name type="pname">Hancock</name>, an engraver of dies of considerable talent. Of these pieces there are several varieties: one, without date on the obverse; on reverse, American eagle, shield on breast, olive branch in one claw, arrows in the other; <name type="place">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</name>;' below '1791.' Another, date under head, '1791;' reverse, eagle as above, but larger; in beak a scroll. ‘UNUM E PLURIBUS;' above, ‘ONE CENT,' no stars, cloud or date. Another profile of <name type="place">Washington</name> to the right, fillet round the head, no dress; legend as above; date ‘1792,' reverse, eagle with shield olive and arrows; above, ‘CENT,' Edges of all the same. These are all of copper and were said to have been patterns for an intended coinage, but not approved.)"</p>
               <p>There are some obvious errors in <name type="pname">Myers's</name> letter, as in 1795, the eagle weighed 270 grains, so that this piece is light. <name type="pname">Newman</name>, by inference, concludes that the gold "eagle" was presented to <name type="place">Washington</name>, by <name type="pname">Westwood's</name> representative. It was common practice to make sample presentations to heads of state or committees when attempting to secure a contract. Certainly it is hard to contradict

                  <name type="pname">Newman</name>'s thesis that this was <name type="place">Washington's</name> pocket piece. With one struck in gold, who was the more deserving recipient than <name type="place">Washington</name>?</p>

               <p>North Wales with head right. We are listing this piece, which probably does not exist. Reported as Snowden 101, and <name type="pname">Baker</name> 36 from a worn piece—undoubtedly a Bungtown. No trace of this variety has been reported. <name type="pname">Breen</name> 1299.</p>
               <p>The SUCCESS tokens are undated, but as summarized by <name type="pname">Breen</name> were made in the period 1792-95, very possibly for <name type="place">Washington's</name> second inauguration in March 1793. J. Doyle DeWitt followed <name type="pname">Woodward</name>'s theory that <name type="pname">Jacob Perkins</name> of <name type="place">Newburyport, MA</name>, made them to be "worn" at the inauguration.<ref target="#CH9-n50">50</ref> But there are no existent holders and they are rarely seen holed or mounted.</p>
               <p>The most convincing evidence as to their period is the All-Seeing eye design, with 15 stars for the 15 states on the reverse, an obvious illusion to the old NOVA CONSTELLATIO device of 1783-85. The outside limit would be the admission of the sixteenth state, Tennessee, on June 1, 1796, bracketing the issue from 1792-95. There is no other background on the tokens in the contemporary literature. <name type="pname">Baker</name> assumed made in the U.S., but pieces found in both English and American collections, so provenance is unclear. That they circulated
<pb n="211"/>
is evidenced by the well-worn survival of most pieces. <name type="pname">DeWitt</name> mentions copper restrikes, but these have not been encountered. There are three obverse dies and one reverse for the larger piece (no denomination is assignable) and only single dies for the smaller piece. The large size is 25.4 mm, small size 19.4 mm.</p>

               <p>The Getz dollar, undoubtedly a medal. A most interesting piece, rediscovered about 1960 and described by <name type="pname">Fuld</name> and <name type="pname">Newman</name>.<ref target="#CH9-n51">51</ref> This piece was listed by <name type="pname">Snowden</name> as being in the Mint collection. Actually it was lent by <name type="pname">H. Drumheller</name> of <name type="place">Schuylkill, PA</name>, and only temporarily deposited at the Mint. It remained untraced for the next 100 years until it came into possession of <name type="pname">Louis R. Karp</name> (<name type="pname">James</name>, Inc.) of <name type="place">Louisville, KY</name>, in 1960.</p>
               <p>The piece itself is die struck over a Mexican 8 reales, with the obverse hub of the Getz 1792 "half dollar" (<name type="pname">Baker</name> 288) with the date restamped 1796, and the reverse of the Getz 1792 "small" eagle die. The dies are half dollar size, but struck on a dollar size coin. <name type="pname">Hodder</name> identified the undertype as a dollar struck after 1772, when the "squares" edge ornamentation was introduced.<ref target="#CH9-n52">52</ref> It is most certainly of the reign of <name type="pname">Charles III</name> (1772-89) or <name type="pname">Charles IV</name> (1789-1808). The undertype is only visible above the CA. on the reverse, where the remains of EX, and the base of the left pillar of the undertype may be seen. The heavy file marks are the result of planing down the original type, accounting for the 55 grain loss from the weight of the pillar coin. The rays about the edge are struck using a hand stamping tool, and some show overlapping after striking. It is important to realize that the bust on the 1796 piece is identical to the 1792 die, and not the 1797 Masonic medal die. The period of issue is not firm (Getz died at age 36 as the result of an accident in
<pb n="214"/>
1804). One Getz 1792 issue is known struck over a 1794/5 large cent flan, another over a 1795-96 cent, so that an issue date of 1796 is not improbable. The 1796 date is not an altered die, but a completely new impression in the die.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Newman</name> and <name type="pname">Fuld</name> concluded that this is a medal and never intended to be a coin. <name type="pname">Baker</name> 33, <name type="pname">Snowden</name> XI, 43, <name type="pname">Breen</name> 1359.

Vlack</name> and the author made a concerted effort to study all possible die varieties of the 1783 <name type="place">Washington</name> cent series. Only three out of a total of 33 varieties have been discovered in the ensuing 35 years. Vlack wrote this data in great detail in the <hi rend="italic">CNL</hi> of July 1978 and numbering and composite rarities will be assigned based on that treatise.<ref target="#CH9-n54">54</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As <name type="pname">Breen</name> stated, the mystery of these 1783 cents remained so for over 100 years. Specialists in Colonials and Washingtonia have collected these pieces since the 1850s. The advent of restrikes in the late 1850s brought even more interest to the "original" 1783 pieces. Allusions to the restrikes in such popular works as <name type="pname">Dickeson</name>
                  <ref target="#CH9-n55">55</ref> and <name type="pname">Snowden</name> brought credence to the series. Even <name type="pname">Crosby</name> included them among "those struck in the eighteenth century" (p. 349).</p>
               <p>That view did not survive among the skeptics who realized that the reverse of the <name type="place">Unity States</name> cents was copied from the 1796-1807 <name type="place">U.S.</name> large cents, and the wording <name type="place">UNITY STATES</name> smacks of the evasion wording commonly used with the Bungtown series of the 1790s. There is the obvious point that the resemblance to regular coinage was meant to deceive the illiterate and an attempt to evade the counterfeiting laws (as of 1806, these laws only applied to copper and silver coinage). The rough planchets with gridwork near the borders possibly was intended to partially obscure the word UNITY. The first author to clearly question the origin of the 1783 cent series was <name type="pname">Frank C. Higgins</name>
                  <ref target="#CH9-n56">56</ref> but earlier <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> and <name type="pname">DuBois</name>
                  <ref target="#CH9-n57">57</ref> and <name type="pname">John H. Hickcox</name>
                  <ref target="#CH9-n58">58</ref> clearly questioned the origins of some of the 1783 series.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Fuld</name> made 15 points as proof of the origin of these cents, presumed to have been made by <name type="pname">Boulton</name> and <name type="pname">Watts's Soho</name> Mint at <name type="place">Birmingham</name>. <name type="pname">Fuld</name> delineated the proof that the 1783 cents (with the exception of the Georgivs Triumpho coin) were made in the 1815-20 period.<ref target="#CH9-n59">59</ref> These include: no portrait of <name type="place">Washington</name> similar to the

1783 cents was available in <name type="place">Europe</name> at that time; the word "cent" was not conceived or used for coinage until 1786; the model for the <name type="pname">Unity States</name> reverse was not used until at least 1796; the type of border denticles used on this coinage was not adopted on English coinage until 1806; the corded edge seen on some coinage was first used on coins in 1806 and on tokens in 1812; the bust on the military bust cents strongly resembles Field <name type="pname">Marshal Wellington</name> pieces struck after 1810 for <name type="place">Canada</name>; the design for the seated Liberty reverse was used for Britannia by <name type="pname">Kuchler</name> at Soho Mint starting in 1797; the date 1783 has its own significance of the signing the Treaty of <name type="place">Paris</name> ending the Revolution; the hubbing process for making virtually identical dies for the military and draped bust cents was technically unfeasible until well after 1805; <name type="pname">Lord's</name> detector of 1853<ref target="#CH9-n60">60</ref> indicates these coins were still in circulation in 1853; no English token books of the 1790s mentions these coins (tokens?); the two sets of dies for restriking in 1851 and 1860 are much more likely being 20 to 30 years after manufacture, rather than 70 years; the Flimby Park overstrike coin could not have occurred before 1815; the initials T.W.I. and E.S. have been identified as <name type="pname">Thomas Wells Ingram</name> and <name type="pname">Edward Savage</name>. Ingram issued dated calender medals in 1827-28 which were very similar to <name type="pname">Kempson</name> issues.<ref target="#CH9-n61">61</ref> Ingram, even if a boy genius, was born in 1799!; <name type="pname">Frank C. Higgins</name> as previously mentioned strongly disagreed with <name type="pname">Crosby</name> as to the emission period of the "1783" cents.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Boulton</name> certainly intended no fraud using the 1783 date, commemorating the Treaty of <name type="place">Paris</name> which ended the Revolution, and <name type="place">Washington's</name> disbanding of the Continental Armies. Starting in 1797, <name type="pname">Boulton</name> and <name type="pname">Watt</name> were making current coins and planchets for the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> Mint; their Soho Mint was too much in the public eye, barring occasional coins for collectors, to do anything outright fraudulent. Most people such as New York and <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> merchants openly imported these "1783" <name type="place">Washingtons</name> by the dozens or even hundreds of kegs, at a fraction of a cent apiece; no law forbade import or circulation of private tokens. At 60 to the lb.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> 6,720 to the cwt.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> 134,400 per long ton, these were not only profitable, they were a familiar way of dealing with shortages of small change, easier than waiting for more expensive Federal cents. Cents (lacking legal tender quality) had no real advantage over tokens. The obvious occasion for such large orders in the 1815-20 period was the coin shortage of 1815-17. Most likely the merchant who ordered the Draped Bust coins sent along a <name type="place">Unity States</name> as prototype; the one who ordered military busts may have furnished a Large or Small Eagle cent or sketch.</p>

               <p>Further proof of their late circulation was Thompson in 1848<ref target="#CH9-n62">62</ref> and <name type="pname">Lord's</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cincinnati Detector</hi> of 1853<ref target="#CH9-n63">63</ref> indicated they were still in circulation. They circulated long and hard, and are commonly found in good or fair condition today.</p>

Liberty seated facing left with olive branch in right hand, pole and liberty cap in left. Liberty cap touches right side of base of A of STATES. The second leaf from the bottom of the branch on the left has a tiny die break showing a period-like effect at the end of the leaf. A smaller and similar break also occurs at the end of the third leaf up from the bottom

7, through 83 and to the rim. Top three leaves close to N of INDEPENDENCE, mostly weak denticles. The main toga fold curves over the 7 and ends over the center of the 1. The I of INDEPENDENCE points very slightly left of a bead. The 7 points at a bead. The C is defective on top. Many of the letters may be recut, especially the NGTON and IND and ND. The 3 has a period directly in back in its apex, and is very close. The two observed specimens have the die break from rim between the 7 and 8 curving through the 8 and 3 and ending at the rim between the 3 and period. Some defective beads. Reverse K has liberty cap just missing right side of base of A of STATES. Olive branch lightly engraved, denticles weak at 6 o'clock, is reworked from reverse J with absence of period-like break at branch, and no curls along the back of the neck. Die break as a chip occurs in back of D. The left of A is heavy, probably from a rusted die. This reverse is used with the <name type="place">Melbourne</name> muling, 1783.M1. Weight 127-128 grains.

Some specimens have been seen that are bronzed. <name type="pname">Vlack</name> 17-L. Weight about 140 grains. Obverse 17 has all three top leaves fully visible, the right leaf point right of center of N of INDEPENDENCE. The main toga fold curves over the 7 and ends over the extreme right edge of the upright of the 1. The A has a flat top and is pointing to a bead. The I of INDEPENDENCE has a bead over its center. The upright of the 7 points slightly right of a bead. The O is recut along its bottom, and the 1 and 7 also show recutting. The 1 of 1783 reengraved with a center line down the numeral. Reverse 1 very similar to reverse A, but lettering more fully cut, heavy olive branch. The cap is very close to the right leg of A, but does not touch. The I has a bead over its right center, and the A, which has a flat top, is pointing between beads. The right upright of

the U slants left. Reverse die breaks develop across the tops of ATES extending to the water line. Later, another break occurs from the right side of the base of T in UNITED touching the right serif of the T, extending to the rim. Rumors persist that plain edge pieces exist, but none have ever been verified. This is by far the most common restrike. R-1. One specimen has corded edge over a reeded edge, reported by <name type="pname">Collins</name>.</p>
               <p>These dies may have been unused from the original 1818-20 period, but there is no "original" to match to these restrikes. The dies for this piece were preserved and were resold by Kelly, Aug. 25, 1950 (ANA), 1049. ex <name type="pname">B.G. Johnson</name>, They were purchased by a collector, Ruder from Ohio, who retired to <name type="place">Florida</name>. When his collection was dispersed, Stacks of <name type="place">New York</name> had a transfer die made from the dies and struck uniface copies with an advertising reverse in 1988. The original dies were then donated, in Ruder's name, to the Smithsonian Institution (see figs. 67-68, courtesy of the Numismatic Division, SI. The Stack's restrikes are fig. 69).</p>

               <p>To illustrate the wide distribution of these pieces, some ten obverse dies and seven reverse dies exist, making up a total of ten different combinations (see below, Tables 2 and 3).</p>
               <p>Using <name type="pname">Mossman's</name> figures of 18,000 to 50,000 pieces as the lifetime of dies in this period,<ref target="#CH9-n70">70</ref> the following calculations can be made. Using an average lifetime, and basing output on average die life (many of the dies show various die breaks as noted), the estimated output of Military bust cents, made in the 1815-20 period, was 240,000 pieces. As virtually no specimens are known with mint red color, one may assume that all these pieces were placed in circulation both in <name type="place">England</name> and <name type="place">America</name>.

In exergue, 1783. Reverse a seated figure of Liberty, with an olive branch in her extended right hand, and supporting in her left, the staff and liberty cap. Above. <name type="place">UNITED STATES</name>; in exergue, T.W.I. E.S. These initials have been identified by <name type="pname">Fuld</name>: T.W.I. stands for Thomas Wells Ingram of <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, a die sinker who started practicing about 1820; E.S. apparently stand for <name type="pname">Edward Savage</name>, whose portrait the design was modeled after. <name type="pname">Baker</name>, RF-4a, <name type="pname">Vlack</name> 1-A, <name type="pname">Breen</name> 1201. Obverse 1, W of <name type="place">Washington</name> far from bust, all other varieties have W under corner of bust. The point of the wreath is close to, but not touching the base of the I. The beads are very fine and close. There is a long crossbar to the G which is close to, but not touching the left serif of T. The C is defective on top, and the A at the right base. The obverse comes fairly regularly with extensive die cracks. A break, from the time, to the point of the bust through the space between period and W. Another from the rim through the center of the first N of <name type="place">WASHINGTON</name> toward the chin. A break connects the base of WASHIN to the two previously mentioned breaks. A break from the rim through the upright of the first E of INDEPENDENCE to the wreath at the center of the head. From this break, another connects EPENDENCE along the bottoms and ends over the date. A break from the rim through the right side of the C to the previously mentioned break. The reverse has three berries on the branch. The cap extends between the T and the A, and touches the A. The I has two beads equally spaced over it, and the A points slightly to the right of a bead. The T of the initials is over the left side of a bead, and the S of the initials is over a bead with the lower curve of the S pointing to the lower portion of the

               <p>A different Small Bust die variety showing different obverse die cracks than the preceding. Not in <name type="pname">Vlack</name>. From NNC 60th Sale, Lot 473 (1968). No duplicate has been reported. Combination la/A. This piece, although called extremely fine, was very dark with verdigris on the reverse. Described in the sale as "We can find no evidence on this coin of the obv. or rev. die cracks that are usually identified with the Small Bust variety. Instead, there is a break in the r. obverse field which follows an irregular course down from under the second E to a ‘thread' projecting like a short ribbon end from the bottom corner of the lower bow. A break-like defect, parallel to the middle of the crack just described, lies in the field above it adjacent to two similar, smaller and less obvious defects. Also, the 7 in date has a spur projecting diagonally to the left from its top right corner, and the two base points of the W are connected by a short break." These breaks might account for the scarcity of this obverse die. Present location not known. Unique at the present time.</p>

               <p>Draped bust with button, 1783, <name type="pname">Baker</name> 5, <name type="pname">Vlack</name> 20-P. Originally listed by <name type="pname">Baker</name> from the <name type="pname">Crosby</name> Sale, Lot 284 as unique. Although still rare, there are four distinct die varieties of this piece with 3 obverse and three reverse dies. A fifth variety has been described that has a button on the drapery, but is probably a contemporary counterfeit and does not resemble the other types. The rarity of the four pieces shows that combination 20-Q is the rarest, while the other three combinations, 20-P, 21-Q and 22-R, rate about the same, with about 6 to 10 each known, the 20-Q is quite rare. The contemporary counterfeit, 24-T, listed earlier is apparently unique. The general description of all pieces is as follows: Bust in a Roman mantle, facing left, laureated, with button on drapery above date. Legend, <name type="place">WASHINGTON</name> &amp; INDEPENDENCE • 1783 •. Reverse, design same as on WA.NC.1783.7 through 1783.17. A seated figure of Liberty, with an olive branch in her extended right hand, and supporting in her left, the staff and liberty cap. Legend, <name type="place">UNITED STATES</name>; in exergue, T.W.I. E.S. Obverse 20 has the A pointing slightly to the right of a bead, and the I of INDEPENDENCE has a bead about over its center. A heavy bead sometimes shows near the rim below the 8, and another slightly right of the 1. Die break from the rim through the last N of <name type="place">WASHINGTON</name> to the bottom of the &amp; sign, to the first leaf of the wreath. Another from the rim to between the W and A. A minor break also connects the H and I along the bottom. Reverse P has the cap extending between the A and T and touches the T. The center of the I and A points left of a bead. The T of the initials is over a bead. The S of the initials is over a bead, is slightly higher then the E, with the lower curve of the S pointing to the center of the period. <hi rend="italic">There is no period after the S. The D in UNITED has a period in its center.</hi> Die break along the bottom of N connecting the base of ITE, with another connecting UNI about one-third down the height of the letters. <name type="pname">Breen</name> 1 198, R-6.</p>

               <p>Double Head cent, assigned <name type="pname">Vlack</name> 29-Y by Ringo.<ref target="#CH9-n71">71</ref> This piece has flat rims giving it the appearance of being in lower relief. The planchet is 1 mm larger (28 mm) and the edge is rounded rather than squared off. Possibly struck outside a collar, weight 131.8 grains. Die differences are the central point of the star below the bust points between two beads, instead of at a bead as on 28-Y. The centers of the two right legs on the N's each point at a bead, they point between the beads on the 28-Y. The cord above the epaulet on the new obverse is longer, and the ends curve outward with a triangular projection inside. On the 28-Y, the cord is shorter with straight ends, and there is a bead inside it. The bow in the hair is detached from the braid, and the frill on the coat is made up of two separate sections. Possibly a trial strike before 1783.NC.24, and only one reported. R-8.</p>

            <p>Between 1776 and 1787, Congress authorized the creation of 11 medals in gold or silver to be presented to major heroes in the Revolutionary War.<ref target="#CH10-n1">1</ref> Up to that time, few medals had been struck in <name type="place">America</name>, and these mostly under emergency conditions and with varying quality. Through the practice of giving medals to the leaders of allied Indian tribes, British and French medals had become common in the colonies.<ref target="#CH10-n2">2</ref> As <name type="place">France</name> was <name type="place">America's</name> leading ally in the struggle, and the recognized master of medallic art in the period, it was there that Congress turned for the production of these medals.</p>
            <p>The production was overseen by an American representative in <name type="place">Paris</name>, who transmitted the wishes of Congress, and whatever details on the battle were available, to the Académie des Inscriptions, which decided on appropriate Latin legends and allegorical themes. A common theme on most was the use of the phrase COMITIA AMERICANA to translate "American Congress." The design of the medal was then commissioned to individual artists, who used whatever portraits might be available and engraved the dies, using hubs for the central motifs and individual letter punches for the legends. The artists involved in these medals were <name type="pname">Pierre Simon Benjamin Duvivier, Nicolas Marie Gatteaux</name>, and <name type="pname">Augustin Dupre</name>, three of the leading medalists for French coins, jetons, and royal medals of the period. The medals were struck at the French mint, which usually kept the dies.</p>
            <p>Many delays ensued in the design and execution of the individual medals. The first completed was that awarded to <name type="pname">Francois de Fleury</name> and given to him in <name type="place">Paris</name> in 1783. Most of the others were seen for the first time when they were included in a set of 11 silver medals given to <name type="pname">George Washington</name> in 1790 and now in the collection of the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Historical Society. This set lacked the medal voted for <name type="pname">John Paul Jones</name>, which was just being completed, and that for <name type="pname">Henry Lee</name>, which apparently had been forgotten. Congress quickly commissioned the American engraver <name type="pname">Joseph Wright</name> to make a substitute medal for <name type="pname">Lee</name>, generally following the format of the French ones. Two medals were included in the set given to <name type="place">Washington</name> which had not been authorized by Congress: the Libertas Americana medal which had been undertaken by <name type="pname">Benjamin Franklin</name>, and a portrait medal of Franklin. Soon after receiving his set, and his own gold medal, <name type="place">Washington</name> ordered the creation of a medal to be given to foreign dignitaries who had aided the infant Republic; this Diplomatic Medal was the last of the official American medals to be made in <name type="place">France</name>.</p>
            <p>In addition to the medals presented to the designated individuals and those in the set given to <name type="place">Washington</name>, other examples have been
<pb n="263"/>
made over the years. In many cases, the <name type="place">Paris</name> mint has kept the dies in active use from the eighteenth century to the present, creating restrikes in various metals on order from customers. Beginning in 1832, it adopted the practice of stamping the edge of gold and silver restrikes with an identifying mark, and, in 1841, extended this to all metals and added the name of the metal in French: OR (gold), ARGENT (silver), CUIVRE (copper) and BRONZE (bronze). The date ranges for the various symbols are: "antique lamp," 1832-41; "anchor intertwined with C," 1841-42; "galley prow," 1842-45; "pointing hand," 1845-60; "bee," 1860-79; "cornucopia," 1880 to present.<ref target="#CH10-n3">3</ref>

            <p>In the course of the nineteenth century, restrikes were undertaken for some of the medals in the series by the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. The earliest efforts were in the 1860s, when examples struck in <name type="place">Paris</name> were hubbed to make new dies of gun metal. These were then used to strike medals which were basically identical with the originals, but had much less clarity. Later in the century, new dies were made in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, copied from the original medals but newly modelled and with different letter punches. Only in the
<pb n="264"/>
case of the <name type="pname">de Fleury, Howard</name>, and Diplomatic Medals was there any overt indication of the origin of these American restrikes. For the <name type="place">United States</name> Bicentennial celebrations in 1976, the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint issued a set of 11 pewter copies of the authorized medals in a set called "<name type="place">America's</name> First Medals"; these are uniformly 38 mm in diameter and are not included in the catalogue below.</p>
            <p>The catalogue describes all examples of the medals of the Comitia Americana series currently in the collection of the American Numismatic Society. They represent the gifts and bequests of two dozen individuals who have helped to build the collection through their generosity; those for which provenance is listed as unknown were mostly acquired in the nineteenth century. Also included are photos of original examples, those in gold awarded to <name type="place">Washington</name> and Gates, and the silver pieces in the set given to <name type="place">Washington</name> in 1790.I am thankful to the various institutions and individuals who made these available for publication here, especially to <name type="pname">John W. Adams</name>, who made available <name type="pname">John J. Ford</name>, Jr.'s excellent photographs of the <name type="place">Massachusetts</name> Historical Society pieces and arranged for the permission for their publication. The medals are grouped by die combination and in approximate order of striking. References are in chronological order; they are to bronze specimens unless otherwise indicated.<ref target="#CH10-n4">4</ref>

               <p>The medal was authorized by Congress on March 25, 1776, only a week after the engagement it celebrates. It took another 14 years, however, before the gold striking could be presented to then President <name type="place">Washington</name>. The medal was produced under the supervision first of <name type="pname">Robert Morris</name>, then of <name type="pname">David Humphreys</name>, and finally of <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>. The legends and design were worked out by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and the dies were engraved by the chief engraver of the <name type="place">Paris</name> Mint, <name type="pname">Benjamin Duvivier</name>. The obverse portrait was copied from a marble bust by <name type="pname">Jean Antoine Houdon</name>. The completed gold medal was presented to <name type="place">Washington</name> by <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> on March 21, 1790; at the same time <name type="place">Washington</name> received a mahogany box containing a silver striking of this plus 10 other medals in this series. The <name type="place">Paris</name> Mint has struck versions of this medal from 1790 through the present, using at least two obverse dies and four reverses. Copy dies were made from a French striking by the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> mint in 1863 and used to strike medals until 1884, when new dies were engraved there.</p>

                  <p>This die is known from two white metal splashers (<name type="pname">Garrett</name> and no. 11 below), and from a copper electrotype (<name type="pname">Dreyfuss</name>) which lacks the artist's signature. A French sketch of the obverse from 1788 which has an exergue line below the bust suggests that this was an early trial for the medal, as does the observation that the <name type="pname">Garrett</name> splasher is paired with a splasher of Reverse A. It is usually thought to have been made earlier than obverse 1, possibly for approval by the Americans commissioning the piece, and rejected in favor of it.</p>

               <p>The medal was voted by Congress on November 4, 1777, to celebrate the surrender of General <name type="pname">Burgoyne</name> to Gates. The commission to engrave the dies was given in 1785 to <name type="pname">Nicolas M. Gatteaux</name>, who worked from an engraved portrait by <name type="pname">John Norman</name>. The gold medal and the dies were sent to Gates in 1787. The medal was given in 1889 to the <name type="place">New-York</name> Historical Society, where most of Gates's papers reside. The dies were used in 1801 by <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeld</name> to strike silver and tin examples and then were given to the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> mint, where they were also used for restrikes. After 1885 a new reverse die was cut by <name type="pname">William Barber</name>, apparently by hubbing the type and punching in new lettering.</p>

               <p>6. <name type="pname">Henry Lee</name> for the Capture of <name type="place">Paulus Hook</name>, August 19, 1779.</p>
               <p>Congress resolved on September 24, 1779, to have a gold medal made for <name type="pname">Lee</name> for the successful attack on the British fort at <name type="place">Paulus Hook</name> (now <name type="place">Jersey City</name>). When the set of silver medals arrived for <name type="pname">Washington</name> 10 years later, it was apparent that the medal for Lee had been overlooked, and the American engraver <name type="pname">Joseph Wright</name> was commissioned to make dies for the medal. There is no evidence that the medal was ever struck or delivered to <name type="pname">Lee</name>, but lead trial strikings were produced. A new obverse die appears to have been made in 1874 for use in uniface strikings, but it cracked immediately. A new reverse die was made in 1874, and a repaired version of the obverse was introduced some time thereafter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>It wasn't until 1787 that Congress voted a gold medal to <name type="pname">John Paul Jones</name> for his capture of the <hi rend="italic">Serapis</hi> off the coast of <name type="place">Scotland</name> in 1779. <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name> arranged to have the medal made by <name type="pname">Augustin Dupré</name> from a portrait bust by <name type="pname">Houdon</name>. <name type="pname">Jones</name>, who was on service to <name type="pname">Catherine II</name> of <name type="place">Russia</name> at the time, offered to fund the production of four gold medals (one for himself, one for <name type="pname">Catherine</name>, one for <name type="pname">Louis XVI</name> and one for the <name type="place">United States</name>) and requested that no silver or bronze be made pending his possible commissioning of additional gold pieces. In the end, only those for <name type="pname">Jones</name> and <name type="pname">Catherine</name> seem to have been struck, and no example was included in the silver set given to <name type="place">Washington</name> in 1790. In 1863, gun metal dies were made in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> from restrikes sent from <name type="place">Paris</name>. These appear to have broken soon and a new set was made by the same method. When these were no longer usable, totally new dies were cut. In 1939, the original dies were brought from <name type="place">Paris</name> to the <name type="place">United States</name> Naval Academy, and at least one gold restrike has been made from them since then.</p>

               </head>
               <p>For the victory over <name type="pname">Cornwallis</name> at <name type="place">Cowpens</name>, in <name type="place">northwestern South Carolina</name>, Congress voted a gold medal to <name type="pname">Brigadier</name> General <name type="pname">Daniel Morgan</name> and silver medals to <name type="pname">Lieutenants William Washington</name> and <name type="pname">J.E. Howard</name>. The plans for the <name type="pname">Morgan</name> medal were finally approved by the Académie des Inscriptions in 1789, and the medal was designed and engraved by <name type="pname">Augustin Dupré</name>. A gold example was presented to <name type="pname">Morgan</name> at about the time that the silver example (no. 64) was given to <name type="pname">George Washington</name>. The gold original was lost, and in 1836 Congress authorized the cutting of new dies to make an example for <name type="pname">Morgan's</name> heirs. This was done in <name type="place">Paris</name> by <name type="pname">Jean Jacques Barre</name>, who copied the silver <name type="place">Washington</name> specimen, then in the possession of <name type="pname">Daniel Webster</name>. The new dies were brought to the <name type="place">Philadelphia Mint</name> in 1839, and were used to strike a gold medal and silver, bronze and gilt bronze examples through the twentieth century.</p>

               <p>In October of 1781, Congress authorized a gold medal for <name type="pname">Greene</name> for his bold attack on the British forces at <name type="place">Eutaw Springs</name>, <name type="place">South Carolina</name>. The medal was the last to be authorized by Congress but, despite the fact that it was one of the first completed, was awarded posthumously to <name type="pname">Greene's</name> widow in 1787. The dies were engraved by <name type="pname">Augustin Dupré</name>, who contracted to strike 24 examples; the medal does not seem to have been restruck by the French mint. New dies were made at the <name type="place">Philadelphia Mint</name> in 1890, perhaps after an attempt at hubbing from an old specimen.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The Libertas Americana was made totally on the initiative of <name type="pname">Benjamin Franklin</name> as a celebration of the victories at <name type="place">Saratoga</name> in 1777 and Yorktown in 1781; it was never sanctioned by Congress. <name type="pname">Franklin</name> developed the legends and imagery through consultation with English and French scholars and artists and engaged <name type="pname">Augustin Dupré</name> to engrave the dies. In 1783, he presented two gold specimens to <name type="pname">Louis XVI</name> and <name type="pname">Marie Antoinette</name> and silver ones to French ministers and the Grand Master of <name type="place">Malta</name>; he sent a silver one to the President of Congress, <name type="pname">Elias Boudinot</name>, and promised copper ones for the members of Congress. He had a four-page brochure advertising the medal printed in French and English. A silver example was included in the set of medals presented to <name type="place">Washington</name> in 1790. There is no evidence for the subsequent use of the dies or of the creation of new ones for restrikes; the piece in the set for <name type="place">Washington</name> shows a further progression in the die break than other pieces catalogued here.</p>

               <p>The <name type="pname">Franklin</name> medal was not authorized by Congress; it is not known whose initiative lay behind it or how much of a role <name type="pname">Franklin</name> himself had in the choice of designs or legends. The earliest designs, by <name type="pname">Franklin's</name> friend <name type="pname">Augustin Dupré</name>, are dated 1783; the two reverses bear the dates 1784 and 1786 respectively. An example with the second reverse was included in the set given to <name type="place">Washington</name> in March of 1790, after <name type="pname">Franklin's</name> return to <name type="place">America</name> and a month before his death. The dies have remained at the <name type="place">Paris</name> mint, where they have been used for restrikes. The obverse die was replaced some time around the middle of the nineteenth century; the second version reverse die was replaced some time in the past century.</p>

               <p>By Presidential order, gold medals were authorized in 1790 for the <name type="pname">Marquis de la Luzerne</name>, French Minister to the <name type="place">United States</name> from 1779 to 1784, and in 1791 to the Count <name type="pname">de Moustier</name>, French Minister to the <name type="place">United States</name> from 1787 to 1791. The production was handled by <name type="pname">William</name> Short, the American chargé d'affaires in <name type="place">Paris</name>, who commissioned <name type="pname">Augustin Dupré</name> to make the dies and strike two gold medals. The French Revolution caused a delay by keeping <name type="pname">Dupré</name> busy with dies for the new coinage. Another delay was caused by the breaking of one of the dies in hardening, after it had produced lead trials; the broken die is in the collection of the <name type="place">Boston</name> Public Library as is the obverse hub. In 1792, the gold medals were given out to the agent of <name type="pname">Luzerne</name>, who had recently died in exile, and to <name type="place">Moustier</name>, who was soon to emigrate; their whereabouts are unknown. Six bronze medals were delivered to Short at the same time. <name type="pname">Charles Barber</name> made new dies of the medal in 1876, copied from lead trials of the original.</p>
