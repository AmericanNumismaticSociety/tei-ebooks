            </head>
            <p> The <placeName>United States</placeName> large cent was the subject of the twelfth Coinage of the Americas Conference, sponsored annually
                    by the American Numismatic Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing
                    Council as a forum for the dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of North and <placeName>South
                        America</placeName> . </p>
            <p> The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present
                    papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all who have an
                    interest in the topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants travelling to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> area to come to know the Society's collections and library better during the days
                    surrounding the conference. </p>
            <p> A number of special exhibits were mounted on the theme of COAC 1996 and remained on view at the Society for several months. Two exhibits
                    featured material from the Society's collection: one exhibit showed unusual cents from the ANS collection, such as Clapp-Newcomb 34, the
                    Saltus-ANS strawberry leaf cent, and the Clapp-ANS Jefferson head cent, the finest known example. The second exhibit, by ANS curator of
                    medals <persName>Alan Stahl</persName> , showed medals from the early <placeName>United States Mint</placeName> . Conference speaker
                        <persName>James Neiswinter</persName> showed numismatic literature associated with <persName>Joseph Levick</persName> ,
                    including two varieties of <persName>Levick</persName> plates; <persName>Mark Borckardt</persName> put on a display of large cent
                    restrikes. <persName>Daniel W. Holmes</persName> , Jr., brought two of the four known strawberry leaf cents to the conference and
                    exhibited them as well; for this we have to thank <persName>Anthony Terranova</persName> , who coordinates exhibits for the Coinage of
                    the Americas Conferences. <persName>Del Bland</persName> co-chaired the conferences and contributed much to its success. </p>

            <p> Large cents are studied with an intensity that is devoted to no other coin series. This long tradition makes many contributors to the study
                    of large cents interesting objects of study in themselves. <persName>James Neiswinter</persName> in this volume discusses <persName>Joseph N. T. Levick</persName> , just as <persName>John W. Adams</persName> discussed <persName>Benjamin
                        Collins</persName> in the first COAC volume. Large cents are a very narrow series; that is one of their advantages. They were made by a mint
                    with a small output for a country with a small population. The population of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in 1790 was 28,522, and
                    we know from documents that large cents, at least in the 1790s, did not circulate much beyond <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . <placeName>Rome</placeName> during the Empire, by contrast, had a population of over a million. A die study of large cents is difficult,
                    but it remains comprehensible. A die study of Roman sestertii - a coin made in greater numbers for a much larger population - can prove to
                    be very complex. </p>
            <p> Despite this narrowness, the numismatist is confronted in the large cent series with nearly every possible numismatic problem. Large cents
                    have been arranged in series according to every numismatic method: style, die studies, and hoards. The cents of 1794 can be arranged into
                    those with a head which resembles those used on the liberty cap cents of 1793 - the head of 1793; a head which resembles those used on the
                    cents of 1795 - the head of 1795; and a head which resembles neither, which is called the head of 1794. This is a standard stylistic
                    arrangement. After the work of <persName>Crosby</persName> , <persName>Maris</persName> , and <persName>Hays</persName> ,
                    cents began to be arranged according to die chains. <persName>Sheldon</persName> carried this process further. <persName>Clapp</persName> suggested a re-arrangement according to edge designs for <persName>Hays</persName> 1, 2, 3, and 4, so that the
                    arrangement went <persName>Hays</persName> 4, 3, 2, 1; <persName>John Adams</persName> has suggested that <persName>Hays
                        3</persName> was actually the first cent minted in 1794; and this remains a topic of much dispute. <persName>George Ewing</persName>
                    studied edge markings in the volume published after the first COAC of <pb n="x"/> 1984, <hi rend="italic">America's Copper Coinage,</hi> and
                    the use of edge markings to determine the emission sequence has been applied by <persName>Russell Logan</persName> , <persName>Ivan Leaman</persName> , and <persName>Donald Gunnet</persName> to the half dollar series; some of this work is in the volume
                    published after the 1986 COAC, <hi rend="italic">Americas Silver Coinage.</hi>
               <persName>Walter Breen</persName> used hoard evidence to re-arrange the emission sequence. In his 1952 study of the Goodhue-Nichols
                    find, <persName>Breen</persName> concluded that S-104 (rusted dies), S-118, S-119, S-123, S-135, S-136, and S-137 were all delivered in
                    the same batch. <persName>Denis Loring</persName> , in his contribution to <hi rend="italic">America's Copper Coinage,</hi> discussed
                    four methods of determining the emission sequence: die chains, die deterioration and repair, design characteristics (i.e. style), edge
                    devices, and planchet quality. In the article <persName>Loring</persName> pointed out the existence of die remarriages, which <persName>Logan</persName> later demonstrated for the half dollar series. Planchet quality remains under-utilized as a tool for analyzing
                    large cents, as opposed to our half cent brethren, who happily distinguish between "cent stock" and "token stock." </p>
            <p> Because large cents have been studied so intensively, conclusions about cents have been applied to other numismatic fields. The survival
                    estimate rule of one percent for gold, two percent for silver, and three percent for copper derives from <persName>Breen's</persName>
                    and <persName>Sheldon's</persName> work on large cents, in particular those of 1794. The study of large cents also allows us to test
                    conclusions from other fields of numismatics, such as die link formulae and die life estimates. </p>
            <p> At the 1984 Coinage of the <placeName>Americas</placeName> Conference, <persName>Walter Breen</persName> proposed a very radical
                    theory of device punches for the cents of 1794; this was published in <hi rend="italic">America's Copper Coinage.</hi> Aspects of this
                    theory will be reconsidered in my contribution to this volume. The letter punches are another area where further research might prove
                    fruitful, particularly in light of the involvement of typefounders with the early mint, as <persName>R. W. Julian</persName> points
                    out. <hi rend="italic">America's Copper Coinage</hi> included <persName>David Cohen's</persName> study of the Randall hoard. This
                    volume includes another hoard study, by <persName>Steven Ellsworth</persName> and <persName>Christopher Schwerdt</persName> on the
                    Butternut hoard. </p>
            <p> Imitations (the Unity States tokens: discussed by Fuld at the 1995 COAC, published as <hi rend="italic">Coinage of the American
                        Confederation Period</hi> ), private patterns (the <persName>Jefferson</persName> head cents), official patterns (the Birch cents:
                    discussed in the same Fuld article), counterfeits (1848 small date cents, and, I would argue, the strawberry leaf), altered dates (1815
                    cents), altered dies ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 3-B), restrikes (1804, 1810 and 1823) and electrotypes complicate the study of large
                    cents. <persName>Neiswinter</persName> discusses <pb n="xi"/> the electrotypes and the <persName>Crosby</persName> 3-B; Julian the
                    Jefferson head cents; the hiatus of 1815 is treated by <persName>John Wright</persName> ; I write about the 1848 small date and the
                    strawberry leaf cents; and <persName>Mark Borckardt</persName> and <persName>William Metropolis</persName> analyze the cent
                    restrikes. </p>
            <p> Finally, two technical aspects are handled by <persName>Denis Loring</persName> and <persName>Craig Sholley</persName> . <persName>Craig Sholley</persName> publishes early <placeName>U.S.</placeName> coining dies from the ANS collection. A pair of dies in
                    the ANS collection for an 1883-CC silver dollar was published by me as an appendix to the volume, <hi rend="italic">America's Silver
                        Dollars.</hi>
               <persName>Denis Loring</persName> explains what is, and what is not, a proof large cent. </p>
            <p> Counterstamps and overstrikes remain a very active area of research in large cents. <persName>David Bowers</persName> wrote a fine
                    piece on counterstamps on large cents for the 1994 COAC volume, <hi rend="italic">The Token: America's Other Money;</hi> counterstamps on
                    silver dollars were discussed by <persName>Robert Stark</persName> in the 1993 COAC volume, <hi rend="italic">America's Silver
                        Dollars.</hi> Overstrikes are an area where there is also much research going on, particularly after the spectacular discovery of a half
                    cent overstruck on die variety Clapp-Newcomb 34. Occasionally cents were overstruck on other coins: on Talbot, Allum and Lee tokens and on
                    Conder tokens. More commonly, large cents served as undertypes for other coins, usually counterfeits, such as the Brazilian 80 reis. The
                    recent book by <persName>Keith Davignon</persName> on counterfeit half dollars should encourage further study of this, since the large
                    cents overstruck with half dollar dies are usually counterfeiters' trial strikes. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Joseph Levick</persName> started collecting in 1852, becoming one of the first people in the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> to collect coins ( <ref target="#fig-1">fig. 1</ref> ). He was a consignor to seven auctions, the first by <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> in 1859, the last by <persName>Thomas</persName> Elder in 1908. <persName>Levick</persName>
                    was a born collector. Besides coins, he collected stamps, political items, currency, medals, and books. He is best known for his collections
                    of store cards and Hard Times Tokens although his various coin collections included a Brasher Doubloon, a silver center cent, and a Birch
                    cent ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 92). His three contributions to numismatic research occurred between 1868 and 1870. The first
                    two, "A Table" ( <persName>Levick</persName> 1868a) and then "the Plate" ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 1869), were the starting
                    points for all that was to follow on the most researched field in American numismatics, the large cent. </p>
            <p> The fever for collecting cents in sets did not start until 1857 when the Flying Eagle cent was issued for circulation. This change in
                    coinage was the start of cent collecting, since the large cents were being recalled and melted by the mint and people realized that they
                    would soon be hard to find. Before then cents were easily found in circulation, except for the '99s and 1804s which were considered rarer
                    than the '93s ( <persName>Levick</persName> 1868a, 48). Probably the first person to complete a date set of cents was <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> of <placeName>Philadel-phia</placeName> who took great pleasure in showing the coins in his store.
                    (He is known as America's first coin dealer.) <persName>Levick</persName> was a frequent visitor to the store. </p>

            <p> The <persName>Cogan</persName> Sale, November 1, 1858, is given credit by <persName>Levick</persName> for the "commencement of the
                        <hi rend="italic">furore</hi> for collecting fine cents and the paying of extraordinary prices for remarkable specimens" ( <persName>Levick</persName> 1868b, 56). The account of this sale was written about in newspapers around the country and is what drew
                        <persName>Levick's</persName> attention to collecting cents. <persName>Cogan</persName> also believed that the published
                    results of the sale were the main cause of the great demand that arose for obtaining cents. </p>
            <p> The sale was his complete date set, from Washington cents of 1791 and 1792 to a flying eagle cent of 1858 (fig. 2). The 1793 cents had a <pb n="3"/> ring, wreath, and liberty cap. There were thick and thin die examples of 1795. There was a fifteen star 1817 cent, and an 1839
                    booby head (maybe the first appearance of the term booby). The seventy-seven cents realized $128.68. There were nineteen mail bidders who
                    bought all but three of the coins. On November 1, several of the bidders were invited to <persName>Cogan's</persName> store to see the
                    letters opened. The names of all successful bidders are known today with the most famous being <persName>Joseph Mickley</persName>
                    (bidder number five) who got the 1793 Liberty Cap for $7.25. It sold in his sale nine years later for $55. Due to the increase in the
                    interest of collecting coin catalogues, <persName>Cogan</persName> was asked by several friends to print a priced catalogue of this
                    sale. He did, in September 1863, almost five years after the event. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Levick</persName> called this sale the starting point for his collecting cents. In the next year he too completed a date set
                    of large cents, obtaining many cents from <persName>Cogan's</persName> sales of the Foote and Gratz collections. <persName>Levick</persName> and other collectors had an advantage living in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> since they were able to go to the
                    mint and select fine examples of cents at face value. This lasted until the mint employees learned to know the value of the cents and kept
                    the better dates for themselves. In 1859 <persName>Cogan</persName> sold the first of <persName>Levick's</persName> four major
                    collections, which included his recently completed date set. </p>
            <p> Little is known about <persName>Levick's</persName> personal life. Circa 1860 he moved from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> to
                    New Street in lower <placeName>Manhattan</placeName> . He enlisted as a private in the Seventh <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> Volunteers during the Civil War and his obituary states he achieved the rank of captain
                    (National Archives Military Records). In 1870 he opened an office as a broker in Gold, Stocks, Bonds, and Government Securities on Wall
                    Street. His good friend <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> had opened a store nearby on <placeName>William Street</placeName> after
                    moving to <placeName>New York City</placeName> in 1865. <persName>Levick</persName> became one of the founders of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> Numismatic Society, and in December 1865 he joined the American Numismatic
                    &amp; Archaeological Society. The next year <persName>Levick</persName> and several others dissolved the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> Society and merged it with the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society ( <persName>Adelson</persName> 1958, 42). </p>
            <p> It did not take him very long to become active in the Society. He served as treasurer from 1867 to 1874, and in a regular meeting on March,
                    8, 1866 he proposed that a numismatic journal should be issued by the A.N.A.S ( <persName>Adelson</persName> 1958, 56). Several
                    European numismatic societies had been publishing such journals since the 1830s. At the annual meeting on March 22 his proposal was adopted.
                    The first number was issued on May 24, 1866. </p>

            <pb n="6"/>
            <p> The Society would guarantee publication for one year at a cost to members of three dollars a year. All publication expenses would be made
                    good by the members. That first year the journal lost $200 and members were assessed to make up the difference. In 1868 <persName>Levick</persName> became the business editor and wrote a report on the difficulties in publishing the journal. Because of his report the
                    members decided that the president, <persName>Charles Anthon</persName> , would write to other numismatic societies about an annual
                    rotation of the job of editing and publishing the journal ( <persName>Adelson</persName> 1958, 62). By 1870 negotiations with the
                    Boston Numismatic Society were successfully completed and they agreed to publish the journal for the next year. After his term as treasurer
                        <persName>Levick</persName> was never as active in the Society as he had been prior to 1874. </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">A Table</hi>
               </head>
               <p> The first mention of the study of 1793 cents appeared in the <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> issue of June 1868. The minutes of a regular
                        meeting of the Society, on May 14, stated that <persName>Levick</persName> had read from a tabular statement that he had prepared
                        that contained the sales, varieties, prices realized, and buyers names. "A Table" was published in the October issue ( <ref target="#fig-2">fig. 3</ref> ). The 20 principal sales all occurred in <placeName>New York City</placeName> or <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> and had cents from the finest collections in the country, starting with the <persName>A. C.
                            Kline</persName> sale in 1855 and ending with the famous Mickley sale of 1867. This was the first systematic survey of coin price
                        statistics. </p>
               <p> He studied over 200 catalogues and excluded those 1793 cents that he thought were too ordinary to note ( <persName>Levick</persName> 1868a). The pieces which were too ordinary he determined by their low prices. Before 1855 he could find only one lot
                        with a 1793. That was in the Roper sale of February 1851, and since it only realized ten cents he thought that its condition must be
                        poor. ( <persName>Ammi Brown</persName> , in a letter to <persName>Levick</persName> that was published in the May 1869 <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> , wrote "The cent of '93 in <persName>Roper's</persName> Sale 1851, was bought by me. It was as fine as
                        when struck, and probably had never been circulated. At that time but little interest was felt in American coinage, and this piece was
                        knocked down to me for my first bid of 10 cents.") </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Levick</persName> used the Kline sale as his starting point since it had one lot that consisted of four types of 1793s.
                        It sold to a Mr. <persName>Burtiss</persName> of <placeName>New York City</placeName> for $3.20 or an average of eighty cents
                        each. The second was the <persName>Cogan</persName> sale of November 1858. Next were the Foote and Gratz sales in 1859. </p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Cogan</persName> sold both collections in his store and manuscripts were issued after each sale with the prices realized
                        written in. The sale of <persName>Levick's</persName> collection in December 1859 (fifth on "A Table") was <persName>Cogan's</persName> first conventional sale catalogue. </p>
               <p> According to <persName>Levick</persName> the five types of 1793 cents were - Link Ameri ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1),
                        Link <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> (S-2, 3, 4), Wreath, Vines &amp; Bars On Edge (S-5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11A),
                        Wreath, Lettered Edge (S-11B, C), and Liberty Cap (S-13-16). (The S-7 and the S-12 had not yet been discovered.) The 109 cents listed in
                        "A Table" realized a total of $1,361.81 for an average of $12.49 each. The highest price paid for a 1793 cent was the $110 that <persName>M.L. Mackenzie</persName> paid for the Mickley Ameri which was exactly twice what the next highest coin brought. </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Project</hi>
               </head>
               <p> In that same October issue <persName>Levick</persName> wrote that his next project was to furnish a Photographic Plate of Types and
                        Varieties of the Cents of 1793, to be accompanied by detailed descriptions. He solicited subscribers to the <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi>
                        to furnish rubbings or copper foil impressions of any 1793s they possessed or the cents themselves for a short time. The Society would
                        guarantee the return of the coins. <persName>Levick</persName> was under-whelmed by the total of three responses he received.
                        Consequently he had to write individually to each well known collector, and anyone else he had heard of who possessed '93s. Many times
                        it took more than one letter to get his point across. Some collectors didn't think their pieces were fine enough, but <persName>Levick</persName> wanted to see all their '93s because he wanted to know of every existing variety. He wanted to make the photographs
                        as complete as possible by showing every variety in the best possible condition. </p>
               <p> It is probable that <persName>Ebenezer Mason</persName> read this and decided to beat <persName>Levick</persName> to the punch
                        by publishing his own study of 1793 cents starting in the December issue of his <hi rend="italic">Coin and Stamp Magazine.</hi> From
                        December 1868 to August 1869 he attempted to describe the varieties of 1793 cents. The difference between <persName>Mason's</persName> effort and <persName>Levick's</persName> was <persName>Mason's</persName> use of rubbings to describe the
                        cents while <persName>Levick</persName> used the actual coins ( <persName>Mason</persName> 1868-69). <persName>Mason</persName> listed three chains, eight wreaths and three liberty caps. Only eleven of his descriptions can be recognized today. He
                        used no plates or drawings to help with those descriptions. </p>
               <p> The ANS Library has <persName>Levick's</persName> Book of Rubbings of 1793 Cents. This book is a diary of the project. <persName>Levick</persName> made obverse and reverse <pb n="9"/> rubbings of the finest varieties submitted to him. He included
                        detailed descriptions of each variety, the name of each collector, and the date he received the coins. An entry from page 24: </p>

                        "The Hewitt Ameri cent I have concluded since the observation made by <persName>Crosby</persName> that the piece is tooled and
                        altered to an Ameri from an <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> which can be seen by examination with a strong
                        glass." A rubbing of this coin is on page 19. Apparently <persName>Crosby</persName> did not agree that this coin was an alteration
                        because he included it in his 1897 monograph as variety 3-B. <persName>George Clapp</persName> wrote that the <hi rend="italic">CA</hi> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> had been carefully milled off and a copper pin inserted as
                        a period after the <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ( <persName>Clapp</persName> 1942). This coin is in the ANS collection. </p>
               <p> In the February <hi rend="italic">1869 American Journal of Numismatics,</hi>
                  <persName>Levick</persName> wrote that he had not anticipated the expense, labor and difficulties in producing the plate. He begged
                        the indulgence of the subscribers and promised to have a plate, worthy of their patience, ready for the last number in volume three
                        (April issue). He stated that the photographs would cost more than they thought, and the journal containing them would only be delivered
                        to those members who have paid their subscriptions. The photographs would also be sold by <persName>Cogan</persName> in his store
                        at $1.00 a pair. These photographs would be desirable for illustrating coin catalogues of past or future sales, and it is not likely
                        that such another set of 1793 cents could be brought together again. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Levick</persName> also wrote that it was remarkable how many collectors had been hoarding counterfeits until they were
                        informed by him ( <persName>Levick</persName> 1869a). Most were <persName>Smith</persName> Counterfeits - engraved copies of
                        1793 cents made from 1794 cents ( <ref target="#fig-3">fig. 4</ref> ). <persName>Smith</persName> of <placeName>Ann
                            Street</placeName> was known to have operated in <placeName>New York City</placeName> in the early 1860s. <persName>Levick</persName> had intended to make photographs of these counterfeits to show the general style of workmanship, and to aid
                        collectors in distinguishing the difference between the real and the fake, but he did not. <persName>Crosby</persName> did include
                        photographs of the <persName>Smith</persName> Counterfeits in his 1897 monograph. </p>

               <p> In the March issue <persName>Levick</persName> thanks <persName>Crosby</persName> for furnishing him with minute descriptions
                        of all the varieties that will accompany the plate. He also thanks him for pointing out different varieties, detecting counterfeits, and
                        supplying some of the specimens on the plate. It is here that <persName>Levick</persName> gives his reason for this project. While
                        doing his research for "A Table" he discovered that the same piece may have been described in a half dozen ways by as many cataloguers,
                        who thus gave the impression that there are as many varieties. In some cases he found the same variety appearing several times in the
                        same catalogue, each time described differently. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>W. Elliot Woodward</persName> had catalogued and sold some of the best collections in the country - <persName>Mickley, McCoy, Colburn</persName> - men who collected 1793 cents by variety, yet <persName>Levick</persName> found it impossible
                        to discover differences in the pieces by referring to his catalogues. He intended that the purpose of this project would be that a
                        variety could be recognized by its number or letter. He wanted every cataloguer to adopt one way of describing a piece, let it be known
                        by a certain title, so all collectors may recognize it at once ( <persName>Levick</persName> 1869b). So it was <persName>Levick's</persName> idea that was implemented by <persName>Crosby</persName> in the text that accompanied the plate. </p>
               <p> Collector <persName>Thomas Cleneay</persName> of <placeName>Ohio</placeName> wrote a letter that appeared in the September issue
                        of <hi rend="italic">AJN:</hi>
                  <q> I'm very pleased with the photographic plate containing the varieties of 1793 cents...it will be of service to both dealers and
                            collectors...the descriptions that accompany the plate will afford all the aid that one will need to determine varieties of 93's.
                            Now, if you can just get the dealers to adopt your plate and descriptions <pb n="11"/> as a means of reference when making out
                            catalogues it will be something gained. </q>
               </p>
               <p> He also wrote, <q> The readers of the Journal must compliment Mr. <persName>Crosby</persName> for the brief and faithful manner in
                            which he performed the part assigned to him of describing the various pieces illustrated on the plate...his descriptions are minute,
                            accurate, and complete. </q>
               </p>
               <p> The first cataloguer to use <persName>Crosby</persName> numbers was <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> in February 1871, when
                        he sold <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> ex-Governor <persName>Packer's</persName> collection.
                        From this point on if the consignor collected 1793 cents by variety, and used <persName>Crosby's</persName> designations, <persName>Cogan</persName> would include them in his catalogue. <persName>Woodward</persName> was the next cataloguer to use
                            <persName>Crosby</persName> numbers and by the end of the century all major dealers, except <persName>Frossard</persName>
                        , used them. </p>
               <p> A strange catalogue was <persName>John Haseltine's</persName> sale of the <persName>Crosby</persName> collection in 1883.
                        There were 15 different varieties among <persName>Crosby's</persName> 1793 cents. It had the discovery specimen of the S-15, which
                        appeared on the plate as 12-K, as well as the discovery S-7. What made it so unusual was the fact that <persName>Haseltine</persName> did not use <persName>Crosby's</persName> designations to describe <persName>Crosby's</persName> own
                        1793 cents. Instead he used <persName>Frossard</persName> numbers. <persName>Frossard's</persName> monograph was published in
                        1879 and encompassed the entire large cent series from 1793 to 1857. He did use plates, but those plates and his descriptions did not
                        come close to matching the <persName>Levick</persName> / <persName>Crosby</persName> effort. </p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Levick's</persName> Plate of 1793 cents is arguably the most famous photographic plate in American numismatics. When you
                        consider that photography was less than 20 years old the quality is amazing. Add to that the quality of the coins and you have a work
                        that has not been matched since. </p>
               <p> The misconception about the plate is that <persName>Levick</persName> took the photograph. He did not. <persName>Levick</persName> was responsible for the arrangement of the coins laid on pin points attached to a board. He wrote that collectors
                        need not have fear of improper handling of their pieces, such as getting scratched, tarnished, or getting mixed up with pieces belonging
                        to other collectors because the operator (photographer) would not be allowed to handle the coins ( <persName>Levick</persName>
                        1869b). </p>
               <p> There are at least two different versions of the plate ( <persName>Van Zandt</persName> 1994). The first version has " <persName>J.N.T. Levick</persName> " printed in block letters in a box in the lower right corner, under obverse 12. It also has
                        "1868" under <persName>Levick's</persName> name ( <ref target="#fig-4">fig. 5</ref> ). </p>

                  <p> 5. The <persName>Levick</persName> plate - first version. </p>

                  <p> 6. The <persName>Levick</persName> plate - second version. </p>
               </figure>
               <pb n="14"/>
               <p> The second version has "Compiled by <persName>Joseph N. T. Levick</persName> " typeset in the same spot, but without the box and
                        the year ( <ref target="#fig-5">fig. 6</ref> ). The coins are the same in both versions. There are minute differences in the positioning
                        of the coins, and the lighting is slightly different. In the second version each coin casts a shadow from three to six o'clock. In the
                        first version the shadow is from four to eight o'clock which means the light came directly from the top of the board. I think that the
                        only significance that can be attached to making different versions was that the photographer was experimenting with the lighting until
                        he produced a photograph that satisfied <persName>Levick</persName> . The change in the lighting of the second version provided a
                        sharper contrast between the coins and the background of the board. </p>
               <p> That this version was the final one, I think can be proven by the name and address of the photographer that is impressed at the bottom
                        of the plate, between obverse 11 and reverse K. His name is <persName>Rockwood</persName> and his studio was located at 339
                        Broadway in <placeName>New York City</placeName> . <persName>Levick's</persName> name is also typed at the bottom instead of
                        being hand printed as on the first version. I believe that these would only be done on the finished product. </p>
               <p> Due to the cost of producing the plates <persName>Levick</persName> probably decided to use every plate that was made to send to
                        the members. The membership of the A.N.A.S. in April 1869 consisted of 42 regular members, 47 corresponding members, and 11 honorary
                        members (Roll 1870). This adds up to 100, which is thought to be the number of plates produced. </p>
               <p> The proprietors of the cents represented in the plate: </p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <persName>M.L. Mackenzie</persName> - 6 coins </item>
                  <item>
                     <persName>George Seavey</persName> - 4 </item>
                  <item>
                     <persName>S.S. Crosby</persName> - 3 </item>
                  <item>
                     <persName>Richard Winsor</persName> - 2 </item>
                  <item>
                     <persName>Bayard Smith</persName> - 2 </item>
                  <item> Col. <persName>M.I. Cohen</persName> - 2 </item>
                  <item>
                     <persName>Thomas Cleneay</persName> - 1 </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <persName>Levick</persName> included these names with the variety that each person supplied at the end of <persName>Crosby's</persName> descriptions. Also included were names of a few others whose pieces were not used, but they were quite equal of
                        those photographed. This list of owners attached to the finest known varieties of 1793 cents became the first Condition Census. <persName>Levick</persName> considered ownership of a coin to be an important selling point, and he believed that the pedigree
                        enhanced the appeal of a coin as well as its value. </p>
               <p> If you think about it, getting these coins together in 1868 was probably easier than it would be today. The collecting of large cents
                        was only <pb n="15"/> ten years old, the collector base was very small, and most collectors lived in the northeast part of the country.
                            <persName>Mackenzie</persName> and <persName>Smith</persName> lived in <placeName>New York City</placeName> , <persName>Crosby</persName> and <persName>Seavey</persName> in <placeName>Boston</placeName> , <persName>Winsor</persName> in <placeName>Providence</placeName> , <persName>Cohen</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> , and <persName>Cleneay</persName> in <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> . All
                        except <persName>Seavey</persName> and <persName>Winsor</persName> were members of the A.N.A.S. and <persName>Crosby</persName> was probably responsible for bringing in those two New Englanders. If an attempt was made to get the same 20 coins
                        together today you would probably have to deal with 20 different owners scattered around the country. ( <persName>Del
                            Bland</persName> says he can trace the current owners of all but two of the coins on the plate.) </p>
               <p> The plate consists of 12 obverses and 10 reverses from 20 coins. There are two coins on the plate that were unique in 1869. The
                        Strawberry Leaf, 6-D, is still unique today. The other is the 12-K (S-15) ( <ref target="#fig-6">fig. 7</ref> ). Only 10 more examples
                        of this variety have been discovered since. <persName>Levick</persName> writes that they could not do better in regard to these,
                        but he proposed if better examples were discovered to have them photographed and paste the photos over those now on the plate ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 1869). He also wrote that if some unknown varieties turned up after publication of the plate he would be
                        obliged to correct the original plates by these additions. However this never happened. No plates are known with photos pasted over the
                        originals. In today's terms the plate consists of 14 Sheldon varieties and one Non-Collectible (the Strawberry Leaf). So <persName>Levick</persName> / <persName>Crosby</persName> missed only two Sheldon varieties, S-7 and S-12. <persName>Crosby</persName> discovered the S-12 (a marriage of obverse 10 and reverse K) in 1870 and the S-7 (a new obverse married to the C
                        reverse) in 1879. Both are R6 varieties today. </p>

               <pb n="16"/>
               <p> The one thing that bothered me about the plate was how there could be a photograph of both the obverse and reverse of a unique coin. I
                        believe that the only way that could happen was to make an electrotype of that coin and put it on the board next to the original, with
                        the electro showing one side and the original coin showing the other. In researching <persName>Levick</persName> , I found that the
                        last major auction of one of his collections, by <persName>Woodward</persName> in May of 1884, contained 21 electros of 1793 cents
                        (lots 803-823). <persName>Woodward</persName> wrote "The following are not only electrotype copies of the very finest procurable
                        examples of the cents of the date, but they possess a historic importance, being generally copied from the identical specimens from
                        which Mr. <persName>Levick</persName> prepared his plate, and Mr. <persName>Crosby</persName> wrote his article on the <placeName>United States</placeName> Cents of 1793 which appears in the American Journal of Numismatics for April, 1869... The copies
                        themselves are very fine, and are, I suppose the work of Mr. <persName>Crosby</persName> " ( <persName>Woodward</persName>
                        1884, 38). <persName>Levick</persName> makes several references in his Book of Rubbings to <persName>Crosby</persName> making
                        copies of the cents. The ANS collection has an electrotype of the 6-D ( <ref target="#fig-7">fig. 8</ref> ). Whether this is the same
                        electrotype that is used on the plate is difficult to tell. </p>

               </figure>
               <p> As for the 12-K (S-15), I believe that the reverse K on the plate is the actual coin, while the obverse 12 is the electro. This is due
                        to some carbon spots that are on the obverse of the coin that do not appear on the obverse of the coin on the plate. (This coin is in my
                        collection and is the genesis for my interest in <persName>Levick</persName> and the plate). </p>

               <p> Curiously, after initiating the study of large cents, <persName>Levick</persName> never published anything else about the series.

                        plate, but <persName>Crosby</persName> had a much easier time putting the whole thing together since almost all the cents on these

                        1897, 3). <persName>Levick's</persName> third and last published work was a listing of 56 different varieties of Hard Times Tokens,

               </p>
               <p> In a letter to <persName>Thomas</persName> Elder's monthly magazine in June of 1907, <persName>Levick</persName> writes that
                        he had been ordered by his doctor to divorce himself from all his hobbies due to his poor health. In two Elder sales, October 1907 and
                        February 1908, <persName>Levick</persName> sells his remaining numismatic material. In his last letter to the numismatic world that
                        Elder published in 1908, <persName>Levick</persName> wrote "Some day there will be a grand housekeeping and the junk man and the
                        scavenger will have a cinch shoveling all my gatherings for the last 50 years...a hogshead of entire embossed envelopes, car and ferry
                        tickets, 200,000 postcards with stamps attached, engravings, philatelic literature, numismatic literature, coins and stamps, etc. There
                        are books, books, books, from one end of the house to the other. I want the numismatic, philatelic, and curio world to know that I have
                        to throw up the sponge and be counted out." </p>
               <p> Why is it that <persName>Levick</persName> never got the recognition that <persName>Sylvester Crosby</persName> received? I
                        believe that he was just as good a numismatic scholar as <persName>Crosby</persName> , but he did not pursue it for the length of
                        time that <persName>Crosby</persName> did. Like a nova, <persName>Levick</persName> burned brightest in the late 1860s, but
                        after 1870 the fire dimmed and he devoted his efforts to his many collections instead of research. He died in October 1908 at the age of
                        80. His obituary appeared in volume 21 of <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> , but not in the <hi rend="italic">AJN,</hi> for whose
                        very existence he was responsible. </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">1. Engravers</hi>
               </head>
               <p> The question of the early <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> engravers is a thorny one, but which yields important information
                        through a careful study of the coins and documents. While the 1792 engraving work is outside the scope of this discussion, dies for the
                        Chain cent were almost certainly executed between mid-January and early March 1793. Congress had reduced the actual weight of the cent
                        and half cent on January 14, 1793, due to increased copper prices; until the actual weight was determined, dies could not be completed.
                        Preparatory work, such as deciding the designs, would of course have already been done. </p>
               <p> We are certain that Chief Coiner <persName>Henry Voight</persName> is the person responsible for the Chain cent dies. ( <persName>Henry Voight</persName> is also known as <persName>Henry Voigt</persName> . The chief coiner spelled his name as <persName>Voigt</persName> , but others anglicized it, as is done here.) In a report to Congress of February 9, 1795, the statement
                        is made that "It was also a considerable time before an engraver could be engaged, during which, the chief coiner was obliged to make
                        the dies for himself..." (Am. St. P.: Fin. 1:353-355). </p>
               <p> The phrase "considerable time" thus becomes a key point. We know that the Chain cent coinage extended from late February until March 12,
                        a period of about two weeks of intensive work (National Archives, RG 104: Treasurer's Receipt). This hardly qualifies as a considerable
                        length of time although, as noted, actual engraving work had probably begun by the middle of January. </p>
               <p> It is known that the 1793 Wreath cent coinage began on April 4, a mere 23 days after the end of the Chain mintage (National Archives, RG
                        104: Personnel Record). Considering that it would have taken a few days to make a decision on the new design, this is a very tight
                        period of time. Most of the wreath cents were struck by the end of June, although some were delivered in July. </p>
               <p> Both <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> and <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> have been suggested as primary engravers of the
                        Wreath cent dies, but both must be rejected. The easiest to dispose of is <persName>Wright</persName> because the new head of
                        Liberty is hardly up to his known skill and artistry. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> , despite his later admirers, was not exactly a "Man for All Seasons" in the early mint. It is true
                        that he was a reasonably skilled blacksmith and general mechanic but until January 1796 was not he even an official employee of the
                            <placeName>Mint</placeName> . He did contract blacksmithing, die hardening, and similar work prior to his regular employment as
                        assistant coiner in charge of copper. </p>
               <pb n="21"/>
               <p> The Wreath cent dies can also be ascribed to <persName>Voight</persName> because of the February 1795 report. If we assume he was
                        still doing engraving work in June 1793 on this design, then the period of January through June nicely fits the phrase "considerable
                        time." It may be, of course, that die work for the Wreath cent actually ceased by the end of May, although minting continued for some
                        time. Furthermore, the 1795 report clearly states that the chief coiner executed the dies until an engraver was engaged and there is
                        very good reason to believe that <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> did not become engraver until after July 1. </p>
               <p> The half cent planchets, even to the point of being edge-lettered, were ready by May 15 (National Archives, RG 104: Personnel Record).
                        There is also a distinct artistic relationship between the reverses of the Wreath cent and the half cent. We find the same cluttered
                        design, down to the excess berries littering the field ( <ref target="#fig-8">figs. 1</ref> - <ref target="#fig-9">2</ref> ). </p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-8">
                  <graphic url="COAC12_021a.jpg"/>
                  <p> 1. The Wreath cent of 1793 ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 6-F). </p>
               </figure>
               <figure xml:id="fig-9">
                  <graphic url="COAC12_021b.jpg"/>
                  <p>2. The half cent of 1793 (Cohen 1, Breen 1).</p>
               </figure>
               <p> One can then reasonably suggest that the first half cent reverse die was actually engraved in late April or early May in anticipation of
                        the half cent coinage. The obverse was not done at this time because the government had finally decided that <persName>Voight's</persName> limited engraving skills were no longer wanted. It is possible, of course, that <persName>Voight</persName>
                        had cut a half cent obverse, but that it was rejected and no specimen survives from any that might have been struck. </p>
               <pb n="22"/>
               <p> The half cent dies of 1793 are sometimes credited to <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> , but this cannot be correct, at least for the
                        obverse. It was not until July 18 that this denomination was first coined (National Archives, RG 104: Personnel Record). The delay can
                        be explained only by assuming that <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> did the necessary die work when he arrived at the <placeName>Mint</placeName> in early July 1793. </p>
               <p> It is of course possible that <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> helped prepare the Wreath cent dies as well as those for the half cent.
                        He might, for example, have punched in the lettering and figures on the obverse and reverse. This sort of help on the cent dies would
                        have freed <persName>Voight</persName> to spend more time superintending the actual copper coinage operations. In addition, <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> may have had serious input into the reverse dies for the half cent. </p>
               <p> That <persName>Voight</persName> was the engraver for the first two cent designs has a certain amount of irony connected to it. In
                        his formal application to become the chief coiner, <persName>Voight</persName> noted he had served in the small <placeName>German</placeName> mint of Saxe-Gotha ( <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> Papers). While there, according
                        to his own statement, he had learned virtually every facet of coinage operations except one: engraving. </p>
               <p> Very little is known about <persName>Voight's</persName> service in the <placeName>Saxe-Gotha mint</placeName> . He was born in
                            <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> about 1745 so presumably went to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName> to stay with relatives, perhaps in the late 1760s. Recent inquiries to experts on the
                            <placeName>Saxe-Gotha Mint</placeName> , however, have turned up no documentary evidence that <persName>Voight</persName>
                        was ever there. </p>
               <p> The quality of the half cent obverse design is so much better than either the Chain or the Wreath cent designs that we are clearly faced
                        with a new engraver. <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> later claimed that he had executed the designs for the 1793 half cent but
                        either he was overstating his work or the listener misunderstood ( <persName>Taxay</persName> 1966, 71). Again, it should be
                        emphasized, <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> has to be rejected as the primary engraver for the obverse for the simple reason that he
                        would have become the chief engraver at $1200 per year rather than have to wait until January 1796 to be employed at an annual salary of
                        only $600. He did not come from a wealthy family and the $600 difference was a great sum of money in those days, the equivalent of about
                        two years' wages for a skilled workman. </p>
               <p> We now have only <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> available for the July work and it is known from a later letter that he was in
                        fact the engraver when he died in September ( <persName>Taxay</persName> 1966, 105). Although the necessary documents are now lost,
                        it seems likely that <persName>Wright</persName> accepted the engraver's <pb n="23"/> post in July 1793, but did not begin
                        full-time work until after the first of July. At that time officers were paid only at the end of the quarter (June 30 in this case) and
                        there is no record of a payment to <persName>Wright</persName> on that date. </p>
               <p> It is also true that there is no record of payment for the quarter ended September 30 but then <persName>Wright</persName> died in
                        mid-September. It seems likely in hindsight that his estate was paid his salary from early July through mid-September, but that the
                            <placeName>Mint</placeName> was not debited. The reason for this odd financial arrangement is not known but may have been
                        connected in some way with the conditions of employment. </p>
               <p> The half cent dies were completed so quickly that it does seem probable that <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> aided <persName>Wright</persName> in completing the work. With <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> free to concentrate on the actual artistic part
                        of the effort and <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> doing the busy work, the overall die preparation would have gone fairly quickly.
                        Considering that <persName>Wright's</persName> liberty cap cent reverse is much better than the half cent reverse, it seems
                        therefore probable that <persName>Wright</persName> had little or nothing to do with the reverse of the smaller coin. </p>
               <p> It seems obvious, from a comparison of the obverses of the half cent and liberty cap cent, that the latter is better done. This can be
                        explained by noting that <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> was getting better with experience. </p>
               <p> There is, of course, no question that <persName>Wright</persName> did the liberty cap cent dies of 1793. The reverse wreath, in
                        particular, is much better done, showing that <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> had little to do with these dies, except perhaps
                        lettering or figures. </p>
               <p> The following schedule of die work, based on the above discussion, will, one hopes, provide a springboard for further thought on this
                        topic: </p>

               <p> With the death of <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> about September 12, the government was forced once more to look for an
                        engraver. In November <persName>Robert Scot</persName> obtained the coveted office and was to serve faithfully until his death in
                        late 1823. That <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> did not obtain this post after the death of <persName>Wright</persName> speaks
                        for itself. </p>
               <p> It is of interest to note that there were also <hi rend="italic">minor</hi> engravers working at the <placeName>Mint</placeName> . In
                        1793 <persName>Jacob Bay</persName> cut all of the letter and figure punches used for the cents and half cents of that year. Bay,
                        however, died in the yellow fever epidemic of 1793 and was replaced by <persName>Frederick Geiger</persName> , who cut punches for
                        the copper and silver coinages of 1794; the latter, however, seems to have left the Mint service after that year. We tend to concentrate
                        on the artistry of the wreath and the head of Liberty, but those who executed the letter punches were also engravers in a real sense. </p>
               <p> Each of the two men had been closely involved with type foundries and the actual cutting of type before coming to the <placeName>Mint</placeName> . <persName>Geiger</persName> is perhaps the more interesting because his passage from <placeName>Europe</placeName> was paid for by <persName>Benjamin Franklin</persName> . </p>
               <p> It does not take a major stretch of the imagination to suggest that both <persName>Bay</persName> and <persName>Geiger</persName> helped with die preparation. <persName>Isaiah Thomas</persName> , who wrote an account of printing in <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> that was published in 1810, may well have had first hand information when he
                        stated that each man was an engraver at the <placeName>Mint</placeName> ( <persName>Thomas</persName> [1810] 1970, 30-31). </p>
               <p> On June 17, 1794, <persName>Frederick Riche</persName> was paid $18 for 18 days employment in the engraving department ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Warrants, 30, no. 92). He helped prepare the dies, but to what extent is unknown. We do not
                        even know under what conditions he was employed or why he did not stay on. Chief Engraver <persName>Scot</persName> may have been
                        ill or perhaps simply needed help for a short period of time. That he was not later hired for additional work would seem to indicate,
                        however, that he was not all that skilled. </p>
               <p> During 1794 the coinage of silver began and gold was to follow in 1795. This meant added pressure on the engraver and in early January
                        1795, not November 1794 as reported by <persName>Stewart</persName> ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Warrants, no. 91;
                            <persName>Stewart</persName> 1924, 93), <persName>John Smith Gardner</persName> was hired as <persName>Scot's</persName> assistant. Warrant number 91 is for $121.60 - 76 days work. No <pb n="25"/> warrant mentioning <persName>Gardner</persName> was found for 1794, despite <persName>Stewart's</persName> statement. The assistant engraver helped prepare the
                        working dies for the gold and silver and also created some of the hubs, according to <persName>Stewart</persName> . </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Gardner</persName> served throughout 1795 and into 1796, resigning at the end of March. He returned, however, for 50
                        days' work at the beginning of July 1796, leaving for the second and final time on August 26, for which he received $150 ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Warrants, no. 14). <persName>Scot</persName> was under considerable pressure in the
                        summer of 1796, due to the new draped bust design for the cent as well as preparations for the first quarter eagle coinage. After August
                        1796 there was no assistant engraver again at the Mint until <persName>John Reich</persName> in 1807. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Robert Scot</persName> has been treated somewhat unfairly over the past few decades by researchers. His skills have been
                        derided but it appears that his work was reasonably competent. If he had been as bad as some claim, then he would have been replaced at
                        the first opportunity and this was not done. Only death removed him from office. </p>
               <p> The last engraver to be considered was never an employee of the <placeName>Mint</placeName> although he was once offered a job, that
                        of assistant coiner (Philadelphia Mint Letters, February 8, 1796, 50-52; a detailed account of the affair, prepared for Congress). In
                        fact, the job he turned down in late 1795 was taken a few weeks later by <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> . We are, of course,
                        speaking of <persName>John Harper</persName> , the former coiner of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New
                            Jersey</placeName> coppers. </p>
               <p> In late 1794 <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> Congressman <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName> had
                        been appointed to chair an investigation into the <placeName>Mint</placeName> . There had been persistent public complaints that the
                        institution was not making coins quickly enough to fill the needs of the marketplace. During the course of his investigations, <persName>Boudinot</persName> interviewed <persName>John Harper</persName> . </p>
               <p> The one-time <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coiner pointed out some short-comings of current Mint
                        techniques and was sent by <persName>Boudinot</persName> to Secretary of State <persName>Edmund Randolph</persName> , the
                        Cabinet officer responsible for the <placeName>Mint</placeName> . <persName>Randolph</persName> in turn sent <persName>Harper</persName> to see Mint Director <persName>David Rittenhouse</persName> . Apparently <persName>Harper</persName> was
                        treated as a country bumpkin with little knowledge of minting procedures, because he then set out to prove that he knew more than the
                        Mint officers. </p>
               <p> To make his point <persName>Harper</persName> engraved a pair of dies and invited the committee for a demonstration of coining
                        superior to that practiced by the <placeName>Mint</placeName> . He struck a number of copper pieces with the committee present. They
                        were so impressed by the work that he was sent back to the <pb n="26"/>
                  <placeName>Mint</placeName> . This time the officers got the point and adopted suggestions advanced by <persName>Harper</persName> ; it is believed that these primarily involved a better method of feeding the planchets into the press. </p>

                  <p>3. The "Jefferson" cent (the Fewsmith specimen).</p>
               </figure>
               <p> There has been general agreement among numismatists for some years that the <persName>Harper</persName> "coins" are the famous "
                            <persName>Jefferson</persName> " cents ( <ref target="#fig-10">fig. 3</ref> ). As this has been questioned occasionally of late
                        it is perhaps best to state the reasons for accepting the <persName>Jefferson</persName> pieces as being done by <persName>Harper</persName> . </p>
               <p> The principal objection to the <persName>Harper</persName> attribution was made by <persName>David Proskey</persName> in 1880
                        ( <persName>Proskey</persName> 1880, 35). He seemed to think that these pieces were actually counterfeits of about 1803. In
                        opposition to this, the following may be stated: </p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1)"> Between 1797 and 1814 the price of copper was so high, due to the Napoleonic Wars then convulsing <placeName>Europe</placeName> , that full weight counterfeits on the standard of January 1793, 208 grains for each cent, would have been
                            absolutely pointless. The copper coinage of 1803, however, was on the reduced standard, 168 grains, of December 1795. </item>
                  <item n="2)"> Harper is known to have cut dies in early 1795 and struck specimens although it is true that <persName>Boudinot</persName> does not mention the denomination. In a letter of November 4, 1795, however, <persName>Harper</persName>
                            offered to strike cents on contract which effectively names the denomination he struck earlier (National Archives, RG 104: Harper
                            Letter). </item>
                  <item n="3)"> The dies were not executed in the <placeName>Mint</placeName> as the letters are completely different from those used
                            on regular coinage. </item>
                  <item n="4)"> Some of the <persName>Harper</persName> cents are known on lettered-edge planchets, almost certainly obtained at the
                                <placeName>Mint</placeName> . That lettered edge planchets would have been prepared by a counterfeiter about 1803 is not
                            worthy of consideration. </item>
               </list>

               </head>
               <p> There has been speculation about the number and kind of screw presses used by the early <placeName>Mint</placeName> for the copper
                        coinage. For a long time it was accepted that <persName>Jean Pierre Droz</persName> , a <placeName>Swiss</placeName> engraver
                        employed at the <placeName>Paris Mint</placeName> , had sent over three presses. According to Mint Director <persName>James
                            Ross Snowden</persName> , supposedly writing from documents no longer in existence, three presses arrived from abroad on September 21,
                        1793, shortly after the first building was ready for occupancy ( <persName>Snowden</persName> 1860, 99). </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Snowden</persName> also gives a direct quote from <persName>Voight's</persName> now-missing first account book in
                        which he indicates that one of the workmen was "triming [sic] the heavy press" ( <persName>Snowden</persName> 1860, 99). This
                        implies that at least two presses were then on hand. </p>
               <p> The report of February 1795 states that three presses were on hand, with a fourth then being readied; this last-named press was first
                        used for silver dollar coinage in early May 1795. </p>
               <p> There was no warrant issued for any press or presses purchased in August or September 1792. We do know, however, that <persName>David Rittenhouse</persName> had the unfortunate habit, at least for present-day researchers, of purchasing expensive items for the
                            <placeName>Mint</placeName> out of his own funds ( <persName>Barton</persName> 1813, 389). </p>
               <p> That there was at least one press on hand in July 1792 is certain because the first half dismes were struck at that time; its source is
                        unknown, however, as there is no warrant for purchase, and the press may have been on loan from <persName>John Harper</persName> ,
                        whose <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> cellar at Sixth and Cherry Streets was the site of the temporary mint in the spring and
                        summer of 1792. </p>
               <p> On August 29, 1792, <persName>John Harper</persName> ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Warrants, no. 7) was paid
                        $217.85 for "cutting-presses, castings." This was copied by <persName>Stewart</persName> ( <persName>Stewart</persName> 1924,
                        170) as "cutting, presses, castings." With this correction of <persName>Stewart's</persName> entry it is unlikely that we are
                        dealing with a coining press, although this is still possible. This same entry may also have confused <persName>Snowden</persName>
                        . </p>
               <p> The Warrant book ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Warrants, no. 35) reports that on December 12, 1792, <persName>Daniel Dawson</persName> was paid for a large screw while two days later <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Warrants, no. 36) was paid $194.85 for unspecified " <persName>smith's</persName> work." It seems
                        possible that this means a press was built at the time. It also seems likely, if this <pb n="28"/> assumption is correct, that the <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> press was used for the first silver coinage in 1794. </p>
               <p> If the <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> press is the correct assumption here, then we may also assume that the press used for the 1792
                        half disme coinage was in fact borrowed from <persName>John Harper</persName> and later returned to him. It would appear, on the
                        face of it, that <persName>Harper</persName> sold no coining presses to the <placeName>Mint</placeName> . Neither, it would
                        appear, did <persName>Droz</persName> . </p>
               <p> We find, in the existing <persName>Voight</persName> account book for 1793, that he paid out of contingency funds on April 8 a
                        small sum for hauling a press from " <persName>Mr. Hamilton's</persName> " (National Archives, RG 104: Personnel Record). It is
                        unknown if he meant Treasury Secretary <persName>Alexander Hamilton</persName> by this reference but there is no official payment
                        for any press at this time. </p>
               <p> On May 28, 1794, <persName>John Rutter</persName> &amp; Company was paid $69.06 for iron castings ( <placeName>Philadelphia
                            Mint</placeName> Warrants, no. 81). In the <persName>Stewart</persName> book on the early <placeName>Philadelphia
                            Mint</placeName> , however, it is stated that this was a press weighing fourteen hundredweight ( <persName>Stewart</persName> 1924,
                        175). <persName>Stewart</persName> reports the date as March 25, perhaps a misreading of his source. </p>
               <p> On June 3, 1794, <persName>Hannah Ogden</persName> - presumably the widow or daughter of <persName>Matthias Ogden</persName> ,
                        a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coiner - was paid $47.44 for a coining press ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Warrants, no. 84). The low price for this press would seem to indicate that it was not a large piece of
                        machinery; it is also likely to have been previously well used in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>
                        copper operations. It is possible that the preceding entry, that for the Rutter Company, actually was payment, in part, for hauling the
                            <persName>Ogden</persName> press from <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . </p>
               <p> Mint Director <persName>David Rittenhouse</persName> , in answer to a question from Congress, wrote on November 20, 1794, that a
                        more powerful press was then under construction in order to coin dollars and medals (Am. St. P.: Fin. 1:317). (Many numismatists are
                        aware that the dollars of 1794 were poorly struck because the largest available press did not have sufficient power.) </p>
               <p> On December 8, 1794, <persName>Robert Fitzgerald</persName> was paid $18.67 for "blocks, tackle, thimbles &amp;&amp; for the coining press"
                        ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Warrants, no. 55). The entry seems to say on the face of it that there was only one press
                        then being used, but this is unlikely. Entries in other fiscal accounts ( <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> Journal) for this
                        same date and person merely record a "pulley and tackle" being purchased although <persName>Stewart</persName> mentions the press. </p>
               <pb n="29"/>
               <p> In late 1794 the Congressional investigation chaired by <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName> got underway; their report was made on
                        February 7 of the new year. It stated that the Mint had only three presses but also specifically mentioned screws as if to indicate that
                        spares were kept on hand in case of breakage. The February report on presses is somewhat confusing as it also adds a note that the three
                        presses "when complete" would strike eight to twelve thousand coins per day (Am. St. P.: Fin. 1:354). This may refer to the improvements
                        suggested by <persName>John Harper</persName> , each press being modified appropriately. </p>
               <p> Because the <persName>Boudinot</persName> report was presented on February 7, it becomes especially confusing when we examine <persName>Stewart</persName> for his report of warrants for February 2, 1795. He shows payment to Samuel Howell and Company for two
                        small presses and one large one; the large press, according to <persName>Stewart</persName> , weighed one ton, eleven
                        hundredweight, or 3,472 pounds ( <persName>Stewart</persName> 1924, 178). The latter, however, cannot be the large coining press
                        mentioned in the November 20 letter as dollar coinage did not resume until early May 1795 and there is a warrant for a heavy press at
                        that time, also to Howell and Company. </p>
               <p> The odd thing about this <persName>Stewart</persName> entry for February 2, 1795, is that the three existing account books covering
                        1795, all of which are on display at the present <placeName>Philadelphia Mint</placeName> , do not indicate at all under this date
                        that presses were purchased from the Howell company. In fact all three entries merely indicate payment for cuttings, wrought iron, and
                        hauling. ( <persName>Stewart</persName> clearly had access to a ledger no longer available in the Archives.) </p>
               <p> Considering all of the above, the following presses were theoretically on hand in February 1795: </p>
               <list type="numbered">
                  <item n="1)"> The press used to strike the half dismes in July 1792, </item>
                  <item n="2)-4)"> The presses mentioned by <persName>Snowden</persName> as having arrived from abroad in September 1792, </item>
                  <item n="5)"> The press constructed by <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> in December 1792, </item>
                  <item n="6)"> The press obtained from "Mr. <persName>Hamilton</persName> " in April 1793, </item>
                  <item n="7)">The Rutter press of May 1794,</item>
                  <item n="8)">The Ogden press of June 1794, and</item>
                  <item n="9)-11)"> The presses obtained from Howell &amp; Company in January 1795. </item>
               </list>
               <p> We can all think of scenarios by which one press went bad and was replaced by another or the named presses were in fact planchet
                        cutters. <pb n="30"/> Until further documents are uncovered, however, this will be pure speculation. </p>
               <p> There does seem to be one likely conclusion to be drawn from the above, however: <persName>Jean Pierre Droz</persName> did not send
                        any coining presses to the <placeName>United States</placeName> , despite reports to the contrary ( <persName>Breen</persName>
                        1954, 4). Had <persName>Droz</persName> sent presses to <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> one would
                        expect them to have been of first-class construction and not needing replacement within a few months. We can, however, safely say that
                        three presses were in use during February 1795, the others having broken down or been sold for scrap; just which three, however, is a
                        question not to be solved here. </p>
               <p> As a mere opinion, it may be that the cent and half cent coinage of 1793 was struck on either the "heavy" press of September 1792 or the
                            <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> press of late 1792. Perhaps both were used. </p>

               </head>
               <p> Although most collectors are aware that public criticism forced a change of design for the cent in 1793, there has been little real
                        interest in the political or artistic elements involved. The Chain on the Chain cent certainly represented the bond between the states,
                        but beyond that, the new Federal union. There was still considerable opposition to the new government and the coin was meant to proclaim
                        the strength of such unity ( <ref target="#fig-11">fig. 4</ref> ). </p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-11">

                  <p> 4. The Chain cent of 1793 ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 1-A). </p>
               </figure>
               <p> The crude obverse head of Liberty, by <persName>Henry Voight</persName> , cannot be characterized precisely, but probably derives,
                        directly or indirectly, from the Libertas Americana medal ordered by <persName>Benjamin Franklin</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> during the 1780s to celebrate the peace of 1783 between <placeName>Britain</placeName> and
                        the <placeName>United States</placeName> . It also, of course, commemorated the American victory. </p>
               <p> The public misunderstood the symbolism but one suspects that die- <pb n="31"/> hard opponents of the new Federal government took
                        particular offense at the Chain motif. The aristocratic <persName>Alexander Hamilton</persName> was blamed although the artwork was
                        almost certainly the choice of President <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> and Secretary of State <persName>Thomas Jefferson</persName> ; the latter was the cabinet officer responsible for the <placeName>Mint</placeName> during
                        1792 and 1793. </p>
               <p> The Wreath cent design was simply a return to patterns of 1792. <persName>Voight</persName> by now had matured somewhat in his
                        engraving skill and managed to produce a better head of Liberty, though far from outstanding. We know of no criticism of this design,
                        although some must have existed. </p>
               <p> The arrival of <persName>Joseph Wright</persName> as engraver in early July 1793 made a great difference. With the exception of the
                        half cent reverse, which <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> may have partly engraved in whole or part, the half cent and liberty
                        cap cent dies of 1793 were prepared by <persName>Wright</persName> ( <ref target="#fig-12">fig. 5</ref> ). </p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-12">

               </figure>
               <p> Although a subjective thought, it would appear that <persName>Thomas Jefferson</persName> was strongly involved in the new liberty
                        cap cent design. He was a strong advocate of the new French revolutionary government, which had overthrown <persName>Louis
                            XVI</persName> , and the liberty cap was a symbol of the new regime in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> . It is
                        perhaps significant that the liberty cap motif does not appear on any new design executed after <persName>Jefferson</persName> left
                        office in December 1793. </p>
               <p> In the summer of 1796 the draped bust design was introduced to the cent ( <ref target="#fig-13">fig. 6</ref> ). It had first been used
                        in the fall of 1795 on the silver dollar but gradually spread to the other denominations as time permitted. It is quite likely, for
                        example, that <persName>John Smith Gardner</persName> returned in July 1796 because of the pressure for new cent dies. </p>
               <p> It is also worth noting that <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName> , mint director since late October 1795, was a strong Federalist
                        (and thus anti-French) and would have been more than pleased to remove the liberty cap from the copper coinage. </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">4. The Weight Standards for Copper Coinage</hi>
               </head>
               <p> In April 1792, when the basic mint law was enacted by Congress, the weight of the cent was set at 264 grains, the half cent being
                        proportional. By November of that year Director <persName>David Rittenhouse</persName> had discovered that copper prices were
                        rising and soon the government would have to issue copper coins at a loss. He made this known to <persName>Thomas
                            Jefferson</persName> , who appealed to Congress to lower the weights. This was done in mid-January 1793 with the cent weight being set
                        at 208 grains. Coinage began in late February on this standard. </p>
               <p> The general practice in 1793 and 1794 was to remelt the scrap copper remaining after the planchets had been cut out and then use the new
                        ingots for a fresh coinage. The only trouble with all of this was that the rollers got progressively worse and the chief coiner wanted
                        to save them for the coinage of precious metals. At the end of 1794 due to the pressure of silver coinage, the <placeName>Mint</placeName> had simply stopped coining copper. </p>
               <p> There was a minor coinage of copper in the fall of 1795, Mint Director <persName>Henry William De Saussure</persName> and <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName> reluctantly ordering a small number of cents and half cents made. The public criticism apparently
                        was sufficient that it overcame the problem with the rollers, which of course continued to cause problems. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Boudinot</persName> took careful stock of the situation and reported to the Secretary of State on December 3, 1795 that
                        rising copper prices were also a problem (Philadelphia Mint Letters, 38-45; part of this letter was reprinted in Am. St. P.: Fin.
                        1:357-358, but the part about copper was not used). The President had the authority, under an earlier law, to lower the weight by edict
                        and did so toward the end of the same month. The cent now weighed 168 grains and would remain at this level until 1857, when the
                        copper-nickel cent was introduced. </p>
               <pb n="33"/>
               <p> With the reduced weight, coinage resumed strongly. The rollers were used but by late in 1796 it became common to sell the scrap copper
                        on the open market. <placeName>The Mint</placeName> used sheet copper in late 1796 as its primary source. After 1797 the <placeName>Mint</placeName> virtually never rolled copper for coinage, preferring to import ready-made planchets from <persName>Matthew Boulton</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> . </p>
               <p> The theory behind the relatively heavy weight of the copper coinage was that it would circulate on its own merit. Too many of the
                        light-weight coppers of the 1780s had been ridiculed by the public and the new government was determined to avoid that problem. It was
                        not, in fact, until 1864 that minor coinage was given legal-tender status. </p>
               <p> As a result of the heavy weight, there were few attempts at counterfeiting the copper coinage between 1793 and 1857 and none at all
                        prior to 1815 as is known at present. </p>

               <p> Study of the strawberry leaf cent is as old as the study of large cents itself. The first notes about it were made by <persName>Joseph N. T. Levick</persName> in 1868, who wrote as follows: <q>
                     <persName>Rich[ard] D. Winsor</persName> , <placeName>Providence</placeName> , <placeName>R[hode] I[sland]</placeName>
                            has 2 '93s both of which I ought to have to discribe [sic] + also to photograph. His broken die Lib[erty] Cap × from the Mickley
                            Coll[ection] is the finest one I ever saw, + the obverse being dif[ferent] variety from that of the perfect die.- </q>
                  <q> The other variety is more like No. 4 or 6. At the top in the word "Liberty" it resembles No. 4, only the letters or the whole word
                            is not directly over the head as in no. 4.- The R of Liberty is opposite the roll or curlicue [that] is rolled back from the
                            forehead. Under the bust is a sprig of four branch[es] at the end of each is a trefoil or clover leaf. The reverse is similar to No.
                            6.- </q>
                  <q> The R in the word "Liberty" is somewhat taller than the rest of the word.- </q>
                  <q> The trefoils under the bust resemble very much those to be seen on the wreaths of 93s. </q>
                  <q> The date is almost obliterated so much so as to be indecipherable - in fact the whole is very much worn. </q>
                  <q> This piece Mr. <persName>Winsor</persName> purchased of Mr. <persName>Meader</persName> of <placeName>Prov[idence]
                                R[hode] I[sland]</placeName> who took [it] in circulation many years ago.- Paine says in 1845. </q>
                  <q> Mr. <persName>W[insor]</persName> says that this 93 is more nearly like the 4 of plate,- the chief distinction however is in
                            the mark under the bust instead of 3 leaves it is a cluster of <hi rend="italic">four</hi> clover leaves. Mr. <persName>Woodward</persName> pronounced it the only one he had ever seen of that kind. The planchet is very little smaller than Liberty Cap,
                            quite thick + has bars + vine on edge. ( <persName>Levick</persName> 1868, 25-26) </q>

               <p> This specimen has been unique since 1845 and has one of the most lengthy pedigrees of any large cent (listed below). </p>

                        identifiable owner of the strawberry leaf cent acquired it, is <persName>George T. Paine</persName> , who became a corresponding
                        member of the American Numismatic Society on March 12, 1868. He lived in <placeName>Providence</placeName> , <placeName>Rhode
                            Island</placeName> , so he would be in a position to know when <persName>Meader</persName> acquired the strawberry leaf cent ( <persName>Roll</persName> 1870, 100). </p>

                            Island</placeName> . <persName>John Meader</persName> is not listed in the 1840 census of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> ,
                        so he <pb n="37"/> appears to have arrived in <placeName>Providence</placeName> between June 1, 1840 (the 1840 census was taken as of
                        that date [ <hi rend="italic">Genealogical Research</hi> 1983, 36]) and July 20, 1841 (the date of the preface of <persName>H.

                        has a partnership with <persName>Goff</persName> , called <persName>Meader</persName> &amp; <persName>Goff</persName> , and

                        banking connection - the Manufacturer's Bank ( <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>Providence</placeName> Directory ( <persName>Brown</persName> ) </hi> 1844, 123). This must be the Mechanics &amp;
                        Manufacturers Bank of Providence, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> ( <persName>Haxby</persName> RI-345), founded in 1827,
                        which in 1865 became the Fifth National Bank of <placeName>Providence</placeName> ( <persName>Haxby</persName> 1988, 4:2238). By

                        Providence list <persName>Meader</persName> under the category " <placeName>West India</placeName> Goods and Groceries, <hi rend="italic">Retail,"</hi> which indicates that <persName>Meader</persName> , like many grocers, made much of his profit from
                        sugar. </p>
               <p> A large retail grocer in <placeName>Providence, Rhode Island</placeName> , whose harbor was filled with clippers from all over the
                        world, could take an unusual looking copper coin in over the counter and set it aside as a curiosity. <persName>Meader</persName>
                        certainly kept up his interest in numismatics, because in 1867 he became the first secretary of the <placeName>Rhode
                            Island</placeName> Numismatic Association (Transactions 1867, 75). In 1868 he was elected its president (Transactions 1868a, 94). </p>
               <p> The first public exhibition of the strawberry leaf cent almost certainly occurred at the meeting of the <placeName>Rhode
                            Island</placeName> Numismatic Association held on March 16, 1868. The minutes say: <q> The chief attraction of the evening was the
                            exhibition of United States Cents. Nearly every member present showed a complete set, in fine condition. Mr. <persName>Winsor's</persName> collection deserved especial notice; also President <persName>Meader's</persName> , which contained seven
                            varieties of the issue of 1793 (Transactions 1868b, 110). </q>
               </p>
               <p> The coin was exhibited again at the meeting held on December 21, 1868, and described with particularity for the first time: <q> An
                            interesting feature of this meeting was the exhibition of <pb n="38"/> specimens of the 1793 cent. Some very fine pieces were shown
                            by Messrs. <persName>Jenks, Gorton</persName> , and <persName>Winsor</persName> . The Liberty Cap (cracked die) and Clover
                            Leaf varieties belonging to the latter gentleman attracted special notice, one for its condition, and the other for its rarity
                            (Transactions 1869, 71). </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Meader</persName> exhibited no cent varieties whatsoever, although in March he had exhibited seven varieties of 1793.
                        This suggests that some time on or before December 21, 1868, <persName>Meader</persName> sold his cent collection to <persName>Winsor</persName> , including the strawberry leaf cent. </p>
               <p> In October 1877 <persName>David Proskey</persName> discovered and catalogued the second variety of strawberry leaf cent, the ONE
                        CENT high variety. This specimen is the finest known strawberry leaf cent. <persName>Proskey</persName> described it as follows:
                            <q> 1793 Wreath Cent. "Stars and stripes" on edge with <hi rend="italic">three clover leaves and blossom under the bust.</hi> Fair
                            condition, but date and legend perfectly distinct. <hi rend="italic">Unique</hi> , both obverse and reverse being from a different
                            die to the one described by <persName>S. S. Crosby</persName> , Esq. ( <persName>Proskey</persName> 1877, lot 201). </q>
               </p>
               <p> This coin was bid up to $77.50 and sold to the coin dealer <persName>H. G. Sampson</persName> , who was acting for <persName>Lorin G. Parmelee</persName> . The underbidder on the coin was <persName>Joseph Levick</persName> , who was acting for
                            <persName>Crosby</persName> with instructions to pay up to $75 for the cent. We know this from a notation in <persName>Levick's</persName> hand in one of the ANS copies of the catalogue, which reads, "I bid to 75$ for <persName>Crosby</persName> ."
                        ( <persName>Levick</persName> 1877). The <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> said, "We have received from Mr.
                            <persName>Proskey</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , the following notes of
                        other recent coin sales in that city, for which we desire to express our thanks," and reported the sale of the strawberry leaf cent as
                        follows: <q> 1793, wreath cent, with clover leaves under bust, (then supposed to be <hi rend="italic">unique,)</hi> fair, $77.50. (Coin
                            Sales 1878, 75) </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Proskey</persName> evidently no longer considered that coin to be unique. The reason was because the dealer <persName>Edouard Frossard</persName> brought another strawberry leaf cent to the sale to compare it with what became the <placeName>Parmelee</placeName> specimen. We know <persName>Frossard</persName> did this because of the description in the first
                        auction appearance of the Merritt-Haines-Saltus-ANS specimen, <q> Head of Liberty, with <hi rend="italic">three clover leaves</hi> and
                                <hi rend="italic">one flower</hi> under the bust; the reverse with ONE CENT within wreath. Of this extremely rare variety only
                            three specimens are known; this one, on the whole, equal to the one sold a year ago at <placeName>Clinton Hall</placeName> , with
                            which we had occasion to compare it. Barely fair; LIBER- <pb n="39"/> TY distinct; 9 and 3 of date weak. (All the preceding 1793
                            Cents have the bars and leaves on edge.) ( <persName>Frossard</persName> 1879a). </q>
               </p>
               <p> The third strawberry leaf cent, which was the second example of the ONE CENT high variety, which <persName>Frossard</persName> had
                        found, was sold as part of the George Merritt Collection in 1879, and bought by <persName>Ferguson Haines</persName> . <persName>Ferguson Haines</persName> attempted to resell it at a profit, but the coin never achieved his reserve; it was finally sold
                        after his death in December 1894. This was the very coin which caused <persName>Lyman Haines</persName> Low to call <persName>Edouard Frossard</persName> a liar and the two ended up rolling about on the floor, kicking each other, and <persName>H. P. Smith</persName> lost a diamond pin while trying to separate the two ( <persName>Adams</persName> 1911a; <persName>Steigerwalt</persName> 1911; <persName>Adams</persName> 1911b; <persName>Carlson</persName> 1978). The coin was
                        donated to the American Numismatic Society on May 16, 1906, by <persName>John Sanford Saltus</persName> as part of his collection
                        of cents and half cents. The collection of cents numbered 124 and was described in the accession book as "complete, including
                        varieties." The ANS accession number is 1906.99. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>William Rabin</persName> , a dealer in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> in September 1941 a fourth example: <q>The Rarest of All U.S. Cents</q>
                  <q>1793</q>
                  <q>STRAWBERRY LEAF</q>

               </p>
               <p> This was considered to be a ludicrously high price at the time. </p>
               <p> This coin may very well be the one which was first reported in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> in December 1933, in an article
                        about unusual coins discovered while going over banks' holdings during the bank holiday and after the gold turn-in order: <q> One of the
                            "strawberry sprig" pennies has turned up. This penny was minted in 1793 and is noted as being unusual due to the wreath of a
                            strawberry sprig over the date. It is listed as being worth over three hundred dollars among collectors (Interesting 1933). </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Clapp</persName> commented to <persName>Sheldon</persName> about the Rabin specimen in 1946, <q> I examined the
                            Phila 5-E and judging from <persName>Crosby's</persName> figure, the Phila. cent was the better. I could have had it for
                            $2500.00 don't know whether it was ever sold ( <persName>Clapp</persName> 1946, 4). </q>
               </p>
               <p> Other advanced collectors were suspicious of the Rabin cent when it was first advertised. In the mid-1940s, <persName>Homer K.
                            Downing</persName> took notes <pb n="40"/> of a conversation with <persName>Henry C. Hines</persName> , including the remark,
                        "Strawberry offered by <persName>Rabin</persName> for $2500 is questionable" ( <persName>Downing</persName> , [1944-1945?]).
                        There is no question of its genuineness today; it is as genuine as the other three strawberry leaf cents. The surface of the coin is
                        porous, but the detail is sharper than the Saltus-ANS specimen. </p>

               </head>
               <p> When the Chapmans catalogued the Winsor collection in 1895, they said of the strawberry leaf cent, "Excessively rare, only about six
                        specimens known - none fine" ( <persName>Chapman</persName> 1895, 51 lot 823). Actually only three specimens were known when the
                        Chapmans wrote. The estimate of six is an error which crept in under deadline pressure. Similarly, <persName>James Kelly</persName>
                        said in his May, 1949 auction that six were known. <persName>Woodward</persName> and <persName>Frossard</persName> , by
                        contrast, got the number right: three. </p>
               <p> There is a persistent rumor of a fifth strawberry leaf cent. In <hi rend="italic">Early American Cents,</hi> Sheldon lists the unique
                        5-D, and then enumerates three 5-Es: condition 1 (which is the Saltus-ANS piece), condition 3 (which is the Parmelee-Hall-Staples
                        piece), and a third described as "Good," (which is the Rabin piece). He adds, "There have been rumors of the existence of still another"
                        ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1949, 61-62). In his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia,</hi>
                  <persName>Walter Breen</persName> lists five strawberry leaf cents: 1) 5-D; 2) 5- E Parmelee-Hall-Staples, VG; 3) 5-E Saltus-ANS,
                        AG; 4) 5-E Rabin, AG; and 5) 5-E "Reported" ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 180-181; catalogue number <persName>Breen</persName> 1643). </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Walter Breen</persName> mentioned one of these rumors in a letter to <persName>Richard Rosichan</persName> in
                        October or November 1954. <persName>Breen</persName> wrote, <q> There is a rumor ... that a <placeName>Swedish</placeName> or
                                <placeName>Danish</placeName> sculptor owned a "clover leaf" cent in VF-20. It was exhibited at the <placeName>N.Y.
                                Numismatic Club</placeName> some years back but the fellow subsequently went back overseas and took the coin with him. I have little
                            doubt that the coin will subsequently turn up. (Money Tree 1995, lot 368) </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Rosichan</persName> apparently suggested that the Swedish-Danish coin might be an electrotype, because <persName>Breen</persName> replied, <q> If there exists an electro of a Vf clover-leaf cent, where is the original it was made from? I have seen
                            only one electro and it is of the NC-2; this electro is in ANS. (Money Tree 1995, lot 369) </q>
               </p>
               <p> (I now know of at least four different electrotypes, but all are of NC-2, <persName>Crosby</persName> 5-D; I shall enumerate the
                        electrotypes later.) </p>
               <pb n="41"/>
               <p> I tried to confirm this rumor by searching the minutes of the <placeName>New York Numismatic Club</placeName> , as published in the
                            <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> , for the period 1940-1954. The minutes of that period listed the exhibits in detail. I did not
                        find anyone exhibiting a strawberry leaf cent of any kind; the only persons to exhibit cent varieties in depth were <persName>Homer K. Downing</persName> and <persName>Willard C. Blaisdell</persName> . I did not notice any recognizably Scandinavian names
                        among the attendees, either. </p>
               <p> In January 1957 <persName>Walter Breen</persName> started a very useful short column in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi>
                        called the "Cent Collectors' Forum"; this summarized the state of research on large cents, probably as part of the run-up to the
                        publication of the second edition of the <persName>Sheldon</persName> book, <hi rend="italic">Penny Whimsy.</hi> Breen got himself
                        thoroughly confused as to the number of strawberry leaf cents. He suggested in January 1957 that there were as many as six strawberry
                        leaf cents - perhaps he was influenced by the Chapmans or <persName>James Kelly</persName> . These were the unique 5-D, and five
                        examples of the 5-E: </p>

                                Kelly</persName> , which was the finest known 5-E ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1957a, 25-26). </item>

               <p> It is interesting that the Swedish or Danish sculptor mentioned in the 1954 letter has vanished by 1957. </p>
               <p> This multiplicity of strawberry leaf cents may be settled by noting that coins have been counted twice. By April 1957 <persName>Breen</persName> decided that the number 5, the <persName>Kelly</persName> - <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New
                            England</placeName> coin, and number 3, the <placeName>Parmelee</placeName> coin, were probably the same piece ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1957b, 419). This is correct. </p>
               <p> The doubling of the other coin is a bit more complicated. In <hi rend="italic">Early American Cents</hi>
                  <persName>Sheldon</persName> writes about 5-E, <q> When <persName>Crosby</persName> wrote, but two were known; one of them in
                            condition 1, and the other, in the <persName>Dr. Hall</persName> collection, could perhaps be described as condition 3. This is
                            the one photographed (obverse and reverse) for the <persName>Crosby</persName> book. ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1949,
                            62). </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Breen</persName> may have been led astray because <persName>Sheldon</persName> undergraded the coins: the Saltus-ANS
                        piece, which <persName>Sheldon</persName> here called condition 1, <persName>Breen</persName> in 1957 graded as "condition 3
                        or 4," and the Parmelee piece, <pb n="42"/> which <persName>Sheldon</persName> called condition 3, <persName>Breen</persName>
                        said "may reach or exceed condition 7." </p>
               <p> The clear solution is that the "condition 1" cent and the "Saltus-ANS" cent are the same coin. Unfortunately, when <persName>Breen</persName> and <persName>Sheldon</persName> tried to correct this error in 1957, they confused this matter further. <persName>Breen</persName> wrote in April 1957, "Dr. <persName>Sheldon</persName> now admits that the 'Condition 1' example of
                            <persName>Crosby</persName> 5-E was mentioned from a reference to one of the three cents known to <persName>Crosby</persName> , and therefore it must have been the 5-D" ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1957b, 419). This is not true; the
                        Condition 1 Strawberry leaf cent in <hi rend="italic">Early American Cents</hi> is the Saltus-ANS 5-E, not the unique 5-D. Perhaps <persName>Sheldon</persName> was genuinely confused; or perhaps he was so vain about his grading system that he preferred to muddy
                        the waters further, rather than admit he had undergraded an about good 3-4 coin as basal state 1. </p>
               <p> To summarize the rumors of additional strawberry Leaf cents: </p>

               <p> Finally, there are two mentions of strawberry leaf cents which I believe refer to actual coins: the advertisement of <persName>A. E. Marks</persName> in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> of July 1893, which I believe refers to what became the Saltus-ANS
                        coin; and the mention of the discovery among banks' holdings of coins in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> of December 1933, which
                        I believe refers to the Rabin coin. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Del Bland</persName> very kindly brought the Marks advertisement to my attention. It reads as follows: <q>Coins for
                            Sale.</q>
                  <q> By <persName>A. E. Marks Woodfords</persName> Me. </q>
                  <q> 1793 Cent. Strawberry leaves and blossom over date; much better than the Parmelee cent. </q>
                  <q> $100 ( <persName>Marks</persName> 1893). </q>
               </p>
               <p> To describe what became the ANS specimen as "much better than the <pb n="43"/> Parmelee cent" is an extreme example of overgrading.
                        Despite the grade discrepancy, I think this must be the Saltus-ANS specimen because that coin was then owned by <persName>Ferguson Haines</persName> of <placeName>Bideford, Maine</placeName> , which is quite close to <persName>Woodfords</persName> .
                            <persName>Haines</persName> had been seeking to sell the coin since 1880, but no one would meet his price. It would be
                        remarkable if <persName>Maine</persName> harbored two strawberry leaf cents in 1893 - <persName>Maine</persName> has never
                        been a wealthy state. Furthermore, the price of $100 is exactly the same as <persName>Haines'</persName> reserve at its last
                        auction appearance, the Chapman auction of October 1888. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Denis Loring</persName> expressed the situation best a quarter century ago: "Exactly four Strawberry Leaf cents are known
                        to exist; three share one reverse die, while the fourth is unique. Periodically rumors of another specimen circulate, but to date all
                        searches have been fruitless" ( <persName>Loring</persName> 1972, 92). </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Photographs of the Strawberry Leaf Cents</hi>
               </head>
               <p> The strawberry leaf cents have been listed as a variety in every work on 1793 large cents from <persName>Crosby</persName> forward.
                        They are so rare that even obtaining photographs of them is difficult. <persName>Levick</persName> was the first to encounter this
                        difficulty. When <persName>Levick</persName> assembled the cents for his photographic plate of 1793 large cents, the only
                        strawberry leaf cent known was the unique 5-D. <persName>Levick</persName> had to photograph obverse and reverse at the same time
                        of a unique coin. He had an electrotype made of the coin ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 1869). </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>George Kolbe</persName> discovered and <persName>Frank Van Zandt</persName> confirmed and published that there were
                        two versions of the <persName>Levick</persName> plate ( <persName>Van Zandt</persName> 1994). As best as I can tell, for the
                        first version, the electrotype was used for the reverse and the genuine 5-D for the obverse. For the second version, the electrotype was
                        used for the obverse and the coin for the reverse. </p>
               <p> In the nineteenth century the strawberry leaf cent was the key coin in the large cent series. When writers on large cents acquired a
                        strawberry leaf cent, they could embark upon a descriptive account of the entire series. When <persName>David Proskey</persName>
                        and <persName>Edouard Frossard</persName> had consigned to them a strawberry leaf cent, they commenced the only two comprehensive
                        listings of the large cent series ever published. The strawberry leaf cent has inspired comprehensive monographs of the entire large
                        cent series as well as narrower treatments of cents of 1793 or just the strawberry leaf cent alone. Appropriately, a line drawing of <pb n="44"/> the obverse of the strawberry leaf cent serves as the frontispiece for the <persName>Doughty</persName> monograph,
                        which was an expansion of <persName>Proskey's</persName> work. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Proskey</persName> had line drawings made in 1879 from what became the Parmelee specimen ( <persName>Proskey</persName> 1879, 169; <ref target="#fig-14">fig 1</ref> ); <persName>Doughty</persName> had this line drawing re-done in
                        1890 when he published <persName>Proskey's</persName> articles as a separate book ( <persName>Doughty</persName> 1890, 6; <ref target="#fig-15">fig. 2</ref> ), partly because the <persName>Proskey</persName> drawing was designed to show the sprig as a
                        strawberry plant, and <persName>Doughty</persName> believed it to be a laurel blossom. The <persName>Doughty</persName>
                        drawing is more detailed and more careful in depicting the individual coin; the <persName>Proskey</persName> drawing just tried to
                        show the general points of the type. </p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Frossard</persName> used the George Merritt collection as the basis for his monograph on large cents, and the most
                        notable coin in the Merritt collection was the third example to be discovered of a strawberry leaf (the second 5-E). For the cents of
                        1793, <persName>Frossard</persName> photographed actual <pb n="45"/> coins, which meant that he needed two examples of each die
                        marriage to show obverse and reverse. <persName>Frossard</persName> used the Merritt 5-E for the reverse (this is the coin which is
                        now in the ANS collection) and borrowed from <placeName>Parmelee</placeName> the finer example of the 5-E to show the obverse. <persName>Frossard</persName> did not publish any photograph showing reverse D ( <persName>Frossard</persName> 1879b). </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>The Parmelee</placeName> sale of 1890 had on its plate 6 a colorized photograph of fugio cents, large cents, and half
                        cents, including the finest strawberry leaf cent. This has been used for the photograph in the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book of United
                            States Coins</hi> (the Red Book) in every edition since the very first one issued in 1946. The Red Book has cleaned up the
                        photograph from time to time, so that it is not so dark, but it is clearly the same photograph. The first edition of the Red Book listed
                        a price for the strawberry leaf cent - $1500, in italics, indicating that it was an approximation. Since the ninth edition, which was
                        issued in 1955, the strawberry leaf cent has been unpriced ( <persName>Yeoman</persName> 1947, 63; <persName>Yeoman</persName>
                        1956, 63). </p>
               <p> In 1897 <persName>Crosby</persName> expanded his article on the cents of 1793 into a fuller monograph. He used the collection of
                        Dr. <persName>Thomas Hall</persName> as the basis for his work. His photographic plate may be either a composite, or, perhaps more
                        likely, photographs of electrotype shells, because he shows obverse and reverse of the same coin, namely the <placeName>Parmelee</placeName> 5-E, then in the Dr. Hall collection ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 1897, plate II). For reverse die D (ONE
                        CENT low) <persName>Crosby</persName> used the <placeName>Winsor-Hall</placeName> specimen; for obverse die 5 and reverse die E
                        (ONE CENT high) the obverse and reverse of the <placeName>Parmelee-Hall</placeName> specimen. This is the only occasion on which a
                        photograph of the reverse of the Parmelee-Hall-Staples 5-E has been published, as <persName>Bill Noyes</persName> pointed out to
                        me. We know it must be the reverse of the <placeName>Parmelee-Hall</placeName> piece, and not the Merritt-Saltus-ANS piece (which at
                        the time was the only other example of reverse E known) because the Merritt-Saltus-ANS piece is easily recognized by the large chunk of
                        copper missing from its reverse on the lower left. </p>
               <p> In 1914 the American Numismatic Society put on one of the most extensive exhibits of <placeName>United States</placeName> and
                        pre-federal coinage ever held. Many superb rarities were displayed. One of the rarities was the Saltus-ANS strawberry leaf cent, by then
                        owned by the Society. The exhibit catalogue had a new photograph of the obverse and reverse of the Saltus-ANS cent (ANS 1914, 65 and
                        plate 22). This identical photograph was then re-used by <persName>Wayte Raymond</persName> when he issued his <hi rend="italic">
                            Standard Catalogue of <placeName>United States</placeName> Coins </hi> in the 1930s ( <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>
                  <pb n="46"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Catalogue,</hi> 1935, 27). The photograph may be identified by a number of black specks which appear on the photograph
                        and which are not on the coin. </p>
               <p> In September 1941, <persName>William Rabin</persName> advertised for sale the fourth strawberry leaf cent to be discovered, and
                        published photographs of the obverse and reverse in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> ( <persName>Rabin</persName> 1941).
                        Photographs of this coin also appeared in the <persName>James Kelly</persName> auction of May 1949. </p>
               <p> When <persName>Sheldon</persName> and <persName>Downing</persName> assembled the photographs for <hi rend="italic">Early
                            American Cents,</hi> the unique 5-D was in the collection of <persName>Charles M. Williams</persName> of <placeName>Cincinnati</placeName> . They were unable to obtain it for photography, so they used the reverse of the electrotype in the Clapp
                        collection in the ANS. We know this by plate-matching the <hi rend="italic">Early American Cents</hi> plate to the Clapp electrotype and
                        comparing it with the unique 5-D; the most notable distinguishing mark on the electrotype is a discoloration at about 2 o'clock on the
                        reverse which <persName>Denis Loring</persName> pointed out ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1949, plate 1). What we know from
                        plate-matching is confirmed by a list entitled "Halftones" prepared by <persName>Homer K. Downing</persName> - a list of which 1793
                        cents <persName>Sheldon</persName> and <persName>Downing</persName> planned to photograph for <hi rend="italic">Early American
                            Cents</hi> . At this point the NC designation had not been invented; instead <persName>Downing</persName> marked the NCs with a
                        star. The entry reads, "* 5D O + R Clapp Electro," indicating that they intended to use the Clapp electrotype for their photograph of
                        the obverse and reverse of the <persName>Crosby</persName> 5-D ( <persName>Downing</persName> [1947?]). For the 5-E, they used
                        the Saltus-ANS specimen. As it happened, <persName>Sheldon</persName> did not illustrate obverse and reverse of die marriages
                        separately: he arranged his photographs in die chains, so the obverse of the Saltus-ANS 5-E served for the 5-D as well, and the
                        electrotype photograph was only used for reverse D. </p>
               <p> In the late 1950s <persName>Sheldon</persName> obtained a photograph of the actual 5-D and the new photograph of reverse D replaced
                        the photograph of the electrotype in <hi rend="italic">Penny Whimsy.</hi> It is clearly a new photograph because it has a much darker
                        tone than the other photographs on the page ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1976, plate 1). <persName>Sheldon</persName> and
                            <persName>Dorothy Iselin Paschal</persName> had many coins re-photographed by <persName>Kenneth Bressett</persName> in May
                        1957 for the revision. Since 1991 the <persName>Bressett</persName> negatives have been in the ANS library, but a review of the
                        eight rolls of negative film showed no strawberry leaf cent, so the <hi rend="italic">Penny Whimsy</hi> photograph must come from
                        somewhere else. It is possible that <persName>Sheldon</persName> obtained this photograph through <persName>Walter
                            Breen</persName> , who worked closely with <persName>Sheldon</persName> and <persName>Paschal</persName> on the revision.
                            <persName>Breen</persName> was able to obtain the 5-D and the <persName>Rabin</persName> 5-E from <pb n="47"/> Floyd Starr
                        for photography, which he published in <hi rend="italic">Empire Topics</hi> in 1959. The photograph of the Saltus-ANS example continued
                        to be used for obverse 5 and reverse E. </p>
               <p> In 1984, <persName>Stack's</persName> published excellent black and white and color photographs of the 5-D and the <persName>Rabin</persName> 5-E in their catalogue of the Floyd Starr collection ( <persName>Stack's</persName> 1984, lots 6 and
                        7). </p>
               <p> For <persName>Breen's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia</hi> , a photograph was obtained of the Saltus-ANS specimen, probably prepared in the ANS's own
                        photographic laboratory by <persName>Michael Di Biase</persName> ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 181). </p>
               <p> Superb photographs were made of the strawberry leaf cents around 1988, when <persName>William C. Noyes</persName> photographed the
                        coins then in the possession of <persName>R. E. Naftzger</persName> , jr., including the strawberry leaf cent. These served as the
                        basis for <persName>Noyes's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">United States Large Cents</hi> , making available for the first time excellent, greatly enlarged photographs of the
                        strawberry leaf cents ( <persName>Noyes</persName> 1991). The Rabin coin, however, looks better in real life - when viewed "in the
                        copper" - than it does in the Noyes photograph. </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Iconography of the Strawberry Leaf Cents</hi>
               </head>
               <p> There has been much debate over what the leaves represent. <persName>Levick</persName> and <persName>Crosby</persName> in 1868
                        and 1869 call them clovers or trefoils. The strawberry leaf designation goes back to <persName>David Proskey</persName> , who first
                        used it in November 1879 in the <hi rend="italic">Coin Collector's Journal</hi> in his series of articles on cents, which were later
                        expanded into the reference work published under the name of <persName>Francis Worcester Doughty</persName> . <persName>Doughty</persName> , however, decided that the sprig was actually a laurel blossom, and amended <persName>Proskey's</persName>
                        text accordingly ( <persName>Doughty</persName> 1890, 6), and other writers have followed <persName>Doughty</persName> ( <persName>Rice</persName> 1901, 3; <persName>Hartman</persName> 1939, 283). <persName>Crosby</persName> decided that the
                        leaves were actually cotton leaves and a cotton boll, and proposed the title "cotton leaf cent" ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 1897,
                        19, 21). </p>
               <p> I consulted my sister, a professionally trained horticulturalist, on this question, and I sent her a photocopy of the <persName>Jack Collins</persName> photograph of the Atwater wreath cent, and asked her to identify the leaves. She said that the leaves looked
                        somewhat like strawberry leaves, but the depiction is more imaginary than from nature. My sister found the beaded sprays very
                        mysterious. </p>
               <p> This is more useful an answer than it sounds: our wreath is an imaginary wreath, the artist is depicting a heraldic device, not plants
                        as found in nature. <persName>Breen</persName> reached the same conclusion in 1959: "the <pb n="48"/> plants depicted on the 1793's
                        do not exactly match any known botanical species" ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1968, 210-211). He changed his view in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia,</hi> saying that "the best evidence suggests" "cotton leaves (the trefoils) and laurel, probably bay
                        laurel." He adds about laurel, "It was smoked by priestesses at <placeName>Delphi</placeName> to induce the altered state of
                        consciousness enabling divination and prophecy, though Rittenhouse may not have known this last" ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988,
                        181). <persName>Breen's</persName> suggestion that the reverse of the wreath cent represents a psychotropic drug deserves high
                        marks for its originality. Despite <persName>Breen's</persName> imaginative arguments, however, I think the idea of a heraldic
                        wreath combining two plants, neither of them actually found in nature, is the best explanation. </p>
               <p> As it happens, there is a heraldic use of the strawberry leaf: they are the conventional figures of a leaf on the coronet of a duke,
                        marquis, or earl. This usage is listed in the <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary,</hi> with several citations (earliest 1827).
                        The 1875 citation says, "It was among the strawberry leaves she chiefly expected to find a husband for her daughter - a marquis at
                        least." </p>
               <p> The wreath on the wreath cents is a composite wreath, which combines the laurel, a symbol of glory, with strawberry leaves, a
                        traditional symbol of the high nobility. In short, <persName>David Proskey's</persName> identification of the leaves as a
                        strawberry leaf seems to me to be the correct one, but the wreath is not an accurate horticultural depiction; it is a stylized heraldic
                        representation. </p>

               </head>
               <p> Before I lay out the various theories as to what the strawberry leaf cents are, I want to eliminate three red herrings: the first of
                        these is <persName>David Proskey's</persName> belief that the obverse dies are different; the second is <persName>Walter
                            Breen's</persName> contention that the strawberry leaves on the obverse are punch-linked with those on the reverse of other cents; the
                        third is the argument that the coins must be genuine mint products, because <persName>Crosby</persName> regarded them as such. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Proskey</persName> was the discoverer of the ONE CENT high variety, and he believed that not only were the reverses from
                        different dies, but so were the obverses; and he describes them in <hi rend="italic">The Coin Collector's Journal.</hi> On the ONE CENT
                        low variety the top of the forehead is immediately beneath the center of the R of LIBERTY; <persName>Proskey's</persName> variety
                        5-C. On the ONE CENT high variety the top of the forehead points between the E and the R; <persName>Proskey's</persName> variety
                        6-D ( <persName>Proskey</persName> 1879, 179). When <persName>Francis</persName>
                  <pb n="49"/>
                  <persName>Worcester Doughty</persName> incorporated much of <persName>Proskey's</persName> work into his own book, he took
                        over the distinction between the two obverse varieties ( <persName>Doughty</persName> 1890, 6-7). <persName>Crosby</persName>
                        in 1897 said that he thought the two obverses were from the same die, and everyone has since followed <persName>Crosby</persName> ;
                        this is the difference which <persName>Crosby</persName> refers to when he says, "I must differ ... from Mr. <persName>Doughty</persName> in regard to the Cent originally described as 'the Clover leaf Cent'" ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 1897, 4,
                        19, 21-23). ( <persName>Crosby</persName> mistook what was really <persName>Proskey's</persName> work for <persName>Doughty's</persName> .) <persName>Crosby</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">probably</hi> was right; every time I have looked at the obverses, they seem more or less the same to me, but all the
                        specimens are so worn that I cannot be absolutely certain about this. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Walter Breen</persName> has argued that the strawberry leaf cents are mint products. He has written, "Whatever they may
                        be, they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> counterfeits: letters and trefoils and numerals match those on other cents of the year,
                        evidently from the same punches. The <hi rend="italic">trefoils</hi> on the obv[erse] are the same as on cent reverses." ( <persName>Pollock</persName> 1994, 17). If the strawberry leaves are punch-linked, as <persName>Breen</persName> contends, that
                        would eliminate many possible theories. This theory <persName>Breen</persName> took up from Dr. <persName>Thomas
                            Hall</persName> ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1968, 210). <persName>Hall</persName> wrote in the margin of his copy of <persName>Crosby</persName> on 1793 large cents (given to the ANS library by <persName>George Clapp</persName> ), on the
                        strawberry leaves, <q> In this connection Mr. <persName>Crosby</persName> might have added an interesting observation, with which
                            he was familiar, viz: that the punch used for impressing the leaves beneath the bust was similar, and probably identical, with the
                            punch used for impressing the so-called trefoil leaves upon the wreath cent reverses of '93 ( <persName>Hall</persName> n.d.,
                            21). </q>
               </p>
               <p> I have looked very closely at the wreath cents and I concluded that there are enough differences among the strawberry leaves on the
                        reverses that they must have been cut by hand, and not made by punches. In the 1980s <persName>Breen</persName> developed some very
                        radical theories of device punches, such as a device punch for the chain on the chain cent, a device punch for the head of Liberty on
                        the caps of 1793, and several head punches for the cents of 1794; but he does not revive his theory of device punches being used for the
                        wreath cents, so he may have changed his mind. <persName>Breen's</persName> and Dr. <persName>Hall's</persName> belief that
                        the leaves were applied using a punch is wrong, to my eye; the leaves were cut individually, by hand. </p>
               <p> Now as to the third red herring: <persName>Crosby</persName> did regard the strawberry leaf cents as genuine mint products, but
                            <persName>Crosby</persName> was not infallible. His work on the cents and half cents of 1793 includes a number of alter- <pb n="50"/> ations which we consider rather obvious: the <persName>Crosby</persName> 3-B and the <persName>Edwin</persName>
                        Bishop <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> half cent ( <persName>Crosby</persName> 1897, 17, 33-34;
                            <persName>Kenney</persName> 1952, 2-3). It is odd that <persName>Crosby</persName> should include the 3-B, because as
                            <persName>James Neiswinter</persName> has shown, <persName>Levick</persName> had already concluded it was an alteration.

                     <persName>Breen's</persName> Theory of Device Punches </hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <persName>Walter Breen</persName> has proposed a very radical theory of device punches for large cents, a theory which is as
                        controversial, in its way, as the punch theories which <persName>Willy Schwabacher</persName> proposed for ancient Greek coins.
                        Both 1794 large cents and ancient Greek coins are held to have particular artistic excellence because the dies were handcut by the
                        engravers, and the <persName>Breen</persName> and <persName>Schwabacher</persName> theories challenge this excellence - hence
                        the controversy. <persName>Breen</persName> elaborated his theory at the ANS Coinage of the Americas Conference in 1984 ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1985, 9-29), and discussed it further in his 1988 <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Breen</persName> holds that there was a simple device punch for the chain on the chain cent made by the <placeName>Germantown</placeName> typesetter, <persName>Jacob Bay</persName> , who also made letter punches for the <placeName>Mint</placeName> ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 177). This I do not believe, but it is very difficult to disprove
                        because the chain device is such a simple one. The link just below the 9 o'clock link is large on reverse A, small on reverse C. It is
                        clearly not the same punch if you put the two reverses side by side, but the chain device punch might have rotated between the time it
                        was used on reverse A and when used on reverse C. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Breen</persName> said that the first to create a more elaborate device punch was <persName>Joseph Wright</persName>
                        in his final weeks of life, which is the liberty cap head of 1793 ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 179, 181). This I do not
                        believe either: <persName>Crosby</persName> obverse 12 is notched in at the neck, all later obverses have no such notch. If a
                        device punch had been used, that notch would either be present in all or present in none. <persName>Hays 4</persName> (S-17) has a
                        very pointy chin, although it is possible that the chin is the result of later hand cutting after the device was punched into the die. </p>
               <p> I think there is general agreement that at some point during the large cent series the <placeName>Mint</placeName> began to use
                        device punches for the obverse type of Liberty. This can be most easily seen with the varieties of 1797 cents S-122 (Clapp-Newcomb 4),
                        1797 NC-2 (Clapp-Newcomb 5), 1797 NC-3 (Clapp-Newcomb 28), and S-123 (Clapp-Newcomb 6). All four varieties share the same obverse. In
                        S-123 and the two NC vari- <pb n="51"/> eties there is clearly a cut on the cheek of Liberty below the eye ( <ref target="#fig-16">fig
                            3</ref> ). S-122 is a thornier problem. Clapp and Newcomb say it has the cut on the cheek below the eye; <persName>Sheldon</persName> says it does not. The cut does not appear on the ANS specimen, but the ANS specimen is in low grade (it is listed at
                        F-12 in the Noyes photo book) and shows evidence of tooling to remove porosity from the high spots and the fields. Since the ANS
                        specimen was bought by Clapp at the October 1938 <persName>Stack's</persName> auction, which is now thought to have included coins
                        formerly in <persName>Sheldon's</persName> possession ( <persName>Adams</persName> 1990, 129), this tooling was probably done
                        by <persName>Sheldon</persName> himself. The cut below the eye does appear on the <persName>Schreuder</persName> S-122, VF-20,
                        of which there is a photograph in the Noyes book. The gash would have been created by the teeth marks from a saw damaging a device
                        punch, which would then result in a raised mark or burr in the die. (A lint mark, by contrast, would not appear on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the cents of that variety.) It is possible that there was some lapping of the die to remove the burr after three die
                        marriages, which would make the gash less obvious on S-122, but the omission of the cut from the die description is probably a mistake
                        by <persName>Sheldon</persName> . Marks of a die clash on S-122, 1797 NC-2, and 1797 NC-3, which are lacking from S-123 - an incuse
                        leaf behind the neck of Liberty - indicate that S-123 does precede, not follow, the other three die marriages. </p>

                  <p>3. 1797 cent, variety S-123.</p>
               </figure>
               <p> The order for these four varieties is due to <persName>Clapp</persName> and <persName>Newcomb</persName> ; <persName>Sheldon</persName> took over their descriptions, introduced a mistake by omitting the remark about the cut for S-122, 1797 NC-2, and
                        1797 NC-3, and inserted the late discovery (by <persName>Henry Hines</persName> ) of Clapp-Newcomb 28 right before Clapp-Newcomb 6
                        (Clapp and Newcomb 1947, 48-49, 58). </p>
               <pb n="52"/>
               <p> The gash below the eye on the bust of Liberty, most visible on the fine cents of S-123 variety from the Goodhue-Nichols hoard, is only
                        explicable by the existence of an obverse device punch. By 1797 the <placeName>Mint</placeName> clearly was using a device punch for
                        the bust of Liberty. At the beginning of 1793, even <persName>Breen</persName> would agree that the <placeName>Mint</placeName>
                        was not using a device punch for the head of Liberty. The argument to be resolved is when between that <hi rend="italic">terminus a
                            quo</hi> and that <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi> the device punch was introduced. I do not find <persName>Breen's</persName> device punch arguments wholly convincing, but they were clearly the result of much careful thought, and should be
                        taken seriously. <persName>Breen</persName> did his own theory a disservice with his wild story of his discovery in a dream ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1985, 17); most people remember the dream and dismiss the theory. </p>
               <p> Besides the pure numismatic evidence, there is the complicating factor of what we know from the documents. In his report delivered to
                        Congress on February 9, 1795, <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName> described the duties of the engraver of the <placeName>Mint</placeName> as follows: <q> The Engraver, whose actual duties are the raising and furnishing all punches that are requisite for the
                            completion of the dies, the engraving and sinking all original dies, and raising all <hi rend="italic">hubbs</hi> [sic; emphasis
                            added] that are struck out of them ( <hi rend="italic">Am. St. P.:Fin.</hi> 1:352). </q>
               </p>
               <p> In a letter to Congress on December 3, 1795, <persName>Boudinot</persName> said, <q> The stealing of the dies, <hi rend="italic">hubbs,</hi> [sic; emphasis added] milling-stamps, screws, presses, or other instruments used in the coinage, as well as the
                            taking, receiving, adulterating, or secreting, the metals kept in, or belonging to, the mint, call for special provision from the
                            Legislature of the <placeName>United States</placeName>
                     <hi rend="italic">(Am. St. P.: Fin.</hi> 1:358). </q>
               </p>
               <p> By 1795 <persName>Boudinot</persName> considered the creation of hubs was one of the functions of the <placeName>mint</placeName> . This does not mean that the mint had yet succeeded in making lasting design hubs, particularly in light of their
                        problems with the quality of the iron; it means that the <placeName>mint</placeName> regarded the making of hubs one of their
                        functions. It now seems to me that the adoption of the "Heads of 1795" may have been the date on which the <placeName>Mint</placeName> began to use a hub for the head of Liberty. At any rate we can no longer say, "The dies were all cut by hand," as
                        casually as people said in the past. </p>
               <p> An interesting aspect of this question is that as early as 1786 there was a mint in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729890">North
                            America</placeName> with a sophisticated device punch and hubbing operation: this was the Company for Coining Coppers at <pb n="53"/>
                  <placeName>Water Street in New Haven</placeName> . <persName>Philip Mossman</persName> says that the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Mailed Bust Right issues of 1785 were made with a device punch; the Draped Bust Left issues which followed in
                        1786 were made by a hubbing technique, which, as <persName>Mossman</persName> points out, was 50 years ahead of its time. The
                        device punches were made by <persName>Abel Buell</persName> , "an uncommonly ingenious mechanic." ( <persName>Breen</persName>
                        1976, 118-122; <persName>Mossman</persName> 1993, 168). Yet the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> mint had to re-invent the
                        wheel. Although there was some overlap between the manufacturers of Confederation coppers and the early Federal Mint, the personnel
                        overlap is almost entirely with makers of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers ( <persName>Albion Cox</persName> , <persName>John Harper</persName> ; <persName>R. W. Julian</persName> also suggests above that one
                        equipment supplier of the <placeName>Philadelphia mint</placeName> , <persName>Hannah Ogden</persName> , was the widow or
                        daughter of <persName>Mathias Ogden</persName> ), and not with the more sophisticated <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coiners
                        ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 78, 187). The <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> coppers, by
                        contrast with the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coppers, were not made with device punches. </p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Sheldon</persName> has written that <persName>James G. Macallister</persName> , a coin dealer of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , held that the strawberry leaf cents were contemporary counterfeits. <persName>Sheldon</persName> writes:
                            <q> In 1944, <persName>J. G. Macallister</persName> expressed himself as "highly sceptical" about the strawberry leaf coins,
                            but thought it would be a fine idea to get all of them together and examine them at one time. He seemed to feel that they might be
                            counterfeit since too little of any one of them can be seen for us to be quite certain that they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                            counterfeit ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1949, 62-63). </q>
               </p>
               <p> This could be useful information, since <persName>Macallister</persName> was regarded by <persName>George Clapp</persName> and
                        others as one of the most advanced students of large cents of his day; but <persName>Sheldon</persName> is an extremely unreliable
                        source. Since it is not generally appreciated how careless <persName>Sheldon</persName> was with facts, I think it is not out of
                        place to demonstrate it with some simple exercizes. </p>
               <p> In 1975, <persName>Warren Lapp</persName> and <persName>Herbert Silberman</persName> edited an excellent anthology of articles
                        from the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> about large cents. The appendix to this anthology includes biographies of old-time
                        collectors and dealers, heavily based on the recollections of <persName>Sheldon</persName> and <persName>Breen</persName> .
                        The information in <persName>Sheldon's</persName> own profile surely derives from <persName>Sheldon</persName> himself. It
                        reads: <q> Dr. <persName>Sheldon</persName> , himself, likes to use the <persName>Hays, Doughty</persName> , or Chapman
                            numbers - the numbers he used when learning. Hays, <pb n="54"/> in turn, for whom Dr. <persName>Sheldon</persName> once worked,
                            insisted on using the Maris numbers ( <persName>Lapp</persName> and <persName>Silberman</persName> , 1975, 597). </q>
               </p>
               <p> It would be a remarkable achievement indeed for <persName>Sheldon</persName> to have worked for <persName>Hays</persName> ,
                        because <persName>William Wallace Hays</persName> , the cataloguer of 1794 large cents, died on July 9, 1899 ( <persName>Obituary</persName> 1899, 29). <persName>Sheldon</persName> was born on November 19, 1898 <hi rend="italic">(Who Was Who</hi>
                        1981, 7:519). </p>
               <p> On February 20, 1971, <persName>Sheldon</persName> delivered a talk to the <placeName>New York Numismatic Club</placeName> which
                        later appeared as an article in <hi rend="italic">Penny Wise</hi> and which contained much discussion of <persName>Carl
                            Würtzbach</persName> and <persName>Virgil Brand</persName> ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1971). <persName>Sheldon</persName> took some care over this article; the copy of <hi rend="italic">Penny Wise</hi> in the ANS library, which was
                        formerly <persName>Sheldon's</persName> copy, contains two handwritten corrections by <persName>Sheldon</persName> : on page
                        74 <persName>Sheldon</persName> crosses out the final "s" in "thoughts" and on page 75 he crosses out "Chapman" in the third line
                        of the fifth paragraph and writes in "C.W." for <persName>Carl Würtzbach</persName> above it. Yet this article is filled with
                        misstatements of fact. We can check many of his statements by comparing them with <persName>Q. David Bowers's</persName> biography
                        of <persName>Virgil Brand</persName> . </p>
               <q>
                  <persName>Sheldon</persName> : "For two decades, <persName>Clapp, Newcomb</persName> , and <persName>Hines</persName>
                        were generally referred to as the 'Big Three of the Big Cents'." ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1971, 74) </q>
               <q> It is most improbable that this expression began to be used as early as 1925, as <persName>Sheldon</persName> suggests. The "Big
                        Three" proper refers to the wartime alliance of <persName>Churchill, Roosevelt</persName> , and <persName>Stalin</persName> .
                        It is more likely to be a phrase of the mid-forties than of the midtwenties. </q>

                  <persName>Sheldon</persName> : " <persName>Carl Würtzbach</persName> and <persName>Virgil Brand</persName> were small

               <q>
                  <persName>Bowers</persName> says that <persName>Michael Brand</persName> , the father of Virgil, emigrated from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName> around the time of the Revolution of 1848. The family lived in <placeName>Michigan, Illinois</placeName> , and <placeName>Missouri</placeName> , but never in <placeName>Wisconsin</placeName> .
                            <persName>Virgil Michael Brand</persName> was born in <placeName>Blue Island, Illinois</placeName> , on January 16, in 1862
                        or 1861. There is no evidence that <persName>Virgil Brand</persName> ever visited <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName> . ( <persName>Bowers</persName> 1983, 27, and <hi rend="italic">passim)</hi>

                  <persName>Sheldon</persName> : "Half a century later, <persName>Brand</persName> had brewed a small ocean of the 'beer that

               <q> The "beer that made Milwaukee famous" is Schlitz. The vari- <pb n="55"/> ous breweries owned by the <persName>Brand</persName>

               <q>
                  <persName>Sheldon</persName> : "Meanwhile, in the late 1890's, these two cousins had remained very close friends, and <persName>Virgil Brand</persName> had turned over about a million dollars to <persName>Carl Würtzbach</persName> with which to
                        purchase for <persName>Virgil Brand's</persName> estate, as many as possible of the top flight early <placeName>U.S.</placeName>
                        Copper cents (and a few other coins) that might become available." ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1971, 75) </q>
               <q> Bowers does not mention this million dollar transaction at all; it probably never occurred. <persName>Brand</persName> did buy
                            <persName>Würtzbach's</persName> cent collection from him in 1911, but the cost was not a million dollars. <persName>Bowers</persName> also does not suggest that <persName>Brand</persName> and <persName>Würtzbach</persName> were cousins. It
                        is unlikely that they were. <persName>Würtzbach</persName> seems to have been born in <placeName> Harzgerode, in the Harz
                            mountains of Central Germany </placeName> now in Saxony-Anhalt ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1947, 779); <persName>Brand's</persName> mother came from <placeName>Framersheim</placeName> , <persName>Brand's</persName> father from <placeName>Oldenheim</placeName> , two towns in the <placeName>Rhenish Palatinate near Mainz</placeName> which are about ten miles
                        from each other. They first met in <placeName>Detroit</placeName> , possibly through a German-American regional self-help group, a
                            <hi rend="italic">Landschaft.</hi> Since the <persName>Brand</persName> family tended to marry into other local families, it is
                        improbable that <persName>Brand</persName> would have a cousin who had been born in a town hundreds of miles distant from the <placeName>Palatinate</placeName> ( <persName>Bowers</persName> 1983). </q>
               <p> Unfortunately, I cannot say for certain where <persName>Carl Würtzbach</persName> was born because my only source for that is an
                        obituary of <persName>Würtzbach</persName> written by <persName>Sheldon</persName> ( <persName>Sheldon</persName> 1947,
                        779). He may have been born in <placeName>Harzgerode</placeName> - or he may have not. </p>
               <p> In short, <persName>Macallister</persName> may have said in 1944 that he thought the strawberry leaf cents were counterfeit - or he
                        may have not. I am more than happy to believe that he did, but we cannot be certain. </p>

               </head>
               <p> I shall now lay out the various possible theories as to what the strawberry leaf is. </p>
               <list>
                  <item rend="hang"> 1) A pattern. <persName>Sheldon</persName> held this to be so, and <persName>Sheldon</persName> says that
                            Dr. <persName>Hall</persName> and <persName>Samuel Hudson Chapman</persName> did so too. (The reader must remember the
                            usual <hi rend="italic">caveats</hi> about anything for which we only have <persName>Sheldon's</persName> say-so.) <persName>Breen</persName> originally thought the strawberry <pb n="56"/> leaf cents were patterns; he wrote to <persName>Richard Rosichan</persName> around October 1954: </item>
                  <item rend="hang">
                     <persName>Sheldon</persName> is inclined to think them patterns, as did Dr. <persName>Hall</persName> and others. I agree
                            with this and expect to have them included in the book on pattern and experimental pieces of the <placeName>U.S. Mint</placeName>
                            which Dr. <persName>Judd</persName> and I am co-authoring (expected to go to press about March 1955). (Money Tree 1995, lot
                            367) </item>
               </list>
               <p> But by 1959 <persName>Breen</persName> had changed his opinion. He repeats <persName>Sheldon's</persName> view that the coins
                        are patterns but describes it as "a view with which I cannot agree" ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1968, 212). Unfortunately, <persName>Breen</persName> does not specifically state in his 1959 article exactly what he thinks the strawberry leaf cents are,
                        although in the 1959 article and in his 1957 columns in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> he appears to be leaning toward regarding
                        them as a regular mint products. By 1991 it seems clear that he did regard them as regular mint products ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1991, 37). Interestingly, despite what <persName>Breen</persName> wrote in his letter to <persName>Rosichan</persName> , the strawberry leaf cents never were listed in <persName>Judd's</persName> books on patterns, although they
                        are listed in the more recent reference work by <persName>Andrew Pollock</persName> . By contrast, another great rarity of the
                        large cent series, the reeded edge 1795 cent, S-79, has always been listed in the <persName>Judd</persName> books as a pattern:
                        Judd-20. </p>
               <list>
                  <item rend="hang"> 2) A normal cent, struck for circulation during a year when the <placeName>Mint</placeName> made many dramatic
                            experiments in coin design. This was <persName>Crosby's</persName> view; it also seems as though this was <persName>Breen's</persName> new opinion by 1957-1959. It almost certainly was <persName>Breen's</persName> opinion by 1991 ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1991, 37). </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 3) A struck fake of the mid-nineteenth century, made during a period when many imaginative fakes were created, such
                            as <persName>Edwin</persName> Bishop's <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> half cent and the Good
                            Samaritan shilling. </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 4) A genuine worn 1793 wreath cent, which has been tooled to create the strawberry leaves. </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 5) A counterfeit of the time. <persName>Sheldon</persName> says that <persName>James G.
                                Macallister</persName> , a coin dealer of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , held this belief. </item>
               </list>
               <p> Theory (4), a genuine worn 1793 wreath cent which has been tooled by someone like <placeName>Smith of Ann Street</placeName> , is a
                        very attractive theory, and if only one example existed, we would give it serious consideration; but it is contradicted by the discovery
                        of the three ONE CENT high specimens. The die link and the die duplicates indicate that the strawberry leaf cents were struck from dies,
                        not made by tooling genuine coins. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Smith's</persName> style is very different from the strawberry leaf cent. <persName> William <pb n="57"/> D.
                            Smith </persName> , an engraver of <placeName>Ann Street</placeName> , who has been the subject of much recent research ( <persName>Smith</persName> 1992a-c; <persName>Kleeberg</persName> and <persName>Trudgen</persName> 1995), produced works of
                        art ( <ref target="#fig-17">fig 4</ref> ). The strawberry leaf cent, by contrast, has a very unprepossessing appearance; an unkind
                        critic might even call it ugly. But what clinches the argument against the strawberry leaf cent being a product of <placeName>Smith of Ann Street</placeName> is the weight. The ANS has an excellent collection of cents tooled by <persName>Smith</persName> ,
                        no fewer than ten. Contrast the weights of these coins with the weights of the three strawberry leaf cents which we were able to weigh;
                        the weights are in grams: </p>

                  <p> 4. Cent tooled by <placeName>Smith of Ann Street</placeName> . </p>
               </figure>
               <p> Note that even the lightest of the strawberry leaf cents, the Saltus-ANS specimen, which has a big lump missing from its reverse, weighs
                        more than even the heaviest cent tooled by <persName>Smith</persName> of <placeName>Ann Street</placeName> . A study of the
                        weights indicates it is very unlikely that the strawberry leaf cents could have been made by <persName>Smith</persName> of <placeName>Ann Street</placeName> . </p>
               <p> There were engravers of altered coins at the time - other than <persName>Smith</persName> - who might have produced a cruder
                        product. The cataloguer of the <pb n="58"/> 1860s, <persName>William Woodward</persName> , mentions the name of <persName>Breschemin</persName> of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> ( <persName>Smith</persName> 1992c, 417). But I believe that the
                        weight, the die link, and the general appearance of the strawberry leaf cent means that it is not a tooled product by <persName>Smith, Breschemin</persName> , or their colleagues. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Eric P. Newman</persName> and I have discussed the strawberry leaf cents extensively: he is a partisan of theory (3),
                        just as I am a partisan of theory (5). He argues: <q> Accepting the finding that the edge decoration on each strawberry leaf cent
                            differs from the edge decoration of the other strawberry leaf cents and that the edge decoration was cut into each such coin
                            manually and not by Castaing methods, I believe the production of strawberry leaf cents are forgeries for collectors and not
                            counterfeits for circulation. For a counterfeiter to go to the trouble of making one obverse die and two reverse dies and then put
                            the edge decoration on each piece separately by hand either before or after striking is not practical or profitable. He would never
                            have made enough money to have the project be worthwhile. He would have left off the edge decoration or selected a cent type which
                            had no edge decoration. The application of an edge decoration in my opinion was to deceive further. Thus the strawberry leaf cents
                            would probably have been made in the latter part of the fifty year period after 1793. ( <persName>Newman</persName> 1997) </q>
               </p>
               <p> We have had many friendly conversations about this, but neither has been able to convince the other of his position. Theory (3), a fake
                        of the mid-nineteenth century, is to my mind contradicted by the pedigree history. The first example was discovered probably in 1845,
                        and certainly by 1868; the second in 1877; the third also in 1877; and the fourth in 1941. If the cents were fakes, they would have
                        emerged onto the market around the same time. The coins also do not have the feel of nineteenth century fakes. Nineteenth century fakes
                        tend to be more attractive, with flashy high relief, like <persName>Edwin</persName> Bishop's <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> half cent, or struck in a flashy metal, like gold. </p>
               <p> This leaves us with possibilities 1, 2, and 5: a pattern, a normal cent, or a counterfeit of the time. </p>
               <p> I looked very closely at the letters on the reverse of the three specimens I could examine, and I concluded that they were hand cut, not
                        made with punches ( <ref target="#fig-18">figs. 5</ref> , <ref target="#fig-19">6</ref> , and <ref target="#fig-20">7</ref> ). On the
                        5-E, the N in ONE is small, and does not have much of a base to its left foot; the N in CENT is bigger, and has a big base to its left
                        foot. The lower serif of the first S in STATES is lined up; the lower serif of the second S in STATES extends further to the left than
                        the top part of the letter. </p>

               <pb n="60"/>
               <p> The E in CENT is very crowded, and the top part touches the middle bar; the E in ONE is less crowded, and the top part does not touch
                        the middle bar; the E in STATES is rather loose. There are also distinct differences between the lettering on the ONE CENT low and on
                        the ONE CENT high varieties. The top of the T on the ONE CENT high is crowded, the top of the T on ONE CENT low is broad. The lettering
                        is also smaller on the reverse of the ONE CENT high than on the reverse of the ONE CENT low. </p>
               <p> There are so many differences among the letters that I think that they were not done with punches, but hand cut. Since the letters are
                        hand cut, the piece is not a product of the <placeName>United States Mint</placeName> . Furthermore, I do not think it is a private
                        pattern, because manufacturers of private patterns - like <persName>John Harper</persName> , the manufacturer of the <persName>Jefferson</persName> head cents - had letter punches too, albeit different ones. </p>
               <p> There are other important differences. <persName>David Proskey</persName> noted that the base of the head on all wreath cents ends
                        in a point but the base of the head on the strawberry leaves is broader and rounder than other varieties ( <persName>Proskey</persName> 1879, 169). The number of strawberry leaves on the reverse also varies. In the wreath cents, reverse F has six
                        strawberry leaves; reverse G has five; and with H, I, and J the number stabilizes at four. On the strawberry leaf cents, the ONE CENT
                        low reverse has four strawberry leaves, the ONE CENT high reverse also has four, but one of the leaves on the lower left is so tiny as
                        to be nearly a "ghost leaf." <persName>Francis Worcester Doughty</persName> could not see this leaf - nor could I, until I saw the
                        reverse enlarged many times in a color slide projected on a screen. <persName>Doughty</persName> wrote, "As it is possible to
                        distinguish but one on the left, however, we have preferred to so state it, subject to correction should a perfect specimen ever appear"
                        ( <persName>Doughty</persName> 1890, 6). </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Del Bland</persName> suggested that one way to solve the problem might be to compare the edge with a genuine wreath cent.
                        I have compared the edges of the chain cents and the wreath cents in the ANS collection with each other and with the edges of three
                        strawberry leaf cents. The vine and bars device on the chain cents and on the wreath cents are different. Apparently a new edge die was
                        developed when the mint changed from making chain cents to making wreath cents. But when the edges of the chain cents are compared to
                        other chain cents, and when the edges of the wreath cents are compared to other wreath cents, after a bit of adjusting to make sure that
                        the edges are going in the right direction and making allowance for die slippage (which occurs on all <pb n="61"/> examples), the
                        similarity between identical edges is marked. I have noticed no such similarity between the edge devices on the wreath and chain cents
                        on the one hand and on the strawberry leaf cents on the other. Nor have I remarked any similarity among the edge devices among the
                        strawberry leaf cents themselves. The edge on the cents is well done, but I do not believe they were done with a Castaing machine. I
                        think the edge was added by hand. </p>
               <p> The diameter varies on the four specimens known, as opposed to the carefully controlled diameters of the wreath cents; <persName>Breen</persName> has noted this, as did <persName>Levick</persName> before him. The weight, however, is good. I have
                        had the opportunity to weigh three of the strawberry leaf cents; the ANS scale weighs to the nearest milligram. My weights tally almost
                        exactly with other weights, such as those published in the Starr catalogue. The unique piece weighs 200.6 grains (13.000 grams; Starr
                        catalogue 200.68 grains). The Saltus-ANS specimen is light, 193.9 grains (12.566 grams), but it has a big gash on its reverse. The
                        Rabin-Starr piece weighs 207.4 grains (13.442 grams; Starr catalogue: 207.44 grains). </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Levick</persName> and <persName>Crosby</persName> had much difficulty deciding exactly where in the series the
                        strawberry leaf cent should go. The R in LIBERTY is slightly bigger than the rest of the word, which suggests that the immediate model
                        was <persName>Crosby's</persName> obverse 7. The way the bottom lock of hair falls straight down also suggests obverses 6 and 7. On
                        the other hand, in the middle of the hair a lock flies straight out, which resembles obverses 9 and 10. The heart-shaped bow on the
                        reverse resembles reverses G and I; the ONE CENT high reverse resembles reverse F, while the ONE CENT low reverse resembles reverse H.
                        The strawberry leaf cents, in other words, are very difficult to place in the series, because they combine elements of nearly all the
                        wreath cents. Whatever it was our counterfeiter copied, he must have copied more than one specific die variety when he was making his
                        dies, and combined disparate elements into one die. </p>
               <p> This is very characteristic of counterfeits. Counterfeiting is a clandestine operation, and counterfeiters work under great pressure and
                        are often short of money. Our counterfeiter may have begun to prepare his dies one night, and then spent the wreath cent which was his
                        model the next day, and waited until he received another in change; but it turned out to be a different die variety, so he kept on
                        adding more and more diverse elements into his die. Counterfeit 2 reales, particularly fine products from the counterfeiting mills of
                        the early Republic, often have <pb n="62"/> bizarre combinations: one common variety is a 2 reales of 1801, but with the assayers'
                        initials TH, which on genuine pieces only occurs on 2 reales of 1804 and later ( <ref target="#fig-21">fig. 8</ref> ). </p>

               </head>
               <p> Counterfeit large cents are unusual; most counterfeiters in the early Republic found more profitable outlets for their talents. 2 reales
                        were a favorite; they also made many counterfeit half dollars ( <ref target="#fig-22">fig. 9</ref> ); and if they went for the high
                        profits of gold, they could counterfeit Brazilian joes ( <ref target="#fig-23">fig. 10</ref> ). </p>

               </figure>
               <p> By the 1840s, it was profitable to make counterfeit large cents. There was a strong demand: because of a shortage of small silver,
                        people used cents instead. The copper price was low enough to permit a profit. <persName>R. W. Julian</persName> has published
                        documents which show that these <pb n="63"/> cents were made in <placeName>New York City</placeName> . In November 1849 a little girl
                        called at a grocery in the <placeName>Bowery</placeName> and paid in eighteen bright new cents of 1849. She was asked where she got
                        so many new cents, and she replied, <q>"I got them out of the keg."</q>
                  <q>"Well, where did the keg come from?"</q>
                  <q>"Oh, why we make them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Julian</persName> points out that this operation appears to have started business in 1848, which makes it most probable
                        that one of the coins made by these counterfeiters was the 1848 small date large cent ( <persName>Julian</persName> 1972, 530). </p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Levick</persName> , who is so often the pioneer in the study of large cents, once again takes first place. The earliest
                        record known of the 1848 small date cent is the sale of his collection of in May 1865, lot 1431, where it was described as "1848
                        Peculiar type, small stars and date, fair condition" ( <persName>Cogan</persName> 1865, lot 1431). When <persName>Newcomb</persName> wrote, only four examples were known, and it was very eagerly sought after: <persName>Clapp</persName> , in
                        1939, paid more for his example of this cent ($25) than for any other 1848 cent ( <ref target="#fig-24">fig. 11</ref> ). The next two
                        most expensive 1848 cents in Clapp's collection were a <persName>Newcomb</persName> 18 with a spectacular die break straight across
                        the obverse, for which he paid <persName>Elmer S.</persName> ("Fall River") Sears $10 in October 1924, and a <persName>Newcomb</persName> 14 for which he paid W. F. ("Billy") Sunday $3.50 in July 1932. Yet <persName>Newcomb</persName> called it a
                        "counterfeit of the times." It is good to see that the counterfeiter's art is so highly appreciated. A glance in <hi rend="italic">
                            Copper Quotes by <persName>Robinson</persName>
                  </hi> shows that this is even more the case today: there is only one 1848 genuine variety ( <persName>Newcomb</persName> 46) whose
                        value even approaches that of the counterfeit 1848 small date <pb n="64"/> ( <persName>Robinson</persName> 1996, 100). The
                        counterfeiters, wherever they are, must be highly amused. <persName>Robinson</persName> says that ten are known today. A remarkable
                        example which was quadruple struck and damaged by a planchet cutter was sold at auction in March 1996 ( <persName>Bowers</persName>
                        1996, lot 651). </p>

               </figure>
               <p> The pedigree of <persName>Clapp's</persName> small date cent is slightly mixed up. <persName>Clapp</persName> wrote on the
                        box, "Found in an old collection in <placeName>Wisconsin</placeName> owned by a Dr. <persName>Chapman</persName> , not
                        recognized by him. <persName>J. G. Macallister</persName> 10/12/39." </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Newcomb</persName> , however, wrote, <q> The third specimen was found in the fall of 1939. It is from the small dies as
                            the three others, is well struck on a perfect planchet giving an even border; the reverse is "upset." This piece has seen more
                            circulation than the others. </q>
                  <q> For about forty years this specimen had lain in the collection of Dr. <persName>W. Earle Chapman</persName> of <placeName>Cheyboygan [sic] Michigan</placeName> , but was found by <persName>James G. Macallister</persName> of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in this collection then owned by a gentleman of <placeName>Columbus, Ohio</placeName> . It
                            is now owned by Mr. <persName>George H. Clapp</persName> of <placeName>Sewickley, Pa</placeName> .- 1940 ( <persName>Newcomb</persName> 1981, 204). </q>

                  <persName>Clapp's</persName> error of " <placeName>Wisconsin</placeName> " when the correct reference is " <placeName>Michigan</placeName> " is easily understood because there is a well known <placeName>Sheboygan in Wisconsin</placeName> , and a less
                        well known <placeName>Cheboygan in Michigan</placeName> . When learning of the pedigree from <persName>Macallister</persName> ,
                            <persName>Clapp</persName> immediately thought of the better-known <placeName>Sheboygan, Wisconsin</placeName> , not
                        realizing that <placeName>Cheboygan, Michigan</placeName> actually was meant. </p>
               <p> Another place which counterfeited large cents was <placeName>Attleboro, Massachusetts</placeName> , where many hard times tokens were
                        manufactured, as well as the cents for the <placeName>Kingdom of Hawaii</placeName> . An article in the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Native American</hi> of July 1, 1844, said that they could be <pb n="65"/> had for sixty cents for a hundred; that
                        they could be easily distinguished by comparison, and that a great many were in circulation (Counterfeits 1941). </p>
               <p> Another counterfeit large cent is the 1818 cent with fourteen stars ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 203; <persName>Hodder</persName> 1994). It is even rarer than the other famous counterfeits, the strawberry leaf and the 1848 small date: only two
                        specimens are known, one sold in the <persName>Edward Maris</persName> sale in 1886 and now in the Mike Ringo collection, and
                        another which was found in a junk box in 1988 and exhibited at the Seattle ANA convention in 1990. I was in <persName>Del
                            Bland's</persName> study in August 1990 when he and <persName>Walter Breen</persName> discussed this coin, and I remember them
                        pulling <persName>Del's</persName> copy of the <persName>Maris</persName> auction with plates off the shelves to look up the
                        reference. The auction catalogue says, <q> 1818 with <hi rend="italic">fourteen stars.</hi> On the reverse, <hi rend="italic">the wreath
                                is endless.</hi> Well preserved, and, I believe, <hi rend="italic">unique.</hi> Its history, like that of the <persName>Jefferson</persName> head, is involved in mystery. May have been a counterfeit of the day ( <persName>Henkels</persName> 1886,
                            lot 284). </q>
               </p>
               <p> In June 1994 the coin was consigned to <persName>Stack's</persName> for auction, but was bought back by the consignor ( <persName>Stack's</persName> 1994, lot 257). The date of its issue is disputed; <persName>Hodder</persName> says the absence of
                        a close collar and obvious signs of die chatter suggests a period before 1835, but this would require us to assume that counterfeiters
                        had access to the same improvements in machinery as the <placeName>United States Mint</placeName> . The likeliest date of issue would
                        be in the "Hard Times" of the 1830s and 1840s, like the other counterfeits known. </p>

               </figure>
               <p> The ANS has in its collection a peculiar cast counterfeit in brass of an 1854 large cent ( <ref target="#fig-25">fig. 12</ref> ). But
                        counterfeit large cents remain rare <pb n="66"/> birds, not because everybody turned honest on January 1, 1793, but because there were
                        easier things to counterfeit. If I were counterfeiting small change coppers during the early Republic, I would make <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> or <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> coppers or <placeName>British</placeName>
                        or <placeName>Irish halfpence</placeName> , which continued to circulate until 1857, and not large cents. The cast counterfeits of
                        state coppers indicate that other people had the same idea ( <ref target="#fig-26">fig. 13</ref> ). </p>

               <p> If the strawberry leaf cents are contemporary counterfeits of the 1790s, as I believe they are, they could not have circulated long. I
                        thought that they might have been made in 1794 or 1795, because that would allow the genuine cents time to wear down to a similar low
                        grade as the strawberry leaf cents. But this apparently is not so. The issuance of reproductions made by the same methods as used in
                        1793 by <persName>Ron Landis</persName> of the <placeName>Gallery Mint Museum</placeName> allows us to test the rate of wear.
                            <persName>John Wright</persName> has carried a chain cent in his pocket since <persName>Ron Landis</persName> issued it,
                        and in two years it has worn down from MS-70 to only VF-20. Even if they were made in 1795, the strawberry leaf cents would be in much
                        lower grade than the other wreath cents circulating at the time. I believe that the strawberry leaf cents were made substantially
                        preworn, with little regard for the grade of the other coins in circulation. The wear on the strawberry leaf cents is largely
                        artificial, just as the wear on many Confederation coppers is artificial. </p>
               <p> The strawberry leaf cents could not have been produced too long after December 27, 1795, when the weight of the large cent was reduced (
                            <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 186-187), because they are struck to the older, heavier standard. A counterfeiter will not put
                        more metal in a coin than he has to. Furthermore, the strawberry cents would have found it diffi- <pb n="67"/> cult to circulate once
                        there was an abundant supply of coins struck to the lighter standard. Gresham's law appears to have operated on the copper coins as
                        well; not as strongly as it acts upon the precious metals, but still to a limited extent. Most North American counterstamps appear to
                        have been applied in the 1850s. <persName>Q. David Bowers</persName> did an analysis of 3,348 counterstamped large cents in 1990.
                        These figures gives us some idea of what dates of large cents were circulating in the 1850s. Of cents minted 1793-1794, 1796-1814 (I
                        omitted 1795 from my calculations because cents of that year can be struck to either standard), 2.76% of <persName>Bowers'</persName> sample bore the dates 1793-1794, 97% bore the dates 1796-1814. The total mintage figures break down to 4.9%
                        1793-1794, 95.3% 1796-1814 - in other words, fewer counterstamped 1793-1794 large cents are known than we would expect, given the
                        mintage figures. This indicates that people may have been picking out the old, heavy cents from circulation and either hoarding them or
                        melting them down to patch teakettles or strike <placeName>Bungtown halfpence</placeName> . </p>
               <p> Another indication of the disappearance of the heavy weight cents from circulation is provided by the counterstamp of <persName>Devins</persName> &amp; <persName>Bolton</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName> , which was
                        applied in the period 1863-1870. This is the commonest North American counterstamp. <persName>Gregory Brunk</persName> lists 245
                        large cents which bear this counterstamp. Yet the earliest date of a large cent undertype is 1796 ( <persName>Brunk</persName>
                        1987, 61-63). Not a single <persName>Devins</persName> and <persName>Bolton</persName> counterstamp is known on a cent struck
                        to the old, heavy standard. This suggests that Gresham's law was at work in copper as well. </p>
               <p> The strawberry leaf cents, in short, could have been made any time between April 4, 1793 and the end of 1795. </p>
               <p> The strawberry leaf cents have been described as a pattern which for some reason was not seen fit for general production. In a way they
                        are, but not a pattern of the <placeName>US Mint</placeName> - rather, they are a test run for a counterfeiting operation. In the
                        1780s there were extensive operations producing and distributing counterfeit coppers in all the <placeName>northern
                            states</placeName> , and naturally some people would try their hands at counterfeiting the new cents. But the new Federal cents were
                        expensive to counterfeit: they required much copper, and one had to apply a decorated edge. <placeName>The Mint</placeName> feared
                        counterfeits greatly: the use of decorated and lettered edges on Federal coins and also on the Conder tokens of the period is the sign
                        of mints who fear extensive counterfeiting. In 1795 the Mint still feared counterfeiters enough that it experimented with putting cents
                        through the edge machinery used for the silver and gold coins (resulting in the variety of 1795 cent, S-79), but it decided that
                        counterfeits were no <pb n="68"/> longer a threat, and switched to a plain edge cent. <placeName>The Mint</placeName> was right: by
                        1795 the price of copper had risen enough so that it was no longer profitable to counterfeit cents. Only in the 1840s would the copper
                        price drop again, allowing counterfeiters to produce the 1818 endless wreath cent, the 1848 small date cent, and similar delicacies. </p>
               <p> Counterfeits of cents never were a threat, the way they had been with the state coppers. The strawberry leaf cents are a monument to the
                        failure of the counterfeiters. Yankee native ingenuity could produce a superb counterfeit cent - the strawberry leaf cents are excellent
                        pieces of work - but it also knew that there were easier and more profitable coins to counterfeit - 2 reales, half dollars, Brazilian
                        joes, or the always popular <placeName>Bungtown halfpence</placeName> . So it concentrated on those. </p>

               <p> This coin may have been the strawberry leaf cent which was reported to have been discovered among banks' holdings re-examined during the
                        1933 bank holiday. The early pedigree of this coin was worked out on that assumption. </p>

               <p> I would like to thank <persName>Del N. Bland</persName> , <persName>R. W. Julian</persName> , <persName>Margaret K.
                            Kelly</persName> , <persName>Denis W. Loring</persName> , <persName>Eric P. Newman</persName> and <persName>William
                            C. Noyes</persName> for their assistance and suggestions. My sister, <persName>Margaret Kelly</persName> , tried to identify the
                        plants depicted on the large cents. <persName>Daniel W. Holmes</persName> , jr., and <persName>Anthony</persName>
                  <pb n="71"/>
                  <persName>J. Terranova</persName> enabled me to have the unique 5-D and the <persName>Rabin</persName> 5-E for extensive study
                        and photography. <persName>Daniel Holmes</persName> and <persName>Del Bland</persName> also examined the pedigrees and made
                        many helpful additions and corrections. In compiling the pedigrees, I also used <persName>Anthony Terranova's</persName> notes kept
                        with <persName>Holmes'</persName> strawberry leaf cents. Finally, just as this book was being readied for the press, <persName>Mike Ringo</persName> showed me color photographs of an 1818 endless wreath counterfeit which he had just bought - which
                        turned out to be the Dr. <persName>Edward Maris</persName> specimen. </p>

            <pb n="80"/>
            <p> Webster's Dictionary defines the word "hiatus" as "an opening, a gap, a break with a part missing." Each of the ten coin denominations
                    originally authorized by the <placeName>United States</placeName> Coinage Act of 1792 has at least one hiatus in its run of years. Most
                    have several. </p>
            <p> Of those ten denominations, from half cent through eagle, only five are still made. And of those, only the cent - the first federally struck
                    coin for circulation - is represented by coins dated every year but one. The hiatus is 1815. </p>
            <p> Why are there no 1815 <placeName>United States</placeName> cents? Did the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> mint make anything else that
                    year? And what else of import was going on here and abroad during the only hiatus in the 204 year run of <placeName>U.S.</placeName>
                    cents? </p>
            <p> For the first question we need reminding that things are not always what they seem. For example, mint records show no cents struck in 1823,
                    but at least a few thousand pieces bear that date. Those coins are definitely of contemporary manufacture with cents dated 1820 to 1825.
                    Opinions vary between inaccurate or missing records and 1823-dated dies used in 1824. Both positions are credible, but I find the latter to
                    be more so. </p>
            <p> There are several proven instances where the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> mint used dies in years other than their dating. Examples
                    include 1798-dated cents (S-166) using a broken reverse die that appears unbroken on 1799-dated cents, cents dated 1796 (S-119) struck on
                    Boulton planchets that were not here until November of 1797, and an 1831 cent (N-2) that shares a reverse die with cents of 1835 and was
                    struck AFTER the 1835s. </p>
            <p> Other recorded coinage gaps include shutdowns of several months in the 1790s during the yellow fever season and switches to different
                    denominations. Since the mint was responsible for striking up to ten denominations on only three to six presses, something had to give way -
                    not once, but regularly. But these interruptions in cent coinage never extended to a year or more. </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Bob Julian's</persName> excellent detective work published in the January 1995 issue of the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> showed that there were indeed cents struck and delivered late in 1815. But these were from newly prepared dies dated
                    1816. Darn!! I would really love to have one with the gap date, because that was one of the most significant dates in world history for at
                    least a decade before or after. </p>
            <p> To get an 1815 date on a <placeName>United States</placeName> coin, the collector will have to settle for a quarter dollar (89,235)
                    struck), a half dollar (47,150 struck), or a half eagle (635 struck). Since each of these is represented <pb n="81"/> by a single variety, a
                    complete <placeName>U.S.</placeName> variety collection of the cent gap-year needs only three coins. But the half eagle is a killer, with
                    only around a dozen pieces known. </p>

               <p>1815 Half Dollar.</p>
            </figure>
            <p> During the 1810 decade the <placeName>Philadelphia mint</placeName> prepared its own gold and silver planchets: from melting, to
                    alloying, rolling ingots to strip, cutting blanks, and upsetting the edges. Copper planchets, on the other hand, were purchased ready for
                    coining. By this time these were sole-sourced from <placeName>Britain</placeName> . With our declaration of war against <placeName>Britain</placeName> , we could buy nothing more from this source. By October of 1814 the mint's inventory of copper planchets
                    was exhausted. And the mint limped through 1815 with the minimal silver and gold coinage noted above. </p>
            <p> A fire in January of 1816 destroyed the rolling mills of the mint. No planchets for precious metal coinage could be made until the mills
                    were replaced (in 1817). </p>
            <p> With the conclusion of the War of 1812, the <placeName>British</placeName> embargo on American trade ended and copper planchets could
                    again be ordered from <placeName>Britain</placeName> . The first shipment of these was received in December of 1815. So as a poetic
                    revenge, although there were NO 1815-dated cents, the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> coinage of 1816 was nothing BUT cents. </p>
            <p> Any one of three major episodes is more than enough to make 1815 a significant year. The one best remembered on this continent is the Battle
                    of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> , a lopsided American victory fought two weeks after the Treaty of Ghent officially ended the War
                    of 1812. The two hour battle culminated weeks of preparation and resulted in 13 <placeName>U.S.</placeName> casualties versus over two
                    thousand British casualties, the loss of two <placeName>British</placeName> generals, and a <placeName>British</placeName> withdrawal. </p>
            <p> For the <placeName>British</placeName> , engaged in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> before and Waterloo
                    after, <placeName> New <pb n="82"/> Orleans </placeName> is remembered (if at all) as an unfortunate sideshow. For the Americans it was
                    the turning point of our nationhood and our one major land victory of the War of 1812. The final repulse of British forces catapulted the
                    autocratic <persName>Andrew Jackson</persName> to a national hero status that led to his Presidency 13 years later. And the national
                    mood swung from a long-term pessimism to the cocky self-assuredness that has since become the prototype European view of our country. </p>

            <p> By 1815 our country had grown to eight and a third million people, with 80 percent of us still living along the <placeName>Atlantic
                        seaboard</placeName> . Our major cities included <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> at 75,000, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> at 60,000, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> at
                    25,000.Over 80 percent of Americans were farmers. Most "quality" manufactured goods were imported from <placeName>Europe</placeName> . </p>
            <p> One major outcome of this war was the long-term diminishment of American shipping. In trying to expand her own nautical advantage, <placeName>Britain</placeName> forced her ex-colonies to develop a greater self-reliance. The British wartime embargo and her own expansion
                    in trade-dominance <pb n="83"/> forced the <placeName>United States</placeName> into home manufacture of many things that we had
                    customarily imported. These practices would benefit our children more than either nation suspected. </p>
            <p> The year of the copper hiatus was also the hiatus between the first and second Banks of the <placeName>United States</placeName> . In
                    1811 the charter of the First Bank of the <placeName>United States</placeName> expired. Congress chartered the Second Bank of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in 1815, but President <persName>Madison</persName> vetoed it, and the charter was not passed
                    again until 1817. </p>
            <p> During the 1811-1817 bank hiatus many states chartered banks that poured millions of inadequately-backed dollars into circulation. These
                    fostered inflation to the point where by 1815 80 dollars in coin would buy the same goods as 100 dollars in paper. Though accounts were kept
                    in lawful dollars, paper payment was accepted only at the current local rate, reminiscent of the confused finances of colonial days. The
                    paper versus coin exchange rate varied with the health of the local issuing banks, being closer to 90% of par in <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> and down as far as 75% in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> and points south. </p>
            <p> With the charter of the Second Bank of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in 1817, federal paper was issued that was fully backed
                    and fully redeemable in coin. The state banks were forced to honor their notes in specie or die, and inflation ceased. </p>
            <p> In the spring of 1814 <placeName>Europe</placeName> had just ended 22 years of war with the defeat and unconditional abdication of <persName>Napoleon Bonaparte</persName> , who was then "exiled" to the island of <placeName>Elba</placeName> in the Mediterranean with
                    a pension of two million French francs per year. <placeName>Elba</placeName> is six miles off the Italian coast. </p>
            <p> After ten months <persName>Napoleon</persName> left Elba for <placeName>France</placeName> . The troops sent from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> to arrest him welcomed their old commander, and <persName>Louis</persName> XVIII fled into
                    exile. <persName>Napoleon</persName> took to the field again and began the "hundred days" of his return, which ended with his defeat at
                        <placeName>Waterloo</placeName> in June. He fled to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> , abdicated again, and
                    tried to escape to <placeName corresp="#geonames_652001">America</placeName> . When he was recognized at dockside, he was taken by the
                        <placeName>British</placeName> as a prisoner of war. He was tried, convicted, and exiled to <persName>Saint Helena</persName> in
                    the <placeName>South Atlantic</placeName> , over 1,000 miles from the nearest land. There he would live out his days. </p>
            <p> The victors re-distributed European kingdoms and territories. Spanish troops, released by the European peace, were hastily dispatched to
                        <placeName>South America</placeName> to counter <persName>Simon Bolivar's</persName> revolution in <placeName>New
                        Granada</placeName> . It would prove to be too little, too late, as the domino-effect cleared nearly all of Central and <placeName>South America</placeName> of European "ownership" by 1830. </p>
            <pb n="84"/>
            <p> In <placeName>Britain</placeName> the long-hoped-for peace abruptly ended demand for military supplies, sent 400,000 demobilized troops
                    home, and brought severe economic depression. A dismal harvest in 1816 added to the massive British unemployment problems, and riots broke
                    out throughout <placeName>Britain</placeName> . </p>

            <p> Meanwhile, a cataclysm had occurred half a globe away. A violent volcanic eruption occurred on April 5, 1815. "Tamboro" in the <placeName>East Indies</placeName> (about 700 miles north of <placeName>Australia</placeName> ) blew up, killing 20,000, creating
                    tsunamis (tidal waves)and blowing millions of tons of ash into the stratosphere. </p>
            <p> Within a year the ash cloud circled the globe, lowering world temperatures to the point that 1816 is still called "the year without a
                    summer." Heavy snows fell in the <placeName>Northeast United States</placeName> in June and July of 1816, clothes left out overnight to
                    dry were frozen stiff in the morning, and frost killed crops in the year that for decades farmers called "eighteen hundred and froze to
                    death." </p>
            <p> By 1816 millions of <placeName>United States</placeName> cents were being coined from British planchets. <placeName>Indiana</placeName> became the nineteenth state. The European map was massively updated. Wars of independence were seething in <placeName>South America</placeName> . And the hiatus was past. There has never been another missing year for <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> cents. But there have been few other years as noteworthy as 1815. </p>

            <p> One of the most poorly understood aspects of <placeName>U.S.</placeName> coinage from 1793 to 1836 is that of the diesinking and minting
                    processes. Unfortunately there are very few records and no drawings detailing coining operations of this period. Equally unfortunate is the
                    fact that none of the early presses have survived to this day. Several coining dies from this period, however, have survived and these dies
                    can help in gaining a clearer understanding of the early processes and problems. </p>
            <p> The American Numismatic Society has five dies of various denominations from this period, all obverse, ranging in date from 1803 to 1818. The
                    dies are quite different than the illustrations which have appeared in numismatic references. They are quite small when compared with dies
                    of the late 1800s and early 1900s, being only around 1.25 to 1.5 inches high and about the same across the base. The dies are briefly
                    described as follows: </p>

               <p> This die was apparently not used; it is not traced to a known vari-ety. Crudely formed, the die is 1.219 to 1.222 inches in height and
                        consists of a machined cylinder approximately .5 inches in height and 1.267 to 1.272 inches in diameter on an octagonal base 1.423 to
                        1.445 inches across. The cylinder is off-axis (eccentric) to the base. The base is very crudely forged, none of the faces being equal.

                        octagonal base about 1.537 to 1.550 inches across. The cylinder is concentric to the base. The base is crudely forged, none of the faces
                        being equal, but the workmanship is better than the previous die. </p>

               <p> This die is a "cylinder on cylinder" design. The die is 1.323 to 1.327 inches in height and consists of a machined cylinder 1.087 to
                        1.090 inches in diameter and about .4 inches in height on a machined cylindrical 1.362 to 1.367 inches in diameter. The die area
                        cylinder is concentric to base. The machining is quite good, looking quite modern. The die has an inverted "T" cut into the side of the
                        base cylinder, presumably used to capture a set bolt in the die cup to lock it in place. <pb n="88"/> There are also two depressions or
                        dimples opposite this "T" cut near the top of the base, also presumably for set bolts. Overall the craftsmanship is very good. </p>

               <p> This die is 1.423 to 1.427 inches in height and consists of a finely machined frustrum (truncated cone) atop an equally well-machined
                        cylindrical base. The base cylinder is 1.678 to 1.682 inches in diameter and approximately .95 inches in height. The frustrum is about
                        .4 inches in height with an angle of about 20 degrees; the frustrum is concentric to the base. There is no "neck" area at the face as
                        with modern dies; the die face is the face of the frustrum. The diameter at the die face is 1.289 inches to 1.293 inches. The die shows
                        two "dimples" on the side of the base cylinder near the bottom of the base, one at the date and one at 9:00, presumably where the set

               <head>
                  <hi rend="bold">Observations and Conclusions</hi>
               </head>
               <p> The base of all of the dies have been machined flat. This brings up one feature which is not readily apparent, but is shown by the
                        measurements - the die face and the base face are quite parallel to each other, showing that <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> was
                        quite aware of the necessity to have the faces parallel so that the dies would strike evenly. </p>
               <p> The dies also provide some hints as to what the "die cups" looked like: these being the fixtures that held the die while in the press.
                        The cups likely had an internal diameter only slightly larger than the base diameter of the die. This would allow the die to be securely
                        locked in place with a few set bolts. The height of the die cup probably was about the same as that of the die's base. The cup could
                        have been merely a ring, but more likely it was truly a "cup," with a flange or feet to bolt it into the press. </p>
               <p> Perhaps the most important feature of the dies is the change in overall form. The dies show a clear evolution from the rather crudely
                        forged 1803 Ten Dollar Gold die to the well made 1805 Quarter and 1806 Half Dollar dies. </p>
               <p> This evolution in form ties in quite nicely with Mint records from the National Archives which show that Eckfeldt was experimenting with
                        several types of die steel, and therefore forging practices, during the early 1800s in an effort to improve die life. Likewise a die
                        life analy- <pb n="90"/> sis of the large cents shows a concomitant rise from about 200,000 strikes per die in 1803 to over 300,000
                        strikes in 1806 ( <persName>Sholley</persName> 1996). </p>
               <p> The "cylinder on cylinder" form of the cent die also explains the cracks, cuds and rim breaks commonly seen on the large cents. </p>
               <p> Although <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> surely realized the superior mechanics of the "frustrum on cylinder" form, it would appear
                        that he used this highly refined, but difficult to manufacture design only for half dollars, these being the most demanding in terms of
                        mechanical strength. </p>
               <p> This conclusion is supported by the 1820 Half Eagle obverse die in the ANA Museum which is again a "cylinder on cylinder" design ( <persName>Hoge</persName> 1994). </p>

               <p> Two other dies from outside the ANS collection likewise support the conclusion that the "cylinder on cylinder" design was the main form
                        used, especially for the large cents. These are the dies used to strike the so-called 1823 restrike cent ( <ref target="#fig-37">Fig.
                            6</ref> ). </p>
               <p> The obverse die of this non-Mint issue is the same die used for the regular issue, non-overdate, <persName>Newcomb</persName> 2
                        variety. The reverse die, the only reverse currently known to the author, is the one used for the 1813 S-293 variety. </p>
               <p> The most interesting feature of these dies is that the obverse and reverse dies are the same in form and size, showing that the early
                        dies could be mounted interchangeably in the press. Either die could be placed in the hammer or anvil position for striking. This does
                        confirm research by error specialist Chris Pilliod which suggested that the dies of this period were used interchangeably ( <persName>Pilliod</persName> 1996a; <persName>Pilliod</persName> 1996b). </p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Part 1 - Defining a Proof</hi>
               </head>
               <p> What is a proof large cent? The easy way out would be to use the late Supreme Court Justice <persName>Potter Stewart's</persName>
                        description of pornography: "I may not be able to define it, but I know it when I see it." Unfortunately, different people see the same
                        thing different ways, so from the point of numismatic scholarship this definition is not very helpful. Can we do better? </p>
               <p> The first attempt to publish a specific list of criteria for proof large cents was by <persName>Howard Newcomb</persName> in his
                        1944 book on the cents of 1816-1857: </p>
               <list>
                  <item>• Sharp, polished dies</item>
                  <item rend="hang"> • The coin is struck from new dies or the earliest known state of the dies </item>
                  <item>• Polished planchets</item>
                  <item>• Reflective, mirror-like fields</item>
                  <item>• Sharp, even border beading</item>
                  <item>• All stars show their centers</item>
                  <item>• All details show perfectly</item>
               </list>
               <p> The only exception Newcomb allowed was for one-sided proofs: coins with one side (usually the obverse) proof and the other a regular
                        business strike. </p>
               <p> In his comprehensive work on proof coins of all denominations, Walter Breen opined that Newcomb's criteria were too strict, particularly
                        for proofs made before the introduction of the steam press and the close collar. Breen put forth his own list of proof criteria: </p>
               <list>
                  <item>• Sharper than a business strike</item>
                  <item>• Struck from 2-4 blows of the die</item>
                  <item>• Polished dies</item>
                  <item>• Mirror fields</item>
                  <item>• Sharp letters and stars</item>
                  <item>• Matte or frosty central devices</item>
                  <item rend="hang"> • If struck in a close collar, the coin should have square edges and sharp rims. </item>
               </list>
               <p> Breen allowed some exceptions from these rules: A coin that exhibited most, but not all, of these characteristics could still be
                        considered a proof. </p>
               <pb n="95"/>
               <p> The problem with both of these lists is that they were written with perfect hindsight. At any point in time, the proofing process is
                        limited by the coining technology of the day. Early nineteenth-century proofs should not be expected to look like the products of a
                        twentieth-century mint - or even of the later nineteenth century. <persName>Newcomb</persName> applied characteristics of the
                        proofs of the 1840s and 1850s to pre-1840 coins. <persName>Breen</persName> was influenced by the King of Siam set and more modern
                        proofs. Any list of proof criteria only makes sense when viewed in the context of what was possible at the time. </p>
               <p> In particular, the close collar and the steam press were major advances in the coining process. The close collar was first used in 1828
                        for silver coins, and probably in the 1834-38 period for cents. It produced far stronger strikes (by restricting the metal flow of the
                        planchet), higher edges, and sharper borders. The steam press was introduced in 1836, although proof large cents continued to be struck
                        on screw presses for several years thereafter. The steam press allowed more uniform striking pressure - hence better strikes - and
                        better positioning of the planchet. </p>
               <p> How, then, can we develop a meaningful list of objective standards for proofs if the rules of the game keep changing? The answer is to
                        play a different game, and ask a different question. Let's try to define a proof large cent not by <hi rend="underline">how</hi> it was
                        made, but <hi rend="underline">why.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> The first identifiable "why" definition of proofs was given by the Englishman <persName>Henry Walpole</persName> in the 1760s. To
                        him, proofs were "Coins made like medals...to exhibit to the recipients a finer quality of die impression." This definition contains two
                        key words: "recipients" and finer. </p>
               <p> "Recipients" - a proof coin was given to someone. That is, proofs are special presentation pieces. The recipient may be a foreign
                        dignitary, <placeName>U.S.</placeName> government official, or simply a collector who paid for the privilege. </p>
               <p> "Finer" - proofs are better than business strikes. They are (or should be) sharper, brighter, better struck, and better preserved. They
                        represent the best the mint can do with the technology of the time. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Dr. William Sheldon</persName> reiterated this idea in <hi rend="italic">Early American Cents</hi> : "Proof coins were
                        never struck for circulation ... [they] were used as presentation pieces ... as 'polished up portraits' of the coinage." His definition
                        of proofs, like <persName>Henry Walpole's</persName> , is based on "why," not "how." </p>
               <p> The pre-eminent researcher on proof coins today is <persName>Michael Hodder</persName> . In preparing to catalogue the October,
                        1992 sale of the <persName>Floyd</persName>
                  <pb n="96"/>
                  <persName>T. Starr</persName> collection for Stacks, <persName>Hodder</persName> produced a state-of-the-art paper on early
                        proof coins. This paper was excerpted in the catalogue; a fuller exposition appears in the September 28, 1992 issue of <hi rend="italic">Coin World.</hi> In it, he set forth what I will call the <persName>Hodder</persName> criteria for proof large cents: </p>
               <p>1. Pre-1840</p>
               <list>
                  <item rend="hang"> • Better impression - multiple strikes. Some stars may not show centers. </item>
                  <item>• Fresh dies - though they may not be perfect.</item>
                  <item>• Better planchet, possibly polished.</item>
                  <item>• Polished dies, but may show mint frost.</item>
                  <item>• Mirror fields.</item>
                  <item>• Sharper edges, squarer rims.</item>
                  <item> • Better preserved - no bag marks or handling marks. </item>
               </list>
               <p> Not every criterion must be 100% satisfied for a coin to be a proof, but most of them must hold. The only clear exceptions are the
                        bronzed (rather than mirror) proofs of 1829 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 6 and the one-sided proofs of 1827 and the 1830s. <persName>Hodder</persName> , however, does admit that the distinction between proof and prooflike examples of these years can be
                        very subjective. </p>
               <p>2. Post-1839</p>
               <list>
                  <item rend="hang"> • Sharp strike - but even here there is the rare exception, such as the 1843 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 14
                            sold as lot 971 in the first <persName>Robinson S. Brown</persName> sale in 1986. </item>
                  <item>• Square edges, sharp "knife" rims.</item>
                  <item rend="hang"> • More subjectively, given the improvement in mint technology, the coin must clearly "look proof," i.e. look
                            qualitatively different from the business strikes from those dies. </item>
               </list>
               <p> The <persName>Hodder</persName> analysis may be conveniently summed up as follows, which I will suggest as the appropriate
                        definition of a proof large cent: <q> A proof large cent is a specimen striking for presentation purposes, of the highest standard
                            possible at the time. It is an exemplar of the coiner's art. Or, to quote <persName>Hodder</persName> : "If it looks entirely
                            different, it probably is." </q>
               </p>
               <p> If a proof large cent is defined by why it was made, then why, in fact, were they made? </p>
               <pb n="97"/>
               <list>
                  <item rend="hang"> 1. Presentation to diplomats and dignitaries, as exemplified by the King of Siam set. </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 2. Internal official presentation to Mint officials and high ranking members of government. <persName>Hodder</persName> observes that the first year for which a significant quantity of proof cents is known is 1821, the year of
                            President <persName>Monroe's</persName> second inauguration and the Era of Good Feeling. He theorizes that the 1821 proof cents
                            were struck primarily to commemorate the inauguration. Similarly, the 1841 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 1 proofs may have been
                            related to the elections of 1840. </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 3. On demand. Prior to 1840, the Mint did not engage in a formal program of offering proof coinage to the public.
                            Individuals who wanted proofs simply requested them from the Mint, which usually supplied them at face value. </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 4. For a profit. Beginning in 1840, proof coins were not only made in response to specific requests, but also for the
                            express purpose of selling them later at a profit. The Mint produced both individual coins and year sets. Eventually, on-demand
                            strikings gave way to a formal program of proof set manufacture. </item>

                                the earliest known state of the dies, but not perfect. The coin is brilliant red with fully reflective mirror-like surfaces, and
                                it also displays cartwheel lustre. It is a wonderful example of how a coin can seem to break all the rules and yet be a proof in

                     <cell> Proofs of these years are of two types, originals and restrikes. By "originals" I mean proof specimens struck from dies also
                                used for business strikes. These are extremely rare: two 1844 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 2s, no 1845s, three or four
                                1846s, no 1847s or 1848s, and three or four 1849 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 30s. "Restrikes," on the other hand, are seen
                                much more frequently. This group consists of one proof-only variety of each year: 1844 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 8, 1845
                                    <persName>Newcomb</persName> 14, 1847 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 42, 1848 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 19,
                                1849 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 18. A single reverse die was used for these varieties, readily identifiable by an
                                irregularity on the reverse <pb n="101"/> rim over TED. See <ref target="#fig-41">Figure 4</ref> . It is believed that all of
                                these were struck in the 1850s, along with the contemporaneous half cents, specifically as specimens for collectors. They vary
                                in the number known from ten to twenty or so, with 1844 being the rarest and 1848 the most common. The year 1846 also boasts a
                                second proof-only variety, the tall date <persName>Newcomb</persName> 24. This is a great rarity, with only four examples
                                traced. Perhaps a few collectors wanted examples of both the small date and tall date varieties. </cell>

                                1857 <persName>Newcomb</persName> 3 share the same reverse die. Perhaps the second set of 1857 dies ( <persName>Newcomb</persName> 5) reflects a final surge of collector demand as the era of large cents finally drew to an end. </cell>

               <p> Late in April 1996, <persName>Colonel Steven Ellsworth</persName> of Butternut Coins obtained a large hoard of approximately 4,700
                        Large Cents from <persName>Bob Miller</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> . The coins
                        are thought to have originated from a family in Eastern <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254927">Pennsylvania</placeName> . It is
                        estimated that the coins had been accumulated by two to three generations of the same family from the early to the late 1800s. </p>
               <p> After attributing about 90% of the coins, the following observations have been made: </p>
               <list>
                  <item rend="hang"> 1. All of the XF-40 and higher grades were absent from the hoard with the majority of coins ranging from Good to Very
                            Fine (someone probably cherrypicked out the XFs but this has not altered the statistics significantly). </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 2. Every date was found with the exception of 1793 and 1804 (these were highly collectable even in the early 1800s). </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 3. Based on the distribution of the varieties within any given year (most levels of rarity were found) and the
                            relatively good correlation between published mintages and the distribution of dates in the hoard, it is believed that the hoard is
                            a good random sample and has not been numismatically searched in the last 50-100 years. Some discrepancies between the published
                            mintages and the hoard findings could be explained by the fact that dies were sometimes used for more than one year until they
                            failed or were thrown out. </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 4. There were approximately 650 early dates (1793-1814), 3,600 middle dates (1816-1839), and 300 late dates
                            (1840-1857) which could be identified by year. </item>
                  <item rend="hang"> 5. An unusually small number of coins were found for the years 1840-1857 (perhaps these were considered "new coins"
                            and were of little interest at the time the hoard was being amassed). </item>

               <q> Although it is somewhat out of our province to treat of counterfeit coins, it [is] necessary to mention another counterfeit which has
                        been made possibly under the supervision of the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Mint officials at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>
                        , within the past twenty years; but <hi rend="italic">who</hi> influenced the manufacture of this disgraceful fraud we prefer not to
                        say. Fraud it is, and intended for the greedy maws of unprincipled dealers and collectors and never for circulation, consequently it is
                        not a coin; nor is it exactly a counterfeit; as it is in no way an imitation of the genuine cent of the date in question; but merits
                        only the appellation we bestow upon it; it is considered a disgrace to any collection in which it may be found. </q>
            </p>
            <p> Thus wrote <persName>David U. Proskey</persName> in the January 1881 issue of <hi rend="italic">The Coin Collector's Journal</hi>
                    regarding the 1823 restrike large cents. The cent restrikes of 1823, along with the well-known 1804, and the lesser known 1810, form a
                    fascinating trio which, fortunately, numismatists today hold in higher regard than did <persName>Proskey</persName> over a century ago. </p>
            <p> The 1804 restrike was produced from an altered obverse die originally dated 1803 and a reverse die of 1820. These were primarily struck in
                    copper although very rare tin composition examples are known. </p>
            <p> Very few numismatists are aware of the 1810 tin restrikes which combine an 1810 dated obverse die with the same 1820 reverse die used for
                    the 1804 restrikes. Only two examples are known. </p>
            <p> The 1823 restrikes are perhaps the most common of the trio, yet hide a few surprises. These combine the 1823 normal-date obverse die with a
                    reverse die of 1813. Copper examples are known in several different die states with the "uncracked" obverse being quite rare. A small number
                    of 1823 restrikes are known in silver. Little is known regarding the circumstances surrounding these issues. Available evidence includes the
                    surviving coins along with a few vague, often conflicting, historical references. </p>

               <p> The earliest printed record located by the author appeared in <persName>W. Elliot Woodward's</persName> auction catalogue of the
                        Finotti Collection, November 1862. Lot 806 was described "1823. Splendid-uncirculated. Recently struck from the original die." This coin
                        realized $3.50. <pb n="163"/> Combined with the previously quoted 1881 comments of <persName>David Proskey</persName> , we
                        rationalize that the first 1823 restrikes were made in 1861 or 1862. <persName>Proskey</persName> mentioned that these were
                        produced "under the supervision of <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Mint officials" which we are now certain was not the case. </p>

                  <persName>Edward D. Cogan</persName> , in his auction catalogue of April 7-8, 1863, described lot 928: "1823 Uncirculated,
                        re-struck from the original die, scarce." This coin sold for $3.75 to <persName>Joseph Zanoni</persName> . This reference appears
                        to be the earliest use of the term "restrike" when describing these issues. </p>
               <p> In March 1868, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Mason's</persName> Coin &amp; Stamp Collector's Magazine </hi> mentioned the 1823 restrike, stating "there has been a
                        're-strike' of this cent from the old obverse die, and the reverse die of another cent." </p>
               <p> One year later, in an article titled "Peculiarities of American Coins" in the March 1869 issue of the same journal, <persName>Mason</persName> further discussed the 1823 restrike and also mentioned the recent appearance of the 1804 restrike: <q> Several years
                            ago a circular piece of copper of the size of a cent of the year 1823, made its appearance in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>
                            . On one side was shown a Liberty head surrounded by thirteen stars, and underneath "1823." The other side had a wreath surrounding
                            the words "one cent," and surrounded by the legend " <placeName>United States of America</placeName> ." The nondescript was
                            alleged to be a <hi rend="italic">re-strike</hi> of the U.S. cent of the year 1823. </q>
                  <q> It was really produced in this way: Somebody obtained an old die that had been used in making the obverse of the '23 cent, and
                            another that had been used in making the reverse of the cent of 1818 <hi rend="italic">[sic].</hi> Planchets of copper being
                            procured of suitable size, and the dies having a portion of rust removed, were forcibly driven against the piece of copper. The
                            obverse die of 1823 was broken on the edge and cracked across the head—no matter, they were driven and re-driven against planchet
                            after planchet. The latter not being protected by a collar, was bent out of shape by the blow, so that it became necessary to file
                            off the edge, tool up the hair, and fix in such manner as to appear to the unsuspecting, like a veritable <placeName>U.S.</placeName> cent. Only a few were stated to have been made, so that the moderate sum of $3.00 was asked and obtained for them.
                            During the year 1867 a great number turned up, and have doubtless been widely distributed. </q>
                  <pb n="164"/>
                  <q> An obverse of the half-cent of 1811, and reverse of 1807 <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> were similarly treated, but only a few were
                            really made, and the dies were not broken. People call it a <hi rend="italic">re-strike</hi> half-cent of 1811. </q>
                  <q> During the year 1868, a third hybrid appeared, also in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , purporting to be a re-strike of the
                            cent of 1804. It is said that the reverse belonged to the issue of the year 1820, and that the other is thought to have been a
                            pattern die that had never been made use of. However this may be, it is certain that both had suffered severely by the corroding
                            tooth of time and oxygen. </q>
                  <q> All the issues mentioned above may be readily known by even the tyro numismatist. <placeName>United States</placeName> coins they
                            never were, and to the appreciative student they can never have any higher standing (if at all admitted into his cabinet), than such
                            imitations of our country's silver money as are marked in the catalogues as <hi rend="italic">base</hi> . </q>
               </p>
               <p> That same year, <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> offered an example in his September 27-28, 1869 auction. Based on these
                        references, we will place the time of issue for the 1804 restrikes as 1868. </p>
               <p> Returning to the 1823 restrike, perhaps the most valuable information is contained in an obscure auction catalog by <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> dated January 16, 1871. In his Catalogue of Coins and Medals, lot 331 sold for $2.75 and was described: <q>
                            1823; re-struck from the original Obverse die, and the reverse die of 1816 <hi rend="italic">[sic];</hi> cracked in three places;
                            the stars and date perfect, the head rubbed; rev., the "One Cent" imperfectly struck. This is one of forty-nine struck by the
                            writer, for the owner of the dies, and must not be mistaken for one of those lately struck, in which the die shows much more damage.
                        </q>
               </p>
               <p> These comments by <persName>Cogan</persName> are important as he identifies himself as the person who actually struck the 1823
                        restrikes and suggests the quantity of 49 examples struck before the dies cracked. <persName>Cogan</persName> in no sense implied
                        that he owned an interest in the dies as would later be suggested. His actual words suggest that he did not own the dies when these were
                        struck. He did imply that there were distinctly different emissions from these dies with one very recent to the time of this offering. </p>
               <p> Almost eight years later, <persName>Cogan</persName> seemed confused about his own participation. In his December 1878 catalogue of
                        the <persName>James E. Root</persName> collection, <persName>Cogan</persName> described lot 307: <pb n="165"/>
                  <q> 1823 Beautiful uncirculated impression of the restruck cent. This is believed to be the only one struck before the die cracked. Very
                            rare. </q>
               </p>
               <p> The library of the American Numismatic Society contains an undated, unsigned manuscript bound with the title <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Miscellany</hi> . This handwritten manuscript was acquired from a <persName>Thomas L. Elder sale</persName> of July
                        1913 where it was attributed to <persName>Montroville Wilson Dickeson</persName> . The author wrote: <q> In digging out the rubbish
                            from the cellar of the Mint which was destroyed in 1815 [actually, January 1816], a small vault was found under the pavement—bricked
                            up with the exception of a small hole, and in tearing away the wall a number of dies were found ... There were about one bushel,
                            they were picked out by the workmen and finally sold as old steel to a worker in that metal. Some time after their disposition, Mr.
                                <persName>James</persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi>
                     <persName>J. Mickley</persName> hearing of them endeavored to obtain them, but most of them had been worked over they being of
                            the very best kind of steel. A number of them are now in his cabinet among which is that very scarce number, the halfpenny of 1811.
                        </q>
               </p>
               <p> These comments by <persName>Dickeson</persName> (?) provide information about the discovery of the various dies which we believe is
                        factual. As Walter Breen later noted, the minor inaccuracies are not sufficient to discount this as a source of historical information [
                            <persName>Breen</persName> 1983, 316.] Later articles would suggest that <persName>Mickley</persName> , who was born in
                        1799, obtained the dies when he was just 17 years old. The above article does suggest that the dies were found in 1816, however, it does
                        not state that <persName>Mickley</persName> acquired them in that year. </p>
               <p> The various dies from <persName>Mickley's</persName> collection were listed in a November 1878 auction catalogue by <persName>M. Thomas</persName> &amp; Sons. This sale, which was catalogued by <persName>Ebenezer Locke Mason</persName> , Jr.,
                        consisted primarily of foreign coins from <persName>Mickley's</persName> estate. Interestingly, the 1804 restrike dies supposedly
                        owned by <persName>Mickley</persName> did not appear in this offering. </p>

               <p> Today, the American Numismatic Society Library contains a priced example of this catalogue with the notation "Out. Sold to U.S. Mint"
                        penned beside lots 907 and 909 through 917. This comment suggests that the government bought the lots rather than confiscated them. </p>
               <p> The following article appeared in the January 1879 issue of <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> and included an
                        account by <persName>R. Coulton Davis</persName> : </p>
               <p> The statement that the dies, hubs, &amp;c. of U.S. Coins advertised for sale with the <persName>Mickley</persName> Collection, were
                        seized by the <placeName>United States</placeName> authorities, has given rise to a great deal of comment. We have received from a
                        gentleman in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> the following account of the affair. </p>
               <p> A few days previous to the sale, the authorities claimed the above, viz: some 20 obverse and reverse dies of <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Coinage, mostly in damaged and corroded condition, the same having <pb n="167"/> been condemned by the Mint authorities
                        above "half a century ago" and as tradition says was the custom in those days, "sold for old iron." Since then we have grown more
                        artful, and it has been deemed politic under existing laws, that the whole multitude of dated dies should be annually destroyed in the
                        presence of three designated officers of the Mint. In the above described lots in the catalogue, there was not a complete pair of
                        obverse and reverse dies. Even the obverse die of the half cent of 1811 was muled with the reverse die of a different year. We cannot
                        conceive by what authority the government, after making sale of its "refuse material," could seize upon the same property without
                        tending some compensation. There is scarcely a numismatist in the <placeName>United States</placeName> but who is aware of the
                        existence and where abouts of similar dies, and who is also aware of the many "re-strikes," known to be such-being made from the dies,
                        say of the 1804 cent, the 1811 half cent, and the 1823 cent outside of the Mint. </p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , December 1878. "Coulton" </p>
               <p> From what we have seen in the public prints in reference to this matter, we infer that the government authorities were somewhat hasty in
                        their action, and claimed the property without first satisfying themselves as to ownership. No one would for a moment suspect Mr. <persName>Mickley</persName> of any wrong in the matter. The affair was settled, we believe, by a payment to the family of the
                        estimated value of the dies, which were then presented to the Mint, and subsequently destroyed. </p>
               <p> The preceding account provides additional details of the coinage dies leaving the Mint and of <persName>Mickley's</persName>
                        ownership of the same. We note that Davis mentioned these dies were condemned by the Mint authorities "above half a century ago." This
                        comment suggests that these dies left the Mint sometime prior to 1829, which agrees with the earlier comments from Dickeson. Certainly
                        the cent dies dated prior to 1816 could have come from this source, however, later date dies such as the 1820 reverse and 1823 obverse
                        must have been from a source other than the 1816 cache. </p>
               <p> In his 63rd sale of March 4-6, 1884, <persName>W. Elliot Woodward</persName> mentioned <persName>Mickley's</persName>
                        ownership of the 1804 dies at lot 709, offering a tin example as "1804 From the original obverse die formerly owned by Mr. <persName>Mickley</persName> ; tin, fine, and far rarer than originals." </p>

               <p> Although they are of no value from a historical perspective, <persName>Harlan P. Smith's</persName> comments in his January 14,
                        1887 catalogue of the <hi rend="italic">

               <p> The next report of historical information in our study of these emissions is an article by <persName>Charles Steigerwalt</persName>
                        in the April 1907 issue of <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> . This commentary requires careful consideration for its contents do
                        not completely hold true: </p>
               <p> A certain kind of 1804 and 1823 cents have appeared in sale catalogues for years as "Mint Restrikes." The recent cataloguers may be
                        excused on the plea of ignorance, but when these rank counterfeits are sold by those who have been doing so for years, it is time
                        collectors knew their true character. </p>
               <p> While at a recent sale, the lacking information regarding the 1823 was given by an aged collector, who told how, years ago, he had found
                        the dies in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> , probably sold with old iron from the Mint, brought
                        them to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , had a collar made, which was lacking, and the coins struck by a man named <persName>Miller</persName> on 7th St., that city. </p>
               <p> Later, the dies came into possession of a then leading dealer there and, when his store was sold out in 1885, the writer finding them
                        among a lot of old dies purchased, they were at once destroyed so effectually that no more will ever come from that source. These coins
                        never saw the Mint, and are counterfeits pure and simple. </p>
               <p> It was supposed the 1804 came from the same source as the 1823, but the originator of those disclaimed any knowledge of the 1804. An
                        effort was made in a recent sale catalogue to throw an air of mystery around this 1804. That is simply ridiculous. The obverse has been
                        identified as an 1803, but as that date was too common, a crude 4 was cut over the 3 and a reverse of the period after the fraction was
                        omitted, probably of about 1816 or later, was used in striking these abominations. By whom struck is unknown, but it was at a period
                        long after, when the dies were rusty, and certainly not in the Mint. </p>
               <p> Who was the "aged collector" mentioned by Steigerwalt? Certainly it was not <persName>Mickley</persName> as he had long since
                        passed away in 1878. Haseltine <pb n="169"/> may be a possibility even though he was a dealer rather than a collector. Perhaps such
                        distinctions were not as important 90 years ago. If it was Haseltine, should we rely on the information presented? Haseltine's
                        numismatic memory was a bit cloudy and inaccurate by the early 1900s. Many of the other actors involved had passed away by 1907. <persName>Dickeson</persName> died in 1882, <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> in 1884, <persName>R. Coulton
                            Davis</persName> (who reported on the disposition of <persName>Mickley's</persName> coinage dies) passed away in 1888, <persName>Ed. Frossard</persName> in 1899, <persName>Mason</persName> in 1901, and <persName>J. Colvin Randall</persName>
                        (who, prior to 1880, was an associate of Haseltine) also died in 1901. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Steigerwalt</persName> mentions that "the dies came into possession of a then leading dealer" and were discovered in his
                        store when the store was closed in 1885. Today, it is generally believed that this dealer was <persName>Haseltine</persName> who
                        relocated to <placeName>New York City</placeName> in 1885 to manage his brother's art gallery [ <persName>Smith</persName> 1992,
                        112]. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Steigerwalt's</persName> report provides the name of the person who supposedly struck the 1823 restrikes, Mr. <persName>Miller</persName> of 7th Street in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . The aged collector who was the originator of
                        these, however, according to <persName>Steigerwalt</persName> , had no involvement with the 1804 restrikes, thus, the 1804 and 1823
                        restrikes were made by different parties. These comments are in disagreement with the earlier remarks by <persName>Edward
                            Cogan</persName> in 1871. It may be the case that <persName>Cogan</persName> was an intermediary between the aged collector and Mr.
                            <persName>Miller</persName> . </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Steigerwalt</persName> also states that he had purchased the dies and had them defaced "so effectually that no more will
                        ever come from that source." <persName>Q. David Bowers</persName> reported to this author that he had seen the dies in the 1950s
                        and recalls that they still seemed to be usable. The following illustration of the dies, found among photos at <persName>Bowers</persName> and <persName>Merena</persName> Galleries, shows that they were, indeed, still sound. </p>

               <p> In discussing the 1804 restrikes in 1908, <persName>Thomas L. Elder</persName> was apparently confused about their previous history
                        when describing the <persName>Peter Gschwend specimen</persName> in his June 15-16 sale: </p>
               <p> 553 1804, The <persName>Dickeson</persName> restrike. This interesting note in ink by Mr. <persName>Gschwend</persName>
                        accompanies the piece: "One cent, 1804. Muled with 1809 <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> reverse in Phila. Mint. Bo't from <persName>M. W. Dickeson</persName> . Sept. 12th, 1881, in Pittsburg Exposition and State Fair," etc. Uncirculated, red. </p>
               <p> Was Elder really confused about the 1804 restrike or was <persName>Dickeson</persName> the party who had these produced? Further
                        evidence surrounding the origin of the restrikes was provided in an article in the December 1910 issue of <hi rend="italic">The
                            Numismatist</hi> . Under the title "Coin Dies Abandoned in the Old U.S. Mint" are found the reminiscences of Charles <persName>K. Warner</persName> : <q> Various publications in recent months regarding the first <placeName>United
                                States</placeName> Mint and the many discussions of the use and misuse of coin dies in early Mint days have been subjects of
                            extraordinary interest to <persName>Charles K. Warner</persName> , the veteran medallist of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . </q>
                  <q> In comparison with the recent destruction of all coinage dies excepting those in actual use, and the now prescribed rigid
                            regulations as to the care and destruction of dies, the following communication to <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> from Mr.
                                <persName>Warner</persName> makes interesting reading at this time: </q>
                  <q> "I have at times in the past promised to write you something regarding my boyhood days around the old Mint building, which still
                            stands on the east side of Seventh street and which was pictured and featured in the January and February <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> of this year. </q>
                  <q> "My father, the late <persName>John S. Warner</persName> , who from 1823 to 1868 was the oldest established medallist in the
                                <placeName>United States</placeName> , was well acquainted with a certain <persName>William Sellers</persName> who for
                            many years conducted the business of a <persName>silversmith</persName> in the old Mint building [ <persName>Joseph
                                Sellers's</persName> name was on the front of the building in 1854. <persName>Sellers</persName> was in the silver-plate
                            trade.] He occupied the entire first floor and a greater part of the basement. In the latter part of 1857 Mr. <persName>Sellers</persName> gave to my father a large number of old coin dies which were a part of a great lot of both obverse and reverse
                            dies for all the silver and copper denominations that <persName>Sellers</persName> found in the old building when he first
                            occupied it years before. It was <pb n="171"/> stated at that time that these were found among general rubbish when the basement was
                            cleaned. Most of the dies were considerably rusted, chipped on the edges, or cracked across the face. My father having no use for
                            the old dies gave them to a particular friend of his, the then Chief Coiner of the Mint, which was then located in <placeName>Chestnut street near Broad</placeName> . </q>
                  <q> "As a lad I frequently visited the old mint building on errands to Mr. <persName>Sellers</persName> for my father and often
                            played about the building with a son of Sellers, who was about my age. I well remember the old vault. I could have easily explored
                            the vault, and no doubt could have found many things which, if preserved, would be of great interest today, but lad that I was, I
                            had no interest in such things." </q>
               </p>
               <p> This report does not add any specific details to the discussion of the 1804 and 1823 restrike issues. However, it illustrates the
                        general concept that the old coinage dies were considered to be scrap metal and were very easily removed from the premises. Is it
                        possible that the 1823 restrike die pair was among these old dies given by <persName>Sellers</persName> to <persName>Warner</persName> and by <persName>Warner</persName> to the chief coiner? </p>
               <p> In his 1944 reference, <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>United States</placeName> Copper Cents 1816-1857, </hi>
                  <persName>Howard R. Newcomb</persName> repeated various details found in the previous writings. <persName>Newcomb</persName>
                        described die states of the 1823 issue and added "The late <persName>David Proskey</persName> fixed the date of this crooked work,
                        restriking 1804 and 1823 cents, as about 1858 and that at about that time a bill was passed by Congress ordering the destruction of all
                        old dies." (This bill was actually passed in 1869. It is interesting to note that <persName>Proskey</persName> objected to the 1804
                        cent restrikes while he was personally involved in the production of the Confederate half dollar restrikes produced by <persName>J.W. Scott</persName> in 1879.) </p>
               <p> A few years later Dr. <persName>William H. Sheldon</persName> , in his 1949 reference <hi rend="italic">Early American Cents,</hi>
                        repeated comments from <persName>Proskey</persName> and <persName>Doughty</persName> : <q> "This singular example of the low
                            moral tone of some of our public officials made its appearance about the year 1860 ... in no (real) sense a re-strike ... but
                            manufactured for the sole purpose of supplying coin dealers with a cent... they could sell to young and ignorant collectors ..." I
                            think we can let this pungent comment stand without elaboration. The coin results from a marriage of obverse 13 of 1803 (altered to
                            1804) with a reverse of 1818 <hi rend="italic">[sic].</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="172"/>
               <p> In the 1952 American Numismatic Association Convention sale, featuring the large cent collection of <persName>Homer K.
                            Downing</persName> , the cataloguer for <placeName>New Netherlands</placeName> Coin Company ( <persName>John J. Ford</persName>
                        ) noted that the 1804 restrike was "made by <persName>Mickley</persName> and [ <persName>Edward</persName> ] <persName>Cogan</persName> , circa 1860-68." This sale also included an 1823 restrike with the comments: "This is an impression with
                        the badly broken obverse, made after <persName>Cogan</persName> and <persName>Mickley</persName> sold the dies, but prior to
                        the silver examples." Apparently Ford mis-interpreted the <persName>Cogan</persName> statement and assumed that he was a part owner
                        of the dies. </p>
               <p> The next significant entry in the literature of these restrikes is an article by <persName>Lynn Glaser</persName> , "Restrikes and
                        Mules of U.S. Coins Made Outside the Mint," which appeared in the September 1961 issue of <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> . <persName>Glaser</persName> discussed the 1811 half cent and 1823 cent restrikes along with various other issues. However, he
                        overlooked the 1804 cent restrike. Concerning the 1823 cent restrike, <persName>Glaser</persName> wrote: <q> Cent 1823 made with
                            obverse NA-2 of 1823 muled with the reverse of the 1813 cent. Forty-nine of these were struck in copper in 1862-63 by <persName>J. J. Mickley</persName> and <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> . They were originally sold for three dollars each.
                            When the dies became broken they were sold. The actual manufacture of the coins was done by <persName>Miller</persName> of 7th
                            St., <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . After <persName>Cogan</persName> and <persName>Mickley</persName> sold the
                            dies additional copper impressions were made by the new owner. These are seen with a crack on the face of the obverse varying in
                            length. The dies are believed to have been owned by Dr. <persName>M. W. Dickeson</persName> and later by <persName>Haseltine</persName> . <persName>Haseltine</persName> is supposed to be responsible for a few silver pieces apparently made in
                            1878-79. After this more copper pieces were struck. <persName>Charles Steigerwalt</persName> supposedly found the dies in <persName>Haseltine's</persName> store sometime before 1907 and defaced them. Recently the defaced dies were offered to a
                            collector for several thousand dollars. </q>
               </p>
               <p> In this article <persName>Glaser</persName> noted "Ray Williams [ <persName>Williamson</persName> ] maintains that dies were
                        sold as scrap when the Mint was moved in 1832-33." Although <persName>Glaser</persName> did not provide the source for this
                        statement, it undoubtedly refers to <persName>R.H. Williamson</persName> , "A Visit to the U.S. Mint in 1812," <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> , January 1951, pp. 4-10. At p. 9, <persName>Williamson</persName> quotes the visitor as observing "After
                        the new mint went into operation the machinery of the old mint was sold under the auctioneer's hammer, mostly by weight as old metal." </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Don Taxay</persName> devoted a few pages to the subject in <hi rend="italic"> Counterfeit, Mis-Struck, and Unofficial
                            U.S. Coins, </hi> published in 1963. New information <pb n="173"/> provided by <persName>Taxay</persName> was, unfortunately,
                        poorly documented. Most of his report simply repeats previous documents. </p>
               <q> In January 1816, the Mint caught fire and much of its heavy machinery was destroyed. Some time later, as men were clearing away the
                        debris, a small subterranean vault was unearthed and its contents, consisting of several old dies, were sold to a worker in scrap steel.
                        [See <persName>Dickeson</persName> Manuscript, above.] The dies were then resold to the budding numismatist <persName>J.
                            J. Mickley</persName> , in whose possession most of them remained over half a century, before being re-appropriated by their original
                        owner. [See AJN letter, above.] </q>
               <q> After <persName>Mickley's</persName> death, a great many of his coins were sold at public auction (November 1878) by <persName>Moses Thomas</persName> and Sons, of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , the catalogue having been prepared by the
                        well known dealer <persName>Ebenezer Mason</persName> . Although the collection consisted mostly of foreign coins, lots 905 through
                        918 are of considerable interest to us. They are described under the heading " <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Steel Dies, Hubs, etc.",
                        and include no less than seventeen obverse and reverse dies for <placeName>U.S.</placeName> coins! Lot 912 reads "1811 2- Hubs [dies]
                        obv. and rev., <placeName>United States</placeName> half cent; rev. slightly damaged on edge." The reverse was actually Gilbert
                        Variety 1 of 1802, and from this muling, <persName>Mickley</persName> had struck off six pieces on bright red copper planchets, the
                        dies having first been retooled and carefully polished in order to produce "proofs." ... </q>
               <q> Among the dies that never returned home was an odd pair (obv. 1823, rev. 1813) for striking large cents. <persName>Mickley</persName> had sold the dies, in cracked condition, to Dr. <persName>M. W. Dickeson</persName> who, after taking several
                        impressions, resold them to <persName>J. W. Haseltine</persName> . The few silver impressions extant are thought to have been
                        struck by <persName>Haseltine</persName> in 1878 or 1879. Sometime prior to 1907, <persName>Charles Steigerwalt</persName>

               <q> We should mention here that the 1804 and 1810 large cents with the reverse of 1820 were, in all probability, struck outside the Mint,
                        despite <persName>Proskey's</persName> assertion to the contrary. The 1804 obverse has been crudely altered from S-261 of 1803 by
                        means of a graver (not a punch) and both pieces are much inferior to the standard set by <persName>J. R. Snowdens</persName>

                  <persName>Jeffrey</persName> and <persName>Paul Oliphant</persName> wrote an article which appeared under the title "Large
                        Cent Restrikes" in <hi rend="italic">Penny-Wise</hi> for September 1970 and <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> for February 1971.
                        The <persName>Oliphants</persName> presented much of the known information, relying on <persName>Taxay's</persName> reference
                        cited above. They discussed specific details of the 1804, 1810, and 1823 restrike emissions described below. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Walter H. Breen</persName> added background information in his <hi rend="italic"> Encyclopedia of <placeName>United States</placeName> Half Cents </hi> , published in 1983. These notes are contained in the listing of the 1811 restrike half
                        cent. </p>
               <q>
                  <persName>Mickley's</persName> ownership of the dies was established by the <persName>Moses Thomas</persName> &amp; Sons auction
                        of his estate, November 1878. The catalogue described a large number of dies and hubs, mostly of half eagle denomination or more
                        obscure, but the 1811 half cent die and the reverse used with it were clearly in evidence. According to lot 408 of the <persName>Cogan</persName> sale, December 16-18, 1878, an agent of the Mint repurchased (not seized, as the newspapers reporting the
                            <persName>Mickley</persName> sale said had been done) all of the dies and hubs which had been mint products. This was a curious
                        courtesy indeed, as today they would merely be confiscated and their owner would be lucky to escape a prison sentence. </q>
               <q> It was a little more difficult to establish when and how <persName>Mickley</persName> obtained the dies. The most varied surmises
                        have been fabricated and published. There were at least two occasions when the Mint sold obsolete, rusted, and broken dies without
                        further defacing them, as scrap metal. One of these was in 1816, the other in 1833. Documentation of which occasion gave <persName>Mickley</persName> his opportunity to buy them is found in a bound manuscript [ <persName>Dickeson</persName>
                        manuscript, above] in the Museum of the American Numismatic Society. The museum buyer obtained this manuscript at a <persName>Thomas L. Elder sale</persName> , July 18, 1913. It contains abundant internal evidence that it was written about 1859-61 by <persName>Montroville Wilson Dickeson</persName> , M.D.; it contains notes on a hundred or more miscellaneous numismatic subjects,
                        including drafts of long sections of his <hi rend="italic">American Numismatic Manual</hi> . </q>

                        discussion. Here, <persName>Breen</persName> suggests that the 1804 issues were produced about 1858 (repeated from comments by
                            <persName>Proskey</persName> ) from rusted dies retrieved from scrap metal sold by the Mint in 1833. Concerning the 1823
                        issues, <persName>Breen</persName> provided four different <pb n="175"/> entries representing three distinct issues of the copper
                        restrike (1862, 1863-79, and 1879-1900) along with the 1879 issue in silver. </p>

               </head>
               <p> During the course of this study, the author felt it would be important to discover the specific composition of the "white metal" 1804
                        and 1810 restrikes along with that of the 1823 silver restrike. For these tests, the assistance of <persName>David Lange</persName>
                        and <persName>William Metropolis</persName> was obtained. <persName>Lange</persName> is the electron microprobe specialist at
                        the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. <persName>Metropolis</persName> is Assistant Curator of the
                        Mineralogical Museum at <placeName>Harvard</placeName> . </p>
               <p> The chemical composition was determined by electron microprobe analysis with each sample checked at five different points. This test <pb n="177"/> compared x-ray energy levels of the sample to those of known sources to determine the elements present. The composition
                        was reported as a percentage of the total weight of the sample. Readings were taken at a depth of five microns. Performed in a
                        non-destructive manner, this test has significant limitations. Under ideal circumstances, the sample would be polished to remove surface
                        roughness and contaminants (corrosion or toning), yielding more accurate results. For obvious numismatic considerations, such polishing
                        was to be avoided in this situation. </p>

               <p> This 1823 silver restrike should be described as "sterling silver," which has a theoretical silver content of 92.5% The missing 1.9% is
                        due to surface corrosion, sample roughness, other minutely present trace elements, and testing limitations. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Lange</persName> suggested that the amount of copper present in the tin restrikes may have been partly from the
                        composition of the sample, however in the case of the 1804 restrike (which has more copper than the 1810), may also have been deposited
                        on the dies during the striking of the copper restrikes and transferred to the surface of the tin example. </p>
               <p> Given the testing limitations mentioned above, and the reasonably close percentages of lead in the two tin samples, <persName>Lange</persName> and <persName>Metropolis</persName> feel comfortable suggesting that these two tin restrikes came from the same
                        planchet source. </p>

                        severely rusted and extensively cracked, was re-annealed, altered to 1804, ground down to remove some rust, and sharpened in various
                        details. The date has the digit 1 recut with a flat top and broad base, 8 has been recut with the new 8 being of a different style (the
                        center stroke thick, unlike the original), the new 0 is narrower with a thinner base and top, and part of the curve of the 3 is left of
                        the base of the 4 with the corner of the 3 right of the top of the 4. </p>

                        rust, and retooled. Leaf point below D is between the inner and outer curves. The highest leaf is right of the final S, nearly half-way

                        beneath that letter, which is nearly closed. All letters are well-spaced although RI are rather close. New border dentils of sawtooth

                  <hi rend="bold">Die State</hi> : The obverse die has an arc crack equivalent to the very latest state of 1803. A second crack from the
                        rim at 7:30 curves through the lower hair towards the first crack. A thin branch below this crack curves through the lower curls to the
                        1 in the date. An additional crack through the hair reaches the upper lip, eventually extending to the rim at 2:30. This crack seems to
                        diminish as die rust advances. All examples of the 1804 restrike seen by the author appear to be in approximately the same die state. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Rarity</hi> : Various estimates have been published at different times. Probably in the range of 1,000 to 1,500 copper
                        examples survive. Rarity of the tin composition examples is not specifically known. Probably not more than three or four exist, of which
                        only one has been traced by the author. Also in existence are obverse and reverse uniface examples in tin, both extremely rare. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Remarks</hi> : Struck in 1868, based primarily on the comments of <persName>Ebenezer Locke Mason</persName> , Jr.,
                        who wrote in 1869 "During the year 1868, a third hybrid appeared, also in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> , purporting to be a
                        restrike of the cent of 1804." Since the reverse die was common to both the 1804 and 1810 restrikes, both are known in tin, and the
                        analysis of tin examples of each suggest the same planchet source, we believe that both of these were made at approximately the same
                        time and by the same person. </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Specifications</hi> : Most examples are known in copper and were struck on broad planchets ranging from 28.5 to 29 mm.
                        Weight of these ranges from 155 to 190 grains. </p>
               <p> A small number are known in tin which in the past have been called "white metal." The tin example studied for this report has a diameter
                        of 28.5 mm., weight of 157.2 grains, and is 93.6% pure tin. </p>

               <p rend="hang"> 1. The rim breaks mentioned for the original 1823 issue are always present unless they have been removed through tooling. In
                        this die state, these rim breaks extend from the right side of star 4 to a point between stars 6 and 7, however, do not touch any stars.
                        No other die cracks are seen. The reverse is as the final die state of 1813 described above. This is apparently the 1862 issue with 49
                        pieces struck, according to <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> . Most surviving examples from the uncracked die state have the rim
                        break tooled away and dentils engraved to simulate original 1823 cents. In <hi rend="italic">The Cent Book,</hi>
                  <persName>John D. Wright</persName> commented "I have seen ten unbisected examples, and eight of these had the obverse rimbreak
                        tooled off to try to pass as original 1823 cents." The author of this report has observed three of these with the rimbreak removed, all
                        three appearing to have the same workmanship. </p>
               <p rend="hang"> 2. An additional small rim break has developed over star 7. A bisecting die crack has its beginnings at the rim break
                        between stars 4 and 5, crossing the head of Liberty to star 12. The reverse remains as described above. </p>
               <p rend="hang"> 3. The bisecting crack is much heavier and continues from star 12 to the rim. The reverse is as above. </p>
               <p rend="hang"> 4. An additional obverse die crack develops from the rim between stars 1 and 2, crossing the chin and joining the main crack
                        on Liberty's cheek. The reverse has a light die crack from the rim through the <pb n="183"/> right side of D, arcing up through the
                        wreath and continuing over ONE, through the top of E, to the right side of the wreath. An additional crack joins the lower right side of
                        the final S to the wreath below. </p>

                        suggested. The 1823 copper restrike was known as early as 1862 and was probably first struck in that year. Later die states, with the
                        obverse cracked, were most likely struck in 1867, based on the comments of <persName>Ebenezer Locke Mason</persName> , Jr., who
                        said "During the year 1867 a great number turned up, and have doubtless been widely distributed." Additional examples were supposedly
                        struck at a later date, perhaps in the late 1870s or even later. Specifications: Struck in copper and silver. The silver example studied
                        for this report has a purity of 93.0%. </p>

               </head>
               <p> Very little is actually known regarding these issues. The 1804 and 1810 restrikes share a common die and were most likely struck by or
                        for the same person in 1868. The 1823 restrikes may have been struck on two or three different occasions by a Mr. <persName>Miller</persName> on behalf of an "aged collector" or by <persName>Edward D. Cogan</persName> . Who was the aged collector?
                        Concrete evidence may never be found as <persName>Steigerwalt</persName> took the secret to the grave. We need to find a collector
                        or dealer who was active in the 1860s and still living in 1907. </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Mickley</persName> is often the name given when the production of these issues is discussed. He reportedly owned the 1804
                        dies. Did he ever own the 1823 dies? Did <persName>Mickley</persName> actually have the restrikes produced, or was he only an
                        accomplice? The study of these issues has provided many more questions than answers and has revealed that many previously supposed
                        "facts" are guesswork or theories. The true story may never be known. </p>
