                <p> "The Medal in <placeName>America</placeName> " was the subject of the thirteenth Coinage of the <placeName>Americas</placeName> Conference
                    in 1997, just as it had been a decade earlier. As the earlier conference had been held in conjunction with the opening of the exhibit "The
                    Beaux-Arts Medal in <placeName>America</placeName> ," so this year's conference was in the context of three exhibits at the Society's
                    headquarters. This year's exhibits were oriented to the medal of the mid- and late-twentieth century. "A Life in the Arts: Medallic Works of
                        <persName>Gilroy Roberts</persName> ," a retrospective look at the works of the former Chief Engraver of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> Mint, traveled to the ANS from our sister institution, the American Numismatic Association, where it had been curated
                    by <persName>Robert W. Hoge</persName> . "The American Medallic Sculpture Association, 1982-1997," featured contemporary work by the members
                    of that group, co-curated by <persName>Jacqueline Lorieo</persName> and <persName>Alan M. Stahl</persName> . A complementary exhibit, "The
                    British Art Medal Society, 1982-1997," was organized by <persName>Philip Attwood</persName> of the British Museum. The latter two exhibits
                    were the subject of a joint catalogue, <hi rend="italic">2 Sides</hi> , published by AMSA. </p>
                <p> The conference itself was organized in sessions over the weekend of November 8 to 9. Saturday was devoted to the history of the American
                    medal, and featured the first eight papers published in this volume. It ended with a formal opening of the exhibits, followed by dinner for
                    the participants at the historic Keen's Chop House. Sunday began with the screening of <hi rend="italic">The Medal Maker</hi> , a film
                    produced by the American Numismatic Society in 1929 and recently restored by <persName>Mike Craven</persName> Productions with a new
                    introduction written by <persName>Dick Johnson</persName> featuring <persName>Elizabeth Jones</persName> . The rest of the day was devoted
                    to hands-on demonstrations of the techniques of medal making. <persName>Virginia Janssen</persName> explained and demonstrated both the
                    pantographic and direct <pb/> approaches to die making. <persName>Ron Landis</persName> , assisted by <persName>Joe Rust</persName> , used
                    equipment transported from the Gallery Mint Museum of Hot <placeName>Springs, AR</placeName> , to show the technique of direct die engraving
                    and striking. Participants in the congress then struck examples of a special medal, whose obverse die had been prepared in advance by
                        <persName>Janssen</persName> using a pantographic reduction and whose reverse die had been carved on the spot by
                        <persName>Landis</persName> . Both demonstrators kindly contributed discussions of their work for inclusion in this volume. </p>

                    <hi rend="bold">Introduction</hi>
                </head>
                <p> Ten years after the first conference and volume on <hi rend="italic"> The Medal in <placeName>America</placeName> , </hi> we return with new
                    studies on the topic. The two sets of papers have much in common, a result of the way in which the medal is viewed in this country. In
                    general terms, the medal in <placeName>America</placeName> is approached as three distinct subjects, each exemplified in this year's
                    conference. The medals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century are treated as subjects for historical and numismatic inquiry,
                    while those of a century later are objects of art historical analysis. American medals since the First World War are scarcely considered
                    worthy of scholarly study at all. </p>
                <p> The paper in this volume by <persName>John Adams</persName> is a preview of his forthcoming book on a series of Indian Peace Medals which
                    are among the most intriguing in the series, those in the name of <persName>George III</persName> . The heraldic group is problematic
                    enough, with the portrait of a young king paired with shields from both early and late in his reign, but the "Lion and Wolf" medal has long
                    been a complete mystery in terms of date, iconography and purpose. <persName>Adams</persName> has combined extensive documentary and
                    numismatic research to his solution to these questions. <persName>Chris Neuzil's</persName> paper on Moritz Fürst is an example of the most
                    basic and valuable tool in medallic study, a fully documented corpus of the work of an artist set into a biographical narrative. It is of
                    special importance in covering the work of an artist of major importance in the early development of the American medal, and one whose work
                    has been little known until now. The paper of <persName>Paul Rich</persName> and <persName>Guillermo De Los Reyes</persName> on Masonic
                    medals is more of a plea for inclusion and introductory overview than a detailed study. Medals, decorations and tokens of fraternal
                    organizations have long been relegated to the edges of medallic inquiry, even though they had an enormous presence in the culture of the
                    times. </p>
                <pb n="x"/>
                <p> Five of the papers in this volume deal with what has become the core area of study for the art of the American medal, the period from the
                    Columbian Exposition to the First World War. <persName>Thayer Tolles</persName> tells the tumultuous story of the most important medal by
                    the most influential of American medalists, the Columbian Exposition Award medal of <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> . Three
                    authors treat the works of individual artists with comprehensive surveys of their work. <persName>Barbara A. Baxter</persName> writes on the
                    classical nature of the work of one of the leading members of the first generation of American Beaux-Arts medalists, <persName>A. A.
                        Weinman</persName> . <persName>Scott Miller</persName> examines and catalogues the medals of <persName>Emil Fuchs</persName> , important
                    in the turn-of-the-century sculpture of <placeName>England</placeName> as well as <placeName>America</placeName> . <persName>Bob
                        Mueller</persName> treats the use of mythological iconography in the medals of <persName>Paul Manship</persName> , an artist whose work
                    can be seen as the culmination of the Beaux-Arts movement in <placeName>America</placeName> and the basis of the Art Deco style which
                    dominated figurative sculpture here for much of the twentieth century. In her essay on <persName>Charles De Kay</persName> and the Circle of
                    Friends of the Medallion, <persName>Susan Luftschein</persName> deals with issues of patronage and reception, situating the art medal in the
                    aesthetic development of the age. </p>
                <p> The contributions of the conference and this volume to the American medal of the late twentieth century are only potential. The Sunday
                    workshops of <persName>Virginia Janssen</persName> and <persName>Ron Landis</persName> were of great interest to historians of the medal in
                    illustrating the processes of many of the phenomena to be studied on the objects themselves, but may have even more importance for their
                    effect on the artists present, who could see traditional techniques employed in the hands of modern practitioners. </p>
                <p> What would we like to see in a third volume of The Medal in <placeName>America</placeName> , perhaps in 2007? There are eight decades of
                    American medals between the War of 1812 and the Columbian celebration of 1892 which remain virtually unexplored and uncatalogued; leading
                    medalists such as <persName>C. C. Wright</persName> and <persName>George H. Lovett</persName> remain little more than names to modern
                    scholars. From the perspective of the next century, we should be able to look back at the twentieth century and find much of interest in the
                    American medals of its last eight decades. And, of course, there will already be a few years of the twenty-first century American medal to
                    subject to examination and study. </p>

                <p> The reign of <persName>George III</persName> lasted for 60 years, from 1760 to 1820. This period spans the War of the Conquest,
                        <persName>Pontiac's Revolt</persName> , the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Our interest in <persName>George III</persName>
                    centers on the Indian Peace Medals issued in his name. These medals tell a story at two levels. At the numismatic level, the story has been
                    told by such distinguished hobbyists as <persName>Robert McLachlan</persName> (1882), <persName>C. Willys Betts</persName> (1894),
                        <persName>Victor Morin</persName> (1916) and <persName>Melville Jamieson</persName> (1936). Much of what has been written by these
                    authors is in error. We attempt to correct the earlier errors, proceeding further to define die varieties, methods of manufacture and
                    quantities issued. </p>
                <p> More important than the story at the numismatic level is the story at the historical level. The peace medals of <persName>George
                        III</persName> tell an eloquent, if cynical, story of relations between the white man and Native Americans. This story spans many of the
                    critical turning points in the development of a continent. The paper that follows attempts to summarize key findings that will be treated at
                    greater length in a book in press for 1999 ( <persName>Adams</persName> 1999). </p>

                        <persName>George</persName> the Second died on October 24, 1760, and his 22 year old grandson was proclaimed the following day. The
                        coronation of <persName>George III</persName> took place on September 22, 1761, followed almost immediately by his marriage to
                            <persName>Charlotte of Mecklenberg</persName> . Newly crowned and newly wed, the young King was also basking in the glow of his
                        grandfather's victories. In the prior year, <persName>Wolfe</persName> had defeated Montcalm before Montreal, driving the French from
                            <placeName>Canada</placeName> after a long, bitterly contested war. </p>
                    <p> Indians played a prominent role in the so-called "War of the Conquest." The Six Nations of the Iroquois League had fought on the side of
                        the British. The Seven Nations of <placeName>Canada</placeName> had fought on the side of the French, as had the tribes in the Great
                        Lakes region—the <placeName>Ottawas, Chippewas, Hurons</placeName> and <placeName>Pottawatomies</placeName> . On the western border of
                            <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> , the Delawares and Shawnees had begun the war as allies of the colonials but then switched
                        sides to the French before switching back as momentum swung to the British. </p>
                    <p> Originally, each colony had conducted its own Indian affairs. In large part because of the troubles in
                            <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> , <persName>George II</persName> decided to centralize the responsibility for relations with the
                        Indians. The new Superintendent of Indian Affairs bypassed the colonial governments, <pb n="3"/> reporting directly to the Commander in
                        Chief for <placeName>North America</placeName> . From 1755 until his death in 1774, Sir <persName>William Johnson</persName> held the
                        position of Superintendent in the Northern District. In 1760, at the beginning of the reign of <persName>George III</persName> , the
                        Commander in Chief was Major General <persName>Jeffrey Amherst</persName> . He was succeeded in 1763 by General <persName>Thomas
                            Gage</persName> of Bunker Hill fame. </p>
                    <p> A large landowner in upstate <placeName>New York</placeName> , <persName>William Johnson</persName> began his career as a trader,
                        assuming the ways of the Indians and learning their language. Adopted by the <persName>Mohawks</persName> , the easternmost of the
                            <placeName>Iroquois nations</placeName> , <persName>Johnson</persName> enjoyed a special relationship with the natives. It was he
                        who saw the inroads being made by the <persName>French</persName> , prompting him to recommend a centralized approach to Indian
                        relations ( <persName>Johnson</persName> 1754). With his appointment to the Superintendency, Sir <persName>William</persName> soon
                        became the most notable figure in colonial <placeName>America</placeName> . He led combined British-colonial-Indian forces to important
                        victories over the <persName>French</persName> at <placeName> Lake George and Niagara </placeName> . With his Indians, he accompanied
                        Wolfe to the climactic battle for <placeName>Montreal</placeName> in 1759. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> started for <placeName>Montreal</placeName> with over 500 Indians but, between whimsical desertions and
                        regular disagreements with the British military establishment, ended up with less than half that number. However, his supreme
                        accomplishment was persuading the French Indians to remain neutral. <persName>Pierre Pouchet</persName> wrote in his memoirs "
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> alone was able to quiet them and make them forget their ancient political system in this war" (
                            <persName>Pouchet</persName> 1866, 1:30). Indeed, <persName>Johnson</persName> was the only figure in colonial
                            <placeName>America</placeName> respected by the Indians, the colonists and the British alike. </p>
                    <p> For his part, <persName>Amherst</persName> had a low regard for Indians. Nonetheless, it was he who recommended the so-called "
                            <placeName>Montreal</placeName> medal" to <persName>Johnson</persName> and then saw to its execution ( <persName>Johnson</persName>
                        1921, 10:461). <persName>Johnson</persName> viewed the medals as a reward for service whereas <persName>Amherst</persName> considered
                        them an identification badge by which "good" Indians could be distinguished in the future. </p>
                    <p> In their paper in <hi rend="italic"> The Medal in <placeName>America</placeName> , </hi>
                        <persName>Fuld</persName> and <persName>Tayman</persName> did a commendable job of describing both the <placeName>Montreal</placeName>
                        medals and the Happy While United medals of 1764 and 1766 ( <persName>Fuld</persName> and <persName>Tayman</persName> 1988). We will
                        elaborate on these issues in our forthcoming book. Suffice for now to observe that there is an ironic connection between the two. Having
                        eliminated the French, <persName>Amherst</persName> decided to suspend the sale of guns, powder and other supplies to the Indians and
                        bar their entrance into British forts (save, presumably, for those natives wearing <pb n="4"/>
                        <placeName>Montreal</placeName> medals). The hard line taken by <persName>Amherst</persName> led to growing unrest, culminating in the
                        conspiracy of 1763. Indeed, the Pontiac Conspiracy is often called " <persName>Amherst's</persName> War" by modern historians. </p>

                    <p> By long tradition, the <persName>George</persName> and <persName>Charlotte</persName> medal has been attributed to 1761 ( <ref
                            target="#fig-2">fig. 1</ref> ). <persName>Robert McLachlan</persName> writes " <persName>George III</persName> was married September
                        8, 1761. On this occasion, the Indians, ever profuse in their expressions of loyalty, forwarded to the 'Great Father' an address of
                        congratulation, which the King gratefully acknowledged by causing these medals to be struck and distributed among the faithful red men"
                        ( <persName>McLachlan</persName> 1882, 11). This statement is romantic balderdash. There were very few "faithful" Indians to be found—
                            <persName>Amherst</persName> had seen to that. </p>

                        in three sizes: 76mm, 60mm and 38mm ( <ref target="#fig-3">figs. 2</ref> and <ref target="#fig-4">3</ref> ). The
                            <persName>George</persName> and <persName>Charlotte</persName> medal shares its reverse with the standard medal of 38mm diameter.
                        The latter is extremely rare; indeed only two specimens are now known. Thus, it seems logical to hypothesize that the obverse die for
                        this medal broke early its life and that the obverse of a previously unused marriage medal was employed in its place. </p>
                    <p> The "Lion and Wolf" medal has been similarly misplaced ( <ref target="#fig-5">fig. 4</ref> ). <persName>C. Willys Betts</persName>
                        deserves the blame for this mistake, because it was he, reasoning from a specimen found in the grave of <persName>Pontiac's</persName>
                        son, who then pioneered the theory that the skulking wolf represented Pontiac with the rest of the scene depicting the bliss to be had
                        by those adhering to the British side ( <persName>Betts</persName> 1894, 238). This flight of fancy was swallowed whole by subsequent
                        writers including <persName>McLachlan</persName> (1899, 16), <persName>Morin</persName> (1916, 35) and <persName>Jamieson</persName>
                        (1936, 13). </p>

                    <p> In attributing the son's medal to the father, Betts ignored the matrilineal customs of Pontiac's tribe, the Ottawas. More obviously, he
                        failed to explain why the great chief would have been pleased to receive a medal on the reverse of which he was caricatured, much less a
                        medal of the medium-size generally issued to lesser figures. Further, none of the early writers observed that Lion and Wolf shares its
                        obverse with the standard <persName>George III</persName> medal of the same diameter. </p>

                    <p> Thus, both the Lion and Wolf and the <persName>George</persName> and <persName>Charlotte</persName> medals are die-linked to the undated
                            <persName>George III</persName> medals of standard design. Most likely, all of these pieces were made during the same period. Our
                        thesis is that the undated peace medals of <persName>George III</persName> were made beginning in 1776 and continued to be made until
                        dated medals appeared in 1814. </p>
                    <p> Our case requires two proofs. The first is that the medals were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> made at the outset of the reign of
                            <persName>George III</persName> (1760) or at any time up <pb n="8"/> until 1776. The second proof required is that they were made
                        thereafter. We have uncovered an abundance of contemporary evidence to support both points. </p>

                    <p> After conquering the French, the British should have renewed ties with their Indian allies as well as initiating relations with the
                        greater number of Indians who had fought against them. Instead, they took a more short sighted view reasoning that, with the French
                        threat removed, the money previously devoted to Indian presents could be saved. This attitude was well expressed by
                            <persName>Amherst</persName> writing to <persName>Johnson</persName> in 1761: "Yet I am of opinion that we must deal sparingly, for
                        the future ... I can see little reason for bribing the Indians or buying their good behavior, since they have no enemy to molest them" (
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 10:348). The Indians were quick to sense the adverse change in their situation. In reporting to
                            <placeName>London</placeName> in the Spring of 1762, Sir <persName>William Johnson</persName> wrote: "On inspecting my transactions
                        of last year, and the later meeting your Lordship will observe that the Indians are not only very uneasy, but jealous of our growing
                        power, which the enemy [i.e., the French] had always told them would prove their ruin, as we should by degrees surround them on every
                        side, and at length extirpate them" ( <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 10:461). </p>
                    <p> The "late meeting" referred to by <persName>Johnson</persName> was a council with the Great Lakes Indians at <persName>Fort
                            Detroit</persName> in the Summer of 1761. This was the first formal meeting held by the English with the most powerful tribes that
                        had fought on the side of the French. Notwithstanding the importance of the occasion, minutes of the meeting reveal no issue of medals
                        or, as protocol would have demanded, exchange of French medals in their place. In contrast, minutes of the councils at
                            <placeName>Niagara</placeName> in 1764 and <placeName>Oswego</placeName> in 1766, for which the Happy While United medals were
                        procured, describe such exchanges. Furthermore, <persName>Ensign Gorrell</persName> , who was sent to
                            <persName>Michillimackinac</persName> , the second most important post in the West, wrote that his predecessor was asked by the
                        Indians for medals in 1761 but there were none to give out then or now ( <persName>Gorrell</persName> 1903 1:33[6/25/1762];
                        1:38[5/18/1763]). Thus it seems clear that no medals were given out in 1761 and 1762. </p>
                    <p> During the year 1763, the frontiers were aflame with <persName>Pontiac's Revolt</persName> . For the treaties held in 1764 and 1766
                        there is ample documentation in the papers of <persName>General Gage</persName> and Sir <persName>William Johnson</persName> that <pb
                            n="9"/> the medals issued were of local manufacture. Indeed, <persName>Johnson</persName> complained about the quality of this work
                        because the French medals being exchanged were both finer and thicker ( <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 12:23).
                            <persName>Gage</persName> responded: "I will inquire whether there is any good engravers at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> .
                        The die in my possession was done by <persName>one de Bruls</persName> who was reckoned the best in these parts of the world" (
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 12:34). <ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
                    </p>
                    <p> Despite the existence of a local source, medals remained in short supply. In 1765, Indian agent <persName>William Howard</persName>
                        wrote from <placeName>Michillimackinac</placeName> that three important chiefs requested medals but he had none to give out (
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 11:806-7). <persName>George Croghan</persName> , who was one of <persName>Johnson's</persName>
                        most active lieutenants, took Happy While United medals on his mission to the <placeName>Illinois</placeName> in 1765 but, in early
                        1767, was forced to order 20 silver medals from <persName>Myer Myers</persName> , a <placeName>silversmith in New York</placeName> (
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 12:265). Thus, there is no evidence of English-made medals being issued from 1763 through 1767. </p>
                    <p> Nowhere was the lack of quality medals felt more keenly than in the case of the Treaty of <persName>Fort Stanwix</persName> in 1768.
                        Preparing more than two years in advance for an event that would cede 20,000,000 acres of Indian land to the Crown,
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> wrote to his civil supervisor at the Lords of Trade: "In my last letters I mentioned what the Indians
                        then inclined to agree to with regard to the boundary between us and them ... and with the assistance of a proper present and some good
                        medals [i.e., English made] struck on the occasion for the chief <persName>sachems</persName> and principal warriors, I do not despair
                        of effecting it" ( <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 12:32). Incredibly, the Lords of Trade denied this modest request as well as
                        subsequent applications for medals to be issued at following councils. <persName>Benjamin Roberts</persName> , Sir
                            <persName>William's</persName> agent in <placeName>London</placeName> , reported the bad news: "I spoke to him about the medals,
                        upon the whole his answer was that he would not augment the expense" ( <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 7:607). And again, "also the
                        article of the Medals but he still persisted in thinking a limit should be fixed to the expense" ( <persName>Johnson</persName> 1921, 7,
                        732). In effect, His Majesty's government graciously accepted the 20,000,000 acres for which é15,000 had been paid but it would not
                        spend another one hundred pounds to dignify the occasion. </p>

                    <p> After the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and its confirmations, the Indians became a forgotten force. <persName>Johnson's</persName> budget was
                        greatly reduced, as trou- <pb n="10"/> bles with the colonists moved to center stage. Seven years later, the situation was wholly
                        reversed. With both the colonists and the British seeking allies in the struggle that began at <placeName>Lexington</placeName> , the
                        Indians held the balance of power. Both sides conducted councils, vying to gain influence. The "peace" medals awarded in the process are
                        enduring symbols of this hypocritical courtship. </p>
                    <p> In our book, we will discuss the individuals who promoted the use of medals as well as what can be learned in the absence of mint
                        records for this period. Suffice for now to observe that British medals appear as early as June 5, 1776, when a German officer describes
                        a reception held in <placeName>Montreal</placeName> , "After the ceremony was over, the General [Governor-General Sir <persName>Guy
                            Carleton</persName> ] ordered uniforms ... for these chiefs, and presented them with big silver medallions upon which the likeness
                        of the King was stamped" ( <persName>Du Roi</persName> 1911, 38). A few months later, similar treatment was accorded to Wabasha, the
                        legendary chief of the <persName>Mdewankton Sioux</persName> and his companion, "The Governor presented each chief with a large silver
                        medal bearing a bust of King <persName>George</persName> on the obverse side and Great <placeName>Britain's</placeName> coat of arms on
                        the reverse. These were hung around their necks on ribbons of royal purple. <persName>Wabasha wore</persName> his above a similar French
                        medal" ( <persName>Stevens</persName> 1990, 46). </p>
                    <p> Many more such references have been located in archives on both sides of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> . In our book, we explore
                        at length the likelihood that the 300 "Burgoyne medals" ( <persName>Clinton</persName> 1900, 2:781) given out at <placeName>Fort
                            Niagara</placeName> in December 1777 were of the Lion and Wolf design. Nonetheless, the first explicit mention of this medal we have
                        located is in a letter dated 4/7/1781 which lists: "50 large silver medals with the Kings bust, the Lion, Wolf, etc." (
                            <persName>Knox</persName> 1781). Our earliest citation for the <persName>George</persName> and <persName>Charlotte</persName> medal
                        occurs on an indent written in 1777 listing "70 silver medals, King and Queen's" ( <persName>Knox</persName> 1777). Thus, both
                            <persName>George-and-Charlotte</persName> and Lion-and-Wolf can be ascribed with certainty to the Period of the Revolutionary War.
                        Notwithstanding an extensive search of archives on both sides of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> , no earlier references to these or
                        any of the undated <persName>George III</persName> peace medals have been found. </p>
                    <p> After the Treaty of <placeName>Paris</placeName> in 1783, the British continued to award peace medals to Indians in the Great Lakes
                        region as well as to a few tribes west of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> . With the advent of the War of 1812, there was another
                        surge in issuance culminating with the new, dated design in 1814. As our census (see below) would suggest, there were half as many of
                        the 1814 medals distributed in a few years as there were undated medals awarded over a few decades. By the year 1815, the <pb n="11"/>
                        demand was pretty well saturated: "Formerly a chief would have parted with his life rather than his medal. Now very few think it worth
                        preserving" ( <persName>Bulger</persName> 1815, 13:114). </p>

                    <p>
                        <persName>George III</persName> medals got off to a very slow start in <placeName>U.S.</placeName> numismatics. Early commentators
                        thought them rarer than the French counterparts. Indeed, the Bushnell Collection, one of the great treasure troves of
                            <placeName>Americana</placeName> , contained but a single example. </p>
                    <p> The cause of the initial scarcity of <persName>George III</persName> medals is eminently logical: having fought on the side of the
                        British in the Revolutionary War, most of the recipients chose to relocate in <placeName>Canada</placeName> . Thus, it wasn't until
                        important Canadian collections came on the market that the supply began to improve. The <persName>Gerald Hart sale</persName> in 1888
                        contained four specimens; the <persName>Hunter</persName> (1920) and <persName>W.W. C. Wilson</persName> (1925) collections contained
                        many more. </p>
                    <p> In point of fact, thousands of the <persName>George III</persName> medals were made—perhaps tens of thousands. We list several hundred
                        in the condition census in our book. With specimens residing among Indians and in small institutions across
                            <placeName>Canada</placeName> , we are confident that more examples will be available to numismatists as time wears on. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Jamieson</persName> (1936) lists a number of die varieties of the <persName>George III</persName> medals of which two are
                        duplicates. All in all, his was a good first effort but we will describe a number of additional die varieties in our book. So numerous
                        are the dies that one could infer from their number alone a total emission of 60,000 to 100,000 pieces. This estimate is almost
                        certainly high; two other approaches described in our book yield estimates ranging between 5000 and 15,000. </p>
                    <p> The large medals were manufactured by one of three processes: </p>
                    <list rend="numbered">
                        <item n="1)"> Some were struck on planchets cut to size, using a collar; </item>
                        <item n="2)">Some were struck as shells and then joined;</item>
                        <item n="3)"> Some were struck on very thin planchets, with a thick rim added around the circumference to support a hanger. </item>
                    </list>
                    <p> In the absence of mint records, one can only speculate as to why three methods of manufacture were employed. It seems logical to
                        hypothesize that methods #2 and #3 were used to save money: Method #1 consumed more than twice the silver required for #2 and for #3.
                        Data on weight, diameter, styles of hanger and other such features are now being gathered. </p>

                    <p> As a check on relative rarity, as well as to minimize duplication, we have designed our census in two parts. The first includes
                        collections, auction appearances, and fixed price lists from 1860 to 1975. The second or modern census extends from 1975 to present day.
                        As can be seen from Table 1, the two censuses reveal quite similar results. Thus one can be tolerably confident that the large undated
                        medals of <persName>George III</persName> are the most common, followed by the large 1814s, Lion-and-Wolf and
                            <persName>George-and-Charlotte</persName> in that order. The small undated medal of <persName>George III</persName> is by far the
                        rarest of the group, which gives rise to our theory that the obverse die broke early in its life, leading to the substitution of
                            <persName>George-and-Charlotte</persName> . </p>

                    <p> If the medium-sized medals were issued to warrior chiefs and the small ones to ordinary warriors, one or both must have been made in
                        much greater quantities than the large designs intended for the political chiefs or sachems. One explanation for the lower survival rate
                        is alcohol: Indians were all too easily addicted to spirits and, given the silver content, medals must have been a fungible source of
                        payment. At formal councils with the white men, chiefs made frequent complaints about the volume of rum dispensed by the traders but
                        only a handful of tribes were successful in barring the substance from their dominions. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Inasmuch</persName> as chiefs drank at least as copiously as warriors, the higher survival rate of the large medals can
                        probably be attributed to inherent political value. Within the Indian community, chiefs' medals were a confirmation of authority.
                        Outside the community, chiefs were expected to <pb n="13"/> wear their medals as symbols of loyalty to the Great White Fathers. </p>
                    <p> Whereas our census captures relative rarity, the total population now extant can only be guessed. The several hundred examples listed in
                        our book could be relatively complete. More likely, in our opinion, is that another one to three times as many await re-discovery. Only
                        time will tell. Whatever the ultimate census may show, it is clear that the population of <persName>George III</persName> medals is
                        greater than generally thought. The good news is that they are sufficiently available to be an eminently collectable item. </p>

                    </head>
                    <p> The generals of <persName>George III</persName> regarded native Americans as idle, drunken and undependable. For their part, the Indians
                        regarded the British as grasping and deceitful. Both sides had their points. </p>
                    <p> From an historical perspective, the medals of <persName>George III</persName> serve to sift through conflicting opinions and create a
                        demonstrable fact: the British policy toward Indians was entirely self-serving. When, as was the case in the 1760s, the government
                        placed a low value on the good will of the North American natives, the medals issued to them were small and/or of crude workmanship.
                        When, with the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the services of the Indians became indispensable, the medals got bigger and better. </p>
                    <p> Be it said that the medals of <persName>George III</persName> do more than enshrine the hypocrisy of His Majesty's government. They
                        recall the enlightened Superintendency of Sir <persName>William Johnson</persName> . They mark the ebb and flow of events from the
                        triumph at <placeName>Montreal</placeName> in 1759, to the disasters of <persName>Pontiac's revolt</persName> , to the attempt to create
                        a permanent boundary at the Treaty of <persName>Fort Stanwix</persName> in 1768. With the Revolutionary War, the issue of medals reached
                        a crescendo, commemorating the early battles for <placeName>Montreal</placeName> , Burgoyne's disastrous campaign, the border wars of
                            <placeName>New York</placeName> and formal alliances in the West. Medal-giving reached another, smaller, peak during the War of
                        1812. Indians played prominent roles at <persName>Detroit, Chrysler's Farm</persName> and <persName>Chateaugay</persName> . </p>
                    <p> Without denigrating the peace medals issued by our own government, we note that the medals of <persName>George III</persName> mark a
                        period when the Indians were still a force on the scene. These medals mark the last period during which Indians played at center stage.
                        They recall the independence, the bravery and the cunning of proud cultures that were soon subsumed by the tide of events. </p>

                <p> Artist and die engraver <persName>Moritz Fürst</persName> was 26 years old when he came to <placeName>America</placeName> from
                        <placeName>Europe</placeName> in late 1807. Between 1807 and about 1840, when he returned to <placeName>Europe</placeName> , he
                    hand-engraved the dies for numerous Congressional award medals for the War of 1812 as well as presidential portrait dies for 12 different
                    Indian Peace Medals. He also made a large number of medal dies as private and institutional commissions and, apparently, as speculative
                    ventures. The medals from these dies preserve a remarkable collection of portraits, allegorical representations, historical scenes, and
                    other iconography of early nineteenth century <placeName>America</placeName> . </p>
                <p> Inexplicably, <persName>Fürst</persName> has received scant attention from numismatists. Although many of his medals have been described in
                    various publications, notably the compilations of American medals by <persName>Loubat</persName> (1878) and <persName>Julian</persName>
                    (1977), the only attempt to catalogue <persName>Fürst's</persName> American medals specifically was by <persName>Chamberlain</persName>
                    (1954b) more than 40 years ago. A great deal has been learned since <persName>Chamberlain's</persName> pioneering study, but the findings
                    have not been collected and organized, and some of <persName>Fürst's</persName> medallic work remains unpublished or unrecognized. Moreover,
                        <persName>Fürst</persName> himself remains a shadowy figure, with many questions surrounding his professional and personal life. </p>
                <p> In this paper I examine <persName>Fürst's</persName> career and present an updated compilation and discussion of his American medals. Both a
                    census of <persName>Fürst's</persName> medal dies in tabular form and an illustrated catalogue of medals from the dies are included, and
                    appear in an appendix. The die census is useful for analysis because many of <persName>Fürst's</persName> dies were paired with more than
                    one of his other dies, with dies of other makers, or used without mate dies. In addition, it is the dies rather than the medals that measure
                        <persName>Fürst's</persName> output and provide a framework for understanding his engraving career. </p>

                    <p>
                        <persName>Fürst</persName> was born to <persName>Jewish</persName> parents in the town of Boesing, near <placeName>Pressburg</placeName>
                        , <placeName>Hungary</placeName> (now <placeName>Bratislava</placeName> , <placeName>Slovak</placeName> Republic) in March 1782 (
                            <persName>Dunlap</persName> 1834, 221). Little is known about his early years. His training took place in
                            <placeName>Vienna</placeName> , then about a two-day journey from <placeName>Pressburg</placeName> . There,
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> relates ( <persName>Dunlap</persName> 1834, 221), he studied die sinking under <persName>Johann N.
                            Wirt</persName> , the engraver at the <placeName>Vienna</placeName> Mint. Wirt directed an Academy of Engraving (
                            <persName>Forrer</persName> 1904, 6:567), and <persName>Fürst presumably</persName> was a student there. <ref target="#fig-6">Figure
                            1</ref> presents an example of Wirt's medallic work. Later, <persName>Fürst</persName> studied under an engraver named
                            <persName>Megole</persName> , who superintended <pb n="19"/> the mint in <placeName>Lombardy, Italy</placeName> (
                            <persName>Dunlap</persName> 1834, 221). <persName>Megole</persName> had earlier been in <placeName>Vienna</placeName> , perhaps also
                        as Wirt's student, and it is likely that he met <persName>Fürst</persName> there. While working in <placeName>Italy</placeName> ,
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> made the acquaintance of <persName>Thomas Appleton</persName> , the American Consul in
                            <placeName>Livorno</placeName> . </p>

                                <placeName>Vienna</placeName> , probably at Wirt's Academy of Engraving. The medal honors the erection of a monument to
                                <persName>Joseph II</persName> in 1806, and features a bust of <persName>Francis II</persName> on the obverse. </p>

                    <p> A pamphlet published by <persName>Fürst</persName> , or on his behalf, in about 1825 (Proceedings n.d.) outlined the artist's version of
                        his intercourse with <placeName>Appleton</placeName> . <persName>Fürst</persName> engraved seals for the Consul, whereupon
                            <placeName>Appleton</placeName> requested a meeting with the engraver through <persName>Francis Wittenberg</persName> , who acted as
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> business agent. The pamphlet describes <placeName>Appleton</placeName> , after some discussion of
                        coinage designs, explicitly offering <persName>Fürst</persName> a position as engraver at the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Mint with an
                        annual salary of $2,000. The offer was later attested by <placeName>Wittenberg</placeName> , whose notarized statement to that effect
                        appears in the pamphlet. <persName>Fürst</persName> recounts that he accepted the offer and sailed with
                            <placeName>Wittenberg</placeName> to <placeName>New York</placeName> , arriving in September 1807 (Proceedings n.d.). </p>
                    <p> As represented in the pamphlet, <placeName>Appleton's</placeName> offer is difficult to reconcile with events that followed. It seems
                        unlikely that <placeName>Appleton</placeName> had authority to engage an engraver for the Mint, particularly at a salary of $2,000; by
                        the time <persName>Fürst</persName> arrived in <placeName>America</placeName> , the German-born engraver John Reich had been hired, at a
                        salary of $600, to assist Mint engraver <persName>Robert Scot</persName> . <persName>Fürst</persName> eventually met with Mint Director
                            <persName>Robert Patterson</persName> , Chief Coiner <persName>Henry Voigt</persName> , and <persName>Reich</persName> (Proceedings
                        n.d.). However, <persName>Patterson</persName> apparently did not offer him the position he expected. </p>
                    <p> Although we do not know what transpired in his meeting with <pb n="20"/> Patterson, it is clear that <persName>Fürst</persName> believed
                        that he would eventually obtain the promised appointment (Proceedings n.d.). <ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> He took up residence in
                            <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> and started engraving dies and seals ( <persName>Chamberlain</persName> 1954a, 590).
                        Unfortunately, a <placeName>U.S.</placeName> embargo in response to British and French trade policies caused a depression beginning in
                        1808. Economic disruption, social unrest, and even threats of civil war ( <persName>Hickey</persName> 1989) marked
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> early years in <placeName>America</placeName> . In 1812, the year <persName>Fürst</persName> turned 30,
                        friction between the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> and <placeName>Britain</placeName> led to war and the British Navy was soon threatening
                        American coastal cities, including <persName>Fürst's</persName> adopted home of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> . In 1814 panic
                        swept the country when the British succeeded in burning <placeName>Washington</placeName> ( <persName>Lord</persName> 1972, 215).
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> can hardly have prospered during this turmoil. Ultimately, however, it was the War of 1812 that
                        catapulted <persName>Fürst</persName> to prominence as a die engraver. </p>
                    <p> Congress voted some 27 medals to Army and Navy commanders during and following the war. By 1814 the Navy had begun to procure medals
                        mandated for its officers. <persName>Reich</persName> was contracted for the work, but he completed only four dies (for two medals) by
                        1817, a clear indication that he would be unable to complete all of the needed dies ( <persName>Julian</persName> 1977, 147). This led
                        the Navy to contract with <persName>Fürst</persName> to cut dies for the medal to Captain <persName>William Bainbridge</persName> .
                        Meanwhile, <persName>Reich's</persName> eyesight deteriorated sufficiently to affect his work ( <persName>Witham</persName> 1993, 18,
                        19); his portrait die for Captain <persName>Stephen Decatur</persName> was not accepted by the Navy. <persName>Fürst</persName> was
                        contracted to make a new portrait die and also made a new reverse after <persName>Reich's</persName> shattered while being hardened.
                        After completing the Bainbridge and Decatur dies, <persName>Fürst</persName> wrote Navy Secretary Crowninshield asking that the Navy
                        "make a regular contract with me for the other medals which remain to be executed" ( <persName>Witham</persName> 1993, 18). Whether or
                        not he obtained such a comprehensive contract, <persName>Fürst</persName> ultimately did all the remaining medal dies for the Navy
                        awards and then did all the dies for the Army awards. Creditable workmanship and the unavailability of <persName>Reich</persName> made
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> the artist of choice for official medals. In 1817, in addition to working on the War of 1812 awards,
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> engraved the Indian Peace Medal portraits of President <persName>James Monroe</persName> . He later did
                        the Indian Peace Medal portraits for all the presidents through <persName>Van Buren</persName> . </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Reich's</persName> disability caused Mint Director <persName>Robert Patterson</persName> to seek another assistant for Mint
                        engraver <persName>Scot</persName> . An offer was made to <persName>Christian Gobrecht</persName> , which <persName>Gobrecht</persName>
                        refused ( <persName>Taxay</persName> 1983, 109). Curiously, there is no evidence that <persName>Patterson</persName> gave any
                        consideration to <pb n="21"/>
                        <persName>Fürst</persName> , who continued to make medal dies under contract to the War and Navy Departments. Perhaps these contractual
                        obligations were too heavy to allow <persName>Fürst</persName> to work at the Mint; he had then only begun work on the dies for the War
                        of 1812 medals, a project that would occupy him for some years. I believe it likely that <persName>Fürst</persName> also was not
                        interested in the assistant's position at the smaller salary. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Scot</persName> died in late 1823. <persName>Fürst</persName> clearly believed that he was rightfully
                            <persName>Scot's</persName> successor, but seems to have realized that he faced competition for the post. I have elsewhere suggested
                        ( <persName>Neuzil</persName> 1991, 140) that <persName>Fürst</persName> engraved the dies for the <persName>Monroe</persName>
                        presidential medal (medal 44 in the appendix) in an effort to promote himself for the engraver's position he had sought for so long.
                        However, <persName>William Kneass</persName> was appointed the Mint's new engraver based on the recommendation of his personal friend,
                        Chief Coiner <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> ( <persName>Taxay</persName> 1983, 109). Compounding the injury to
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> , <persName>Kneass's</persName> appointment roughly coincided with the end of
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> lucrative contracts for War of 1812 medal dies, which were essentially completed the following year.
                        The fact that <persName>Fürst</persName> did not obtain the appointment as Mint engraver evidently incited him to petition the
                        Congressional Committee on Claims for compensation. Asserting that he had been promised the position of Mint engraver before his arrival
                        in 1807, <persName>Fürst</persName> asked the Committee for back pay (Proceedings n.d.). He explained the filing of his grievance 15
                        years after the fact by claiming unfamiliarity with American law and custom although in reality he may have been mollified by the income
                        he enjoyed from the War of 1812 contracts. The petition was rejected, allegedly because no written record existed of
                            <persName>Appleton's</persName> original offer (Proceedings n.d.). </p>
                    <p> In 1835 <persName>Kneass</persName> suffered a stroke. <persName>Gobrecht</persName> this time accepted the assistant's position (
                            <persName>Taxay</persName> 1983, 171), and when <persName>Kneass</persName> died in 1840, assumed the mantle of engraver. Probably
                        seeing himself in direct competition with <persName>Fürst</persName> , Gobrecht had actively promoted himself for the engraver's
                        position ( <persName>Breen</persName> 1988, 433). <persName>Fürst</persName> , by then in his late fifties, returned to
                            <placeName>Europe</placeName> . </p>
                    <p> Although <persName>Gobrecht's</persName> appointment probably was the immediate reason for <persName>Fürst's</persName> return to
                            <placeName>Europe</placeName> , other factors probably contributed to his decision to leave. <persName>Fürst's</persName> government
                        contracts had dwindled to the point that his official work was limited to the infrequent Indian Peace Medal dies for new presidents.
                        Even the income from these infrequent contracts was at risk. The nature of medal making and the role of medals themselves were changing
                        fundamentally in the late 1830s. The <pb n="22"/> Contamin portrait lathe, purchased by the Mint in 1836, could mechanically reduce
                        bas-relief models to make dies ( <persName>Taxay</persName> 1983, 150). The new process was much less expensive than hand-engraving, and
                        threatened to make die engraving by hand obsolete. <ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> Presaging an even more fundamental change, photography
                        was becoming practical ( <persName>Dibner</persName> 1967, 461) and promised an alternative to medallic and other forms of miniature
                        portraiture. <persName>Fürst</persName> would certainly have seen these changes as threats to his livelihood. </p>
                    <p> Perhaps the Old World offered <persName>Fürst</persName> some respite from the forward march of technology. Following his return to
                            <placeName>Europe</placeName> , <persName>Fürst</persName> continued to hand-engrave medal dies for some years.
                            <persName>Forrer</persName> (1904, 7:333) lists a medallist under the name " <persName>Fürst</persName> " who was active in
                            <placeName>Munich, Germany</placeName> , from 1841 to 1847. We can surmise that this was <persName>Moritz Fürst</persName> because
                        of a <placeName>German</placeName> medal dated 1841 and signed with the same letter punches <persName>Fürst</persName> used in
                            <placeName>America</placeName> ( <ref target="#fig-7">Figure 2</ref> ). <persName>Forrer's</persName> listing implies that
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> engraved dies until about the age of 65. Nothing more is known of this phase of
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> life. </p>

                    </head>
                    <p> A die census presented in the appendix (Table 2) reveals that <persName>Fürst</persName> made more American medal dies than previously
                        realized. Slightly over 100 dies can be identified that are attributable to <persName>Fürst</persName> while he was in
                            <placeName>America</placeName> . However, as discussed in the appendix, it is quite likely that the actual total is larger, perhaps
                        113 or even more. </p>
                    <p> When the date of completion of a die is known or can be reasonably constrained, it has been noted in Table 2 (
                            <persName>Julian</persName> (1977) and other <pb n="23"/> authorities noted in Table 2 are the source of most of the dates). The
                        availability of dates for most of the dies presents the possibility of examining <persName>Fürst's</persName> die-making activity in a
                        quantitative fashion. Using the information in Table 2, I have plotted by year the number of dies <persName>Fürst</persName> produced in
                            <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> . This plot shows 97 dies; it does not include seven for which the dates of completion are very
                        uncertain, nor does it include any of several unverified dies from Table 2. When interpreting the plot, one should bear in mind that
                        some of the completion dates are somewhat uncertain. </p>

                        <p> Fig. 3. Plot showing the number of medal dies <persName>Fürst</persName> produced, by year. The plot breaks down
                                <persName>Fürst's</persName> production into official (US and PA) and unofficial (IO) dies (see the Appendix for a fuller
                            explanation of these categories and identification of the dies). Replacement dies for US-24, 40, 50, and 54 are included in the
                            plot, but dies IO-2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 27, and 30 are not included because of uncertain completion dates. Where a range of years is
                            given in Table 2, the latest date was used, except for dies US-43, 47, 54, and 60 for which the earliest date was used. </p>

                    <p>
                        <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> shows that <persName>Fürst's</persName> die-making fluctuated dramatically, with most of the
                        activity after 1816 and before 1823. It was during these middle years that he executed dies for the Navy and Army awards of the War of
                        1812 (denoted as US and PA dies in <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> and Table 2). The Navy awards were his dominant activity from
                        1817 through 1820. The Army awards, nearly all of which were done during 1821 through <pb n="24"/> 1824, account for the second
                        prominent peak in 1822. The plot implies that in 1817 he made 17 dies (including replacements of three dies that broke during
                        hardening), an average of one die every three weeks. The year 1822 is shown being nearly as busy, with 15 dies (counting one replacement
                        die). <ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> Between the beginning of 1817 and the end of 1824 the count is at least 58 dies (including
                        replacements), an average of more than 7 dies per year. This eight-year stretch, roughly one fourth of <persName>Fürst's</persName> time
                        in <placeName>America</placeName> , accounts for over half of <persName>Fürst's</persName> known output of medal dies. In contrast, the
                        years before 1817 and after 1825 are distinguished by both lower overall rates of die production and production of most of
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> unofficial or nongovernment dies (denoted as IO in <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> and Table 2). </p>
                    <p> Payments cited by <persName>Julian</persName> (1977) suggest that <persName>Fürst</persName> typically received between $300 and $400
                        per die. The amount varied according to the difficulty of the die and other expenses involved. Interestingly, <persName>Fürst</persName>
                        asked more for battle scenes than for portraits, presumably reflecting the engraving time required. Probably included in the fees were
                        the cost of materials, polishing the dies after hardening (Proceedings n.d.) and, in some cases, travel in order to make portrait
                        sketches. Assuming that <persName>Fürst</persName> completed about 100 dies that actually provided income, <ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
                        his fees from this activity were in the neighborhood of $35,000 over about 33 years, or close to an average of $1,000 per year. During
                        1817 through 1824, the busy middle years of his career, <persName>Fürst's</persName> annual fees from diemaking averaged, by this
                        analysis, between $2,000 and $3,000. By comparison, <persName>Reich's</persName> average annual income from 1800 to 1817 is estimated to
                        have been about $700 ( <persName>Witham</persName> 1993, 46). <ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
                    </p>
                    <p> Reliable data on wages and income are sparse for this period, but it appears that in 1830 wages to laborers were about $0.75 to $1.00
                        per day while craftsmen and land-owning farmers had incomes of about $1.00 to $1.50 per day ( <persName>Larkin</persName> 1979, 2;
                            <persName>Kuiken</persName> 1997). <persName>Fürst's</persName> income from a single die thus exceeded a laborer's earnings for a
                        year, and his average annual income between 1817 and 1824 was nearly ten times that amount. <persName>Fürst</persName> also had income,
                        which may have been significant, from other activities (see next section). All told, he enjoyed a rather substantial, although unsteady,
                        income. However, even during his most active years, <persName>Fürst</persName> reportedly lived beyond his means. Referring to the
                        period 1821-23, <persName>Julian</persName> (1977, 112) states that <persName>Fürst</persName> "apparently spent his funds far faster
                        than they were received, thus fitting the classical mold of the impoverished artist. He was, nearly always, deeply in debt." The loss of
                        the income from the War of 1812 dies, beginning in 1825, <pb n="25"/> must have been financially devastating to
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> after eight years of relatively high income. This was undoubtedly the impetus behind
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> petition to the Committee on Claims and publication of the pamphlet detailing the claim (Proceedings
                        n.d.) after it was rejected. </p>

                    <p>
                        <persName>Chamberlain</persName> (1954a, 590) and <persName>Albert</persName> (1974) have reported that <persName>Fürst</persName>
                        engraved seals and at least one die for uniform buttons. However, the fact that <persName>Fürst</persName> also engraved dies for
                        decorative embellishments on silverware is largely unrecognized by numismatists. At the turn of the eighteenth century, the making of
                        silverware was evolving toward increasing mechanization, allowing cheaper and more rapid fabrication ( <persName>Plaut</persName> n.d.,
                        7). Before this, <persName>silversmiths</persName> cast or engraved the ornamentation for silverware. Die-struck embellishments were
                        easier to produce in quantity and often more elaborate and expressive than engraved or cast ornamentation. This presented opportunities
                        for die-sinkers like <persName>Fürst</persName> to make and sell die-struck ornamentation or dies themselves to makers of silverware. </p>
                    <p> I have identified five dies by <persName>Fürst</persName> that were used for making decorative embellishments, all made before 1817.
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> probably did not make decorative dies and similar items after he became busy with the War of 1812 dies in
                        1817. Whether he made decorative dies after 1824, when he had largely completed the War of 1812 contracts, is not known. It is also
                        unclear whether <persName>Fürst</persName> sold the decorative dies themselves, or sold the embellishments that he made from them. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Fürst's</persName> known decorative dies are of two types. The simplest was a cylinder die with a repeating grapevine pattern
                        that produced a decorative silver strip. <persName>Fürst</persName> signed the die, and his signature appears about every 15.7 cm along
                        the strip ( <persName>Skerry</persName> 1986), indicating that the cylinder had a diameter of approximately 5 cm. Decorative silver
                        strips from this signed die were incorporated into a tea service now at the Yale Museum of Decorative Arts in <placeName>New Haven,
                            Connecticut</placeName> ( <ref target="#fig-9">Figure 4</ref> ) and a ewer now at the <placeName>Winterthur</placeName> Museum in
                            <placeName>Wilmington, Delaware</placeName> . These pieces have been dated to between 1810 and 1817 (Yale University Art Gallery
                        1984). Decorative strips from the same die also appear on a silver tea service dated to circa 1835 ( <persName>Christie's</persName>
                        1988, 40). </p>
                    <p> Decorative dies of the second type were used to impress designs on square silver panels or sheets. The panels were applied to flat
                        surfaces on silverware. <persName>Fürst</persName> cut at least four such dies, comprised of two different <pb n="26"/> compositions in
                        large (56 by 56 mm) and small (34 by 34 mm) versions. One design features <persName>Zeus</persName> as an eagle tended by his daughter
                            <persName>Hebe</persName> ( <ref target="#fig-10">Figure 5</ref> ) and the other is a classically-garbed female leaning on a rock.
                        Panels struck from these dies were used to decorate a silver tea service ( <ref target="#fig-11">Figure 6</ref> ), made in
                            <placeName>New York</placeName> about 1810 ( <persName>Southeby's</persName> 1985), that is now in a private collection. The panels
                        are not fastened, but slide into slots on the sides of the pieces. </p>

                    <p> Because the decorative dies carry classical or purely decorative motifs, they cannot clearly be assigned an American origin. The
                        embellishments first appear on American silverware dated between 1810 and 1817, and it is possible that <persName>Fürst</persName> cut
                        the dies before coming to <placeName>America</placeName> . However, I believe it likely that <persName>Fürst</persName> made the dies
                        after coming to <placeName>America</placeName> , and probably while establishing his engraving business in

                    <p> Other decorative dies by <persName>Fürst</persName> may exist. <persName>Chamberlain</persName> (1954a, 592) reports that
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> made presentation swords under contract to the State of <placeName>New York</placeName> for several War
                        of 1812 commanders. <persName>Fürst</persName> may have engraved dies to produce decorative elements for these swords and their
                        scabbards. </p>

                    <p> The allegorical and classical figures on <persName>Fürst's</persName> medals and embellishments suggest that he could have made
                        significant contributions to the nation's coinage, which used classical figures as embodiments of <persName>liberty</persName> .
                        Although <persName>Fürst</persName> never got the chance to design coins as a Mint engraver, it is possible that he did at least
                        influence <placeName>U.S.</placeName> coin design. <ref target="#fig-12">Figure 7</ref> , reproduced from <persName>Taxay</persName>

                            Sully</persName> for the new seated <persName>Liberty</persName> coinage. These sketches, dating to 1835, clearly borrow <pb n="28"
                        /> from many earlier coins, including English and pre-Federal American issues that feature seated goddesses or allegorical female
                        figures. For example, the late eighteenth-century coppers of <placeName>Vermont</placeName> and <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>
                        crudely portray a seated female figure with a shield and liberty cap on a pole. However, the most direct and immediate precedent for the
                        sketches appears to be a medal by <persName>Fürst</persName> . <ref target="#fig-13">Figure 8</ref> shows an American Institute medal
                        from a die (IO-25 in Table 2) made by <persName>Fürst</persName> in about 1830 ( <persName>Harkness</persName> 1989, 128), some five
                        years before the designs in <ref target="#fig-12">Figure 7</ref> . <persName>Fürst's</persName> composition features a seated,
                        classically-garbed female holding a liberty cap on a pole and supporting a shield, all of which are major elements in the designs that
                        were ultimately adapted to make the new <placeName>U.S.</placeName> coinage. </p>

                        posed very much like that on <persName>Fürst's</persName> composition. The trade dollar ( <ref target="#fig-15">Figure 10</ref> )
                        features a seated Liberty holding a pole and liberty cap, with a distant sea before her and a plow and sheaf of wheat behind her. All of

                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> American Institute design proved quite popular. It was copied repeatedly (by

                        dies for the American Institute, appearing on medals until about the turn of the century ( <persName>Harkness</persName> 1989, 132). The
                        design also could be found in nineteenth century print advertisements and even on a hard-times token ( <ref target="#fig-16">Figure
                            11</ref> ), attesting to its wide popularity. </p>

                    </head>
                    <p> In terms of design, <persName>Fürst's</persName> medals are a mixed bag of his own and others' work. Most of his dies for War of 1812
                        Congressional awards copied portraits, battle scenes and allegorical scenes by graphic artists, both obscure and well known. Reverses
                        for many of the Army medals, for example, were designed by the painter <persName>Thomas Sully</persName> ( <persName>Julian</persName>
                        1977, 112). Other dies, most notably the Indian Peace Medal portraits, were composed as well as engraved by <persName>Fürst</persName> .
                        The presidential portraits on the Peace Medals are especially noteworthy and valuable as they were based on <persName>Fürst's</persName>
                        life studies of these men (see, for example, <persName>Prucha</persName> 1971, 101-103). </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Marvin Sadik</persName> , writing in 1977 as Director of the National Portrait Gallery ( <persName>Sadik</persName> 1977, 9),
                        described <persName>Fürst's</persName> contribution to American medallic art by referring to his "brilliant series of twenty six
                        [medals] for the military heroes of the War of 1812." He went on to state that: <q> [i] n the sustained excellence evident in the work
                            of <persName>Reich</persName> and <persName>Fürst</persName> , which forms another link in the great tradition established by
                                <persName>Pisanello</persName> , one sees a worthy continuation of the high standards set for American medallic art by the trio
                            of Frenchmen [ <persName>Duvivier, Dupre</persName> , and <persName>Gatteaux</persName> ] who produced our earliest medals. </q>
                    </p>
                    <p> A less enthusiastic evaluation was provided by <persName>Vermeule</persName> (1971, 39) in his book <hi rend="italic"> Numismatic Art in
                                <placeName>America</placeName> . </hi> Vermeule mentions <persName>Fürst</persName> once in passing, referring to the
                        "Napoleonic pictorialism and patriotic fussiness of <persName>Reich</persName> and <persName>Fürst</persName> ." </p>
                    <p> However one views <persName>Fürst's</persName> work, there is no denying that his prolific output of dies made him the leading figure in
                        American medallic art of the early nineteenth century. Medals from most of <persName>Fürst's</persName> dies, including all of the War
                        of 1812 and Indian Peace series, have been <pb n="31"/> restruck and avidly collected since the mid-nineteenth century. <ref
                            target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Many, in fact, continue to be periodically restruck from copy dies and sold by the
                            <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Mint as part of a series of "national" medals ( <persName>Failor</persName> and
                            <persName>Hayden</persName> 1972). His dominance of early nineteenth century medallic art in <placeName>America</placeName> has not
                        brought <persName>Fürst</persName> a corresponding level of recognition in American numismatic circles. I hope that the information
                        presented here will provide a framework for the fuller study that <persName>Fürst</persName> deserves. </p>

                <p> Ninety-two medal dies can be definitely attributed to <persName>Fürst</persName> during his American period, but a strong case can be made
                    that the actual number is over 100 and possibly as many as 113 or more. <ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> Uncertainty in the die count results
                    from problems of attribution and the likelihood that <persName>Fürst</persName> made some dies that are presently lost. Sixty-one different

                <p> This appendix presents both a tabulated census of the dies and an illustrated catalogue of medals from the dies. The compilation includes

                    <p> Table 2 tallies all American medal dies that can be attributed to <persName>Fürst</persName> . The tabulation is based on my own
                        observations as well as published and other authoritative sources as cited. The presentation of the dies is not chronological because
                        their exact sequence (as opposed to their year of completion) is poorly known. Rather, the dies are arranged in four broad generic
                        categories. First are dies done under contract to the <placeName>United States</placeName> (designated by <placeName>US</placeName>
                        -numbers), comprised of presidential portrait dies for the Indian Peace Medal series and Congressionally-mandated award medals for the
                        War of 1812. Indian Peace Medal dies and Army Congressional award dies were made under contract to the War Department whereas Navy
                        Congressional award dies were made under contract to the Navy Department. Second are dies for medals mandated by the
                            <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> legislature and made under contract to the Commonwealth of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>
                        (designated by <placeName>PA</placeName> ) as awards for the Battle of <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName> in the War of 1812. Listed third
                        are dies made for individuals, organizations, and as speculative ventures (designated by IO). Dies for individuals (such as IO-17 and
                        18) and organizations (such as IO-25 and 26) were private commissions. Other dies (such as IO-6 and 7) apparently were ventures intended
                        by <persName>Fürst</persName> for striking medals to be sold for profit. <ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> The fourth and last category in
                        Table 2 comprises dies whose existence is speculative (designated by UV, indicating "unverified"); these are dies for which there is
                        only indirect evidence (i.e. there is a written description, reference, <pb n="33"/> or such, but no known medal from the die or die

                        <hi rend="italic">Attribution</hi> . <persName>Fürst</persName> signed nearly all of the tabulated dies (generally using letter punches
                            <ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> ), leaving no question as to their authorship. <persName>Fürst</persName> indicated his authorship in
                        various ways, ranging from an explicit statement ( <persName>FURST</persName> DESIGNED AND SCULP, on die IO-5; see medal 44) to simply
                        his name ( <persName>FURST</persName> or <persName>FURST F.</persName> ) or, on some dies, only the initial F. Eight dies included in
                        Table 2 are unsigned (PA-3, 4, IO-1, 2, 24, 26, 27, 30). For most of these, I have relied on comparisons of engraving style or letter
                        punches to attribute them to <persName>Fürst</persName> . The exception is die IO-2 ( <persName>John Adams</persName> ; medal 42), which
                        is linked to <persName>Fürst</persName> anectdotally, as I describe in more detail below. Although attribution is never certain for
                        unsigned dies, there is little question that most of the unsigned dies in Table 2 were engraved by <persName>Fürst</persName> . Why
                        didn't <persName>Fürst</persName> sign them? Some dies, such as inscription die IO-24 (medal 55) and wreath dies IO-26, 27, 30 (medals
                        56 and 58), probably had too little space or were simple enough that <persName>Fürst</persName> declined to sign them. In the case of
                        other dies (PA-3,4, IO-1,2; medals 40, 41 and 42) the lack of a signature is perplexing. </p>
                    <p> The die memorializing <placeName>Washington</placeName> (IO-1; medal 41) is especially interesting with regard to the problem of
                        attribution. This unsigned die, almost certainly by <persName>Fürst</persName> , features a bust of <placeName>Washington</placeName> on
                        a pedestal flanked by figures representing an Indian and a classical female. It exhibits several strong stylistic links to
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> known dies. The modelling of the human figures, especially their musculature and feet, is quite
                        characteristic of <persName>Fürst's</persName> work. The stance of the Indian closely matches that of a figure on die US-20, the reverse
                        of the Congressional award to <persName>William Henry Harrison</persName> (medal 16), and the rendering of the tree branches on the
                        pedestal matches that on die IO-11, one of the reverses of the <persName>Benjamin Rush</persName> medals (see medal 47). Attribution of
                        this die to <persName>Fürst</persName> resolves a longstanding problem. <persName>Chamberlain</persName> (1954b, 937) noted that an art
                        exhibit in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in 1817 listed a medal of <placeName>Washington</placeName> by <persName>Fürst</persName>
                        and added that the medal was unknown to her. Apparently medal no. 41 (die IO-1) is the medal in question. </p>
                    <p> Die IO-2 (see medal 42), an unsigned portrait die of <persName>John Adams</persName> , is atypical of <persName>Fürst's</persName> work,
                        the bust being rather stiff and not particularly natural. Differences are apparent, for example, with <persName>Fürst's</persName> more
                            <pb n="34"/> lifelike portrayal of <persName>Adams's</persName> son, <persName>John Quincy Adams</persName> , on Indian Peace Medal
                        dies US-4, 5, 6 (medals 4, 5, 6). However, as <persName>Julian</persName> (1977, 31) notes, both <persName>Franklin Peale</persName> and
                            <persName>J.R. Snowden</persName> explicitly attributed the die to <persName>Fürst</persName> . Peale was the
                            <placeName>Mint's</placeName> Chief Coiner from 1839 to 1854 and <persName>Snowden</persName> was Director from 1853 to 1861. Peale
                        was associated with the <placeName>Mint</placeName> before 1839 and thus probably had first-hand knowledge of
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> work, lending credence to his attribution. Contrary evidence comes from an 1871 auction sale (
                            <persName>Bangs, Merwin</persName> 1871, 69) of the collection of <persName>William F. Packer</persName> , a former
                            <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> governor who died in 1870. The sale contained a <persName>John Adams</persName> medal (of the
                        correct diameter for IO-2) with the cataloguer's note: <q> I find the following memorandum in regard to this Medal in the handwriting of
                            the late Governor Packer: </q>
                        <q>
                            <hi rend="italic"> During the Presidency of the <persName>Elder Adams</persName> , the die for this medal was cut </hi> and
                            submitted to the government, but not accepted. The few Medals struck - some four or five in number - have remained in the possesion
                            of the artist's family until very recently. </q>
                    </p>
                    <p> The emphasis is mine. If the die was cut during the elder <persName>Adams's</persName> presidency, which ended in 1801, it could not
                        have been done by <persName>Fürst</persName> (but could have been done by <placeName>Mint</placeName> engraver <persName>Robert
                            Scot</persName> ). Thus, the attribution of die IO-2 to <persName>Fürst</persName> is uncertain. If <persName>Fürst</persName> did
                        engrave IO-2, the style must echo that of an earlier portrait, perhaps a painting, that served as the model. </p>
                    <p> A number of questions surround the dies for the naval award medals authorized by the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> legislature.
                        Two of the four dies apparently used to strike the original medals are unsigned. <persName>Fürst</persName> signed dies PA-1 and PA-2
                        (medal 39) but the unsigned dies PA-3 and PA-4 (medal 40) also appear to be his work. The unsigned portrait die of Captain
                            <persName>Oliver H. Perry</persName> (PA-3) is a matter of curiosity because it features a different rendering of
                            <persName>Perry</persName> than the signed die but carries the same legends in the same arrangement. It is very typical of
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> style. Likewise, the rendering of the boughs tied with a ribbon on PA-4 is quite reminiscent of the
                        design on die US-32, <persName>Fürst's</persName> signed reverse of the Congressional award to <persName>Winfield Scott</persName>
                        (medal 22). I believe that both of the unsigned dies (PA-3 and PA-4, medal 40) are by <persName>Fürst</persName> . </p>
                    <p> Unsigned dies IO-26, 27, and 30 are comprised of relatively simple wreath designs used as the reverses on award medals presented by the
                        American Institute and the Mechanics Institute (medals 56 and 58). The two organizations shared at least one reverse die (IO-27), which
                        is found paired with both obverse dies (IO-25 and IO-29). Die IO-26 is <pb n="35"/> apparently the earliest reverse and clearly seems to
                        be <persName>Fürst's</persName> work. The wreath of boughs tied with a bow is also quite similar to the wreath on the reverse of the
                            <persName>Winfield Scott</persName> medal (medal 22). IO-27 is a later die, but stylistically similar and probably also by
                            <persName>Fürst</persName> . The authorship of IO-30, a still later reverse die, is questionable. Unlike the oak leaves on IO-26 and
                        27, which were made with a punch, those on IO-30 are individually engraved. Die IO-30 is quite possibly the work of another engraver
                        copying <persName>Fürst's</persName> original design. </p>
                    <p> Problems of attribution extend to the provenance of the dies. My intent is to include only "American" medal dies in the tabulation, that
                        is, dies made by <persName>Fürst</persName> while he was in <placeName>America</placeName> . <persName>Fürst</persName> may have
                        engraved medal dies before coming to <placeName>America</placeName> and he certainly did so after returning to
                            <placeName>Europe</placeName> (see main text). In most cases the dies in Table 2 are clearly from his American period, but for a few
                        (dies IO-31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36) an American origin is disputable because foreign subjects or interests are represented. Inclusion of
                        these dies in Table 2 reflects the fact that they appear to date from <persName>Fürst's</persName> American period. They may represent
                        commissions from foreign interests, perhaps diplomatic or trade missions, that were in the <placeName>United States</placeName> at the
                        time. </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Intended Die Pairings.</hi> The intended pairing is firmly established for most of <persName>Fürst's</persName> dies,
                        and is indicated in Table 2. For example, although the dies for the Army medals of the War of 1812 were muled extensively at the
                            <placeName>Mint</placeName> during the latter half of the nineteenth century, the intended pairing for these dies is well documented
                        (even if it is not always self-evident). In a few instances, however, dies appear to have been muled so consistently that the mulings
                        have come to be accepted as the intended pairings. In other cases, it is not clear what the intended pairing was or, indeed, whether
                        mate dies ever existed. </p>
                    <p> The confusion surrounding the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Naval award dies (PA-1, 2, 3, 4; medals 39 and 40) extends to their
                        intended pairings. <persName>Julian</persName> (1977, 166) catalogues four medals representing all possible obversereverse combinations
                        of the two obverse with the two reverse dies. However, <persName>Julian</persName> also states that <persName>Fürst</persName> engraved
                        only one obverse and two reverse dies for the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> medals. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the
                        signed obverse die (PA-1; medal 39) is known only from two gold medals in institutional collections where it is paired with signed
                        reverse die PA-2: I know of no other confirmed pairings for PA-1 (including the pairing with PA-4 that Julian speculatively catalogues).
                            <placeName>The Pennsylvania</placeName> legislature authorized gold medals for Captain <persName>Perry</persName> , <pb n="36"/>
                        Master Commandant <persName>Elliot</persName> , and a Lieutenant <persName>John J. Yarnall</persName> , and silver medals of a distinct
                        design for <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> citizens who served in the enlisted ranks in the Battle of <placeName>Lake
                            Erie</placeName> ( <persName>Ayers</persName> 1972, 7). Perhaps the signed obverse was intended to be paired with both reverses for
                        the two different awards. If so, how does one explain the unsigned obverse? The signed obverse die may have failed or had to be retired
                        after a few uses, explaining the lack of restrikes from it and the need for a second portrait die. This hypothesis is supported by the
                        observation that the signed obverse was already buckled when <persName>Perry's</persName> gold medal was struck. Additional confusion
                        about die pairing probably arose because unsigned obverse die PA-3 was extensively paired with signed reverse die PA-2 by the
                            <placeName>Mint</placeName> to make restrikes in the late nineteenth century. </p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Fürst's</persName> unofficial die portraying President <persName corresp="#viaf_59096754">Madison</persName> (IO-3) has been extensively muled. This
                        die, paired with an unsigned reverse die, was used to strike medals (number 43) in the 1860s or earlier. <ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref>
                        This pairing is the only one known for IO-3 and has come to be accepted by many as the intended one. However, multiple lines of evidence
                        indicate that it is a mule. First, stylistic comparisons clearly indicate that the reverse die is not by <persName>Fürst</persName> .
                        Second, the legend within the wreath, which refers to political issues during the War of 1812, is incompatible with the surrounding
                        legend INDUSTRY BRINGS PLENTY. The design itself, which features agricultural implements, is at odds with the central inscription. <ref
                            target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Third, the reverse die was reduced from a larger diameter to one matching that of IO-3. The reduction is
                        apparent from the position of the eagle's wingtips, which extend through the border to the edge of the die ( <ref target="#fig-17"
                            >Figure A1</ref> ). Reduction is also indicated by prior cracking of the die below the word PLENTY, which caused that lettering to
                        be especially close to the new edge ( <ref target="#fig-17">Figure A1</ref> ). Finally, by the time known medals were struck, the
                        obverse die (IO-3) had been crudely lapped to conceal damage. The lapping obliterated part of <persName>Fürst's</persName> name on the
                        banner below the bust. All of these observations lead to the conclusion that the reverse die used with IO-3 was not its intended mate,
                        but was concocted to permit restriking the <persName corresp="#viaf_59096754">Madison</persName> portrait from an impaired die. The intended pairing for die IO-3
                        is thus unknown. </p>
                    <p> The <persName corresp="#viaf_95296943">John Adams</persName> "Indian Peace Medal" (medal no. 42, which uses unsigned portrait die IO-2) is also, strictly
                        speaking, a mule. It is not a true Indian Peace Medal because the <persName>Reich</persName> Peace and Friendship reverse was made in
                        1809 ( <persName>Julian</persName> 1977, 29), well after <persName>Adams</persName> held office. <placeName>Mint</placeName> Director
                            <persName>J. R. Snowden</persName> considered the <persName>John Adams</persName> portrait die to be a private commission and noted
                        the absence of a reverse <pb n="37"/> ( <persName>Prucha</persName> 1971, 137). The intended pairing is thus uncertain. </p>

                        <p> Fig. A1. Detail of reverse die used with <persName>Fürst's Madison</persName> portrait die (IO-3). As seen here, (1) the eagle's
                            wingtip extends through the border to the edge of the die and (2) the word PLENTY, with tangential cracks beneath it, is closer to
                            the edge than BRINGS. Both observations indicate that the die was once larger and was reduced to mate with IO-3. </p>
                    </figure>
                    <p> Two of <persName>Fürst's</persName> dies are known only from uniface medals. The dies portraying <persName>George</persName>
                        <placeName>Washington</placeName> (IO-1; medal 41) and <persName>Gershom Seixas</persName> (IO-19; medal 52) are not known to have been
                        paired with any die ( <persName>Stack's</persName> 1996, 40; <persName>Friedenberg</persName> 1990). It is possible that no mates were
                        ever made for these dies. This is implied for the <placeName>Washington</placeName> die by an entry in an 1817 art exhibit catalogue
                        (cited by <persName>Chamberlain</persName> 1954b, 937) that mentions the <placeName>Washington</placeName> portrait but does not mention
                        a reverse. </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Missing dies.</hi> Various lines of evidence suggest that I have not identified all of <persName>Fürst's</persName>
                        American medal dies. First, as shown by Figure 3 in the main text, relatively few dies are known from the early and late portions of
                            <persName>Fürst's</persName> American career; he had ample time to produce more dies than are now documented. Second, some of
                        Fürst's dies are known to us through only one, two, or a few medals. In particular, dies that <persName>Fürst</persName> made as
                        speculative ventures typically left few surviving medals. Apparently, if sufficient subscriptions were not obtained, a medal would not
                        be struck in large quantities, or not struck at all. This may explain the rarity of medals from the <placeName>Washington</placeName>
                        (IO-1; medal 41), <persName>Monroe</persName> (IO-4, 5; medal 44), and <persName>John Q. Adams</persName> inaugural (IO-6, 7; medal 45)
                        dies, and the lack of original strikings from the <persName>Madison</persName> (IO-3; medal 43) and <persName>Seixas</persName> (IO-19;
                        medal 52) dies. <ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> These medals <pb n="38"/> could easily have been lost to posterity and, by extension, it
                        would not be surprising if others have in fact been lost. Third, indirect evidence exists for several specific dies that are currently
                        unknown. Nine candidates for such missing dies are listed in Table 2 as "unverified" (UV). </p>
                    <p> The listings of UV-1 and 2 and UV-3 and 4 are prompted by exhibit catalogues of 1811 and 1829 cited by <persName>Chamberlain</persName>
                        (1954b, 937). The first refers to "a medal of <persName>William Penn</persName> ," which is unknown today. The second lists a "Cast of a
                        medal of President <persName>Andrew Jackson</persName> , on reverse the Battle of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> ." Unlike the
                        Congressional award to <persName>Jackson</persName> (dies US-21, 22; medal 17), which features an allegorical scene on the reverse, the
                        catalogue explicitly refers to a depiction of the battle. No such medal is known today. <ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> The word <hi
                            rend="italic">cast</hi> in the catalogue entry suggests a trial impression rather than a struck medal; perhaps no struck medals were
                        made. </p>
                    <p> The unverified die depicting Captain <persName>Jesse Elliot's</persName> capture of the British ships <hi rend="italic">Detroit</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> (UV-5) is listed based on an unusual piece of evidence. <persName>Chamberlain</persName> (1954b,
                        938) located and reproduced an early nineteenth century painting that appears to depict <hi rend="italic">two different gold</hi> medals
                        awarded to Captain <persName>Jesse Elliot</persName> ( <ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref> ). The obverse of the Congressional award
                        (die US-46) is shown together with its intended reverse depicting the Battle of <placeName>Lake Erie</placeName> (die US-56) to the left
                        and in the center of <ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref> . However, an undocumented reverse (die UV-5) is also shown, as seen on the
                        right in <ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref> . Reverse die UV-5 may have been mated with the regular portrait obverse for striking an
                        award medal for <persName>Elliot</persName> from the Commonwealth of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> . </p>
                    <p> I also considered mateless dies to be evidence for missing dies. The <persName>Madison</persName> obverse die (IO-3), which is known
                        only from mulings with an unrelated reverse die, is a good example. Did <persName>Fürst</persName> make a reverse die, now missing, to
                        pair with IO-3? I believe it likely because he cut an elaborate reverse die (IO-5) for a similar portrait die of
                            <persName>Monroe</persName> (IO-4; see medal 44). Dies that are now missing may also have served as reverses for the
                            <placeName>Washington</placeName> (IO-1), <persName>John Adams</persName> (IO-2), and <persName>Gershom Seixas</persName> (IO-19)
                        portrait dies, as indicated in Table 2. </p>

                    <p> Damage to the dies, when present, is noted under "Comments" in Table 2. Notes on damage are based on personal examination of many
                        medals. Table 2 reveals a surprising fact with respect to <persName>Fürst's</persName> official <pb n="39"/> (US and PA) dies: most of
                        the dies for the Navy awards exhibit some sort of damage, whereas few of the Army or Indian Peace Medal dies do. More than 60% (17/28)
                        of the Naval dies exhibit damage (or had to be replaced), whereas this is true of fewer than 10% of the Army dies (2/22) and the Indian
                        Peace Medal dies (1/12). The damage to the Naval dies is usually buckling and cracks. The buckling occurs as a "sinking" of the die that
                        causes it to become mildly concave and the field of the struck medal to be correspondingly convex. The sinking is generally uneven and
                        cracks are often located along the trace of maximum buckling. Other types of damage evident on the Naval dies include stray cracks and
                        indentations and even corrosion that may have occurred during acid "frosting" of the relief. <ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref>

                        <p> Fig. A2. Detail of contemporary painting by <persName>John A. Woodside</persName> that appears to depict two different gold medals

                    <p> Apparently, most of the damage occurred during the initial handling and hardening of the dies, rather than developing later in the die's
                        life (although the damage often worsened with use). This can be established because the Naval award dies were used in a very consistent
                        manner: first a single gold medal was struck for the honoree, and then a limited <pb n="40"/> number of silver medals were struck for
                        his officers ( <persName>Julian</persName> 1977, xxii; 3 gold medals were struck in the case of the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>
                        award to <persName>Perry</persName> ). Original gold and silver medals therefore display very early die states. In examining several
                        original gold and silver award medals from the Naval series, I have found that damage known from copper restrikes of the medals <hi
                            rend="italic"> generally is also present on the original gold and silver strikings. </hi> The gold medal presented to Captain
                            <persName>Oliver H. Perry</persName> by <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> and now in the collection of the
                            <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Naval Academy is an excellent example; this medal was presumably the first struck and shows that both
                        dies were strongly buckled. </p>
                    <p> Buckling and cracks occurred during hardening of the die ( <persName>Julian</persName> 1977, 152), which required heating and rapid
                        cooling by quenching in water ( <persName>Taxay</persName> 1983, 83; <persName>Landis</persName> , 1997). In several instances (US-24,
                        35, 49, 50, 52, 54), <persName>Julian</persName> cites contemporary documents that mention damage caused by hardening. Other types of
                        damage, such as stray indentations, were apparently due to careless handling before hardening. </p>
                    <p> Why did the Naval dies suffer more damage than the Army and the Peace Medal dies? They were the first large group of medal dies to be
                        delivered to the <placeName>Mint</placeName> for hardening and striking, and inexperience with such large dies may have led to problems.
                        Prior to the large influx of Naval War of 1812 dies, <placeName>Mint</placeName> personnel had worked mostly with small coinage dies.
                            <persName>Julian</persName> (1977, 113) reports that <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> , the <placeName>Mint's</placeName> Chief
                        Coiner, was often very slow to harden medal dies. Risk of damage to the dies may have caused <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> to adopt a
                        very deliberate approach to hardening. By the time the Army award dies and most of the Indian Peace medal dies were delivered to the
                            <placeName>Mint</placeName> , <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> had more experience with the quirks of large medal dies. It is also
                        conceivable that the War Department (which contracted for both the Army's War of 1812 dies and the Indian Peace Medal dies) procured
                        superior steel for its dies. </p>

                    <p> Medals from <persName>Fürst's</persName> dies are described and illustrated in the catalogue that follows. The arrangement corresponds,
                        as closely as possible, to the listing of dies in Table 2. Cross-references to <persName>Loubat</persName> (1878),
                            <persName>Julian</persName> (1977), <persName>Harkness</persName> (1989), <persName>Brown</persName> (1980), and
                            <persName>Eimer</persName> (1987) catalogue numbers are provided, while cross-references from <persName>Julian</persName> (1977)
                        numbers to the present catalogue numbers are provided in Table 1. </p>
                    <p> The die pairings represented here are generally the intended ones. However, in some cases (which are noted) the die pairing is the most
                        commonly encountered but not the intended one. Numerous mulings, particularly of the dies for Army Congressional awards, are known to
                        exist <ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> but are not listed. </p>
                    <p> All medals illustrated are from the original dies. Note that all of the official ( <placeName>US</placeName> and
                            <placeName>PA</placeName> ) dies as well as some of the unofficial (IO) dies have been copied and that early strikings from copy
                        dies are often confused with those from the original dies. The best diagnostics of original and copy dies are the style and placement of
                        the lettering. </p>

                                SEP. 17 is punched over AUG. 15. The same overpunches can be seen on medals to <persName>Miller</persName> (die US-26),
                                    <persName>Porter</persName> (US-28), and <persName>Scott</persName> (US-32). Evidently, there was confusion about the dates
                                of the Battles of <placeName>Chippewa</placeName> and <placeName>Fort Erie</placeName> . In the case of <placeName>Fort
                                    Erie</placeName> , there were two significant actions - one on August 15, 1814, in which Generals <persName>Edmund P.
                                    Gaines</persName> and <persName>Eleazer W. Ripley</persName> participated, and one on September 17, 1814, in which, in
                                addition to <persName>Ripley</persName> , Generals <persName>Brown</persName> , <persName>Miller</persName> ,
                                    <persName>Porter</persName> , and <persName>Scott</persName> participated ( <persName>Hickey</persName> , 1989). Apparently,
                                the earlier date was inadvertantly used for those in the later action and then corrected. These overpunches were described by
                                    <persName>Michael Hodder</persName> in the catalogue of the Dreyfus Sale by <persName>Bowers</persName> and

                        <p> Due to a late decision to include references to the battles at <persName>Fort Erie</persName> (see <persName>Julian</persName> 1977,

                            name) had to be ground down and the <placeName>Erie</placeName> inscription added. The result is that the reference to the battles
                            at <placeName>Erie</placeName> appears on a raised "step" on the struck medals and <persName>Fürst's</persName> signature is, unlike
                            on other medals in this series, above the ground line. In addition, careful examination reveals that NOVEMBER was punched into the

                            about an American victory: some of <persName>Shelby's</persName> militia, commanded by Congressman <persName>Richard M.
                                Johnson</persName> , rode into battle on horseback carrying their muskets. After breaking through the British line, they
                            dismounted and caught the British in a crossfire ( <persName>Hickey</persName> 1989, 137). On the medal, the mounted troops are
                            depicted advancing from the left, and are accurately shown carrying muskets rather than traditional cavalry sabers. </p>

                            Arts and Sciences to endow an award recognizing discoveries in light or heat. <persName>Rumford</persName> stipulated that each
                            award consist of a gold and a silver medal to have a combined intrinsic value of $300. Examination of an awarded silver medal (shown
                            in the photo) revealed it is stamped COPY on the edge, an apparent reference to duplication of the gold medal. Awarded in 1910, the

                        <p> This uncommon medal is found in silver, engraved with various award inscriptions. The busy obverse design was copied repeatedly on

                            also used for the Mechanics Instutute medals (see no. 58 below). The pairing with IO-30 listed here is speculative. </p>

                            elements. Wreath reverses IO-26, IO-27 and possibly IO-30 were used for the American Institute Instutute medal (no. 56 above). The

                                may lie in the change in Mint leadership in 1805. As early as 1801 the Mint's third Director, <persName>Elias

                                permission to hire <persName>Reich</persName> . In his letter, <persName>Patterson</persName> stated that engraver
                                    <persName>Robert Scot</persName> was "so far advanced in life, that he cannot very long be expected to continue in his
                                labors" ( <persName>Taxay</persName> 1983, 108). Perhaps <persName>Patterson</persName> planned on <persName>Scot's</persName>
                                retirement and asked <placeName>U.S.</placeName> officials, including <placeName>Appleton</placeName> , to help recruit a
                                replacement. In his meeting with <persName>Fürst</persName> , <persName>Patterson</persName> may have suggested that
                                    <persName>Scot's</persName> position would soon be available. If so, he greatly underestimated Scot's tenacity;
                                    <persName>Scot</persName> remained the Mint's engraver until his death 16 years later. </p>

                                of <persName>Van Buren</persName> had cost $1160 but that dies for President <persName>Tyler</persName> , if made using the

                            <p> The two prominent peaks that appear in Figure 3 may, to some extent, be artifacts of inaccuracy in die completion dates.
                                    <persName>Julian</persName> (1977, 112) asserts that <persName>Fürst</persName> worked more or less at full capacity on the
                                War of 1812 dies once he began work on the entire series in 1817. Some dies believed completed in 1817 may actually have been
                                completed in 1818, and some listed as completed in 1822 may fall in 1821. Even so, <persName>Fürst's</persName> maximum output
                                probably was still about 10 dies per year, substantially more than <persName>Reich</persName> was able to accomplish.
                                    <persName>Ron Landis</persName> of the Gallery Mint, who works today as a hand engraver of dies, believes an accomplished
                                engraver capable of hand-engraving more than 10 complex dies per year ( <persName>Landis</persName> 1997). </p>

                            <p> It is very likely that several dies made on speculation, that is, in hope of profiting from the sale of medals, brought
                                    <persName>Fürst</persName> little, if any, income. Examples include the <placeName>Washington</placeName> ,
                                    <persName>Monroe</persName> and <persName>Jackson</persName> dies (designated IO-l, 4 and 5 and UV-3 and 4 in Table 1). </p>

                            <p> In making this comparison it should be noted that the making of medal dies was distinct from <persName>Reich's</persName> Mint
                                duties (making coinage dies) and brought him additional income. Thus we find that the Navy Department paid
                                    <persName>Reich</persName> $800, or more than his annual Mint salary, for award medal dies for Captain <persName>Isaac
                                    Hull</persName> ( <persName>Julian</persName> 1977, 160). Income from both sources is reflected in
                                    <persName>Witham's</persName> (1993, 46) estimate. </p>

                            <p> Restrikes of <persName>Fürst's</persName> medals were in such demand in the late nineteenth century that the dies often were not
                                robust enough to make the number of medals (typically on the order of 100) needed to supply collectors of that era. Several
                                failed, requiring the Mint to make copy dies by mechanical means. Some of the copy dies made by <persName>Charles
                                    Barber</persName> carry both <persName>Fürst's</persName> name and the initials C.B. Others are much more deceptive, and the
                                medals from them are easily confused with those from the original dies. Lettering on the copy dies had to be repunched, and the
                                style and positioning of the lettering (including <persName>Fürst's</persName> name) allow the copy dies to be distinguished
                                from the originals. However, distinguishing between original and early copy dies requires experience, and because of this,
                                collectors should exercise caution. </p>

                            <p> Dies IO-6 and IO-7 were used to strike medals (medal 45) recognizing <persName>John Quincy Adams'</persName> inauguration; these

                                quotes a letter from <persName>Fürst</persName> to <persName>Adams</persName> offering silver examples of the medal at $10 each.

                                <persName>Charles McSorley</persName> (n.d.) has suggested that a small unsigned medal known to numismatists as a political
                                piece and catalogued as AJACK 1828-10 by <persName>DeWitt</persName> (1959, 26) may be <persName>Fürst's</persName> (i.e. struck
                                with UV-3 and 4); it features a portrait of <persName>Jackson</persName> and the Battle of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName> .
                                The portrait, which features <persName>Jackson</persName> in civilian attire, is reminiscent of that on the middle-size and
                                small Indian Peace Medals (dies US-8 and 9; medals 8 and 9). However, the engraving is much too crudely done to be the work of
                                    <persName>Fürst</persName> . An interesting possibility thereby presents itself: could this small medal be a copy of

                <p> Over the years many medal enthusiasts have had the occasion to come across what appear to be a country's orders or decorations but which,
                    finally, and after considerable frustration, turn out to be distinctions awarded by a fraternal order. <ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> They
                    are not the less collectable, but certainly are less identifiable than the issues of <placeName>sovereign states</placeName> . </p>

                    <p> The medals or jewels of the officers of a symbolic blue, or third degree lodge. </p>
                </figure>
                <p> The medals of secret <ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> and ritualistic <ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> organizations have never received the
                    attention in numismatic studies that the subject deserves ( <persName>Morris</persName> 1991; <persName>Anonymous</persName> 1991, 1;
                        <persName>Peterson</persName> 1993). Considering how widespread they are, involving all kinds of people and many countries, <ref
                        target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> numismatists might give more attention to this aspect of medal scholarship. <ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> There
                    are a bewildering number of these groups, ranging from those such as the Moose and Elks and Eagles whose animal names at least result in
                    visual clues for disciphering the medal's significance, to organizations like the Odd Fellows and the Orange Order whose symbols are
                    incomprehensible to the public and whose awards' significance defies easy interpretation. </p>
                <p> Undoubtedly the most widespread and perplexing source of fraternal medals is Freemasonry. The assistance in identification that the <pb
                        n="121"/> Masons themselves can provide is as spotty as the parson's egg. There are some excellent studies, albeit in somewhat obscure
                    publications, such as Anonymous 1997, Wheeler 1992, Wheeler 1996. But much awaits research. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> Freemasons in their own discussions often blur the distinctions between medals and other commemorative material such as identification pins
                    ( <persName>Cubbison</persName> , 90-91). The word "jewel" is used somewhat indiscriminately by them to describe Masonic items, and indeed
                    the principal study group for Masonic medals and associated objects is simply called <hi rend="italic">Jewels of the Craft.</hi> The problem
                    is compounded by the fact that few public or university libraries take seriously the collecting of material on the Masons, so the serious
                    researcher must get permission to use Masonic archives and libraries, which is sometimes difficult. A number of these date from the
                    nineteenth century and have large holdings not only of journals and books but of medals. An idea of what these libraries contain is
                    indicated by the classifications of the Library of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite in <persName>Washington</persName> , which dates
                    back to 1888 and even then had more than eight thousand volumes. There are sections for Masonry in more than seventy countries, and
                    categories include philosophy and symbolism, church and state, paraphernalia, glassware, benevolent and educational institutions, hospitals,
                    cemeteries, architecture, poetry and drama, humor and satire, and women in Masonry. <ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
                </p>
                <p> While other fraternal orders claim hoary parentages which are dubious, there is no question but that Masonry's origins are ancient. They are
                    also controversial ( <persName>Rich</persName> 1993, 45), partly because some Masons are fond of embroidering the society's quite long
                    history and extending its genealogy further back, to King <persName>Alfred</persName> or even <persName>Adam</persName> . </p>

                <p> While there do not appear to be any Masonic medals surviving from before the eighteenth century, there are metal objects in collections that
                    may have been used ritualistically from as early as the sixteenth century—such as tools embellished with engravings. </p>
                <p> Masonry was widespread in the eighteenth century and is not a nineteenth-century creation like so many of the fraternal orders. Therefore
                    its medals have an older and often considerable antiquarian interest. <ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> The celebrated Masonic scholar
                        <persName>Albert Mackey</persName> wrote in 1917 that, "the earliest Masonic medal of which we have an authentic account is that know as
                    the 'Freemason's ducat', which was struck at Brunswick in 1743. The number have since so greatly increased, that it would be impossible to
                    give even a catalogue of them. <ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> They are struck every year by lodges to commemorate some distinguished member
                    or some remarkable event" ( <persName>Mackey</persName> 1917, 560). </p>
                <p> By 1767, there are reports of a proliferation of medals that were worn around the neck by members on public feast days, at funerals and
                    other special events ( <persName>Mackey</persName> 1917, 560). Some of these early Masonic medals, both in the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> and <placeName>Europe</placeName> , are pierced or fretted along with a certain amount of engraving, and the
                    suggestion has been made that they were not created by specialist medal-makers but often by watchmakers: "...(they resemble) the watch
                    'cocks'—that is, the decorative plates, which in the old watches, carry the outer bearing of the balance-wheel. These cocks are pierced or
                    fretted and engraved, and although only as large as a six-pence, include as many masonic emblems as many of the jewels having six times
                    their area...The obvious suggestion is that many of the old masonic jewels of the type described were the work of watchmakers" (
                        <persName>Jones</persName> 1980, 468). The establishment of Masonic supply houses in the nineteenth century brought professionalism and
                    a degree of discipline to the field ( <persName>Anonymous</persName> 1994b, 22). </p>
                <p> The movement's medals vary according to the particular rite involved. <ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref> Any discussion of them must avoid the
                    supposition that Masonry is a cohesive movement. That is untrue even within countries, let alone between them. Probably it is more accurate
                    to speak of "Masonries" in the plural, for the differences are large and while in some places the Masons are conspiratorial and clandestine,
                    elsewhere they are benign and charitable: <q> Although Freemasonry is usually considered a singular phenomenon, it is actually a diverse and
                        wide-ranging complex of <pb n="125"/> many different orients; orders; directorates; societies; national, provincial, and grand lodges;
                        rites; and systems. At different times and different places Freemasonry can be politically revolutionary or reactionary, actively
                        involved in public affairs or in retreat from the world, rational or mystic. Some orders and lodges have fallen into obscurantism,
                        charlantry, and religious intolerance. Freemasonry has thrived in different forms in Catholic countries such as
                            <placeName>France</placeName> , <placeName>Italy</placeName> , and <placeName>Poland</placeName> , predominantly Protestant
                        countries like the <placeName>United States</placeName> , Orthodox countries like <placeName>Russia</placeName> , Islamic countries like
                            <placeName>Turkey</placeName> , and recently in <placeName>Israel</placeName> . (To this must be added the rapid revival of
                        Freemasonry underway in <placeName>Russia</placeName> and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.) Freemasons trace
                        their founding variously to the builders of Solomon's temples, the Knights Templars of the Crusades, and the craftsmen of medieval
                        English and European guilds ( <persName>Leighton</persName> 1994, 28). </q>
                </p>
                <p> Many Masonic rituals make specific reference to medals and orders, and quite often the ritual includes the confering of a medal on the
                    initiate or on a member who has achieved high office or served with dedication. In the first or Entered Apprentice degree, which every Mason
                    regardless of of ultimate rank must take, the candidate is told that membership as symbolized by the white apron is more of an honor than
                    the Garter or the Golden Fleece ( <persName>Robbins</persName> 1984, 64-66). In the celebrated third degree, the candidate receives a medal
                    as part of a charade in which he thinks he has finished the initiation ceremony, only to be brought back into the lodge for the real and
                    highly dramatic portion of the ritual. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> There are a variety of Masonic medals issued in large number for the various ceremonies, such as Mark Master degree tokens and pennies.
                    Since by the nineteenth century there were more than 1,000 different Masonic degrees or initiation ceremonies, it can be appreciated that
                    the number of medals or tokens used in one or another of these rituals becomes numerous. All of this hoodwinking and marching around strikes
                    the non-member as strange and it may indeed seem "obviously hokey" when "once in so often you march around your lodge room in the wake of
                    the Grand Exalter of the Holy Mackerel and absorb a certain luster from the glittering insignia..." but that was hardly the view of the
                    members, who as the Victorian age lengthened displayed an enormous appetite for ever more fanciful rituals ( <persName>Devere
                        Allen</persName> , quoted in <persName>Kimmel</persName> 196). </p>
                <p> Although Masons would argue vigorously that the medals conferred when receiving the various degrees are indeed honors, there is surely a
                    distinction between them and those which are given for an actual accomplishment. Therefore a possible classification of the various medals
                    awarded in the <placeName>United States</placeName> suggests itself: </p>
                <p> I. Medals primarily used as recognition of general membership in the Masonic Order or of a branch, e.g. those incorporating Royal Arch
                    keystones to show membership in that Masonic rite, or Shrine scimitars to show membership in that Masonic collateral body. In a similar
                    category are some medals and medallions which are simply an indication that the member has donated to a Masonic charity (
                        <persName>Anonymous</persName> 1995). When found in a dealer's odd lot box, they sometimes are pierced and were possibly used for watch
                    chain <pb n="127"/> adornment. A British numismatist writes that "our American brethren are particularly fond of pocket pieces. These are
                    most frequently associated with the Craft or blue lodges and have an array of masonic symbols on one side and spaces on the other side for
                    the insertion of a brother's dates for taking the Craft degrees" ( <persName>Wheeler</persName> 1996, 209-210). (A Revolutionary War Masonic
                    pin was recovered from a camp site some years ago and thanks to scholarship is attributed to General <persName>Otho Holland
                        Williams</persName> , who had the good fortune to be painted by Rembrandt Peale while wearing it [ <persName>Lang</persName> 1993,
                    134-35]. An excellent post Civil War example of such a pocket piece was recently described in <persName>Cubbison</persName> 1995.) </p>

                    <p> The mock murder of the initiate in the third degree, just after he has been given the medal of a Master Mason. </p>
                </figure>
                <p> II. Medals showing the office, degree or level within the order achieved - e.g. the double eagle of the 32nd degree in the Scottish Rite of
                    Freemasonry or the sun between open compasses to show election as master of a symbolic blue lodge. Such medals belong in the area of
                    regalia, in that wearing them is often compulsory, as <pb n="128"/> indeed it is with some of those medals in category one. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-87">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_128.jpg"/>
                    <p> Three versions of the medal of a 32nd Degree member, Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret. </p>
                </figure>
                <p> III. Medals that indicate a distinction not earned by taking degrees or by election to office but rather given for singular achievement,
                    e.g. The <persName>Albert Gallatin Mackey</persName> Medal of the Grand Lodge of <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> or the <persName>John
                        Barney</persName> Medal of the Grand Lodge of Vermont. The medals in this class are much rarer than those in the other two classes (
                        <persName>Anonymous</persName> , 1967). The first of these to be instituted in the <placeName>United States</placeName> on a regular
                    basis was <placeName>Massachusetts'</placeName> Henry Price Medal in 1888. </p>
                <p> In all three cases of this simple classification, the medal design can include universal Masonic symbols, <ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref>
                    symbols associated with the particular rite or degree, or symbols linking Masonry with patriotic themes. <ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref>
                    This last patriotic theme has particular interest. While Masonry came to the <placeName>United States</placeName> from
                        <placeName>Europe</placeName> , it has developed a uniquely American flavor, including a distinctive tradition in medals which
                    reinforces other Masonic efforts to demonstrate that the organization is a staunch booster of flag and country. </p>
                <p> An example of how the Masonic mantle of myth to support this patriotic motif was woven is the Masons' embroidered version of the origins of
                    the American flag: <q> The Continental Congress with but three or four exceptions was composed entirely of Masons. As Col. <persName>George
                            Ross</persName> was of <pb n="129"/> Scotch descent, the old Scotch Coventanters' "blue blanker," as it was called, may possibly
                        have suggested the blue field for the union which has been claimed for it; but casting aside this supposition, it is evident that
                        General <persName>Washington</persName> , when he designed it, had in mind the Masonic covering of the Lodge, the blue and starry decked
                        canopy of heaven. The three colors, the five-pointed stars of fellowship or fraternity and the seven red stripes, all suggestive of the
                        three, five and seven steps of the Masonry of the Blue Lodge, while the six stars on the Master's collar, the four stars on the Senior
                        Warden's, the two stars on the Junior Warden's, together with the blazing star, comprised the thirteen stars of the constellation of the
                        Masonic union, and were the symbols also of the thirteen States which formed the American Union ( <persName>Sherman</persName> , 1,
                        38-39). </q>
                </p>
                <p> Actually there is no evidence that the Continental Congress was so completely composed of Masons or that General
                        <persName>Washington</persName> or anyone else was thinking of a Masonic lodge when the Stars and Stripes were designed, but the story
                    is illustrative of how Masonry has woven itself into a national fabric. The effort to do so goes on, as demonstrated by the offer of the
                        <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Masons to rebuild the great entrance arch to the national park at Valley Forge. This offer was
                    accepted and the Masons proceeded to rededicate Valley Forge with a ceremony which included a robot programmed as <persName>George
                        Washington</persName> . <ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref>
                </p>
                <p> The wish to commemorate Masonic associations with American history is illustrated by a number of what we call the Class III medals. For
                    example, since 1930 the Grand Lodge of <placeName>New York</placeName> has awarded the <persName>Joseph Warren</persName> Medal, which is
                    given for distinguished service. The Grand Lodge of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> gives the General <persName>John
                        Sullivan</persName> Distinguished Service Medal. Vermont confers the <persName>John Barney</persName> Medal. The choice of Revolutionary
                    War heroes for these medals is illustrative of this desire of Masonry to link itself with American patriotic themes. As a group to be
                    collected, these medals are clearly much harder to come by than many of the medals in the other two categories (
                        <persName>Anonymous</persName> 1957). </p>
                <p> In proposing these three categories of Masonic medals as a way to approach the subject, and suggesting that the history of the American
                    Masonic medal involves at times a unique combining of European Masonic and American patriotic symbolism, we still have not provided an easy
                    solution for the problem of deciding whether the treasure discovered at a local flea market is of Masonic origin. Fortunately, as <pb
                        n="130"/> noted, the Masons maintain a number of excellent libraries and museums, one of which in <placeName>New York</placeName> City
                    in the Masonic temple at 71 W. 23rd Street is more than willing to help numismatists. <ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> But even with such
                    help, the curator and the collector must exercise tact and remember that they are dealing with a secret organization. One should reflect on
                    the fact that the phrase about giving someone the third degree as a description of a rough time did not enter the language without reason! </p>

                    <p> "Young Protestant middle-class men sought their rituals not only in the fraternal and beneficiary lodges, but also in scores of
                        voluntary associations with primarily religious, reform, political, or economic objectives. College fraternities are an obvious example,
                        but they involved few men and their initiations were brief and underdeveloped. Fraternal initiation was more important in Mormonism,
                        temperance societies, the Know-Nothings and the Knights of the Golden Circle, the Grange, labor and veterans' organizations, and the
                        life insurance industry. Historians of each of these subjects have commented on the peculiar role of initiation, which they generally
                        have attributed to shield members from blacklisting, and fraternal life insurance firms used ritual to remind members to pay premiums.

                        Valley Forge Arch Rededication Brethren <lb/> Firstly, I would like to thank all those members of the list who replied to my earlier
                        messages requesting directions and info regarding the rededications of the Arch... Upon arrival there we saw the Arch covered with a
                        large cloth bearing the S&amp;C. Also in attendence was Bro. <persName>George Washington</persName> who was sitting on the dais...Never saw
                        so many fancy aprons, collars and jewels. Part of the fun for me was trying to guess what position these Brothers held as many of the
                        symbols on their aprons and jewels were not <pb n="132"/> similar to those in <placeName>NY</placeName> ...It turns out the Bro.
                            <persName>Geo</persName> was not just a manniquin, but a animatronic (like in <placeName>Disneyland</placeName> )... Regards. <lb/>

                <p> Augustus Saint-Gaudens's <hi rend="italic"> World's Columbian Exposition Commemorative Presentation Medal </hi> (American Numismatic
                    Society; <ref target="#fig-89">figs. 1</ref> &amp; <ref target="#fig-90">2</ref> ) was an official award for the great fair held in
                        <placeName>Chicago</placeName> from May to October 1893 to celebrate the quadricentennial of <persName>Christopher Columbus's</persName>
                    landing on this continent. This discussion will address the history of the commission, focusing on <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName>
                    controversial rejected design for the reverse and why the final appearance of the medal was far from what he originally envisioned. Instead
                    of a piece by the greatest American sculptor of the day, the result was composite: the obverse was by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> ,
                    and the reverse by <persName>Charles E. Barber</persName> , the Chief Engraver at the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint from 1879 to
                    1916. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> obverse depicts <persName>Columbus</persName> alighting from his vessel onto the rocky shore of the New
                    World. He strides forcefully to the left, with right foot advanced, arms outspread, and head raised to the skies. He is dressed in armor and
                    a cloak that partially obscure the attached sword and scabbard. The background—with its masterful illusion of depth—abounds with narrative
                    details. On the left a banner sweeps dramatically around <persName>Columbus</persName> , echoing the medal's edge and reinforcing the
                    explorer's powerful stance. To the right, still on the ship, are three somber male figures, one a standard bearer holding the staff of the
                    banner, and two others who will presumably also disembark. At the upper right are symbolic devices: the <placeName>Pillars of
                        Hercules</placeName> , symbolizing the Rocks of <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName> with the three caravels setting sail, and the
                    inscription PLVS VLTRA. Filling the field directly below is another inscription: <persName>CHRISTOPHER</persName> / COLVMBVS / OCT XII /
                    MCCCCXCII. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> rejected effort for the reverse features a nude youth representing the "Spirit of
                        <placeName>America</placeName> ," posed frontally in a modified contrapposto stance. A pencil drawing ( <ref target="#fig-91">fig.
                        3</ref> ), now destroyed, reveals a loosely sketched design, perhaps Augustus's conception for his younger brother
                        <persName>Louis</persName> —also a sculptor—to carry out. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> relied on <persName>Louis</persName> to
                    model the nude figure, a perfectly acceptable practice for a sculptor with numerous ongoing commissions ( <persName>Dryfhout</persName>
                    1982, 202). In a proof cast from the ANS ( <ref target="#fig-92">fig. 4</ref> ), the supple boy, "in the full vigor of young life" (
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to <persName>R.C. Preston</persName> , Director of <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Mint, November 17,
                    1893 [copy], <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> Papers), holds three wreaths in his left hand. He supports a tall shield inscribed "E
                    PLVRIBVS VNVM," and decorated with an American eagle, an olive branch, and a smaller shield. In his right hand he grasps a torch. A young
                    oak tree follows the contour of the boy's shield at the right, while at the lower left, space is provided for the name of the medal's
                    recipient. </p>

                    <persName>Barber's</persName> version, the final minted reverse of the medal, is a competent, traditional design. It is composed of a
                    central tablet with inscription: WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION / IN COMMEMORATION OF THE / FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY / OF THE LANDING OF
                        <persName>COLUMBUS</persName> / MDCCCXCII MDCCCXCIII. There is space below for a small insert die for the prize winner's name. Flaming
                    beribboned torches representing light and intelligence fill the left and right margins. Above, two semi-draped females are separated by a
                    globe marked with meridian and parallel lines. With trumpet and pen, they announce the award; the figure at the left also holds presentation
                    wreaths. In the lower portion, <persName>Columbus's</persName> caravel, the <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Santa Maria</persName> , </hi> is set in stylized waves under which <persName>Barber</persName> signed his name. </p>
                <p> In tracing this commission, it would be easy to reduce the controversy to petty personal jealousies between
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> and <persName>Barber</persName> . This element must be factored into the history of the medal;
                    however, it is more important to consider two larger issues that led to the rejection of <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> reverse: the
                    climate for American medallic art in the late nineteenth century and public discomfort over artistic renditions of the male nude. </p>

                    <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> numismatic involvements were fairly limited before he accepted the award medal commission. His
                    2-Vi-inch portrait of American painter <persName>John Singer Sargent</persName> (The Metropolitan Museum of Art; <ref target="#fig-93">fig.
                        5</ref> ), was his first foray into the field. Completed in <pb n="140"/> 1880, it is simple and sensitive, an exemplar of his
                    experimentation with the sketch aesthetic. Two years later, in 1882, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was asked to enter a competition to
                    design the Temple Award medal for the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Academy of the Fine Arts. He did not, but revealed, "I am greatly
                    interested in the subject of medals" ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to <persName>George Corliss</persName> , November 20, 1882,
                        <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Academy of the Fine Arts Archives). His first official medallic commission was the <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>George Washington</persName> Inaugural Centennial Medal </hi> (ANS; <ref target="#fig-94">figs. 6</ref> &amp; <ref

                    for Renaissance coins and medals, especially those by <persName>Pisanello</persName> , casts of whose work
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> collected according to currently available documentation. Two thousand medals were cast, rather than

                <p> In 1891 <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was one of ten prominent artists asked by the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Treasury Department to
                    submit designs for the first public competition for new silver coinage—coinage Mint officials felt should better express the art of the day
                    ( <persName>Taxay</persName> 1983, 287). Rather than preparing their designs, the artists—among them <persName>sculptors Daniel
                        Chester</persName>
                    <placeName>French</placeName> and <persName>John Quincy Adams Ward</persName> —wrote a joint response stating that neither the amount of
                    time nor the monetary compensation was adequate. After the Treasury scrapped this first plan, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> served on a
                    jury for a public competition with Mint official <persName>Charles Barber</persName> and <placeName>Boston</placeName> engraver
                        <persName>Henry Mitchell</persName> . This committee, too, was a dismal failure; from 300 submissions, no new designs were adopted.
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> and <persName>Barber</persName> sparred over aesthetic and technical matters. In general,
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> favored more artistic designs impossible to <pb n="142"/> adapt—due to a high degree of relief—to the
                    rigors of the coinage manufacturing process. He also informed Mint Director <persName>Edward Leech</persName> that only four Americans were
                    qualified to carry out this work, himself and three who resided in <placeName>France</placeName> . <persName>Leech</persName> countered that
                    he found it doubtful that any "high-class artist...any distinguished sculptor or designer can prepare a practical model for a coin" ([Marks]
                    1891, 102). <persName>Barber</persName> also contended that no one outside the Mint could competently design coinage, and in the end,
                    himself prepared new designs for the 1892 dime, quarter, and half-dollar. Thus the line between <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> and
                        <persName>Barber</persName> , artist and engraver, was drawn and would plague the sculptor throughout the remainder of his career (
                        <persName>Taxay</persName> 1983, 287-94, and <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1891, 1-3). </p>
                <p> In autumn 1892 <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was approached with a proposal from <persName>John Boyd Thacher</persName> , chairman of
                    the World's Columbian Exposition's Executive Committee on Awards to complete an award for the fair. The commission was in fact controlled by
                    the Quadro-Centennial Committee of the <persName>United States</persName> Senate, a fact that made the sculptor wary. He refused the
                    project—possibly as many as three times—turning down a generous five thousand-dollar payment, "a large sum...in those years" (
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:66). According to his son, Homer, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> claimed (with
                    uncharacteristic modesty), "that neither he nor any one else in the country could model a decent medal, and that it was necessary to go to
                        <placeName>Europe</placeName> for it" ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:66). </p>
                <p> In the end <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> presumably accepted the commission out of loyalty to fellow artists involved in preparations
                    for the Columbian Exposition as well as out of a spirit of patriotism. Before his involvement with the award medal,
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> had a sustained, but mainly unofficial, role in preparations for the fair, an event which reflected
                    an unprecedented spirit of cooperation among American painters, sculptors, and architects. His one submission for an ambitious outdoor
                    sculptural program, a monumental figure of <persName>Columbus</persName> , now destroyed ( <ref target="#fig-96">fig. 8</ref> ), was modeled
                    by his assistant <persName>Mary Lawrence</persName> , to whom he fully credited the work. His <hi rend="italic">

                    </hi> ( <ref target="#fig-97">fig. 9</ref> ), while not prepared specifically for the exposition, was installed on the Agriculture Building
                    (having previously topped the tower of Madison Square Garden in <placeName>New York</placeName> ). <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName>
                    official appointment was as an advisor to the Department of Fine Arts, offering recommendations on the selection of paintings and sculpture
                    ( <persName>Carr</persName>

                </figure>
                <p> As <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> warmed to the prospect of assuming the medal commission, he had to contend with the <persName>Robert
                        Gould Shaw</persName> Memorial Committee, whose members had grown impatient with his painfully slow pace on the monument planned for the
                        <placeName>Boston</placeName> Common. Under the terms of his contract, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was obliged to seek its
                    permission to pursue additional commissions. In November 1892, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> wrote Shaw committee treasurer
                        <persName>Edward Atkinson</persName> to explain that his desire to design the medal had, in part, to do with his animosity toward
                        <persName>Barber</persName> : <q> I only wish to do it to keep it out of the hands of the man at the mint who I am positively
                        assured...will certainly do it if I don't. If I thought that it were at all possible that one of two or three other artists could obtain
                        the work, I should certainly refuse to have anything to do with the matter ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to
                            <persName>Atkinson</persName> , November 10, 1892 [copy], <persName>Lee</persName> Family Papers). </q>

                </figure>
                <p> So <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> explicitly confessed a desire to hold <persName>Barber</persName> at bay, in effect to prevent him
                    from crossing the line from an engraver of coins to an artist of a prestigious medal. Despite Saint-Gaudens's comment that Europeans were
                    more capable medalists, he believed that, in order to raise the status of the American artist, an American was obliged to carry out the
                    commission. Therefore he accepted it. </p>
                <p> By October 31, 1893—when the Columbian Exposition closed— <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> had completed designs for both faces of the
                    medal. He insisted that models be closely guarded until they were delivered to the proper officials. Apparently the obverse was readily
                    accepted. Controversy flared, however, when a rendering of the reverse ( <ref target="#fig-98">fig. 10</ref> ) was prematurely circulated in
                    January 1894. The respected journal, <hi rend="italic">The American Architect and Building News</hi> , reported that officials of the Page
                    Belting Company of Concord, <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> , to whom two medals were to be awarded, decided that a drawing of the
                    medal would form an interesting decoration for the new calendar which they proposed to send to their customers at the beginning of the year;
                    and, as the medal itself was not yet available, they sent a draughtsman to <placeName>Washington</placeName> , to make a drawing from the
                    dies, or from <persName>Mr. St. Gaudens's</persName> model <hi rend="italic">(American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49). </p>
                <pb n="145"/>
                <figure xml:id="fig-98">

                </figure>
                <pb n="146"/>
                <p> No sooner had the souvenir books with the pirated drawings been distributed than objections to the medal's reverse escalated. Furious that
                    the design had been leaked, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> called the rendering "incorrect and offensive" and threatened legal action (
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:68). Furthermore, he characterized the draftsman who made the sketches as an "idiot," and a "
                        <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> ass" ( <hi rend="italic">American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49). </p>
                <p> Reconstructing the ensuing sequence of events through letters and newspaper accounts reveals how terribly mismanaged the administration of
                    the commission in fact was. The Page Belting Company publication attracted the notice of <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> Senator
                        <persName>William Eaton Chandler</persName> . Though Secretary of the Treasury <persName>John Griffin Carlisle</persName> had apparently
                    already "formally accepted" ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:67) <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> model,
                        <persName>Chandler's</persName> objections forced the Quadro-Centennial Committee to reconsider the design. In January 1894 the
                    Senatorial committee requested that "the Secretary of the Treasury...have work on the dies stopped, on the ground that the nude figure
                    represented on the reverse of the medal was indecent" ( <hi rend="italic">American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49). Secretary
                        <persName>Carlisle</persName> , in deference to his peers and President <persName>Grover Cleveland</persName> , recanted the acceptance
                    to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> on the grounds that the nude was offensive: <q> I am frank to say that inasmuch as there are to be
                        over 20,000 of these medals struck, I am satisfied that it would be severely criticized by a large majority of the people in its present
                        form....I have to request that...you will be kind enough to submit some design covering the objectionable part of the figure (
                            <persName>Carlisle</persName> to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> , January 23, 1894 [copy], <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName>
                        Papers). </q>
                </p>
                <p> Anticipating the likelihood of open confrontation, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> replied to <persName>Carlisle</persName> , warning him
                    icily: "I of course shall feel at liberty at all times to publish the correspondence between us" ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to
                        <persName>Carlisle</persName> , January 25, 1894 [copy], <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> Papers). Clearly
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> planned to make <persName>Carlisle</persName> the scapegoat for what he saw as the government's
                    provincial and uncultured attitude toward the arts. </p>
                <p> The controversy immediately caught the attention of the press, which followed it for several weeks, often giving it front page coverage. <pb
                        n="147"/> The majority of published articles were sympathetic to the sculptor, written by journalists determined to advance the concept
                    of a viable American "school" of artists. A note in <hi rend="italic">The Collector</hi> supporting <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> is a
                    case in point: "To fling into the face of such a man, who is an honor to this country and his art, the filth of time-serving politics, and
                    the ignorance of the intelligences of mud, is not so much to insult him as to defame this country before all the world." ([
                        <persName>Trumble</persName> ] 1894, p. 101). </p>
                <p> Not surprising, artists, especially other French-trained sculptors, also rallied in support of <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> . In their
                    effort to redeem his reputation, they decried the government's censorship and poor track record as a patron of American artists. Their
                    collective organ was the National Sculpture Society, founded in 1893 to regulate commissions for public sculpture and to advance exhibition
                    opportunities for small works. The Society published a resolution on February 12, 1894 that concluded: "That if changes in works of art are
                    ordered, then such changes should be made under the immediate direction of the artist" (copy in <persName>Gilder</persName> Papers). In
                    fact, the exact opposite would happen. </p>
                <p> By early March, perhaps mollified by the sympathy of the press and fellow artists, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> consented to make
                    slight, but significant, refinements. He altered his design, as he later put it, to "flatter the sensitiveness of the rampant pure'." (
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:68). He experimented with several options, adding a teasingly thin ribbon across what
                        <persName>Carlisle</persName> had deemed the "objectionable part" of the nude in one version ( <ref target="#fig-11">fig. 11</ref> ),
                    while in another, he relied on the time-tested fig leaf ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to <persName>Carlisle</persName> , March 15,
                    1894 [copy], <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> Papers). In April, with limited explanation, the government deemed these designs unfit. </p>
                <p> Although his patience and pride were tested, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> complied with a request from <persName>Robert
                        Preston</persName> , new Director of the Mint, to furnish yet another model. On May 22, 1894, the sculptor wrote to his friend, the
                    influential journalist <persName>Richard Watson Gilder</persName> : "I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> doing a reverse, but am eliminating the
                    figure entirely, confining it only to an inscription.... The figure that I had composed was composed to be nude, and I find it impossible to
                    drape it without entirely destroying the composition." ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to <persName>Gilder</persName> , May 22, 1894,
                        <persName>Gilder</persName> Papers). By ousting the nude, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> presumed that the acceptance of the design
                    was all but guaranteed. In fact, Mint Director Preston had written him to that effect just days earlier, on May 18: "As soon as the Reverse
                    is received, preparation will be made to have it engraved immediately, and to make a faithful reproduction of the same" (
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:71). </p>

                <p> The revised composition ( <ref target="#fig-100">fig. 12</ref> ), in the sculptors words, "surely avoided all erotic insinuation" (
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:68). It is a conventional design with an inscription as the central element: THE COLVMBIAN /
                    EXPOSITION IN COMMEMORATION / OF THE FOVR HVNDREDTH ANNI / VERSARY OF THE LANDING OF / COLVMBVS. The sole vestiges of the earlier
                    composition— the eagle, a small shield, and E PLVRIBVS VNVM—appear in a wreath above the longer inscription while below is a tablet-like
                    space for an insert die with the recipient's name. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> sent this design off to Secretary
                        <persName>Carlisle</persName> on June 23, believing the problem element to be eliminated. This attempt too was rejected without reason
                    just four days later, while a model for the reverse by <persName>Barber</persName> that was commissioned without
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> knowledge was accepted. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> fumed at a chain of events that had ended in deception. In an incendiary letter to Secretary
                        <persName>Carlisle</persName> , his rage is almost palpable: <q> You will excuse me for saying that your action in allowing me to devote
                        time, thought and money to the elaboration of this final model, while keeping me in ignorance of the fact that another design was being
                        prepared at the Mint for the same purpose, was something more than discourteous ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to
                            <persName>Carlisle</persName> , July 3, 1894 [copy], <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> Papers). </q>
                </p>
                <p> In a letter that <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> planned to submit for publication in the <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>New York</placeName> Daily Tribune </hi> , which is reprinted in his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> , he set forth his
                    "mortifying confession of criminal <hi rend="italic">naéveté</hi> ," detailing the circumstances of the commission as a "moral to others
                    moved to entertain government proposals" ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:67-68). Seeking to expose the government's bad faith,
                    he printed verbatim the letter from Mint Director <persName>Preston</persName> that had guaranteed acceptance of the final design. While the
                    sculptor conceded that, legally, the government could combine his work with <persName>Barber's</persName> , "the rare shamelessness of such
                    offense will be appreciated by all my confreres at home and abroad." He would, he concluded, "in all humility, await from these official
                    gentlemen their own explanation" ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:72). The sculptor, however, met a wall of silence, and by
                    October 1894, he conceded defeat, the incident having brought him "great distress of mind" ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:66). </p>
                <p> Once the decision was made to mule <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> design with <pb n="150"/> Barber's, the medal's production rested
                    solely in government hands. In November 1893, Mint Director <persName>Preston</persName> asked <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to provide
                    a list of foundries that could strike the award medals, evidence perhaps that the sculptor had requested that they not be struck at the Mint
                    ( <persName>Preston</persName> to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> , November 13, 1893, Records of the Bureau of the Mint,
                        <placeName>United States</placeName> National Archives). Annual reports of the <placeName>U. S.</placeName> Mint between 1894 and 1896
                    suggest that the Mint did produce the hubs and dies, but farmed out the actual striking of the medal ( <persName>Julian</persName> 1977,
                    410). A sample card accompanying one of the medals in the ANS's collection reads, "Award Medal and Aluminum Case made by
                        <persName>Scoville</persName> Manufacturing Company, <placeName>Waterbury, Connecticut</placeName> ." Thus <persName>Scoville</persName>
                    was the producer of not only the medals, but the accompanying velvet-lined cases. </p>
                <p> The medal, along with an award diploma designed by <persName>Will Low</persName> , was finally circulated to prize winners in April 1896, a
                    full two and a half years after the fair's closing. An article in that month's <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> noted
                    the culmination of the protracted ordeal: "the medals...have at last been issued." Lamenting the aesthetic disparity between
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> obverse and <persName>Barber's</persName> reverse, the author commented: "While there is dignity
                    and devotion finely expressed in the figure of <persName>Columbus</persName> , ...the general effect of the medal, as a specimen of the
                    highest attainment of American numismatic art, is...hardly up to our hopes" <hi rend="italic">(AJN 1896,</hi> 119-20). </p>
                <p> It would be fruitful to consider the described course of events in the context of American medallic art of the late nineteenth century. In
                    the 1880s, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was part of a growing trend by French-trained American sculptors to embrace a field
                    monopolized by engravers and die cutters. Technological progress revolutionized the methods by which coins and medals were made and
                    boundaries between engravers and sculptors dissolved. The refinement of a reducing machine allowed sculptors to model their designs on a
                    larger scale and then mechanically modify them to appropriate proportions. Thus, the ability to model became the chief requisite for the
                    creation of a medal and sculptors were able to compete on a more equal basis for the abundant commissions. For the Columbian Exposition
                    alone, several hundred coins and medals were produced, from those of official status, such as the <persName>Saint-Gaudens/Barber</persName>
                    award medal to those sold for negligible sums as collectibles (see <persName>Eglit ca</persName> . 1965). </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was also a victim of a power struggle waged by <persName>Barber</persName> and his chief assistant
                        <persName>George T. Morgan</persName> to retain control over <pb n="151"/> designs of coins and medals of the
                        <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Mint. As mentioned above, in 1891, in an effort to address dissatisfaction with the appearance of American
                    coinage, the Mint had engaged in open competition for designs. Although the submissions were unacceptable, and <persName>Barber</persName>
                    proceeded to make his own revisions, it is understandable that he and <persName>Morgan</persName> would resent the intrusion of lofty
                    artistic ideals into the practical matters of producing coinage. Sculptors, for their part, perceived the Mint engravers as inferior talents
                    because they had not undergone stringent academic training. Such is the case with <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> son,
                        <persName>Homer</persName> , who years later disdainfully referred to <persName>Barber</persName> as the "commercial medallist" (
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:67). </p>
                <p> As <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> was mired in dispute over the award medal, <persName>Barber</persName> was also vying to control two
                    other Columbian coin commissions. The <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Mint was, for the first time, to produce commemorative coinage, in this
                    case to help finance the Exposition ( <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, 32). Mrs. <persName>Potter Palmer</persName> , as head of the fair's
                    Board of Lady Managers, was responsible for the commission of the Queen <persName>Isabella</persName> quarter dollar, authorized by Congress
                    on March 3, 1893, in recognition of women's contribution to American society. She hired <persName>Caroline Peddle</persName> for the task,
                    but <persName>Barber</persName> intervened and executed the coin himself (see <persName>Taxay</persName> 1967, 8-13). <persName>Olin
                        Warner</persName> , one of the most esteemed sculptors of the day, suffered a similar fate with his half dollar. Selected by the Board
                    of Managers of the Columbian Commission, <persName>Warner</persName> was the first individual outside the Mint to design an American coin.
                    His obverse—a bust-length portrait of Columbus—was based on a medal ( <ref target="#fig-101">fig. 13</ref> ) that he produced to commemorate
                    the Exposition's dedication. When <persName>Barber</persName> and <persName>Morgan</persName> prepared the dies for
                        <persName>Warner's</persName> half dollar ( <ref target="#fig-102">fig. 14</ref> ), they not only clouded his subtle modeling, and
                    reworked elements of the design and inscription, but added their initials, in effect obviating <persName>Warner's</persName> principle role
                    ( <persName>Gurney</persName> 1978, 3:779-80). </p>

                <p> The issue of nudity was also at the heart of the controversy over the initial design for the reverse. Despite his thorough grounding in
                    Beaux-Arts academicism, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> rarely introduced the nude into his work. In the few instances he attempted the
                    subject he often was embroiled in debate over its propriety in relation to the adornment of public space. Three fauns for the <placeName>Eli
                        Bates Fountain</placeName> , <hi rend="italic">Storks at Play,</hi> of 1886-87, dance among herons and cattails in <placeName>Chicago's
                        Lincoln Park</placeName> . <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> originally intended the boys to be nude, but was obliged to add fig leaves
                    at the request of the committee overseeing the commission. <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> most notorious nude, the eighteen-foot <hi
                        rend="italic">
                        <persName>Diana</persName>
                    </hi> for Madison Square Garden was the object of extensive controversy. The first version, now destroyed, stood atop the Garden's tower
                    from November 1891 to September 1892. There and during its subsequent installation atop the Agriculture Building at the Columbian
                    Exposition, <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Diana</persName>
                    </hi> had been fiercely criticized as inappropriate. <hi rend="italic">Diana's</hi> display in <placeName>Chicago</placeName> may have
                    prompted members of the Quadro-Centennial Committee to take swift action when the dispute over the nude on the medal arose. Lastly,
                        <persName>Louis St. Gaudens</persName> , in consultation with Augustus, had modeled a seal ( <ref target="#fig-103">fig. 15</ref> ),
                    based on a design by <persName>Kenyon Cox</persName> , for the main entrance of the new <placeName>Boston</placeName> Public Library <pb
                        n="153"/> in 1889-90. Here two nude figures supporting a shield bear a resemblance to the figure on the rejected reverse. Opposition to
                    the seal's placement on the library erupted in the Boston press in mid-February 1894, just three weeks after the initial rejection of
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> reverse for the Columbian medal. Fortunately, this design withstood the objections of its critics. </p>

                <p> Not only was the inclusion of a male nude on an American medal a gamble, the subject had a tenuous place in nineteenth-century American
                    sculpture. Historically, nudes were acceptable so long as they did not overstep bounds with an American audience: the line between praise
                    and castigation was a fine one. Idealized subjects far removed from modern American life stood a better chance of acceptance, such as Hiram
                    Powers's classicizing <hi rend="italic">Fisher Boy</hi> (1841-44; The Metropolitan Museum of Art), a rare case in which the genitals are not
                    covered, or <persName>John Donoghue's</persName> fig-leafed <hi rend="italic"> Young <persName>Sophocles</persName> Leading the Chorus of </hi>

                    the <placeName>U.S. Capitol Rotunda</placeName> , provides insight into the furor over <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> nude youth. Also
                    a governmental commission, the heroic-size seated <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Washington</placeName>
                    </hi> was condemned because the figure was partially nude. Many saw this as an irrational presentation of a venerated leader. Like
                        <persName>Greenough's</persName>
                    <hi rend="italic">

                    <hi rend="italic"> Spirit of <placeName>America</placeName>
                    </hi> overstepped the bounds with viewers unwilling to make the leap from realism to "a bit of artistic idealism" (
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> 1913, 2:66). To its detractors, the issue was not only one of propriety, but also appropriateness:
                    this figure was not an acceptable personification of an American youth of the 1890s. In an era of optimism, realism, and self-confidence, a
                        <persName>Huck Finn</persName> or <persName>Tom Sawyer</persName> vision of boyhood was fitting, but a nude without a veneer of morality
                    or virtue was direct provocation. That <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> youth was a sensual full-length, unprecedented in an American
                    medal, caused additional governmental discomfort since the nubile youth was to be yoked with the noble <persName>Columbus</persName> .
                    Furthermore, since a medal's reverse conventionally featured an artfully placed inscription, a heraldic shield, or an eagle, it is even
                    easier to comprehend the circumstances leading to this clash between freedom of expression and censorship. </p>
                <p> In the end, <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> original conception was not realized largely because of the incompatibility of subject and
                    audience. Highminded aesthetics could not override moral standards and politics. The incident represented a setback for American sculptors,
                    who through principles ingrained in their French academic training, labored to teach Americans that the nude was not common or immoral, but
                    inspirational and pure. For his part, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> salvaged elements from the medal's reverse and incorporated them
                    into other projects. The elongated shield is realized in the <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>James Garfield</persName> Monument </hi> , dedicated in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> in May 1896. The eagle and motto
                    "E PLVRIBVS VNVM" on the shield were repeated on the reverse of the <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName> special inaugural medal of 1905
                    (ANS; <ref target="#fig-105">fig. 17</ref> ) and reverse of the ten-dollar gold piece of 1906-07 (ANS; <ref target="#fig-106">fig. 18</ref>
                    ). </p>

                <p> Despite the regrettable close to this chapter of <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> career, his contribution toward a redefined field of
                    American medallic art is uncontested. His protean attempts to marry American sculptural and numismatic traditions paved the way for the
                    glorious Beaux-Arts medals of <persName>John Flanagan</persName> , <persName>Victor David Brenner</persName> , and others at the turn of the

                <p> A 1917 article on the sculpture of <persName>Adolph Alexander Weinman</persName> in the <hi rend="italic"> Pan-American Union Bulletin </hi>
                    concludes with a paragraph on his achievements in medallic art: <q> As a medalist, however, he ranks probably second to none. Ingenious and
                        skillful in this branch of artistic endeaver, he has produced some exceptionally fine work. No doubt his early training as a wood and
                            <persName>ivory carver</persName> stand him in good stead. The medal of honor of the American Institute of Architects is his work,
                        as is also the medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the <placeName>United States</placeName> medal for life saving on
                        railroads. He also did the official medal of the <persName>St. Louis</persName> Exposition. In all these designs he combined strength
                        with simplicity, thus creating an object of striking charm. Most recently he has designed a series of coins for the <placeName>United
                            States</placeName> Government. New coins of the denomination of 10 cents and 50 cents are now in circulation in this country and are
                        bringing forth much favorable comment for the beauty of design and the effective expression through it of the spirit and ideals of this
                        country. <hi rend="italic">(PAUB</hi> 1917, 787) </q>
                </p>
                <p> The strength and clarity of design noted in this anonymous review, coupled with a rigorous adherence to classical ideals, distinguish
                        <persName>A. A. Weinman</persName> 's medals from those of his contemporaries. Drawing on the evidence of previously unpublished
                    studies, notes, and sketches that have been donated or loaned by the <persName>Weinman</persName> family to the American Numismatic Society
                    and the Archives of American Art, it is possible to trace the development of <persName>Weinmans</persName> medallic designs and to
                    illuminate the singularity of his artistic vision. </p>
                <p> Born in 1870 in <placeName>Karlsruhe, Germany</placeName> , <persName>Adolph Alexander Weinman</persName> emigrated to the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> with his family in 1880. At age fifteen, he was apprenticed to a wood and <persName>ivory carver</persName> in
                        <placeName>New York</placeName> . The following year, he began studying drawing and modeling in evening classes at the Cooper Union. He
                    later said of that experience, "I liked carving, but it was all small stuff and when I saw the large work being done in the modeling class,
                    I made up my mind then and there to quit carving and try to become a sculptor" ( <persName>Weinman</persName> , Typescript of a public
                    address, April 13, 1948; AAA). When he learned that the sculptor <persName>Philip Martiny</persName> , a former pupil and assistant of
                    Augustus <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> , was taking on apprentices, <persName>Weinman</persName> signed on for the job of "push[ing] a
                    studio broom, keep[ing] the potbellied stove going and mix[ing] barrels of good, wet clay" ( <persName>Weinman</persName> , April 13, 1948;
                    AAA). Working during the day in <persName>Martiny's</persName> studio, <persName>Weinman</persName> , like so many of <pb n="159"/> his
                    contemporaries, continued his studies in the evening classes taught by <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> at the Art Students League.
                    Through these classes, <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> transmitted the Beaux-Arts tradition of bronze sculpture to an entire generation
                    of American sculptors. <ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
                </p>
                <p> After a brief assistantship with <persName>Olin Levi Warner</persName> , cut short by <persName>Warner's</persName> untimely death,
                        <persName>Weinman</persName> joined <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> studio in 1895. He worked closely with
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> for the next ten years, before establishing his own studio. While assisting
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> , <persName>Weinman</persName> also worked at times with the sculptors <persName>Charles
                        Niehaus</persName> and <persName>Daniel Chester French</persName> . <persName>Weinman</persName> described
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> , whom he and other studio assistants referred to as "the Saint," as "a man of remarkably magnetic
                    personality, intensely temperamental and of striking personal appearance, whom I shall always remember with great affection, despite the
                    fact that there was one fault in his general makeup, he habitually forgot to pay his assistant at a specified time and that is the way he
                    was about money in general" ( <persName>Weinman</persName> , April 13, 1948; AAA). </p>
                <p> Surviving documentation clearly shows that <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> held <persName>Weinman</persName> in high regard and bestowed
                    on him the primary responsibility for carrying out important commissions. Likewise, <persName>Daniel Chester</persName>
                    <persName>French</persName> trusted <persName>Weinman's</persName> abilities, writing in a letter of September 10, 1903: "I do want all the
                    time you can give me from the first of next month on indefinitely ... I am sorry to stand in the way of your working with Mr. <persName>St.
                        Gaudens</persName> but I need you too much to be generous" ( <persName>French</persName> to <persName>Weinman</persName> , September 10,
                    1903; HKW). </p>
                <p> The exhibition of European medals at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in <placeName>Chicago</placeName> first sparked
                        <persName>Weinman's</persName> interest in medallic sculpture. His subsequent experience in the studios of <persName>Warner</persName>
                    and <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> , both of whom received critical acclaim for their masterful portrait plaquettes and medallions in
                    the 1880s and early 1890s, further inspired his early efforts at medallic portraiture. <ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref>
                    <persName>Weinman's</persName> earliest surviving portrait medallion is a silvered galvano depicting his mother, Catharina, sculpted in 1896
                    (Baxter 1987, cat. no. 165, illustrated p. 47).The soft, atmospheric modeling and format of this piece are very much in the Beaux-Arts
                    tradition. The style of inscriptions and use of the Latin "FECIT" in the artist's signature follow <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName>
                    practice, inspired by Italian Renaissance models. </p>
                <p> During his tenure with <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> , <persName>Weinman</persName> modeled other portrait plaquettes and medallions
                    for relatives and acquaintances, but his first commission for a commemorative medal did not come until <pb n="160"/> 1904. When he received
                    the commission for the official medal of the 1904 <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase Exposition, <persName>Weinman</persName> seized
                    the opportunity, crafting a unique series of commemorative and awards medals ( <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, 38-39). The
                        <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase medals are innovative for their use of varying planchet shapes to distinguish the different
                    classes of awards. All of the medals share the same central obverse and reverse designs, but the motifs around the edges of the planchets
                    differ. The format for the Gold Medal and official Commemorative Medal is a triangular planchet with curved sides ( <ref target="#fig-107"
                        >fig. 1</ref> ). The Grand Prize Medal is struck on a shield-shaped flan, the Silver Medal a square, and the Bronze Medal a circle. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Weinman's</persName> design for the <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase medals anticipates many of his later medallic
                    achievements. On the obverse, the central medallion features an image of Liberty cloaking herself and a younger figure beside her in the
                    American flag, with a rising sun in the background. The circular field on the reverse is filled by a heroic eagle with outstretched wings
                    perched on a rectangular plaque bearing the inscription, with a pair of opposed dolphins flanking a scallop shell below. The graceful,
                    curving line, restrained composition, and strong forms evident in this piece are hallmarks of <persName>Weinman's</persName> mature style.
                        <persName>Weinman</persName> became a specialist in the modeling of eagles, and this magnificent bird initiates a lengthy series of
                    variations on the theme. </p>
                <p> In a letter of July 14, 1905 that undoubtedly refers to the <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase medal, <persName>Daniel Chester
                        French</persName> indicates that he has seen the models for the medal in Ward's studio and congratulates <persName>Weinman</persName> on
                    his achievement. He goes on to add: <q> Mr. <persName>Ward</persName> said, that he had called your attention to the drapery in the lower
                        part of the principal figure. This does not seem to me as happy in arrangement as the rest of the drapery. At the same time I hesitate
                        about criticising it, or making any suggestion, the whole thing is so fine. I still fell [feel] that your Dolphins have not squirm
                        enough. I think that the curves in the outlines of them are too true, and that some little breaks in the outlines and some little
                        suggestion of unevenness in the modeling would take away from the regidity I feel in them. You know I criticised them before. (
                            <persName>French</persName> to <persName>Weinman</persName> , July 14, 1905; HKW) </q>
                </p>
                <p> A somewhat awkward relationship between the drapery and the lower part of the figure of Liberty is evident in the finished medal.
                        <persName>French's</persName> comment about the dolphins is also very telling. In the modeling of his medallic compositions,
                        <persName>Weinman</persName> favors smooth surfaces <pb n="161"/> and clarity of outline over the more nuanced surface modulations
                    preferred by <persName>French</persName> and <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> . This stylistic difference reflects
                        <persName>Weinman's</persName> closer adherence to Classical sources than to the Renaissance models emulated by
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> . </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    <persName>Weinman</persName> certainly adapted his work to the master sculptor's dictates when required to do so, and the Special Inaugural
                    Medal commissioned <pb n="162"/> from <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> by President <persName>Theodore Roosevelt</persName> in 1905 is a
                    case in point ( <ref target="#fig-108">fig. 2</ref> ) ( <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, 29, 31). At a White House dinner on January 12,
                    1905, <persName>Roosevelt</persName> asked <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to create a special commemorative medal for his upcoming
                    second inaugural. A week later, the sculptor wrote back to the President: <figure xml:id="fig-108">

                    <q> If the inauguration medal is to be ready for March the first, there is not a moment to lose. I cannot do it, but I have arranged with
                        the man best fit to execute it in this country [ <persName>Weinman</persName> ]. He is a most artistic nature extremely diffident but he
                        would do an admirable thing. He is also supple and takes suggestion intelligently. He has made one of the great Indian groups at St.
                        Louis that would have interested you if brought to your attention. He is so interested that he begged me to fix any price. I named $250
                        ( <persName>Weinman</persName> to <persName>Roosevelt</persName> , January 20, 1905; DCL). </q>
                </p>
                <p> Letters from <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> in <persName>Vermont</persName> to <persName>Weinman</persName> in <placeName>New
                        York</placeName> document the progress of the models for the <persName>Roosevelt</persName> medal and illustrate the nature of the
                    working relationship between the two sculptors. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> sketched out the composition and decided on the
                    inscriptions in consultation with the President, who agreed that the text should be kept to a minimum, following Renaissance prototypes.
                    Weinman attended to all of the technical details, from soliciting proposals for the medal's production to choosing the color of gold for the
                    President's specimen. The Renaissance-inspired design of the obverse features a truncated bust of the President. A noble, Ptolemaic eagle
                    appears on the reverse, accompanied by <persName>Weinman's</persName> monogram. <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> required that
                        <persName>Weinman</persName> make numerous small revisions in the models before he was satisfied that the medal was ready for casting:
                        <q> Dear <persName>Weinman</persName> : </q>
                    <q> I think the eagle without the shield is the right one. I return the model with three little corrections: </q>
                    <q> No. 1, showing more of V and N in VNVM by cutting one of the feathers shorter, as I have indicated. </q>
                    <q>No. 2, increasing the size of our monograms.</q>
                    <q> No. 3, making the front of the rock in simpler planes, as I have also roughly indicated. </q>
                    <q> As to the head, it is all right except that I think the letters might be a little thinner and longer in relief; after that is done, go
                        ahead with the reduction </q>
                    <q> ( <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> to <persName>Weinman</persName> , March 14, 1905; AAA). </q>
                </p>
                <p> In typical <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> fashion, the first trial casts were sent back to Tiffany &amp; Company because they had not been
                    executed "in the best possible manner," and <persName>Weinman</persName> tried another foundry [Roman Bronze Works] to see if better casts
                    could be obtained ( <persName>Weinman</persName> to <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> , May 3, 1905, and May 21, 1905; DCL). In the end,
                    Tiffany did produce casts that met with <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> and <persName>Weinman's</persName>
                    <pb n="164"/> approval, and the President finally received his medal in June 1905, more than three months after the inauguration. </p>
                <p> The success of <persName>Weinman's</persName> designs for the <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> Purchase medals and his association with
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> brought him further important commissions, beginning with the <placeName>United States</placeName>
                    Medal for Life Saving on Railroads, enacted by Act of Congress in 1905. A unique study for the Lifesaving Medal, presented to the American
                    Numismatic Society by <persName>Robert A. Weinman</persName> from his father's collection, shows the design in progress (
                        <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, cat. no. 172, illlustrated p. 47). <persName>A.A. Weinman</persName> originally sketched the piece as
                    a two-figure composition, embodying the concept of rescue in a heroic, classical nude who lifts a limp victim in his strong arms. He later
                    reduced the composition to a single, allegorical nude figure that better suits the small scale of the struck medal (
                        <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, cat. no. 173, illustrated p. 48). In the final design, the diagonal position of the figure, the
                    tension of the musculature, and the movement of the drapery create a sense of drama appropriate to the subject. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>James Earle Fraser's Harriman</persName> Memorial Medal for the American Museum of Safety, issued in 1914, makes an instructive
                    comparison with <persName>Weinman's</persName> Lifesaving Medal ( <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, 10, <ref target="#fig-115">fig. 9</ref>
                    ). <persName>Fraser</persName> , another of <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> gifted students, gives the theme of railroad safety a more
                    realistic treatment, using textured modeling to complement the robust image of a contemporary track walker. <persName>Weinman</persName>
                    seems to have considered such a literal representation of the subject inappropriate to the format and commemorative purpose of the medal.
                    For the duration of his career, he remained faithful to the classical, allegorical ideal, long after the Beaux-Arts tradition in sculpture
                    and architecture had been eclipsed by what he derisively called the "stark functionalism" of modernist design ( <persName>Weinman</persName>
                    , April 13, 1948; AAA). </p>
                <p> For <persName>Weinman</persName> , the starting point for each medallic design was the search for a symbolic equivalent of the subject. A
                    unique sketch for the 1909 <persName>Edison</persName> Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers shows a partially draped,
                    seated figure holding a lightbulb, attended by a small winged genius ( <ref target="#fig-109">fig. 3</ref> ) ( <persName>Baxter</persName>
                    1987, 49, cat. no. 175). The image of a seated male nude with a lightbulb also appears in another study for this same medal by
                        <persName>James Earle Fraser</persName> , suggesting that in this case the allegorical figure may have been a requirement of a design
                    competition for the medal ( <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, 61, cat. no. 232). <persName>Fraser</persName> was ultimately awarded the
                    commission for the <persName>Edison</persName> medal ( <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, 60, cat. no. 231). </p>

                <p> Sketchbooks and drawings in the collection of papers donated by <persName>Robert A. Weinman</persName> to the Archives of American Art give
                    further insight into the genesis of <persName>A.A. Weinman</persName> 's medallic designs. Two undated, loose sheets of pencil sketches for
                    medals are illustrated in <ref target="#fig-110">figures 4</ref> and <ref target="#fig-111">5</ref> . The Classicism of these designs is
                    immediately apparent, as is the sense of monumentality in the figural compositions. <persName>Weinman</persName> was an accomplished
                    sculptor of architectural reliefs, and these studies show the austere Classicism of his large-scale relief sculpture translated into the
                    small format of the medal (Dorr 1913). Some of these sketches bear a strong resemblance to ancient coin types, and there are examples in one
                    of <persName>Weinman's</persName> sketchbooks of studies from Roman coins and Greek sculpture (HKW). </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Weinman's</persName> studies for medallic designs are often accompanied by penciled captions explaining the allegorical subjects
                    of the compositions. On one sheet of studies, for example, the jotted notations include "Joy of Freedom/The narrow path of Duty" ( <ref
                        target="#fig-110">fig. 4</ref> ); on another, "Adventure, Romance of History," "Adventure, Defence," "Man and his Conscience," "Peace &amp;
                    Security/Parting of the Way," "Reason deceives us often, Conscience never./Man &amp; his conscience/Conscience, oracle of god" ( <ref
                        target="#fig-111">fig. 5</ref> ) (AAA). <persName>Weinman</persName> kept lists of quotations and allegorical subjects for reference.
                    One lengthy, alphabetized list begins: "Ability/Arts, The/Adventure/Adversity/[ ]/ <placeName>America</placeName>
                    /Civilization/Confidence/Conquest/ Conscience, ..." (AAA). </p>

                <p> On another page, the sculptor cites <persName>Bartlett's</persName> Quotations as the source of inspiration for a design, and in a memo to
                    himself, he writes: "Inscribe message on Reverse of medal, instead of any devise, if found more to the point" (AAA). </p>

                <p> In comparison with the medals sculpted under <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> tutelage, two important commissions dating from the years
                    just after <persName>Weinman</persName> established his own studio in 1906 show a new sense of maturity in their design and execution.
                        <persName>Weinman's</persName> 1907 medal for the American Institute of Architects pays homage to the classical ideal, represented by
                    the jugate busts of <persName>Ictinus, Kallikrates, and Phidias</persName> , the architects and chief sculptor of the
                        <placeName>Parthenon</placeName> ( <ref target="#fig-112">fig. 6</ref> ). On the reverse of the ALA medal, a magnificent eagle with
                    partially extended wings appears on a rocky perch, ripping off a laurel branch in its beak. In comparison with the rather tame bird on the
                    reverse of the <persName>Roosevelt</persName> Special Inaugural Medal, this eagle has a great sense of power and life, enhanced by the way
                    that the motif fills the entire field, extending right to the edge of the frame. <persName>Weinman</persName> achieves a remarkable amount
                    of <pb n="168"/> detail in the talons and the differentiation of neck and wing feathers, the result of careful studies from nature. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-113">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_168.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    <persName>Weinman's</persName> 1909 medal for the National Institute of Arts and Letters is another beautiful example of the balance and
                    grace that typify his best work ( <ref target="#fig-113">fig. 7</ref> ). Once more the obverse features a classical theme, the head of
                    Apollo, god of music and poetry. A Roman lamp, symbolic of learning, burns brightly on the reverse. The relief here is higher, the surface
                    smoother, and the forms more sharply delineated than in the AIA Medal. The obvious reference to masterpieces of ancient coinage includes the
                    beaded treatment of the rim. Weinman's placement of the head in a slightly off-center position, with the locks of hair that ripple down the
                    neck transgressing the border, gives the image greater vitality. The reverse complements the obverse in its simplicity and off-set
                    composition. </p>
                <p> Another piece dating from 1909 is quite different in character and unusual in <persName>Weinman's ouevre</persName> ( <ref target="#fig-113"
                        >fig. 8</ref> ). <persName>Weinman</persName> exhibited the rectangular, cast bronze plaquette entitled "The Charge" in 1910 at the <pb
                        n="169"/> American Numismatic Society's International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals, but it is otherwise overlooked in the
                    literature (IECM 4). An unpublished companion piece given by <persName>Robert A. Weinman</persName> to the American Numismatic Society
                    represents a naval battle ( <ref target="#fig-114">fig. 9</ref> ). These small reliefs may be studies for a Civil War soldiers and sailors
                    monument. Both depict scenes of action with historical accuracy. When the nature of the commission necessitated that Weinman forgo the
                    heroic, allegorical nude, he did adopt a greater degree of realism in his figurative sculpture, although in the traditional format of the
                    commemorative medal he chose not to do so. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> In modeling portrait plaquettes and medallions, <persName>Weinman</persName> was interested in creating an authentic likeness of the
                    subject. He especially enjoyed portraying children, including his own, who are the subject of numerous reliefs. A medallic portrait of his
                    son <persName>Robert</persName> ( <persName>Bobbie</persName> ) exists in two versions, both galvanos—one a plaquette with charming details,
                    the other a circular medallion of the head alone ( <ref target="#fig-115">fig. 10</ref> ) (Noe, 40; Baxter 1987, cat. no. 171). </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>A.A. Weinman</persName> also played a key role in the Beaux-Arts redesign of the <placeName>United States</placeName> coinage,
                    initiated by <persName>Roosevelt</persName> and <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> with the ten- and twenty-dollar gold pieces of 1907. In a
                    1916 design competition for the fractional silver coins, <persName>Weinman</persName> was selected as the artist for the revamped dime and
                    half-dollar pieces. </p>

                <p> The so-called "Mercury" dime, misnamed because of the wings applied to Liberty's cap, is the less successful of the two designs. An
                    exquisite plaster sketch for the head of the Walking Liberty on the half dollar, based on ancient coin types, shows how the obverse of the
                    dime might have looked without the problematic wings that <persName>Weinman</persName> deemed symbolic of "liberty of thought" ( <ref
                        target="#fig-117">fig. 11</ref> ). <persName>Cornelius Vermeule</persName> has speculated that another reason for the wings is "because
                        <persName>Weinman</persName> , in the true <persName>Saint-Gaudens</persName> tradition, liked the effect of feathers in relief on his
                    coins and medals" ( <persName>Vermeule</persName> , 145). </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-117">

                </figure>
                <p> The "Walking Liberty" half dollar is a true masterpiece of design, the highpoint of <persName>Weinman's</persName> medallic career, drawing
                    together elements from his earlier work in a perfect balance of strongly modeled, sculptural form and elegant, linear pattern ( <ref
                        target="#fig-118">fig. 12</ref> ). Although the powerful <pb n="172"/> eagle on the reverse of the coin resembles the one that
                        <persName>Weinman</persName> had sculpted for the 1909 AIA medal, the uplifted head of the bird creates a much stronger diagonal axis in
                    this composition, and it links the obverse and reverse of the coin thematically. Just as the sun rises in the image on the obverse, the
                    eagle on the reverse raises its head as if readying for flight. In comparison with the modeling of the reverse of the AIA medal, the
                    sharpness of contour and depth of relief achieved in the small format of the half dollar are extraordinary, surpassed only by the high
                    relief version of <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> twenty-dollar gold piece. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Weinman's</persName> design for the obverse of the half dollar is reminiscent of the earlier <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>
                    Purchase Medal in its use of the flag drapery encircling the figure of Liberty and the rising sun motif. The rising sun also figured in
                        <persName>Saint-Gaudens's</persName> design for the twenty-dollar gold piece. <persName>Liberty's</persName> striding pose echoes Roty's
                    "Semeuse" or "Sower" on the French two-franc piece, and it has been noted before that the choice of a French-inspired design on the eve of
                        <placeName>America's</placeName> entry into World War I was not merely a personal artistic statement. <persName>Weinman's</persName>
                    Walking <persName>Liberty</persName> is a beautiful figure. Her billowing swirls of drapery create a sense of flowing movement, echoing the
                    circular outline of the frame, and she strides forward with strength and purpose. As in many of <persName>Weinman's</persName> medallic
                    compositions, the figure overlaps the inscription, accentuating her stature, and the drapery spreads out to give her lower body breadth,
                    revealing the form beneath. In this relief, <persName>Weinman</persName> achieves a breathtaking synthesis of sweeping line, precise detail,
                    and sculptural volume. </p>
                <p> The American art medal reached its apogee in the years prior to World War I, and the War effectively marked the end of the renaissance of
                    medallic sculpture in this country. World War I did occasion an outpouring of decorations and commemorative medals, but the Beaux-Arts
                    tradition was ill-suited to expressing the horrors of a brutal, devastating war ( <persName>Jones</persName> , 1979, 152). Although
                        <persName>Weinman's</persName> 1920 War Service Medal for <persName>Mt. Sinai</persName> Hospital is one of the more successful American
                    war medals from an artistic standpoint, it illustrates the difficulties of adapting the classical, allegorical vocabulary to commemorating
                    the events of the war ( <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, 11, <ref target="#fig-118">fig. 12</ref> ) .The grace of the central figure in
                        <persName>Weinman's</persName> composition and the limp pathos of the warrior whom she protects from a menacing German soldier are
                    faithful to their Greco-Roman sources, but the stereotypical treatment of the theme limits its effectiveness. A series of pencil sketches
                    for the <persName>Mt. Sinai</persName> medal shows that <persName>Weinman</persName> considered several other compositions <pb n="173"/>
                    before settling on the grouping of three figures (HKW). At an earlier stage of the design, he placed the wounded figure in the lower
                    righthand corner, slumped in the posture of the famous Hellenistic sculpture of the <persName>Dying Gaul</persName> . The female figure
                    towered above him, holding a caduceus in one hand and raising the other arm to ward off the advance of the threatening enemy behind her. The
                    final design works more successfully in filling the circular format of the medal, and <persName>Weinman</persName> atypically adds the
                    suggestion of a battlefield setting in the lower corner to balance the composition. </p>

                    <graphic url="COAC13_173.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> Another group of more finished pencil sketches exists for a second medal commissioned by <persName>Mt. Sinai</persName> Hospital, the
                    Trusteeship Medal, "presented in recognition of 25 Years of Distinguished Service" ( <ref target="#fig-119">fig. 13</ref> ) (Undated; AAA).
                    Once again, in the search for a suitable obverse design, <persName>Weinman</persName> conceives of the composition in terms of monumental
                    groupings of allegorical figures. <ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> This severe Classicism runs as a thread through much of his later work,
                    which lacks the subtlety and grace of his earlier medals. </p>
                <p> In 1919, when the American Numismatic Society held a design composition for a new award medal to be presented annually to an outstanding
                    medalist, <persName>A.A. Weinman</persName> 's proposal was selected as the best among fifteen entries. <persName>Weinman's</persName>
                    classic design for the <persName>J. Sanford Saltus</persName> Medal set a high standard for the "signal achievement in the art of the <pb
                        n="174"/> medal" that the award celebrates ( <persName>Baxter</persName> 1987, cat. no. 182, illustrated p. 89). The restrained
                    composition, elegant line, and delicate modeling of the obverse, a symbolic representation of Medallic Art, complement the more vigorous
                    image of Pegasus on the reverse, which is effectively set off from the lengthy surrounding inscriptions by the use of a recessed field. </p>
                <p> Fittingly, <persName>Weinman</persName> himself was the second recipient of the Saltus Award in 1920, in recognition of his exceptional
                    contributions to medallic art. In his finest medallic work, <persName>A.A. Weinman</persName> transcended the limitations of a mode of
                    expression that would soon be regarded as irrelevant to the modern age. Recasting the classical vocabulary in his own terms,
                        <persName>Weinman</persName> created coins and medals that are a lasting tribute to his technical skill and innate aesthetic
                    sensibility. </p>

                <p> The abundant wealth of the <persName>Edwardian era</persName> , though concentrated in the hands of a few, provided the means for a
                    flowering of the arts that has not been matched since. It was in this world of privilege that <persName>Emil Fuchs</persName> made his mark
                    as an artist. Although overlooked today, a century ago <persName>Fuchs</persName> was on the verge of becoming a fashionable society artist.
                    His body of work includes approximately 50 medals, produced in <placeName>England</placeName> and the <placeName>United States</placeName> . </p>
                <p> In the introductory text, I will discuss only a portion of <persName>Fuchs's</persName> work. The accompanying catalogue is, however, as
                    complete as I have been able to compile. I began to accumulate information on these medals about ten years ago, and have long put off
                    publishing anything until now because there are so many questions for which I have not been able to find answers; not the least of which are
                    the identities of many of the small portrait medals <persName>Fuchs</persName> produced. However, the occasion of a second COAC on medals
                    has inspired me to publish what I have found in the hopes that someone might be able to provide additional information about the artist and
                    his work. </p>

                <p> For someone who had access to the highest levels of society, surprisingly little is known about <persName>Fuchs's</persName> life. He
                    appears to have destroyed virtually all private papers prior to his death, and is rarely mentioned in biographies and histories. Therefore,
                    most of the little we do know comes from his highly readable, but carefully guarded 1925 autobiography. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Emil Fuchs</persName> was born in <placeName>Vienna</placeName> in 1866 ( <ref target="#fig-120">fig. 1</ref> ). His father, who
                    was born in <placeName>Hungary</placeName> , married the <persName>boss's</persName> daughter and after moving to
                        <placeName>Vienna</placeName> became a reasonably successful businessman. In addition to an older brother who died prior to
                        <persName>Fuchs's</persName> birth, <persName>Fuchs</persName> had at least one sister, <persName>Renee</persName> ; neither sibling
                    ever married. Raised largely by his father, <persName>Fuchs</persName> entered the family business after leaving college. Finding he had
                    neither the inclination nor the ability for commerce, <persName>Fuchs</persName> obtained his father's permission and enrolled in the
                    Imperial Academy of Fine Arts where he studied sculpture and drawing. While at the Academy, <persName>Fuchs</persName> also studied piano at
                    the <placeName>Vienna</placeName> Conservatory ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> pp. 3-12). Thus began what <persName>Mark Jones</persName> so
                    aptly described as "a curious career as cosmopolitan, socialite and portraitist to the international rich" ( <persName>Jones</persName>
                    p.23). </p>
                <p> Shortly after the death of his parents in around 1888, <persName>Fuchs</persName> went to <placeName>Berlin</placeName> where he studied
                    under Professor <persName>Schaper</persName> . The Professor's remark that <persName>Fuchs</persName> "...knew nothing about sculpture"
                    apparently came as no surprise to the student ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> p.13). However, after some serious study,
                        <persName>Fuchs's</persName> abilities seems to have improved, so that during his two years in <placeName>Berlin</placeName> he was
                    awarded a number of minor commissions from the court and a traveling scholarship to Rome ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> pp.16-19). While in
                    Rome, <persName>Fuchs</persName> embarked upon a five year project of a marble statue entitled "Mother Love," for which he eventually
                    received a gold medal from the Art Association of <placeName>Munich</placeName> ( <ref target="#fig-121">fig. 2</ref> ). Described by Fuchs
                    as "a monument to the love and unflinching suffering of motherhood," it might also be described as Victorian sentimentality at its worst (
                        <persName>Fuchs</persName> pp. 25-30). Though poorly designed, it was well executed, and for our purposes, hints at the medallic work
                    which would soon follow. Within the pedestal of the statue were four bronze panels ( <ref target="#fig-122">fig. 3</ref> ); two in high
                    relief and two in relief that Fuchs described it as "a form of <hi rend="italic">relievo</hi> so low that it might almost be termed a
                    painting in stone. This is the most difficult. To distinguish the modeling at all, it has to be illuminated by sharp light which will throw
                    deep shadow. Its application is particularly well suited for medals and was practiced by Roty, Dupré and Bottée to best advantage" (
                        <persName>Fuchs</persName> p. 30). </p>

                </figure>
                <p> While in Rome, <persName>Fuchs</persName> received commissions for portraits and busts, including those from <persName>Alexandra
                        Ellis</persName> , daughter of <persName>Arthur Ellis</persName> , Equerry to the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> , and Mrs.
                        <persName>Carl Meyer</persName> , whose husband was the manager for the <placeName>London</placeName> Rothschilds. As the bust of Mrs.
                        <persName>Meyer</persName> could not be finished prior to her return to <placeName>London</placeName> , <persName>John Singer
                        Sergeant</persName> offered Fuchs the use of one of his <placeName>London</placeName> studios ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> p. 32). </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Fuchs</persName> arrived in <placeName>London</placeName> in the summer of 1897. Having soon set up his own studio in
                        <placeName>Kensington</placeName> , <persName>Fuchs</persName> continued to work on his bust of Mrs. <persName>Meyer</persName> , as
                    well as receive new commissions. He was also introduced to General <persName>Arthur Ellis</persName> and received a commission for a bust of
                    his youngest daughter ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> pp. 35-37). Beginning in 1898 <persName>Fuchs</persName> executed a series of small
                    portrait medals of <placeName>London</placeName> society. Among the first was a commission by <persName>Lady Randolph Churchill</persName>
                    shortly after the <pb n="181"/> return of her son <persName>Winston</persName> from <placeName>South Africa</placeName> (Catalogue no. 3).
                    According to <persName>Fuchs</persName> , she "commissioned me to make a small medal with the profiles of her two boys one on each side,
                    which she always wore around her neck. It was considered a novel idea and led to a sort of fashion..." ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> pp.
                    50-51). </p>

                </figure>
                <p> Other medals commissioned according to this "fashion" include two for the <persName>Rothschilds</persName> . Mrs. <persName>Leopold de
                        Rothschild</persName> commissioned a medal of her boys <persName>Anthony and Evelyn</persName> (catalogue no. 4), while <persName>Baron
                        Alphonse de Rothschild</persName> ordered one of his daughter <persName>Charlotte Beatrix</persName> , who married <persName>Maurice
                        Ephrussi</persName> (catalogue no. 25). Medals were struck <pb n="182"/> for Sir <persName>Ernest Cassel</persName> and his daughter
                        <persName>Maude</persName> , who was married to <persName>Wilfred Ashley</persName> (catalogue no. 2); their daughter
                        <persName>Edwina</persName> later married <persName>Lord Louis Mountbatten</persName> . The memorial to <persName>Maude
                        Ashley</persName> in <persName>Ramsey Cathedral</persName> by Fuchs includes the image from his medal of her (catalogue no. 9; <ref

                    <persName>Fuchs</persName> probably owed much of his popularity as a medalist to another patron, however, the <persName>Prince of
                        Wales</persName> . Shortly after the youngest <persName>Miss Ellis's</persName> engagement, <persName>Fuchs</persName> prepared a small
                    portrait medal of her father, which he attached to a small chain as a bracelet and presented as a wedding present (catalogue no. 1). Not
                    surprisingly, the General was <pb n="183"/> pleased with his portrait and ordered more, which he had placed in ashtrays, cigarette cases and
                    other small objects which were distributed as Christmas presents. Among the recipients was the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> , who
                    ordered a similar medal in June 1899. At one of the sittings, the Prince prepared two autographs with his initials and the date September 9,
                    1899 and requested that the medals be ready by that time (catalogue no. 6). Unfortunately, the significance of that date has so far proven
                    elusive. A second reverse was also paired with the same portrait, displaying the Prince's insignia of feathers and the date 1899 (catalogue
                    no. 7). One hundred such medals were ordered and distributed at Christmas of the same year ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> pp. 64-67). </p>
                <p> Additional commissions from the royal family followed the medal for the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> . One of these was for a large
                    silver medal depicting the Princess of Wales (catalogue no. 20). According to <persName>Fuchs</persName> , <persName>Alexandra</persName>
                    was greatly interested in the production of this medal. In a note dated December 6, 1900, <persName>Charlotte Knollys</persName> (Lady in
                    Waiting to the Princess of Wales) informed <persName>Fuchs</persName> that, "The Princess's favorite flower is the rose, but H.R.H. is very
                    anxious that you should make the background of the medal as <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> and delicate as the one in the 'War and Peace' <ref
                        target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> medal, which she admires particularly. I may tell you in confidence that the Princess does not wish to have her
                    name placed in <hi rend="italic">relief</hi> , as in the case of the reverse of the Prince's medal, as she thinks it makes it look hard and
                    cutting." In another note dated December 29, <persName>Knollys</persName> wrote, "The Princess says you were consulting together about the
                    inscription to be put on the back of her medal, so I write one line to tell you privately that I am sure the one she would like best would
                    be 'Princess of Pity,' as several of the newspapers have called her lately" ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> pp. 115-117). </p>
                <p> Not surprisingly, <persName>Fuchs</persName> adopted these suggestions. The Princess's name, found beneath the bust is incuse, and the
                    border design consisting of ribbons and roses is softly modelled. To complement the description of the "Princess of Pity" is the reverse
                    design of Faith, Hope and Charity. These medals, which were struck in two sizes, were used as Christmas presents in 1901. </p>
                <p> At the request of Queen <persName>Victoria</persName> , <persName>Fuchs</persName> produced two medals to mark the entry of her reign into
                    the new century. The larger of the two, which was also produced in two sizes, depicts a crowned bust of the Queen on the obverse, and a
                    figure standing on a globe and bearing a facsimile autograph on the reverse (catalogue no. 18). The second medal, a smaller, more informal
                    medal meant for the Queen's family, <pb n="184"/> portrays <persName>Victoria</persName> in the cloth cap she normally wore, and her
                    signature on the reverse (catalogue no. 17; Fuchs pp. 101-109). Shortly afterwards, in January 1901, Queen <persName>Victoria</persName>
                    died and was succeeded by her son, the <persName>Prince of Wales</persName> , now <persName>Edward VII</persName> . Along with the new reign
                    came additional commissions for <persName>Fuchs</persName> . </p>

                <p> On April 23, 1901 the King asked <persName>Fuchs</persName> his views concerning a coronation medal and soon received a commission for one
                    medal. Following a practice initiated with <persName>Victoria's</persName> Golden Jubilee in 1887, two official medals were issued, a table
                    medal for sale to collectors and a military medal to be awarded to participants. Basing his design on the <persName>St. Helena</persName>
                    medal, which was instituted under <persName>Napoleon III</persName> and awarded to veterans of <persName>Napoleon's</persName> campaigns (
                        <ref target="#fig-124">fig. 5</ref> ), <persName>Fuchs</persName> prepared two slightly different versions of the military medal (
                        <persName>Fuchs</persName> 161-162). The first, awarded to those who took part in the coronation ceremony, is slightly oval and depicts
                    crowned busts of <persName>Edward</persName> and <persName>Alexandra</persName> , left, within a border composed of laurel wreaths
                    surmounted by a crown; on the reverse is the royal cypher within a similar border (catalogue no. 32). A second version, on a round planchet
                    with the portraits reversed was issued to <persName>Lord Mayors</persName> and other civic officials who took part in the ceremonies
                    (catalogue no. 33). In comparison is the official commemorative medal by de Saulles ( <ref target="#fig-125">fig. 6</ref> ). Besides the
                    enormous difference in style, the cross on top of the crown is noteworthy; most artists depict the cross on top of the crown sideways so
                    that it is recognizable as a cross. In fact, when seen from the side, one would only see a vertical bar; <persName>Fuchs</persName> ,
                    despite his impressionistic style, often strove for accuracy in detail. </p>

                <p> Considering his relative obscurity today, it is perhaps surprising to note that some of <persName>Fuchs's</persName> medals were enormous
                    commercial successes. <persName>Elkington</persName> , which struck the military style coronation medals received permission to use the
                    reversed portraits on commercial medals. For this, Fuchs designed a reverse portraying a seated Britannia with Westminster Abbey in the
                    background. On the shield is the date of the coronation, June 26, 1902 (catalogue no. 34). When the King suffered an attack of acute
                    appendicitis, the date for both the coronation and the medal were changed to August 9. <persName>Elkington</persName> also paired the
                    obverse design with many local reverse dies. Altogether, some 950,000 medals were sold, although orders for 40,000 were canceled when the
                    King became ill ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> p. 162). </p>
                <pb n="186"/>
                <p> While in <placeName>England</placeName> , <persName>Fuchs</persName> also designed a number of medals relating to the Boer War. Three relate
                    to heroes of the war, General Sir <persName>Robert Baden-Powell</persName> (catalogue no. 26), <persName> Field Marshall Lord Roberts
                    </persName> (catalogue nos. 22 and 23) and General Sir <persName>George White</persName> (catalogue no. 24). In 1900
                        <persName>Fuchs</persName> prepared a medal marking the end of the war and bearing the inscription TO THE/ MEMORY OF THOSE/WHO GAVE
                    THEIR LIVES FOR/QUEEN AND COUNTRY (catalogue no. 21). In 1902, when the war finally did end, the medal was reissued, but with the new date
                    and the inscription changed to read KING AND COUNTRY (catalogue no. 36). </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Fuchs</persName> came to the <placeName>United States</placeName> for the first time in order to finish a portrait and began the
                    custom of spending his winters in <placeName>New York</placeName> , supplying art for the rich, though not necessarily discerning Americans
                    ( <persName>Fuchs</persName> p.188). In 1906 Fuchs received his first medallic commission in this country, a membership medal for the
                    Hispanic Society of <placeName>America</placeName> (catalogue no. 39). At the time, the Society consisted of up to 300 corresponding
                    members; between 1906 and 1924 they were awarded bronze membership medals. From those 300, no more than 100 members were named and presented
                    with silver medals (HSA p. 38). </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Fuchs</persName> produced a second medal for the Hispanic Society when he was commissioned to design their Medal of Arts and
                    Literature (catalogue no. 40). Approximately 4 inches in diameter, this impressive medal has been awarded since 1907 to "men and women
                    distinguished in the field of Hispanic art, history, or literature" (HSA p. 38). The obverse depicts the seated figure of Inspiration
                    surrounded by eight female figures representing the arts, while on the reverse is a Genius seated on a sarcophagus, kissing a standing
                    female. This medal was first struck by <persName>Tiffany</persName> &amp; Co., and later by the Medallic Art Co.. </p>
                <p> Between 1908 and 1913, <persName>Fuchs</persName> designed three medals for the American Numismatic Society. The first was a double
                    commemorative honoring both the 50th anniversary of the A.N.S. and its President, <persName>Archer M. Huntington</persName> (catalogue no.
                    41). During the Fiftieth Anniversary meeting <ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>
                    <persName>Huntington</persName> cancelled the Society's $25,000. loan, leaving the Society free from debt ( <persName>Adelson</persName> pp.
                    148-150). A resolution by <persName>George F. Kunz</persName> was unanimously adopted calling for a medal in
                        <persName>Huntington's</persName> honor bearing a portrait of <persName>Huntington</persName> on the obverse and a picture of the new
                    building on the reverse. Although <persName>Victor D. Brenner</persName> had previously submitted some sketches for just such a medal to
                        <persName>Bauman Belden</persName> for circulation among the members of the committee on medals, the commission was eventually given to
                        <pb n="187"/>
                    <persName>Fuchs</persName> . In keeping with <persName>Huntington's</persName> wishes, his portrait was not used. On the obverse, therefore,
                    is a coining press with a male figure on either side while a third male is seated in front examining a coin; above is the inscription
                        <persName>ARCHER MILTON HUNTINGTON</persName> MEDAL. On the reverse a standing female figure holds a scroll upon which is a
                    representation of the Society's building and an appropriate inscription noting the organization's 50th anniversary. One gold medal was
                    struck and presented to <persName>Huntington</persName> ; of the eleven silver specimens struck, one was reserved for the Society's cabinet.
                    Since 1918, silver specimens have been awarded to individuals in recognition of outstanding achievement in numismatic scholarship. In
                    addition, bronze medals were both offered for sale to members and presented to contributors to the Exhibition of <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> Coins held from January 17 to February 18, 1914, and to the Exhibition of March 26 to May 15, 1914 (
                        <persName>Adelson</persName> pp. 175-177). </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Fuchs's</persName> second medal on behalf of the American Numismatic Society was struck in 1909 to mark the
                        <persName>Hudson-Fulton</persName> Celebration (catalogue no. 42). Issued in conjunction with the <persName>Hudson-Fulton</persName>
                    Celebration Commission, it was struck in six sizes in a variety of medals, and might rank as the most common of all <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> commemorative medals, with a total of 124,698 struck. The obverse portrays <persName>Hudson</persName> and his men on
                    the deck of his ship, the <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Halve Maene</persName>
                    </hi> , while the reverse depicts allegorical representations of Steam Navigation, History and Commerce beneath a portrait of
                        <persName>Robert Fulton</persName> ; in the background are views of <placeName>New York</placeName> in 1807 and 1909 (
                        <persName>Adelson</persName> pp. 177-178). </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Fuchs</persName> went to great lengths to insure the accuracy of design of this medal including several trips to
                        <placeName>Holland</placeName> to obtain official sanction for his portrayal of the <hi rend="italic">Half Moon.</hi> Surprisingly, the
                    greatest difficulty seems to have come from the name of the ship; after the determination that the proper spelling was 'Halve Maene,' dies
                    were prepared, only to have papers received from <placeName>Holland</placeName> illustrating the reproduction of
                        <persName>Hudson's</persName> ship, the 'Halve Maen.' Frantic cables to Dutch authorities confirmed their original determination that
                    the name of the ship should include the final 'e' ( <persName>Adelson</persName> pp. 179-180). Similar problems arose with the depiction of
                    the Claremont; after the plaster models were delivered to the die sinker, they were altered twice as changes were made in the construction
                    of the replica of the ship ( <persName>Adelson</persName> p. 180). </p>
                <p> In 1913 <persName>Fuchs</persName> was commissioned to design a medal in memory of <persName>John Pierpont Morgan</persName> , who had died
                    earlier that year (catalogue no. <pb n="188"/> 43). According to the Society's annual report for 1913, the medal was issued in recognition
                    of <persName>Morgan's</persName> work in support of art <hi rend="italic">(ANS Proceedings</hi> , p.12). Struck in the exceedingly low
                    relief which characterizes many of <persName>Fuchs's</persName> medals, the obverse depicts the facade of a building with four columns; from
                    a niche in the center descends Art; the allegorical groups on either side represent painting and sculpture. On the reverse, flanked by
                    allegorical figures representing Fame and Industry, is a plaque with the simple inscription <persName>JOHN/PIERPONT/MORGAN</persName> . The
                    single gold specimen was presented to Mr. <persName>Morgan's</persName> family and resides in the famed library today; additional specimens
                    in bronze and silver were, as usual, available for purchase. </p>
                <p> For a number of years <persName>Fuchs</persName> divided his time between <placeName>England</placeName> and the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> . He had previously suffered verbal attacks as a foreigner when he was commissioned to design the new postage stamps
                    for <persName>Edward VII</persName> . Now, even though a naturalized British subject, he suffered even more as a result of the anti-German
                    feeling prevalent after the start of World War I. In this he was not alone; even <persName>George V</persName> was not exempt. <persName>H.
                        G. Wells</persName> , who had urged the formation of Republican societies, referred to the Court as "alien and uninspiring." In his
                    characteristic bluntness, the king remarked "I may be uninspiring but I'll be damned if I'm an alien!" ( <persName>Edwards</persName> p.
                    300). <persName>Fuchs</persName> decided to wait out the war in the <placeName>United States</placeName> . When, after the armistice he had
                    written to a friend <ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> to see if popular feelings had changed, he was advised to wait a year or so (
                        <persName>Fuchs</persName> p. 175). By that time, <persName>Fuchs</persName> had become engaged in another project and eventually gave
                    up the idea of returning to <placeName>England</placeName> , <ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> and was naturalized as a <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> citizen in 1924 (Petition). </p>
                <p> The end of World War I was marked not only by <persName>Fuchs's</persName> disappointment in not returning to <placeName>England</placeName>
                    , but also by a commemorative plaquette issued by <persName>Cartier</persName> (catalogue no. 44). World War I changed the popular notion of
                    war from that of a gentlemanly pursuit to an act of horror. This change is reflected in <persName>Fuchs's</persName> work; whereas the Boer
                    War medal depicts war and its resultant deaths in sentimental terms, the World War I medal depicts it as something more graphic and
                    personal. </p>
                <p> Even though he was now living in a republic, <persName>Fuchs</persName> had not given up on his attachment to the upper class, producing
                    medals for the <persName>Cartier</persName> and <persName>Heinz</persName> families, as well as a number of corporate pieces. One of these,
                    for the <persName>H. J. Heinz</persName> Company, was struck in gold for presentation to those employees who had served the company twelve
                    years (catalogue no. 46). First issued in 1922, over 500 medals were issued <pb n="189"/> the first year ( <hi rend="italic">The
                        Numismatist</hi> , May 1922 p. 235). </p>
                <p> In 1926 Fuchs produced two medals for the <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>New York</placeName> Times; </hi> one was for The National Oratorical Contest on the Constitution of the <persName>United
                        States</persName> , open to all students in secondary schools (catalogue no. 55). The country was divided into seven regions, each under
                    the sponsorship of a different newspaper. The region for the <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>New York</placeName> Times </hi> consisted of the Metropolitan area and parts of <placeName>New York State, New
                        Jersey</placeName> and <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> . Students in each of 64 districts submitted essays on any of ten subjects
                    related to the Constitution, with each school picking its own winner. The winners would then compete at the district, regional, national and
                    international level. Although cash prizes were awarded to all winners at the district level and higher, medals were presented to the winners
                    at each school. </p>
                <p> According to the report on the oratorical contest, response to the contest was one of optimistic enthusiasm; of the 417 schools entered,
                    only 275 produced actual candidates for competition. Nationally, an estimated 15,000 students participated. Although a number of suggestions
                    were made that separate contests be held for boys and girls, the idea was rejected; to quote the report "But the holding of dual contests
                    would be a tremendous, if not unworkable, proposition. Boys and girls nowadays are supposed to enjoy equality in all things - why not in
                    competition?" (Report "Separating Boys and Girls"). </p>
                <p> The second <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> medal, for the Intercollegiate Current Events Contest (catalogue no. 56), was instituted to

                    that "In the present tendency in sculpture in <placeName>America</placeName> I notice a leaning of a group of gifted young sculptors towards

                    exact nature of his illness was kept from him, <persName>Fuchs</persName> knew he was dying. He left a note to his sister which read: <q>
                        Dear <persName>Renee</persName> : </q>
                    <q> You can see with your own eyes that I am going down every day. You would not like to see me wasting away much more. As it is now, I am
                        already a burden to myself and a burden to my surroundings. </q>
                    <q> There are moments in life when we have to accept in humble resignation what is decreed to us. To live longer would only mean prolonging

                <p> Upon his death, <persName>Fuchs</persName> was described by his secretary as "modest, sensitive. He would never consent to have his picture
                    taken. He would not even sit for a portrait for any of his best artist friends. I only know of one picture of him—although there are

                            I have placed it under 1900; the date on the medal itself. A number of pieces, such as the 1902 coronation medal, indicate a design
                            which predates issuance; in such cases I have placed the medals in the year of the event noted. However, in cases such as the
                            Roberts medals, where there is no clear indication of a specific event, I have used, when indicated, the date placed with the

                        <p> This medal was extremely popular, with 950,000 having been sold at the time the coronation was postponed due to the King having been
                            stricken with an attack of appendicitis. As a result, orders for 40,000 were cancelled. The 64mm medal is also seen with the date of
                            the actual coronation, 9 August 1902. The obverse was paired with many local reverse dies, and the large number of medals ordered
                            presumably includes these. </p>

                        <p> Officially, there is no obverse or reverse. According to <persName>Edward D. Adams</persName> "By reason of the importance and
                            distinctive character of each design, neither supplementing the other, and because the events commemorated occurred two hundred
                            years apart, the faces of the medal do not properly come under the customary designation of obverse and reverse. There is no reverse
                            to describe or illustrate the obverse; each side is complete by itself. Chronologically the Hudson side would be the obverse and the
                            Fulton side the reverse. Practically this technical relation will change according to the artistic tastes or sympathies of the
                            observer. In order to facilitate the exhibition and examination of each <pb n="218"/> side, from time to time, as may be desired,
                            some of the cases prepared by the Commission for the presentation examples have been made to hang or stand, so that the medal may be
                            reversed in position" (Hall p. 82). </p>

                        <p> Issued by Cartier, the bronze medals were priced at $10. and the silver at $20. Fuchs had previously submitted a design to the
                            American Numismatic Society for its Peace medal. The Society eventually awarded the commission to Chester Beach. Although there is
                            no documentation to support this theory, it is possible that this medal reflects that rejected design. </p>

                <p> The turn of the twentieth century in the United States saw an unprecedented rise of interest in medallic art. One of the most intriguing
                    manifestations of this interest was the formation of a group called the Circle of Friends of the Medallion, organized by <persName>Charles
                        De Kay</persName> and <persName>Robert Hewitt</persName> Jr. in 1909. The Circle was an organization with one goal in mind: to support
                    the production and appreciation of medallic art. Or in the words of Charles De Kay, "It has been the aim of the founders of this little
                    circle to call the attention of American sculptors and art amateurs to sculpture in the miniature, with the hope that in the course of time
                    improvements will be made in our coinage and our monuments" (De Kay). The background of the Circle has been detailed before; I intend to
                    concentrate on the role of Charles De Kay in its founding, and more importantly, its character as regards the dissemination of aesthetic
                    taste in the United States during the early years of the twentieth century. </p>
                <p> To briefly summarize the history of the Circle: <persName>Robert Hewitt</persName> , real estate speculator, long-time numismatist, and one
                    of the founders of the American Numismatic Society, came up with the idea of issuing a series of medals which probably developed as a result
                    of his travels to Europe and from the success of his private issuance of a Lincoln commemorative medal bound in a book. In Europe he was
                    able to see the products of two societies, the Société des Amis de la Medaille Franéaise in <placeName>Paris</placeName> , and the Société
                    Hollandaise Beige des Amis de la Medaille d'Art in Brussels, both of which issued medals in this fashion. At some point, and the details are
                    sketchy, <persName>Hewitt and De Kay</persName> came together, and began working on a project that would culminate in the Circle.
                        <persName>De Kay</persName> was the perfect person to work with <persName>Hewitt</persName> . He was very well known in <placeName>New
                        York</placeName> literary and cultural circles. He was a graduate of Yale, wrote poetry, served as the literary and art critic for the
                        <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>New York</placeName> Times </hi> from 1877 to 1894, and had a second career as a frequenter and founder of clubs. Among those
                    he was influential in founding were the Author's Club in 1881, the Fencers' Club in 1888, the National Sculpture Society in 1893, and the
                    National Arts Club in 1898. While Hewitt provided the funds for the organization, <persName>De Kay</persName> was responsible for publicity,
                    and authored most of the texts that accompanied each issue. He provided the contacts and the organizational know-how to launch the fledgling
                    Circle. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>De Kay</persName> and <persName>Hewitt</persName> envisioned a charter membership of several hundred individuals interested in
                    small sculpture and medallic art. It was intended that the membership would receive medals and perhaps <pb n="237"/> little bas-reliefs or
                    statuettes. An early announcement of the Circle stated, "Such small portable works for the library and office do more than monuments to give
                    people a feel for sculpture and form the habit of looking at art works with understanding and appreciation" ( <hi rend="italic">Art
                        News</hi> 1910). The name for the organization was chosen to reflect the hope that "from a modest beginning it may extend its influence
                    in all directions, like the widening circle a stone makes when it plumps into still water" (De Kay 1913). De Kay wrote of the Circle at the
                    time of the issuance of Isidor Konti's medal in honor of the Home, <q> Little organizations of this kind, of which the public rarely hears,
                        perform a serious work in the encouragement of art. Though it may be true that the great artists of the Renaissance flourished
                        principally by reason of the support received from munificent patrons—aristocrats of Church and State—in our different times it is very
                        appropriate that the individual patron should be partly relieved by an organization of patrons working for the best interests of art,
                        with the wisdom which mutual council gives (De Kay). </q>
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p> The first medal was issued in September 1909, to coincide with the Hudson-Fulton Celebration; the second appeared in May 1910. In total, 12
                    medals were issued, approximately two per year (see Appendix). <ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> The works were distributed to the membership of
                    the Circle, who paid ten dollars a year in dues, and received their medals <pb n="238"/> bound in a book with accompanying text written, for
                    the most part, by <persName>De Kay</persName> . <ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> By April 1910, the charter membership had reached 448, and
                    included individuals from a wide variety of cultural and social spheres. Among its distinguished members were Alexander Graham Bell,
                    inventor; <persName>Archer Milton Huntington</persName> , philanthropist; <persName>Louis Comfort Tiffany</persName> , artist and designer;
                        <persName>Leonard Forrer</persName> , numismatist; <persName>R. Tait McKenzie</persName> , sculptor; and four of the artists who created
                    medals for the circle, to name just a few. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-163">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_238.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> The process of selecting a design for issuance in medallic form was left in the hands of the Circle's Art Committee. The Committee would
                    choose a subject, and then ask a particular sculptor to work up a design. If that sculptor saw something in the subject, he would make a
                    sketch; if not, he would come up with his own subject and design. As De Kay wrote, "The object is to get the best a man has in him" (De Kay
                    1913). The choice of sculptors was by commission, not by competition. </p>
                <p> De Kay's motives in co-founding the Circle were many and varied. He was concerned with the role of artists in contemporary American society,
                    the role of art in the same, the aesthetic education of the public, and the furtherance of an appreciation of sculpture, specifically in the
                    form of medallic art. In one of the many articles he authored, <persName>De Kay</persName> discussed the role of artists in contemporary
                    society. <q> The problem for our artists consists in making their products popular in the higher sense, not vulgarly popular, but adapted to
                        the present needs of their fellow-countrymen. Portraits and mural paintings ordered by municipality or private citizen meet this problem
                        so far as they go. But their scope is very limited....[T]he ordinary well-to-do citizen is far from feeling the need of sculpture and
                        painting as an integral part of the surroundings of his home. One reason for this fact is the aloofness of painters and sculptors from
                        the daily life of the communities in which they live....Our artists should realize the situation and meet it. For one thing they should
                        react against their very unfortunate but very natural ten- <pb n="239"/> dency to segregate themselves into small circles, or retire
                        entirely to themselves in their studios. They should remember that, no matter what particular phrase or school of art they admire and
                        try to work in, there is a larger aspect of the problem in which these things sink to the second plane ( <persName>De Kay</persName>
                        1900a, 23). </q>
                </p>
                <p> In other words, <persName>De Kay</persName> believed artists must learn to embrace other disciplines/professions and their practitioners.
                    Doing so would enable them to stay in touch with the tastes of their audience, thereby remaining viable. By creating works like medals to be
                    distributed to a wide audience, sculptors would literally be making themselves more relevant to contemporary American society. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>De Kay</persName> realized that there were two sides to this discussion. He also believed that lay people needed to become
                    involved in aesthetic appreciation. Therefore, to explain his interest in the founding of an organization like the Circle, De Kay wrote, <q>
                        Although the issuing of medals has increased greatly in this country in recent years, sculptors feel the need of a wider education of
                        the public in that branch of their art. Such organizations as the Circle of Friends of the Medallion and the Numismatic Society, while
                        their medals appeal especially to the artist and the collector, also hope to foster a proper interest and appreciation among laymen. For
                        a collection of medallions and other small bas-reliefs is apt to promote a taste for and an understanding of sculpture ( <persName>De
                            Kay</persName> ). </q>
                </p>
                <p> In publication after publication De Kay tried to impress upon numismatists the aesthetic value of their treasured objects. In order to fully
                    appreciate medals, their clubs and societies should look at them from the viewpoint of the artist. To illustrate the importance of an
                    aesthetic appreciation of medals, he made pointed references to the societies in Paris, Brussels and Vienna as precursors to the Circle.
                    What would make the Circle different however, was the mounting of the medals in a book, which not only made the works easier to forward to
                    the membership, but was also done for the convenience of those without a wall-case or other piece of furniture designed for displaying
                    medals. </p>
                <p> The role of medallic art in daily life was a topic that occupied much of <persName>De Kay's</persName> time. He wrote, <q> It is indeed
                        remarkable what a hold small sculpture—whether in the round or in high relief or in plaque and medal—has taken on modern life....
                        Perhaps the growth of great cities has something <pb n="240"/> to do with [the increase of interest in small works]. Certainly it has
                        become more and more costly to own city homes which have sufficient wall space for large paintings....But even small easel pictures find
                        scant wall accommodation in the homes of the cliff-dwellers' of <placeName>New York</placeName> . There is still room, however, for a
                        fine medallion or medal, a bit of animal bronze, or a figurine for the mantel or table ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1909, 25). </q>
                </p>
                <p> Obviously, <persName>De Kay</persName> saw medallic art, in which he had a vested interest, as a way of introducing art into the home. This
                    is just another example from De Kay's writings that illustrate his many motives for co-founding the Circle. </p>
                <p> As part of his role within the Circle, <persName>De Kay</persName> authored many articles publicizing the medals. One of the more
                    interesting was published in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> in 1913. <persName>De Kay</persName> offered these words: <q> [The]
                        seven pieces [issued so far] are truly works of fine art wrought by our own sculptors, each working according to his own method. The
                        result is no stereotyped series, but in every instance the expression of a separate individual....There is no other society like the
                        Circle which devotes itself to the spreading of a love of sculpture in relief among amateurs and stimulates artists to work in this
                        charming branch ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1913a, 136). </q>
                </p>
                <p> In the same spirit of publicity <persName>De Kay</persName> also published articles on <persName>Isidor Konti</persName> and
                        <persName>Sigurd Neandross</persName> , two of the medalists commissioned by the Circle. Konti's medal, issued in 1910, was described by
                        <persName>De Kay</persName> as striking the fancy of connoisseurs. "Konti's medal has made a very real appeal....[T]hough the subject
                    lends itself easily to dramatic treatment, the sculptor...has been particularly fortunate in the simplicity and sincerity of his work" (
                        <persName>De Kay</persName> ). <persName>Sigurd Neandross</persName> , who designed the 8th issue in 1913, was a sculptor whom
                        <persName>De Kay</persName> greatly admired. "He belongs to the rarer kind of sculptor who makes one think....He is a sculptor with
                    temperament who goes his own way, endeavoring to express lovely and innocent and poetic feelings to the best of his ability through his
                    chosen art" ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1914, xxii.). </p>
                <p> He also discussed some of the other medals in articles devoted to such topics as "fine art in medals." Of the power of <persName>John
                        Mowbray-Clarke's Saint Brendan</persName> to appeal to the public he wrote, "The sculptor...has imagined the doughty Saint as a man
                    better suited to steer a ship and swing a spear than to expound the Christian faith to men and women of peace." Of <persName>Victor David
                        Brenner's</persName> Motherhood medal he had this to say: "By bringing out the Motherhood medal the <pb n="241"/> Circle seems to wish
                    to accentuate the policy of departing now and again from the custom of reserving medals and plaques as honors for individuals. It is well to
                    remember that sculpture on a small scale has a wider scope than merely portraiture or the commemoration of events in history" ( <persName>De
                        Kay</persName> 1911,21). The first medal issued by the Circle was obviously dear to De Kay's heart, and he wrote of it, <persName>John
                        Flanagan's</persName>
                    <persName>Hudson-Fulton</persName> medal, "Here we find, in the delicate modeling of Fulton's profile, the contrast between
                        <persName>Elizabethan ruff</persName> and <persName>Georgian jabot</persName> , the dignity given to the lettering; how differently from
                    a painter a sculptor will treat a theme" ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1909, 25). This last comment was directed at the official medal of
                    the Celebration, by <persName>Emil Fuchs</persName> . <persName>De Kay</persName> does not seem to have approved of Fuchs's medal; he wrote,
                        <q> the official is pictorial and popular, while the Circle's will appeal to those who have learned by study to appreciate the
                        sculpturesque side of such small works of art. Viewed from the sculptor's camp, the modelling of the Fuchs medal is soft and evasive in
                        form, while the <persName>Flanagan</persName> attacks the problem and carries it out to the best of the sculptor's ability. The painter
                        tries skillfully to evade the difficulty of human figures and draperies, and enlists interest in the general picture; the sculptor,
                        while he does not solve these problems at all points in the very best way, does not avoid the issue, but meets them as they rise (
                            <persName>De Kay</persName> 1909, 25). </q>
                    <q> De Kay's comments on the Circle's medals reveal a not unexpected bias in their favor; at the same time, however, they express a
                        heartfelt belief in the relevance of the Circle and its mission. </q>
                </p>
                <p> Of interest is how <persName>De Kay</persName> came to be so actively involved with the Circle. As mentioned, <persName>De Kay</persName>
                    was a strong force in the organization of a number of institutions in <placeName>New York</placeName> in the late years of the nineteenth
                    century. Two of these organizations, the National Sculpture Society and the National Arts Club, figure prominently in this investigation. </p>
                <p> The National Sculpture Society, of which almost all of the Circle's medalists were members, was conceived as a counterpart to the
                    specialized artists' clubs and societies that set exhibitions as their priority, and as a professional society that could control quality
                    and set standards. Because of its priorities, personalities, and relationships with other organizations, it relied on the involvement of
                    non-sculptors. <persName>De Kay</persName> was instrumental in convincing sculptor <persName>Frederic Ruckstull</persName> help him develop
                    the idea for the Society after hearing of an "altercation" over the poor placement of Ruckstull's works at a Society of American Artists
                    exhibition. <persName>Ruckstull</persName> had persuaded <persName>De Kay</persName> that sculpture shown with <pb n="242"/> painting would
                    never receive the kind of installation it deserved. In turn, De Kay became convinced that a sculpture society that held its own exhibitions
                    would solve these kinds of problems, and convinced <persName>Ruckstull</persName> to help him organize it. In order to recruit members they
                    needed to overcome the sense of individualism felt by American sculptors. <persName>De Kay</persName> and <persName>Ruckstull</persName>
                    were afraid that the idea of a society devoted exclusively to sculpture would sound too commercial and nonprofessional and it would be
                    impossible to get sculptors to join. After securing the cooperation of <persName>Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> , <persName>Olin Levi
                        Warner</persName> and <persName>John Quincy Adams</persName> Ward, De Kay became the primary force behind the organizational drive. He
                    sent invitations to prospective members, inviting them to an organizational meeting at the home of his brother-in-law and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Century</hi> editor <persName>Richard Watson Gilder</persName> . As a result of his efforts, the Society became a reality on May 30,
                    1893. <ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref> Of primary interest is the fact that De Kay was instrumental in pushing lay participation. As
                        <persName>Michelle Bogart</persName> has pointed out, "An American sculpture society could not be like those of
                        <placeName>Europe</placeName> ; it had to be in keeping with the distinctive social and political framework of a democratic republic to
                    advance truly national forms of artistic expression" (Bogart 1989, 53). The American artists' organizations that were forming during these
                    years were closing the gap between art and the larger public, both well-to-do and working class. This broad public was, in De Kay's view,
                    the American audience for art. A society like the NSS, with lay members who were asked to share the burden of "keeping their society alive"
                    better suited, in De Kay's view, the social and political ideas of Americans. These lay people would act as the backing for the artists,
                    drumming up support, acting as spokesmen. In defending the NSS De Kay wrote, "What country other than ours has arrived at any period at such
                    a pitch of the cultivation and subdivision in the cultivation of the fine arts as to establish a separate society for sculptors, and to give
                    independent exhibitions of sculpture without the aid of painting or some other of the more popular arts?...We are better off as we are than
                        <placeName>France</placeName> or <placeName>Germany</placeName> , and the proof is that the biennial exhibitions of the National
                    Sculpture Society surpass anything the old countries have to show" (De Kay 1898, 140). The presence of laymen within the Society was of
                    primary importance to <persName>De Kay</persName> . He wrote, "With a wider and deeper feeling for the arts, the world of amateurs will take
                    more interest in bronzes for the decoration of houses within and without....To aid the spread of this taste is one of the objects of the
                    National Sculpture Society, which seeks to encourage the making of figurines and small <pb n="243"/> groups that come within the means of
                    people of moderate fortune...." ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1895, 112). </p>
                <p> The second, and more relevant, organization which De Kay was instrumental in founding was the National Arts Club. More relevant because, for
                    its entire existence, the Circle was headquartered at the Club and, in fact, the Club was designed with artists and lay people equally in
                    mind. The Club was conceived in a conversation between <persName>De Kay</persName> and <persName>John DeWitt Warner</persName> , President
                    of the Reform Club of <placeName>New York</placeName> , after a February 1898 meeting of the National Sculpture Society, of which they were
                    both members. <persName>De Kay</persName> , while serving as the American Consul-General in Berlin from 1894 to 1897, had noted the
                    eagerness of European governments to encourage, through exhibitions, the application of art to industry in order to enable them to keep in
                    touch with movements in other countries. By June of 1898 the National Arts Club was incorporated. </p>
                <p> The United States was, in the late years of the nineteenth century, a recent entry into the arena of the application of art to industry. No
                    American museums were devoted to it, there were no societies to look after the interests of those practicing it. The National Arts Club was
                    founded specifically to remedy this situation. The mission of the Club was threefold: first, to champion applied and decorative arts;
                    second, to create an organization that crossed existing arts organizational boundaries; and third, to encourage the participation of lay
                    people in the arts community. One observer wrote, <q> There are abundant purposes a truly National Arts Club might cherish, abundant aims it
                        might set before it. There is the encouragement of industries on which art has been expended, leaving the fine arts to the established
                        societies and clubs. There is the giving of exhibitions of special work, at which employers of skilled labor could see which designers
                        and workers are inventive and talented, and artists and art students pick up suggestions for bread-winning. There is the binding
                        together with the bonds of a common interest the art lovers of the whole country, enabling men and women from San Francisco and New
                        Orleans when visiting <placeName>New York</placeName> to find themselves in congenial atmosphere, if they are amateurs themselves, and
                        giving manufacturers of the most varied sort ideas how to handle their products so as to surpass their rivals abroad ( <hi rend="italic"
                            >Critic</hi> 1899, 350-351). </q>
                </p>
                <p> The National Arts Club was founded in an effort to bring the layman in touch with the connoisseur, and the artist and craftsman with <pb
                        n="244"/> both. A 1909 article in the <hi rend="italic">Craftsman</hi> discussing the Club cited Victor David Brenner as an example of
                    the ideal member. "Ever enthusiastic, sincere, and a loyal and hard worker, his influence is widely felt as something constructive and in
                    accord with the Club's ideals. On the walls of the club rooms hangs a permanent exhibition of Brenner's work, which cannot but have an
                    uplifting influence upon medallic art in this country" (Teall 1909, 613). We can extrapolate this praise of the influence of Brenner's work
                    to those lay people who visited the Club and could not help but see the artist's work so prominently displayed. The singling out of
                        <persName>Brenner</persName> also indicates the importance of medallic art within the Club. We can only credit De Kay with fostering
                    this atmosphere. </p>
                <p> The role of the artist within the larger artistic community, and the Circle of Friends, was a problem that De Kay often wrote about. The
                    lack of recognition of American artists, caused by their self-segregation, was the cause, <persName>De Kay</persName> believed, for our
                    disadvantageous position when compared to <placeName>Europe</placeName> . "The prestige of European art is against us;...the American artist
                    and artisan must exert themselves more than their European brothers" ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1900, 85). And yet the fact that art was
                    not so familiar in the United States gave Americans an advantage, a greater freedom of mind from prejudice and tradition. "In other words,
                    the United States should be a very open field for experiments in the fine arts, and especially in the industrial, because the innovator here
                    should find less of tradition, less of prejudice to encounter" ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1900, 85). <persName>De Kay</persName> saw the
                    trend in <placeName>Europe</placeName> toward centralization of the arts, specifically the role European governments played; the situation
                    in this country, however, was different. There was just as much activity to be found in <placeName>Chicago</placeName> ,
                        <placeName>Boston</placeName> , <persName>St. Louis</persName> , etc. as in <placeName>New York</placeName> . Annual exhibitions and
                    exhibition organizations were, <persName>De Kay</persName> believed, a hindrance because they tended to substitute official and routine art
                    for the natural expression of a nation. Also, one large exhibit, like those held by the Royal Academy in <placeName>London</placeName> , or
                    even the National Academy of Design in <placeName>New York</placeName> , compelled the formation of huge exhibitions which defeated their
                    own object by their very size. Traditional European shows catered to a specific audience, one very unlike that to be found in the United
                    States. "What we are after in the United States is to close the gap between art and the great body of people, not merely the wealthy, or the
                    well-to-do, but the anxious, hard-working public" ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1900, 89). But art would never be healthy here until the
                    public recognized artists the way it did lawyers and merchants. "What <pb n="245"/> we should do is to look about for some kind of an
                    organization that exactly fits our ideas, social and political, and appeals to the sentiments and habits of thought of our own people, and
                    avoids any clash with the opinions of the public at large, in so far as no artistic principle is involved and the concession can be made
                    with dignity" ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1900, 90). The success of the NSS could be found in its appeal, from the start, to the lay
                    public. The National Arts Club was the next step. "It shows that Americans are realizing very keenly the honor which great artists confer
                    upon the country, and their duty in assisting the development of the national arts on the broadest lines" ( <persName>De Kay</persName>
                    1900, 95). </p>
                <p> By headquartering the Circle within the National Arts Club, <persName>De Kay</persName> was declaring not only the validity of medallic art,
                    but also the relationship between medallic art, as the representative of the "fine" arts, and applied art. <persName>De Kay</persName> was
                    quoted by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> as saying, "It is for the art lovers of this great city to call attention to the neglect of these
                    forms of art which, for reasons that I need not specify, are ranked by so many people lower than what are called sometimes, the pure arts,
                    such as easel painting and sculpture, and I maintain that even those who strenuously deny that they are art lovers, or know anything about
                    art, should feel it their duty to help art lovers to correct this neglect because it has become a matter of patriotism" (NYT 1899, 5). </p>
                <p> No understanding of the impact of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion can be gained without thoroughly examining De Kay's general
                    aesthetic attitudes, available to us, fortunately, through the numerous articles published by <persName>De Kay</persName> on both
                    non-medallic and medallic art. </p>
                <p> To appreciate what <persName>De Kay</persName> has to say about medallic art and the sculptors who practice it, we must look briefly at his
                    comments on artists in general. He believed, and rightly so, that artists in the United States did not hold the position in society that
                    they should. "So little weight do artists...carry in the general estimation that it is very common to see long accounts in the papers of
                    monuments and wall paintings opened for the first time to public view without a mention of the men who designed them" ( <persName>De
                        Kay</persName> 1900a). The social status of artists was lower in the United States than in <placeName>Europe</placeName> because they
                    were neglected and overlooked. Only a small segment of the population had the aesthetic knowledge to appreciate and understand the output of
                    Americas artists. "...Painting and sculpture, like music, must be enjoyed for their own sake, on their own merits, after considerable
                    acquaintance with the best ancient and modern examples and with the distinct perception that they are things by themselves, have a language
                        <pb n="246"/> of their own, and to be truly relished must have from their admirers just as true and faithful service as lovers of other
                    arts give to their special affection...." ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1900a). </p>
                <p> The example of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion in regards to De Kay's ideas about organization among artists is instructive. The
                    choice of sculptors who were almost primarily known as medalists, and the awarding of, with one exception, only one commission to each
                    artist, was a way of creating variety, of introducing a large number of practitioners to a wide audience. By commissioning so many different
                    sculptors, the Circle was attempting to elevate the role of the sculptor within American culture. The choice of subjects also serves the
                    same purpose. The subjects of the Circle's medals ran the gamut from commemorations of historic events (
                        <persName>Mowbray-Clarke's</persName> Centennial of American and British peace) to portraits of relatively obscure historical figures (
                        <persName>Louis Potter's Abdul Baha</persName> ) to difficult to classify subjects ( <persName>Brenner's</persName> medal celebrating
                    Motherhood.) </p>
                <p> The social set which <persName>De Kay</persName> frequented was hinged around his brother-in-law, <persName>Richard Watson Gilder</persName>
                    . For this group, art served an indispensable purpose in a materialistic age. It had to be beautiful, in "good taste," and exist independent
                    of any moral message. The style favored by Gilder, <persName>De Kay</persName> and their circle was a realism tempered by idealism, a not
                    uncommon preference of the period. In an 1890 article on Albert Pinkham Ryder, an artist whose work fit their description perfectly,
                        <persName>De Kay</persName> wrote, "But perhaps American art, like American mechanics, literature, politics, has a mission of its own.
                    Perhaps it may teach the great lesson in the Fine Arts which the United States is teaching in many other fields — individuality, freedom,
                    rejection of authority of any one school." <ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref> We can easily apply this attitude toward art to the campaign
                        <persName>De Kay</persName> successfully waged to incorporate art more fully into American life, of which the Circle was the ultimate
                    expression. </p>
                <p> De Kay's attitude toward medals was gleaned from a number of sources; one of the more interesting was his interest in quality over quantity.
                    In writing about the sculpture for the new Appellate Courthouse in <placeName>New York</placeName> City <persName>De Kay</persName> stated,
                    "Size alone does not give importance; on the contrary, by enlarging a figure its effect is sometimes lessened" ( <persName>De Kay</persName>
                    1901, 1797). The same sentiment about the disparity between size and quality appeared in an article on miniature painting published in 1901.
                        <q> How many of us stop to remember that 'miniature' the word has nothing to do with size in its original meaning?...[T]his matter <pb
                            n="247"/> of size has always acted as a slur on the esteem in which miniatures have been held, very much as the material in which a
                        work of art is fashioned has always affected men's estimate of the artistic quality belonging to a given object. It is hard for the
                        average man to understand that a medal in bronze may have higher artistic quality than the same medal cast in gold, or a carving in wood
                        surpass in beauty the same object in ivory ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1901a, 333). </q>
                </p>
                <p> It is interesting that De Kay would make pointed reference to medallic art in an article on painting; whenever he had the chance to act as a
                    booster for medals, he seized the opportunity. And while he never comes right out and says so, his comment on size in the previous quote can
                    also be construed as being directed at critics of medallic art. Later in the same article on miniature painting he writes that medalists
                    must "pack much in little room and remain true and graceful, thoughtfill and artistic....The medalists of the old school are still shaking
                    their heads over innovators who model medals large and reduce them to medal size and treat the old stiff rules of medaldom with scant
                    respect in more than one regard" ( <persName>De Kay</persName> 1901a, 336). The issue of size was one that intrigued De Kay. "It is not easy
                    for a man engaged in monumental work to change off to modelling in very low relief and meet the other requirements that a medal forces upon
                    him....[H]e must have the habit of seeing things on the medallic scale; he must have the practice of subtle planes" (De Kay 1907, 158). In
                    yet another article he writes, "Bronze is apt to be associated too closely with monuments that stand in public places, because the enjoyment
                    of small bronze-work is not general. The lover of bronzes, however, regards size no more than does the lover of paintings. He finds a zest
                    in figurines or medallions or small objects...." (De Kay 1895, 111). It seems obvious that De Kay's priorities during the early years of the
                    twentieth century, even before the founding of the Circle, were toward spreading art and culture to the general public through the use of
                    small, intimate, and therefore easily digested works like medals, and medals created by sculptors who were ardent students of the craft of
                    working in miniature, a scale appropriate to the medium. </p>
                <p> De Kay had a special, and obvious, fondness for medals. Two aspects of these small bronzes that especially pleased him were the
                    commemorative nature of medals and the variety of colors that could be applied. Medals, along with coins and tokens, "...[have] kept the
                    record of men and peoples utterly vanished from history" (De Kay 1895, 110). They were another way of recording history, an important part
                    of De Kay's <pb n="248"/> aesthetic, and yet they functioned and appeared differently than coins and tokens as historical markers. Their
                    commemorative function worked within, not separately from, an aesthetic one, unlike tokens and coins, and this made them unique. As for
                    color, "A collection of bronzes satisfies the love inherent in mankind for form, and pleases not a little his love of color. From bright
                    green to bright yellow, from brown to black to invisible green or blue, there is a great range of colors for the skilled collector" (De Kay
                    1895, 112). This emphasis on the range of colors possible with gold, silver and bronze was another attempt at convincing the public that
                    medallic art was indeed a worthy branch of the arts, comparable to painting for variety and emotional expression. </p>
                <p> De Kay believed that medals also played a significant role in influencing popular taste. Medals had, in the past, suffered the reputation of
                    "things of use" rather than things of beauty. He hoped the Circle would remedy this. One of the goals of the Circle, for De Kay, was to
                    teach the public about the inherent beauty of these small sculptures. "It is still a small band of amateurs who encourage the passion, and
                    not all of these can shake off the collector's tendency to value an object for its rarity or historical worth more than for its intrinsic
                    beauty; but no one can indulge long in the passion without making comparisons between one medal and another...and gradually separating in
                    his mind those which please the aesthetic side of him from those which merely excite his interest for other reasons" (De Kay 1907, 153). The
                    Circle would awaken in its members the aesthetic "passion," the ultimate complement to the historical, long the sole province of medals. </p>
                <p> The relationship between the design of medals and coins was obvious, De Kay believed. Medals have long had an influence on coinage, and the
                    best example of this was <placeName>France</placeName> . "We may safely reason that neglect of medallic study in the United States is
                    responsible for the flat and tasteless appearance of our own coinage...." (De Kay 1907, 154). Another reason for the founding of the Circle
                    was to elevate medallic art to a level where the general public would realize that our coins needed the same kind of aesthetic attention as
                    medals, or small sculptures. The only American, De Kay believed, who had made a thorough study of medals was <persName>Victor David
                        Brenner</persName> , who was commissioned to design the fourth issue for the Circle. Coin designers, of which
                        <persName>Brenner</persName> was one, had different problems to solve than medalists, and it was to <persName>Brenner's</persName>
                    credit that he was able to switch roles so easily. </p>
                <p> Brenner's example was perfectly suited to illustrate the importance of medals in the education of the public about aesthetics. A sculptor
                        <pb n="249"/> who could so easily and expertly switch genres, teach in both, and write eloquently about the processes, was the
                    embodiment of the type of artist De Kay championed. "It is strange that a country in which education engages so much thought and ability as
                    does ours should fail to perceive the value of medals as a means of instruction and lay so little stress on them. They do not teach history
                    alone, but when designed by the proper hands they teach art" (De Kay 1907, 162). By studying medals, the public would naturally learn to
                    appreciate larger works. "The value of such portable small sculpture is not easily overrated; it leads to the...thousand and one sculptured
                    objects which add so much atmosphere to a room furnished in the common way with pictures only..." (De Kay 1907, 163). In De Kay's mind,
                    medals formed a stepping-stone to some of the most refined pleasures in the world. </p>
                <p> The Circle of Friends of the Medallion folded just after the onset of the First World War. The reasons for its disappearance are not known,
                    but can certainly be surmised. First, De Kay and Hewitt never reached their goal of 1000 subscribers, so it is possible that it was not
                    financially feasible to keep the Circle going. Second, the nation's attention was beginning to focus on the war in
                        <placeName>Europe</placeName> and <placeName>America's</placeName> looming role in it, leaving very little time and thought for personal
                    consumption of art. Third, the slowly growing interest in modernism and its highly subjective styles may have begun to undermine the
                    traditional, i.e., social, value De Kay and Hewitt attached to medals, and art in general. However, De Kay's contributions to American
                    aesthetic thought were invaluable. During his tenure with the Circle he produced countless articles, in addition to those cited, for many
                    nationally prominent magazines and newspapers on a wide spectrum of artistic matters. It is inarguable that De Kay was one of the most
                    influential cultural figures in the United States in the years before the First World War, and almost singlehandedly responsible for
                    elevating medallic art to a popular level. </p>

                <pb n="264"/>
                <p> Since the invention of money, the gods and goddesses, heroes and beasts of mythology have been portrayed on coinage to commemorate a
                    particular event or associate a ruler with his patron deity. Nowhere was this more prevalent than in the coinage of ancient
                        <placeName>Greece</placeName> resulting in some of the most beautiful designs ever produced in this medium. The primitive methods used
                    to produce these coins dictated that the designs be engraved directly onto the dies at the actual size they were to be struck. When looking
                    at these miniature works of art one is amazed by the fineness of detail and the ingenuity of the designers' use of iconography in so limited
                    a space. Much later, during the Italian Renaissance, artists such as <persName>Pisanello</persName> , <persName>L'Antico</persName> ,
                        <persName>Fiorentino</persName> and <persName>Cesati</persName> used the creatures and characters of mythology on portrait medals to
                    convey certain messages about their subjects. Meanings hidden to the ordinary person could easily be deciphered by their well educated
                    aristocratic patrons. In twentieth century <placeName>America</placeName> , the sculptor <persName>Paul Manship</persName> was greatly
                    impressed by the work of the ancient <placeName>Greeks</placeName> and the Renaissance medalists. Like them, he was an artist whose career
                    was linked to wealthy patrons, those self-made tycoons who formed the apex of American society and manipulated the taste of the nation.
                    Archeological discoveries in the nineteenth century infused these classic mythical themes with new vigor. Manship's mastery of archaic form,
                    coupled with fresh originality and fluid handling of spatial relationships made him a favorite of Americas elite. </p>
                <p> "His feeling for the sculptural medium also inspired unique achievement in medallic art. Following the introduction of mechanical means for
                    cutting dies from larger models, medallists had departed from the appropriateness of scale that had been imposed upon the ancient die
                    cutters... Manship revived the clarity of design and treatment that had been the charm of the Greek gems and coins as well as of the early
                    Renaissance medals" (Hancock 1966). Manship himself expressed his unhappiness with the effects achieved by modern technology: "The
                    mechanical reduction, which is to perhaps to be wondered at for its fineness, produces a result which is false and inartistic, because it is
                    obviously not the direct work of the human hand. The beautiful coins of the Greeks and the artistic medals of Pisanello and his
                    contemporaries were of necessity made at their final size. I believe that this mechanics in art is one of the reasons why the art of the
                    medalist has sunk today to such a low state" ( <persName>St. Paul Pioneer</persName> 1915). This admiration and desire to achieve the
                    "appropriateness of scale" influenced his methods in "the designing of modern medals, he carved the most intricate <pb n="265"/> designs and
                    exquisite lettering directly in the plaster mould <hi rend="italic">(sic)</hi> ... Had Manship confined himself solely to making medals he
                    would have achieved wide acclaim" ( <persName>Richards</persName> 1966). </p>
                <p> Many collectors of medallic art are familiar with some of the works produced by this giant of American sculpture but very few realize how
                    prolific a medalist Paul Manship really was. In his lifetime, Manship created well over a hundred medals, decorations and small bas-reliefs. </p>
                <p> Mythological themes are no stranger in Manship's sculpture and are evident in such works as Centaur and Dryad, Infant Hercules Fountain,
                        <persName>Diana and Acteon</persName> , <placeName>Europa</placeName> and the <persName>Bull</persName> and his most famous work, The
                    Prometheus Fountain in New York's Rockefeller Center. Among his medallic efforts the best known is <persName>Dionysus</persName> , which was
                    the second issue of the Society of Medalists. He also created two presidential inaugural medals: the first in 1931 for <persName>Franklin
                        Delano Roosevelt</persName> , the second for <persName>John Fitzgerald Kennedy</persName> in 1960, and although neither contains a
                    mythological theme, they are noteworthy nonetheless. </p>
                <p> For those not familiar with Manship and his work, we must take a brief look at the influences that moulded him as an artist. The most
                    important was that he learned through the traditional apprenticeship, allowing him to acquire the techniques he needed to develop his own
                    distinctive style and not be stamped in the mold of a particular school. Above all, he was a craftsman of the highest degree and tried to
                    instill this quality in others throughout his career. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName>Paul Howard</persName> Manship was born on <persName>Christmas Eve</persName> , 1885 in <persName>St. Paul, Minnesota</persName> ,
                    the seventh child of <persName>Charles</persName> Manship and <persName>Mary Etta</persName> Friend. He first studied art at the
                        <persName>St. Paul</persName> Institute where he decided to try his hand at painting. Discovering he was color blind, he switched to
                    modeling in clay, and by the age of 15 decided to become a sculptor. Leaving high school at 17, he opened his own design business in
                        <persName>St. Paul</persName> . For a year he did sign painting and lettering, which remained of great interest to him and shows
                    strongly in his medallic work. </p>
                <p> Manship went to <placeName>New York</placeName> in 1905 where he entered the <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> Students League and after a few
                    months of formal study, served as an assistant to <persName>Solon Borglum</persName> until 1907. In the autumn of that year he enrolled at
                    the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Academy of Fine Arts where he studied life modeling with sculptor <persName>Charles
                        Grafly</persName> . From 1908 to 1909 Manship assisted <persName>Isidore Konti</persName> , who taught him the techniques of low relief
                    modeling and persuaded <persName>Paul</persName> to compete for entry into the American Academy in Rome which he won. He was also greatly
                    responsible for drawing Manship away from the influence of Rodin whose style was <pb n="266"/> emulated by most of the sculptors of the
                    period, thus giving him the freedom to pursue his own style which would in time set him above all his peers. Manship later acknowledged his
                    debt and fondness toward the elder sculptor with one of his first portrait medals. </p>
                <p> Manship's stay in <placeName>Rome</placeName> was probably the single most influential period in his life as well as his work. It would bear
                    a significant impact on the way he viewed sculpture in general and how he interpreted that view in his own art. Surrounded by antiquity he
                    was able to study and then synthesize the ancient forms to achieve a fresh new look which would become known as Archaism. Within a year of
                    his arrival at the Academy, his work shows a dramatic change from the <persName>Neo-Baroque</persName> style he had previously been working
                    in. During his fellowship he also made trips around the Mediterranean studying Archaic Greek, Minoan, Assyrian and Egyptian forms. </p>
                <p> The lessons and inspiration derived from antiquity were not the only influences on the young sculptor. Also during his time in
                        <placeName>Italy</placeName> , Manship was able to study the Renaissance masters Michaelangelo and Donatello as well as the medals of
                    Pisanello and his contemporaries. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-176">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_266.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> It was in Italy, the birthplace of modern medallic sculpture, that Manship created the first of what was to be many works in this genre.
                    Frederic Crowninshield (1845-1918), a painter, had been associated with American Academy in Rome since 1900, and its director from <pb
                        n="267"/> 1909-1911. He resigned as the director following a merger with the School of Classic Studies, which he opposed, and as a
                    farewell, the fellows presented Crowninshield and his wife with a plaque modeled by Manship. </p>
                <p> The Crowninshield Medallion ( <ref target="#fig-176">fig. 1</ref> ) depicts the winged figure of Iris holding a trumpet-blowing putto in one
                    hand and two doves in the other. Iris was the messenger of Zeus, along with Hermes, and was the faithful servant of Hera. She also helped
                    the other gods, unharnessing their chariots and giving the steeds nectar and ambrosia. She is a fitting symbol for this tribute to
                    Crowninshield who was a dedicated, faithful servant of the Academy and well liked among the fellows. Iris hangs her head in sorrow at the
                    loss of one who embodied her role at the institution. The putto blows a fanfare in recognition of his accomplishments and loyalty while the
                    doves symbolize an offering of peace and happiness for the couple. The medallion remained within the Crowninshield family until 1990 when it
                    was sold at auction in <placeName>New York</placeName> . </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-177">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_267.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> After his return to the states in 1913, Manship had several highly successful exhibitions and won national acclaim becoming one of the
                    hottest properties in the art world. Commissions flocked to him, among which was one to design the first gold Civic Forum Medal Of Honor (
                        <ref target="#fig-177">fig. 2</ref> ) to be awarded to <persName>George W. Goethals</persName> , Engineer of the Panama Canal. The
                    obverse depicts Athena with a winged victory in her right hand and the torch of enlightenment in her left. In Greek mythology Athena is
                    credited for giving many valuable services to mankind including the art of taming horses, invention of the potters wheel, the weaving of
                    cloth and embroidery. The medal was given "FOR DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE" and was awarded to such notables as <persName>Thomas

                <p> In the summer of 1914, the Manships vacationed in Italy with their friend <persName>Barry Faulkner</persName> , a mural painter, whom Paul
                    had met at the American Academy. Ending their tour in Rome, Manship modeled the Infant Hercules Fountain and presented it to the Academy as
                    his gift. Circling the base of the fountain are six low relief panels portraying the Labors of Hercules. They were not to be cast as
                    individual plaquettes until 1955. All show Hercules wrestling with an opponent either animal or human in form. These are probably the most
                    archaic in style of any of Manships medallic works and could be mistaken at first as works of antiquity. </p>
                <p> One of these ( <ref target="#fig-178">fig. 3</ref> ) depicts the wrestling match between Hercules and Nereus, The Old Man of the Sea. The
                    hero had to defeat this shape changing deity to discover the route to the Garden of the Hesperides in his quest to steal the Golden Apples
                    of Hera. An early 6th century BC, black figure vase in the <persName>Louvre</persName> ( <ref target="#fig-179">fig. 4</ref> ), shows Nereus
                    with a fish tail that sprouts the head of a lion and a snake, attesting to his power of mutation ( <persName>Boardman</persName> 1974, 223).
                    By mid century, Nereus changed identity to Triton, which was probably more politically symbolic than a relation to any myth (
                        <persName>Boardman</persName> 1974, 223, n.2). Nereus appears on later vases but in full human form and with none of the manifestations
                    of the earlier examples. </p>

                <p> The Manships rented a house the next summer in Cornish, New Hampshire. Other artists had been attracted to the colony founded by Augustus
                    Saint-Gaudens, among them were <persName>Stephen</persName> and <persName>Maxfield Parrish</persName> , <persName>Charles Adams
                        Platt</persName> , <persName>Kenyon Cox</persName> and <persName>Thomas W. Dewing</persName> . There Manship started a series of
                    portrait medals of his artist friends beginning with <persName>Barry Faulkner</persName> ( <ref target="#fig-180">fig. 5</ref> ). This is
                    the first medal by the sculptor dedicated to an individual rather than an event or award. </p>
                <p> The reverse of this medal portrays Orpheus and Eurydice with the inscription: "TO THE ULTIMATE DO WE PURSUE THE IDEAL". Orpheus, a son of
                    Apollo, was renowned for his remarkable singing voice and mastery of the lyre. His music was so beautiful that wild beasts and even trees
                    would follow him. He fell in love with and married the nymph Eurydice who was bitten by a snake and died. Orpheus, heartbroken, went into
                    the Underworld to bring back his bride. His beautiful singing charmed Hades and Persephone into letting her return on the condition that he
                    not gaze back at her until they were out of the Underworld. Orpheus in his impatience and fearing treachery on the part of Hades turned back
                    to look and so lost his love forever. </p>
                <p> Here Orpheus with his lyre represents artistic expression while Eurydice is the ideal to be pursued and attained. An artist will go through
                    'the gates of hell' to obtain the epitome of his art. But as in the myth, no matter what the effort, that goal can sometimes be lost in a
                    moment of uncertainty. The pair are surrounded by a chain border, binding them together as an artist is bound to his art. This medal was
                    closely followed by one honoring Maxfield Parrish ( <ref target="#fig-181">fig. 6</ref> ). </p>
                <p> The Parrish medal is of particular interest as it is the first depiction of Pegasus in Manship's sculpture. The winged steed became a
                    favorite subject of the artist and appears again in five other medals as well as numerous sculptures. Here Pegasus appears to be in the
                    throes of trying to break free from the world below, even the bronze in which he is cast. The wings of the fabled steed are strikingly
                    archaic in appearance and the stylized rays behind lend an urgency to the scene. In Manship's iconography, Pegasus represents artistic
                    inspiration or a means of transport to higher realms. The latter is particularly appropriate in this instance as the paintings of Maxfield
                    Parrish depict fantasy worlds, utopias bathed in ethereal light, or the fancies of nursery rhymes and fairy tales. Pegasus becomes a means
                    for the viewer to visit those realms so skillfully wrought by Parrish. </p>
                <p> Seeing the two of these medals together is enough to confirm Manship's status as an heir to Pisanello in the finest traditions of medallic

                <p> It was also in 1915 that The National Sculpture Society commissioned Manship to create a small bronze ashtray to be presented to its lay
                    members. Although this work is not a true medal, during the year 1914-1915 there were 145 lay members in the NSS making this one the most
                    highly produced reliefs by Manship to be discussed here. The artist chose the goddess Diana as the subject and created a gem in bronze that
                    became the first of a series of small relief dishes illustrating mythological scenes and astrological signs. </p>
                <p> Looking at the <persName>Diana Ashtray</persName> ( <ref target="#fig-182">fig. 7</ref> ), the viewer is first taken by the great illusion
                    of motion and speed of the figures. Diana with her bow flies through the surrounding flora, her swiftness easily matching the speedy hound
                    beside her. Her figure is freely modeled and extremely fluid in form, her long hair flowing in serpentine waves on both sides of her head
                    and is reminiscent of early Minoan frescoes. </p>
                <p> While <persName>Diana</persName> shows lithe gracefulness, the hound, in comparison, exudes pure physical power and lightning speed as he
                    adoringly follows at her side. Both are encircled but not completely contained in a raised beaded border giving the illusion that they might
                    at any moment leap from the confines of the bowl. This border is then contained within a second zig-zag motif just inside the rim and adding
                    to the dynamic energy of the piece. </p>
                <p> The figure of <persName>Diana</persName> appeared again in a later bronze ( <ref target="#fig-183">fig. 8</ref> ). Looking at both pieces
                    together, the distinct similarities become very <pb n="272"/> apparent. This small dish can be considered the earliest study for one of
                    Manship's most popular and beautiful sculptures. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-184">

                <p> Appropriately, Manship modelled the <persName>St. Paul</persName> Institute Medal ( <ref target="#fig-184">fig. 9</ref> ), as that was where
                    he received his first formal art training. The obverse portrays a kneeling Muse with her <persName>cithara</persName> , her right hand
                    holding a winged victory bearing two laurel wreaths. On the reverse Pegasus appears again, high above the earth with a pattern of vertical
                    rays rising behind. The almost Egyptian style of the kneeling muse on the obverse was several years ahead of its time as the revival of
                    interest in Egyptian art did not fully occur until after the discovery by <persName>Howard Carter</persName> of King Tutankamun's tomb in
                    1921. Manship himself considered this piece a radical departure from his previous work ( <persName>St. Paul Pioneer</persName> 1915). <q> I
                        have thought to get away from the stereotyped models generally used in this connection to suggest the whole idea in an abstract manner,
                        and so, instead of representing the figure of Art with a palette in one hand and a work of sculpture in the other, I have pictured, for
                        the obverse of the medal, the Muse that inspires <pb n="273"/> and extols, kneeling before the figure of Victory, who bestows the
                        recognition of artistic accomplishment. But for the reverse of the medal, the idea of the Pegasus arising from the globe itself,
                        appealed to me, apart from its decorative effect, as being suggestive of the flight of Fancy, and its vehicle of transport to the higher
                        realms. </q>
                </p>
                <p> There was also a smaller study for the obverse of the <persName>St. Paul</persName> Institute medal of which only a few casts were made (
                        <ref target="#fig-185">fig. 10</ref> ). Although the modeling is more simplistic, the figure of the muse in this version seems more
                    natural. You can sense the movement of the hand just having plucked the strings and you find yourself straining to hear the notes of the
                    melody she sings towards the heavens, four stars twinkling above her head. The border of raised dots forms a halo, or glow, around the
                    figures or could be interpreted as the vault of the heavens which, like artistic inspiration, knows no limits. It also creates the illusion
                    of being reflected in a pool beneath the figures. The inscription forms a cradle which embraces the figures and solidifies the design. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> Welles Bosworth, the architect, was the subject of another portrait medal. He and Manship had been friends since the sculptor's return from
                    Rome in 1913, and it was through him that several important early commissions were received. The reverse of the Welles Bosworth Portrait
                    Medal ( <ref target="#fig-186">fig. 11</ref> ) depicts a winged female figure kneeling on a plinth and holding a column in both hands. To
                    the left, in Greek characters reads "EUPHROSYNE," one of the three Graces, whose name means "she who rejoices the heart." This symbolism has
                    a double meaning here, the first is a reference to Bosworth's architecture which in its beauty and grace were a thing of joy to look upon.
                    The second being to the great friendship shared by the two men which lasted their lifetimes. </p>

                <p> Orpheus and Pegasus soar above the rising sun on the obverse of The Art Directors Club Medal of 1921 ( <ref target="#fig-187">fig. 12</ref>
                    ). The Club, incorporated in 1920, was intent on bringing the art of commerce to the fore. In its first 20 years the ADC awarded 129 medals
                    and the list reads like a Who's Who of artists and designers. Among the recipients were such notables as <persName>J.C.
                        Leyendecker</persName> , <persName>Walter D. Teague</persName> , <persName>Norman Rockwell</persName> ; <persName>Rockwell
                        Kent</persName> , <persName>Peter Arno</persName> , <persName>James Thurber</persName> , <persName> Edward Steichen and P. Horst

                </figure>
                <p> As in the Maxfield Parrish medal, Pegasus flies over the sun; the pose and style are very similar, only this time the soaring steed faces
                    left. His head is thrown back in joy as he listens to the wondrous song of Orpheus who rides bareback, playing his lyre. These two strong
                    icons of artistic inspiration and expression are quite fitting for this award, bestowed for artistic merit. </p>
                <p> Manship originally met <persName>John Singer</persName> Sargent in 1916 and became fast friends with the elder painter who even put the
                    sculptor up in his <placeName>London</placeName> flat while on his way to serve with the <persName>Red Cross</persName> during WWI. It
                    wasn't until 1923 that Manship created a portrait medal ( <ref target="#fig-188">fig. 13</ref> ), to honor his illustrious friend, the
                    reverse of which portrays the slaying of Medusa by the hero Perseus. </p>
                <p> The composition is complex but full of smooth flowing interactive curves. Perseus stands above the fallen Gorgon, his helmeted head turned
                    away so as not to look upon Medusa's countenance. The right arm juts back at a right angle and holds the downcurving blade which draws the
                    eye to the severed head held in his left hand. The corpse follows the bottom curvature of the medal, from the severed stump springs Pegasus
                    whose upswept wings draw our eye back to the figure of Perseus. Encircling the figures, but not containing them, is a zig-zag <pb n="275"/>
                    border that adds to the energy of the scene. The inscription, "PEGASUS LIBERATED," pays tribute to this artist who was the embodiment of
                    artistic inspiration as the greatest painter of his day. By the use of initials, "P.M. TO J.S.S. 1923," Manship reveals the casualness and
                    the closeness of the friendship shared by the two men. </p>

                <p> On August 15, 1927, <persName>Judge Elbert H. Gary</persName> , CEO and Chairman of the United States Steel Corporation; president and
                    founder of the American Iron and Steel Institute; namesake of <persName>Gary</persName> , <placeName>Indiana</placeName> ; philanthropist
                    and the single most powerful and influential leader in American industry, succumbed to heart disease at age 80. His vision and commitment
                    are responsible for many things we take for granted in business today including fair labor practices, health and safety incentives,
                    quarterly and annual reports to the public and an 8-hour workday. It was only appropriate that his creation, the American Iron and Steel
                    Institute, create an award to truly honor his memory. </p>
                <p> The obverse portrait ( <ref target="#fig-189">fig. 14</ref> ) was executed from a marble bust at the Gary residence in
                        <persName>Jericho</persName> , <placeName>Long Island</placeName> . Manship achieves a marvelously strong profile relief of Judge Gary
                    in his prime that projects the power, conviction and dignity of this great man. There are no other decorative elements save the identifying
                    legend. None are necessary, as the portrait conveys all that needs to be said. There is some flair in the letterforms, especially the "R's"
                    that add to the impression of this man's uniqueness. </p>
                <p> The symbolism of the reverse is as strong as the portraiture of the obverse. Here Manship gives us a scene of Hephaestus resting at his
                    forge. What more fitting tribute to a man who was this god's incarnation in modern industry, whose mills glowed like so many volcanoes <pb
                        n="276"/> across the nation? Two winged figures hover above his head with the victor's laurel signifying the award. The forge and anvil
                    are traditional symbols for Hephaestus but are also symbolic of the Iron and Steel industry from whose fiery forges a modern industrialized
                        <placeName>America</placeName> emerged. The rays around the god's head, aside from a reference to the genius of <persName>Judge
                        Gary</persName> , himself connote the signal significance of the award and the distinction of the recipient. Finally, that the god is
                    resting refers to the fact that this is a memorial to one who has passed on. </p>

                <p> The Society of Medalists (SOM) was founded in 1930 with the promise of making available to the average citizen small bas-relief works of art
                    by America's greatest sculptors at an affordable price. The second issue of the SOM, modeled by Manship, caused quite a stir in its
                    depiction of Dionysus ( <ref target="#fig-190">fig. 15</ref> ), the god of wine, frivolity and drunken debauchery. Considering that this was
                    during the height of Prohibition the subject matter didn't sit well with many people. Manship himself, in the brief accompanying message,
                    considered that: "The medal is not conventional. It is subtly humorous and is symbolic of a present-day attitude toward certain restraints
                    of the times. Thus it is commemorative of an era" (SOM 2). </p>
                <p> Shortly after its release, an article appeared claiming that the medal <pb n="277"/> had become a "matter of contention" between "Wets" and
                    "Drys" in the membership of the SOM, it went on further to say that it knew of at least one member who threatened to resign if "any more
                    insults to the Constitution are perpetuated in the name of art" (Art Digest 1931). </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-190">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_277a.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> The SOM quickly released a statement to the effect that "the protests which had been received did not cite advocacy of Prohibition as the
                    reason for disapproving the medal", and went on "that more letters of praise than censure had been received..." (New York Times 1931). </p>
                <p> With this singular piece Manship reaches the epitome of his art in the interpretation of modern issues through archaic forms. He did not see
                    the issue in terms of "Wets" or "Drys" but rather as a statement on the social issue of Prohibition and a reflection of its times. </p>

                <p> Modern technology blends with ancient mythology on the Southern Railways Centennial Medal ( <ref target="#fig-191">fig. 16</ref> ) of 1930.
                    A powerful locomotive <pb n="278"/> bursts its way across the lower half of the medal, bolts of power fly from its wheels and a swift column
                    of smoke streams from the stack. The tangibility of the power and speed that radiate from this image is astounding and to further emphasize
                    these attributes the god Mercury flies above. Known for his swiftness as a messenger of the gods, Mercury was also the god of commerce. Upon
                    his forward extended right arm is a miniature of "The Best Friend of Charleston," the locomotive whose historic (albeit short) run on
                    Christmas day 1830 signaled the beginning of railroad transport in this country. <ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> Adding to the atmosphere of
                    the piece, the wavy rays behind symbolize the dawn of the new age that the steam locomotive brought to the economic growth of the nation.
                    Two hundred of these much sought after medals were produced at a cost of approximately $900 (including dies) plus Manship's usual $2,500 fee
                    (Manship, Letter). </p>

                <p> Pegasus makes his final appearance, this time with Bellerophon the Carnegie Corporation Medal ( <ref target="#fig-192">fig. 17</ref> ). This
                    award, created in 1934, was presented by the Carnegie Corporation in recognition of an academic contribution to the advancement of
                    knowledge. Bellerophon, a great lover of horses was visited in a dream by Athena one night in which she told him where to find the winged
                    steed Pegasus. Upon <pb n="279"/> awakening he found a golden bridle left by the goddess and at a clearing, just as she had described, he
                    found Pegasus, drinking from a pool of water. His stealthy approach went unnoticed until the last instant and Pegasus bolted, but
                    Bellerophon just managed to slip the on the bridle which tamed the beast instantly. One day, according to Pindar, Bellerophon tried to reach
                    Olympus on his fabulous beast, and Zeus in his anger at the mortal's impudence, flung him to earth, laming him for life. </p>
                <p> The symbolism here is as well thought out as the composition. In this instance, Pegasus represents knowledge and Bellerophon, man's gaining
                    of that knowledge. Their struggle attests to the fact that though knowledge can be gained, it can be flighty and elusive and its attainment
                    is not always easy. The waves become the symbolic carriers of knowledge and ideas to all corners of the globe. Lastly there is the warning,
                    though not seen, to those familiar with the myth that knowledge used toward the wrong ends is a dangerous thing and the consequences can be
                    costly. </p>

                <p> Manship's relationship with the Hercules Powder Company began in 1941 with a commission to create the <persName>John Wesley Hyatt</persName>
                    Award to be given for distinguished achievement in the field of plastics. The company, a leading explosives and industrial chemicals
                    manufacturer, was founded in 1912 by <persName>Russel H. Dunham</persName> . Dramatic growth and expansion during and after WWI allowed
                    Hercules to become a major manufacturer of raw materials for the growing plastics industry. In 1945 Manship sculpted a statue for their
                    corporate headquarters in <pb n="280"/>
                    <persName>Wilmington, DE</persName> and in 1951 was asked to create a medal commemorating Dunham's fifty years of leadership. </p>
                <p> This 3 inch uniface medal ( <ref target="#fig-193">fig. 18</ref> ) depicts a strident Hercules wearing the famed skin of the
                        <persName>Nemian Lion</persName> and carrying a club on his shoulder. Struck in gold and bronze issues by Medallic Art Company, <ref
                        target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> it is a relief miniature of the sculpture done six years earlier. Compared to his earlier medals this one seems
                    very static in composition and has lost all the decorative brilliance for which he was so well known. This lack of a more involved
                    composition may have been due to a hasty deadline. At this point in his career, Manship's popularity had greatly declined because of his
                    association with the "academic" art establishment and his strong opposition of the avant-garde who were now riding the crest of the wave of
                    popularity. </p>

                <p> The last medal to be discussed here is the Century Association medal of 1955 ( <ref target="#fig-194">fig. 19</ref> ). Awarded annually to
                    the Centurion by the Board of Management of the Club, the medal's obverse presents a standing Pallas Athena, patron goddess of literature,
                    art and industry, helmeted and wearing the aegis over her chiton. In her left hand she holds the laurel of recognized achievement and with
                    her right she touches the base of a lamp symbolizing knowledge and enlightenment. This lamp stands upon a pylon rising from the plinth upon
                    which <persName>Athena</persName> stands. This representation, as Manship would have been aware, resembled the celebrated statue of the
                    goddess by Phidas that was in the Parthenon. The reverse of this medal, as with so many of Manship's works of this period is a wonderful
                    treatment of his seemingly endless array of a ribbons and panels. The dexterity and variety of these when viewed together is astounding.
                    Originally conceived as an <pb n="281"/> annual award, this medal has been presented only 13 times to date since its creation </p>
                <p> The fifteen medals covered here merely scratch the surface of the sculptors success in this medium. But, they are indicative of the
                    consistency of his creativity and his dedication to craftsmanship. They truly set Paul Manship among the great medallists of all time. </p>

                        been unending in their patience and support and I count their friendship as one of the treasures in my life. There are also two other

                        <p> The locomotive "Best Friend of Charleston" was given that name by local businessmen who saw it as the means of getting goods from
                            the port city to the newly developing inland areas. It made its famous December 25th six mile run on the partially completed track
                            of the South Carolina Canal &amp; Railway Company. A contemporary account tells of the then dazzling speed of the train as it travelled
                            "on the wings of the wind at the speed of 15 to 25 miles an hour, annihilating time and space and leaving the world behind...(the
                            engine) darted forth like a live rocket, scattering sparks and flames on either side, passing over three saltwater creeks, hop, step
                            and jump, and landed us all safe at the lines before any of us had the time to determine whether or not was prudent to be scared."
                            Six months later the "Best Friend of Charleston" met its end when a fireman, annoyed at the hissing noise from the boiler, proceeded
                            to hold down the safety valve. The resulting explosion blew him and the engine to kingdom come. </p>

                            this piece. Dunham's fiftieth anniversary was played down in the company's newsletter, "The Hercules Mixer," with absolutely no

                <p>
                    <persName>Die-engraving</persName> for the production of coins and medallions is an age-old and increasingly rare form of art. Once, all
                    coins were struck from hand-engraved dies, and the engraver held an honored position in government and in society. Today there are several
                    ways to create minting dies that do not necessarily require the skilled hands of an engraver, and thus die-engravers have become almost as
                    rare as the art that they practice. </p>
                <p> It is part of the trade's mystery that very little written information exists to aid in the education of a would-be engraver.
                        <persName>Die-engraving</persName> is passed from master to apprentice, a visual and manual training that can be acquired in no other
                    way. They say that it takes seven years to become a competent die-engraver, but, as one who has struggled with this obdurate art form for at
                    least ten years, I suggest that it takes much longer— perhaps a lifetime. In addition, there are few schools that offer this very specific
                    training. Die-engraving could easily disappear without some conscious effort to continue it, to pass on a fascinating and intricate
                    decorative art form. </p>
                <p> The tools used by the engraver, ancient and unchanging, are relatively simple. Each engraver makes his own tools, as they are hand-held and
                    so must fit each individual hand. Hardened steel chisels and a hammer are used to remove large amounts of steel from a steel die ( <ref
                        target="#fig-195">fig. 1</ref> ). Small steel gravers or burins are used to remove small amounts of steel, and to add lines and details
                    ( <ref target="#fig-196">fig. 2</ref> ). Hand-made steel punches have a design engraved on their faces, which is then hammered or "punched"
                    into the face of the die. It is often true that one must make a tool to make a tool. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-195">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_284.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> A die-block, or cylindrical piece of "soft" workable steel is placed in a vise called a graver's block. White paint is smeared over the
                    surface of the die-block, and the design to be engraved is then transferred onto the face of the die, and traced again with a sharp metal
                    scribe. This will serve as a map for the engraver. It is at this point that the work begins. </p>
                <pb n="285"/>
                <figure xml:id="fig-196">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_285a.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> Each engraver has a slightly different way of approaching a job, and so I may only speak for myself. I begin with my chisels and a heavy
                    hammer. Chisels and gravers both have different "faces," that are either round, flat, or v-shaped. Depending on the cut needed, I then
                    hammer my chisel along within the design, removing the mass of the design. This may also be accomplished with a flexible shaft tool, or
                    other similar mechanical grinding tool. The chisel can leave ragged marks in the steel, and these are then smoothed somewhat with a wide
                    flat graver. </p>
                <p> Fine details and lettering may be added with a small graver. As demonstrated by master engraver Ron Landis, lettering may also be added with
                    individual letter punches. Punches guarantee a uniformity of image, and are particularly useful when a design element is repeated within the
                    image. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-197">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_285b.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> Modern dies are created with a different method, and with the skills of another artist. As demonstrated by Laura Gardin Fraser in a recently
                    restored video, "The Medal Maker," a die may be made from an original "sculpt" which is actually much larger than the finished product. <ref
                        target="#fig-197">Figure 3</ref> shows the passage of an idea through design to finished sculpture. The artist's design is translated
                    into a three-dimensional sculpture through clay and plaster. Lettering is usually carved into the negative plaster model, from which a
                    positive is poured in plaster. This model is then cast in bronze at a foundry, or cast in a hard epoxy resin. The original <pb n="286"/>
                    must be made of some very hard material that will withstand a lot of machining. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-198">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_286a.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> The model is placed on a machine called a pantograph reduction machine (fig. 4). Two of the most common machines are the Janvier and the
                    Augenstein, which vary slightly in design, but achieve the same result. A stylus traces the relief of the model in a series of concentric
                    circles, moving slowly from the center out toward the edges of the model. At the other end of the machine's long arm, a steel cutter repeats
                    the motion at a reduced ratio, thus creating a smaller version of the original model. This, when finished, will be the "hub" from which a
                    negative die will be made. The hub is checked by the engraver for flaws, often left behind by the reduction machine, and then the steel hub
                    is hardened. The hardened hub will be impressed into a "soft" piece of steel, thus creating the die from which a coin or medal will be
                    struck. <ref target="#fig-199">Figure 5</ref> shows a hub, the "soft" steel that it will be impressed into, and the resulting die. </p>
                <figure xml:id="fig-199">
                    <graphic url="COAC13_286b.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p> Historically, the striking of coins and medals has involved ingenious and not always efficient machinery. It is this requirement that makes
                    the art of the struck medal different from other forms of sculpture; limitations are imposed by the capacities of the machine upon design
                    and relief of modeling. The trick is to combine art, inspiration, and mechanical restraints into a very small beautiful space, and in the
                    most successful of coins and medallions this always occurs. <ref target="#fig-200">Figure 6</ref> shows one such medallion. </p>
                <p> At a workshop held in conjunction with the 1997 conference, a <pb n="287"/> combination of both old and modern techniques in die-engraving
                    and striking was demonstrated. I prepared an obverse die from a sculpt, and <persName>Ron Landis</persName> prepared a reverse die, engraved
                    by hand. Playing with the "Coinage of the Americas Conference" theme, we both designed an image that had to do with <placeName>North and
                        South America</placeName> . The obverse, reduced from a larger sculpt, shows a Liberty head mirrored by an aztec goddess head ( <ref
                        target="#fig-201">fig. 7</ref> ). The reverse, hand-engraved directly into the steel die, juxtaposes an eagle with a phoenix-like bird.
                    These two dies were struck together to produce small medals commemorating "the Medal in America," the theme of the conference ( <ref
                        target="#fig-202">fig. 8</ref> ). </p>

                <p> Through this demonstration we sought to answer some questions about the vanishing art of die-engraving. Only continued interest will help
                    this art form survive as it always has, passed on from teacher to student, hand to hand. </p>

                <p> After several years of struggling to become a hand engraver, I found myself exploring many facets of this simple, yet challenging art form.
                    In 1982, I acquired a small coining press and was inspired to create small medals which I peddled at <persName>Renaissance</persName> Fairs
                    across the country, dragging several tons of minting equipment along to demonstrate with. Being a hand engraver of limited means, I created
                    the dies the only way I knew how—the same way I engraved wax seals and signets, by cutting the design in reverse directly with hand held
                    chisels called gravers. </p>
                <p> Trying to stay true to the historic theme of the Renaissance period, I was compelled to try to make my coining demonstration as true to form
                    as I could, and by 1991, had built a water wheel powered mint at the Texas Renaissance Festival. We demonstrated hammered coining methods as
                    well as the "modern" milled coining techniques developed in the sixteenth century using screw presses, bellows blast furnace, drop hammer,
                    hand cranked edge mill, and water wheel powered rolling mills to demonstrate roller milled coining. </p>
                <p> In my initial research, I was surprised that there was really nowhere that was set up to show these obscure methods. I always thought that
                    an art form that played such an important role in our development as a civilization should have a place to exist at a living history museum,
                    like Colonial Williamsburg. After teaming up with my machinist partner, Joe Rust, we vowed to make it our responsibility to create a museum
                    that would be a place where this, and other related technical arts such as paper making, printing, and bookbinding, can exist and thrive. </p>
                <p> Hand engraving has been all but replaced with the advent of new technologies such as pantographs, reduction lathes, spark erosion
                    technology, and computer guided lasers. In order for it to exist as a trade, it must be put in a historic context the same way Colonial
                    Williamsburg provides an environment were silversmiths, broom makers, and other obsolete trades and folk arts can thrive. </p>
                <p> It is important to preserve rare and historic coins, medals, currency, postage stamps, and other historic documents. Likewise, it is
                    important to preserve the art forms that created these artifacts as a living, breathing part of our culture. </p>
                <p> The art of hand engraving, although just a shadow of the thriving trade it once was, still has its place and still offers unique and
                    rewarding opportunities for the artist determined to master these hard learned skills. There is still a demand for high quality stationary,
                    wax seals, ornamental engraving on guns, knives, hollow ware, jewelry, musical instruments, and even motorcycles to name a few. The
                    distinctive styles <pb n="291"/> and delicate sharpness and human qualities of the hand cut line can be mimicked, but never truly captured
                    by mechanical means. Portraits on paper currency are still engraved by hand in most countries for this reason. To my knowledge, there hasn't
                    been a machine invented yet that can cut a line with the same delicate finesse as a true master engraver. </p>
                <p> I'm straying from the subject of medals a bit, but there is a relationship between all these trades that I wanted to point out merely to
                    entice medalists to ponder the depth of possibilities this traditional art form still has to offer. My personal interest is the historic
                    coin making techniques developed from its earliest, and most primitive forms. </p>
                <p> To my knowledge, there are no books specifically devoted to early die engraving techniques, so I am learning by trial and error, reproducing
                    early coins using, as close as I can determine, the same techniques used to create the originals. In the process, we hope to parallel the
                    developments that occurred in the early mints through the same sort of natural order of "evolution" as early mints did. We will never figure
                    out all the exact methods and tools used in a given mint for a specific coin, but we can learn the general methods of given time periods,
                    and thus gain an overall basic knowledge of the development of minting processes through hands-on trial and error experience. </p>
                <p> My latest obsession has been to reproduce Early American coins. The techniques employed to produce dies for these coins were also used to
                    produce tokens and medals of the period. The big difference between engraving a medal die and a coining die is that coining dies need to be
                    reproduced quickly and with great consistency. Most mints developed a method of producing dies from hand-engraved punches so that the time
                    consuming engraving process is only done once, and the dies could be executed from these punches by a die sinker. Therefore, individual
                    punches are made so that Miss Liberty for example, looks exactly the same from die to die. The terms engraving and die sinking are often
                    used synonymously, but in practice, they are really two separate operations most likely performed by two specialists in larger mints. In his
                    "Treatises of Goldsmithing and Sculpture," sixteenth century goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini mentions the security feature of using punches as
                    opposed to directly engraving dies; <q> The tools used for this purpose have two names, in some instances they are called punzoni (punches),
                        and in other cases madre (matrices), and of a truth they are the mothers that may be said to beget the figures and all the other things
                        you fashion in the die of your coins. The men who did the best work in coining <pb n="292"/> always did the whole of the work upon
                        either the punches or the matrices, and never once touched up the dies with either gravers or chisels, for that would be a great
                        blunder, as all the various dies necessary for making many impressions of the same coins, would be a bit different, and thus cause
                        slight differences in the coins themselves, and that would be making thing easy for forgers, whereas coins well wrought in the way
                        described could be less easily copied. </q>
                </p>
                <p> I am finding there are other advantages to making the main device punches from matrices. By engraving the reverse matrix, or master die, and
                    then producing the positive punch from this master matrix, the steel can be worked back and forth in the same manner that modern coin
                    sculptors work in plaster. Things like incised lettering and belly buttons, for example, can be added in the positive much easier and
                    cleaner than trying to engrave all around the detail. Combined with several sets and sizes of letter punches, dies for simple medals and
                    tokens can be quickly and easily executed with a sharpness of detail inherent to these methods. </p>
                <p> When the New World mints of Spain began operating, they received from the mother land a mint "kit" so to speak. This kit contained not only
                    a start-up set of dies, but all the punches to create new coining dies as needed. If a punch broke or wore out, a new one could be produced
                    from the matrix which was a plate with all the letters and design elements used for a particular coin. This made it possible for the early
                    Spanish Colonial Mints to operate without the skills of a master engraver. An apprentice with little or no artistic background can be
                    trained to sink dies of a set pattern in a relatively short time compared to learning to engrave. </p>
                <p> To demonstrate how quick die sinking really can be, I sunk a die at the Coinage of Americas Conference held at the American Numismatic
                    Society in NY. I only worked on it about fifteen minutes, hastily composing a simple eagle design from feather punches, and adding the
                    legend with letter punches. I then spent no more than a half hour finishing it up when I returned to Arkansas. So in less than one hour, I
                    was able to create a die, designing it as I went. Had I spent more time, it would certainly have been better designed, but I only wanted to
                    illustrate how efficient this method can be for producing simple token dies, for example. </p>
                <p> Many early tokens and medals have been made using these basic techniques of die sinking, and often combined with direct engraving of <pb
                        n="293"/> the main device. Since medals and tokens are made on more limited runs than coins, in many cases, it is more economical to
                    hand cut the main device directly into the working die, instead of spending extra time to create a master die, and device punch. When using
                    these large punches, there is always extra time in the machine shop to turn the distorted die blank back to round after punching in a
                    complete eagle, for example. In other words, engraving a large device does not mangle the shape of the die like applying 100 tons of
                    pressure to stamp it in. </p>
                <p> In doing our reproductions, I am always trying to figure out things like if a design element is hand cut in the die, punched in the matrix,
                    punched in the punch or a combination. I am discovering there really are no rules for this, and I think all die sinkers and engravers
                    gravitate to what they think is best to achieve the result they are looking for. </p>
                <p> During my short apprenticeship under George Bickley, he was trying to get me to think beyond the basic rules that I learned in trade school.
                    He explained that at some point you need to throw out the rule book and become the master of your own bench. The final result is what you
                    are going after, and there can be different roads to the same destination. Engravers develop their own ways that work for them. This is why
                    I don't like to think of myself as a master. As long as there is a new or better, or different way to do something, I remain a student, just
                    scratching the surface (pun intended). </p>
                <p> I enjoy exploring various kinds of numismatic engraving. One of my greatest loves is <persName>carving nickels</persName> . Based on the
                    folk art of " <persName>Hobo Nickels</persName> ," this is a simple, spontaneous way of creating small medals from available pocket change.
                    Many hoboes of the Great Depression used to recarve Buffalo nickels into various novel designs such as hobo heads, and then give these
                        <persName>Hobo Nickels</persName> in exchange for favors received along the way. Although somewhat of a novelty, the original
                        <persName>Hobo Nickels</persName> of yesterday are a uniquely American form of medal that has a charm all its own. </p>
                <p> Carving nickels is an excellent way to learn portrait engraving. If you goof it up, you have only lost a nickel. Also, it is a very free
                    form of medallic expression that does not require extensive equipment and dozens of highly technical steps to complete. The coin is carved,
                    and then it's done. It also makes for a quick, convenient way to sketch medal designs in 3-D. Taking this concept of carved coins a step
                    beyond the more primitive folk art of the hoboes, coin carving can be done on larger coins, or used to create medals by directly engraving
                    the original from a solid block of metal, then molding and casting to duplicate <pb n="294"/> the finished piece, thus returning us full
                    circle to an earlier time when some medals were created this way. I love the way all this ties together. </p>
                <p> Certainly the most challenging and rewarding aspect of my work at Gallery Mint is the early U.S. coin reproductions. Although I am often
                    criticized for this type of work, it has taught me much about coin design and portrait engraving. I find that by copying the work of earlier
                    engravers, I am gaining a better eye for sculpting portraits, just as when apprentice painters copied the work of their masters to learn
                    color and composition. This is a demanding discipline that I find most rewarding. And let's face it, like all artists, I'm always copying
                    something, whether it's my sketch on paper, a photograph of a coin, a profile of a person, or just an idea in my head. To me, the execution
                    of these designs is the act of creating which is the real art. But using these quaint, antiquated methods is part of the ritual, an exercise
                    that carries on a traditional art form that is thousands of years old, and makes me feel connected with something very basic and ancient.
