            <p>The present monograph introduces a series of studies devoted to the coinages of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2267430">Iberian Peninsula</name> and related countries, published jointly by The American Numismatic Society and The Hispanic Society of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. This projected series is one result of the decision of the President of the latter Society, <name type="pname">Mr. Archer M. Huntington</name>, to transfer his great personal collection of Spanish coins<ref target="#FR-pgvii-n1">1</ref> stored in the Museum of the Hispanic Society to the custody of the neigh­boring Museum of The American Numismatic Society. This collection of more than thirty thousand coins, the fruits of a determined and exhaustive effort on the part of <name type="pname">Mr. Huntington</name> to assemble under one roof a representation of the entire coinage of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2267430">Iberian Peninsula</name> and of its rulers beyond its land and sea frontiers from the time of the early Greek colonies down to the birth of the independent republics in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_7730009">Latin America</name>, is beyond doubt one of the finest and most comprehensive collections of Spanish coins that has ever been brought together. No phase of the numismatic history of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> and related countries has been neglected, and in many series the assemblage is as nearly complete as any single coin collection can be. Publication of this great mass of material will be a task of many years.</p>
            <p>The physical transfer of the coins was begun late in 1946 and was completed in 1948, and during this period plans were projected for the publication of The Hispanic Numismatic Series, to be based in large measure on this remarkable collection. The work of sorting and attribution was commenced immediately and continued during the period of transfer; and in 1948 when the decision was taken to initiate the series with a study of the coinage of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> princes and Caliphs of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, intensive study of this important part of the collection was begun. Concurrently with the cataloguing of the Hispanic Society coins a corpus of published Spanish <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> coins was compiled with the intent of producing a study of this branch of numismatics that might be as nearly definitive as possible. The present work, which combines a catalogue of the relevant coins in the Hispanic
<pb n="viii"/>
Society and The American Numismatic Society collections with a reasonably comprehensive treatment of the existent published ma­terial, is the result.</p>
            <p>Of the total number of coins – over seventeen thousand – to which reference is made in this volume, some twenty-one hundred and fifty are the property of the Hispanic Society, while about two hundred and seventy are in the permanent cabinet of The American Numismatic Society. Less important numbers of hitherto unpublished coins are from other public and some private collections in this country and abroad. These collections are listed at the end of the foreword and in the compilation of sources.</p>
            <p>At this point a few words must be said regarding the composition of the Hispanic Society collection. While I have no specific information with respect to the sources or provenance of the Arabic coins in the collection and know only that they, along with the great body of coins dating from other periods of Spanish history, were collected over a period of years ending about 1906, my detailed scrutiny of the coins in conjunction with the collation of published catalogues has revealed the fact that parts, at least, of two well-known collections were incorporated in that of the Hispanic Society. Reproductions of a few coins in these collections – those of <name type="pname">Codera</name> and <name type="place">Dos Santos</name> – are the key to these relationships<ref target="#FR-pgviii-n1">1</ref>. Whether all, or only parts, of these collections were acquired by the Hispanic Society cannot be determined from the evidence available, for only a limited number of <name type="pname">Codera's</name> and <name type="place">Dos Santos</name>' coins (those illustrated in the <hi rend="italic">Tratado</hi> and in <name type="pname">Schulman's</name> sales catalogue of the latter collection) are specifically identifiable; nor is the matter one of particular significance except insofar as it relates to the question of rarity or of divergent readings – mine and Codera's, for example – of possibly identical coins. The lack of this knowledge is of some embarrassment, when added to other factors to be briefly mentioned forthwith, in determining just how many specimens of a given issue are actually known to exist. Thus it doubtless very frequently occurs that an entry in the corpus
<pb n="ix"/>
lists separately two or three, or even more, specimens which may in fact be one identical coin.</p>
            <p>The complicating factor of the same nature to which I have alluded is the matter of duplication (without the specific description essential to positive identification) of specimens in certain important Spanish publications. The question leads inevitably to a brief digression. I refer especially to the numerical listing by both <name type="pname">Codera</name> and <name type="pname">Vives</name> in their compendia, of specimens in identical collections, some of which are, and others of which are not, described or listed in other published catalogues; and also to the various works dealing – but none of them adequately – with the collection of the Archaeological Museum in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</name>
               <ref target="#FR-pgix-n1">1</ref>. If in all these instances we were confronted with detailed descriptions of the coins in question, it would be no impossible task to collate the descriptions and eliminate duplication of citation. But unfortunately such is not the case: the vast majority of pieces in the great Spanish collections are inventoried with reference only to mint and date, and sometimes to auxiliary names. The matter is further complicated by the fact of the later acquisition by the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</name> Museum of the <name type="pname">Vives</name> collection, which by 1895 had absorbed several other collections to which <name type="pname">Vives</name> had earlier made reference and which in some cases had been the subject of independent publications<ref target="#FR-pgix-n2">2</ref>.</p>
            <p>Without entering further into tedious details it can therefore readily be seen that in some respects the compilation of the corpus has been a painfully complex task, and I trust that the reader will recognize, and perhaps condone, the fact that I have at times become inextricably involved in ambiguities of identification and duplication. However, I have striven to eliminate as much of this duplication as possible, and I hope that the specialist, who may have reason to do so, will find that if he submits each group of references cited as authority for a given issue to a careful scrutiny, controlled by the explanatory remarks in the bibliography, he will be able to discern to his own satisfaction such inevitable duplication as remains. In the main, the matter is not one of very great importance. While in some instances the number of specimens listed may be greater than the total of specimens published or seen, we must remember that this number is in actual fact only a fraction of the true total, for only a
<pb n="x"/>
small proportion of the coins preserved have been published; and of course those preserved are an even smaller proportion of those originally struck. In the long run it is safe to say that the number of citations after each issue (or in the index of issues at the end of the book, where in striking the totals due allowance has been made for duplication of reference) is a good indication of relative, and a fair indication of absolute, rarity or commonness.</p>
            <p>With few exceptions (notably the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_berlin">Berlin</name> collections, and to some degree that of the British Museum) the symbols and ornaments which appear on the coins of the <name type="place">Umayyads of Spain</name>, and by means of which one specific issue can be distinguished from another, have not heretofore been recorded. In the present work an effort has been made to describe every issue in detail, the ornaments being represented by means of more or less conventionalized drawings; and in this, as well as in other respects, the opportunity of working at first hand with the Hispanic Society collection, not to mention the smaller but representative one of The American Numismatic Society, has been invaluable. Both <name type="pname">Codera</name> and <name type="pname">Vives</name> doubtless devoted much attention to these symbols and to other details in their study of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> coinage, but their substance was never committed to paper. While I cannot pretend that the present work is conclusive (no work of this nature is ever truly finished), or that it contains detailed descriptions of any really large percentage of distinct extant issues, it is I believe comprehensive of most, if not all, previous published material. In respect of both comprehensiveness and detail I trust that it may be found to show progress over its predecessors, and that it may serve others as a basis for further specialized studies. In reaching toward these ends the existence and accessibility of the Hispanic Society collection has been indispensable, for I think I may say that no nearly comparable collection has been described in such detail. Thus, in spite of the mass of published material which has been laid under contribution, the Hispanic Society collection is in a very real sense the foundation of this monograph.</p>
            <p>The reader will, I hope, recognize, as I must gratefully do, my great intellectual debt to three outstanding scholars of Spanish culture, one deceased and two living: <name type="pname">Francisco Codera</name>, the first really great student of Hispano-Arabic numismatics; <name type="pname">Mr. Archer M. Huntington</name>, whose vigorous and intelligent collecting has brought the Museum of The Hispanic Society of America into being; and <name type="pname">M. É. Lévi-Provençal</name>, whose superlative studies of the Muslims in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> are the worthy successors of the basic heritage passed down by <name type="pname">Reinhart Dozy</name>.</p>

[This curious work contains a vast amount of material of importance, but unfortunately it literally swarms with errors and ambiguities of every sort. Many of the descriptions are unintelligible, there are countless typographical errors, and the seldom legible illustrations in the plates rarely conform with the text. In short, the identifications must all be accepted with the greatest reserve, but the material cannot be ignored for the author obviously owns, or has seen, a very large quantity of coins relating to Arab <pubPlace>Spain</pubPlace> and <pubPlace>North-West Africa</pubPlace>.

                  <bibl>C. – <author>Don Francisco Codera y Zaidín</author>, <title>Tratado de Numismática Arábigo-Española</title> (<pubPlace>Madrid</pubPlace>, <date>1879</date>). [This book, antedating Vives' Monedas by more than a decade is the fundamental work on the coinages of the Arabs in Spain, and like all subsequent students of the subject, I am deeply indebted to Codera for the foundation which he so firmly laid in this and his other monographs and studies. As explained in the foreword, the Tratado is unsatisfactory as material for the corpus in that there are relatively few descriptions of specific coins. In his letter to Lane-Poole of 1877 (see below), Codera wrote that he had prepared a „Description générale des monnaies arabes de l'Espagne," of which the first volume, devoted to the <name type="pname">Umayyads</name>, was to contain the description of more than 1500 varieties; but he found that he would need 80 plates, and as there were only three or four engravers in Madrid capable of doing the work the editor had to abandon the project. In the present catalogue references to C. are followed by square brackets containing the number of specimens known to Codera and listed by him in Appendix XIII on pp. 294–312, with due consideration of specimens cited by Codera but independently accounted for by myself, these having been eliminated. When the issue is rare, the names of the pertinent collections are included within the square brackets. The collections to which Codera had access were: Museo Arqueológico de Madrid, Real Academia de la Historia, Pascual de Gayángos, <name type="pname">Garcia de la Torre</name>, <name type="pname">Lorichs</name>, <name type="pname">Manuel Cerdá</name>, <name type="pname">Aureliano Fernandez Guerra</name>, <name type="pname">Francisco Caballero Infante</name>, <name type="pname">Carlos Camerino de Jerez</name>, Codera's own collection, and the British Museum. Occasionally a figure
<pb n="4"/>
appears after a plus sign, signifying other specimens from unspecified collections which Codera had seen. The general question of duplication with coins in the Hispanic Society collection and with Vives' listings is mentioned in the foreword; in principle, V. has been used as the primary source, and duplications in C. have been eliminated in the numeration. But the number of specimens in C.'s own collection have been taken from the Tratado rather than from V. Cf. the remarks under V. Page references are given only where a specific issue is discussed (i. e., the coins illustrated in the plates).]</bibl>

[For over fifty years this has been the primary compendium of Hispano-Arabic coins of all classes, more detailed and more comprehensive than <author>Codera's</author> Tratado (q.v), to which <author>Vives</author> fully acknowledges his indebtedness. All issues and types known to the author are separately described,
<pb n="13"/>
but without details of ornament, etc. In the present corpus references to <author>V</author>., exactly as with <author>C</author>., are followed by square brackets containing the number of specimens of each issue known to <author>Vives</author> and listed by him in his "<title>Indice de precios</title>," pp. 471–91, but not including those specimens which are identical with ones to which I have given the primary reference (e. g., <pubPlace>Paris</pubPlace>, British Museum, etc.). When the issue is rare, the names of the relevant collections are given within the square brackets. Some of the collections to which <author>Vives</author> had access are the same as those utilized by <author>Codera</author>, but as explained under the latter entry, duplications (not only of <author>C</author>., but of other collections) have, as far as possible, been eliminated. The principal collections enumerated by <author>V</author>. were: Museo Arqueológico de <pubPlace>Madrid</pubPlace>, Bibliothèque Nationale, British Museum, Academia de la Historia, Universidad de Valencia, Pascual de Gayangos, Codera, and <author>Vives'</author> own. Among less important collections to which <author>Vives</author> had references were some forty other named collectors or sources, many of the latter supplied to <author>Vives</author> by <author>Codera</author> in correspondence. These doubtless are in many instances synonymous with <author>C</author>.'s "varios," i. e., those represented by figures after the plus sign in C. entries in the present corpus. The general difficulties of collating <author>V</author>. with <author>C</author>., <author>R</author>., <author>DR</author>., etc. are referred to in the foreword.</bibl>
                  <bibl>As with <author>C</author>., the vast majority of <author>V</author>. catalogue numbers cannot be specifically categorized in view of the lack of detailed descriptions; thus in most cases <author>V</author>. entries fall under such headings as "<title>Details lacking," or "As ... but details lacking," or "Details lacking except</title> ...." There are no reproductions whatever in <author>V</author>.; consequently there is no possibility of verifying any of <author>Vives'</author> readings or of establishing the exact identity of coins published elsewhere. <author>V</author>.'s enumeration of specimens in the Academia and <author>Gayangos</author> collections have been adopted in preference to <author>C</author>.'s; also <author>V</author>.'s listings of <author>C</author>.'s Fās specimens have been utilized because <author>C</author>. has no entries for them.]</bibl>

               <p>The earliest <name type="place">Arab</name> coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> consisted of gold, and debased gold, one-third, one-half and full dinars of Byzantine type with Latin legends, resembling and derived from the earliest <name type="place">Arab</name> coins of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg20-n1">1</ref>. These issues extend from shortly after the conquest of southern <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> down through the year 97 A. H. (715/6 A. D.). For a particular reason I have chosen to omit these coins from the present volume and have begun with the bilingual issues of the year 98. The reason for this decision is the fact that <name type="pname">Mr. John Walker</name> has been engaged since before the recent war in the preparation of a catalogue of the <name type="place">Arab-Byzantine</name> coinage in the British Museum. This volume, the second in the revised <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Muhammadan Coins in the British Museum</hi>, to be entitled <hi rend="italic">A Catalogue of the <name type="place">Arab-Byzantine</name> and other <name type="place">Umaiyad</name> Coins</hi>, will doubtless be along the lines of the first in the series, his excellent <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Arab-Sassanian Coins;</hi> in other words, a comprehensive treatment not only of the specimens in the British national collection but of this phase of Arab numismatics as a whole. <name type="pname">Mr. Walker</name> writes me that his work, inevitably delayed by the exigencies of the war, is nearing completion and will probably be ready in 1950. There is every reason to believe that he will accord the same exhaustive and competent attention to the difficult problems presented by the Latin types of <name type="place">Arab Spain</name> as that which he devoted to those of early <name type="place">Arab Persia</name>, and since the Spanish issues are closely related to those of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name>, and these in turn stand in a certain relationship with <name type="place">Byzantine</name> and other <name type="place">Byzantine-Arab</name> coinages further afield, I have retreated from the whole complex

               <p>There are some coppers of purely Arab type, associated with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, but which must be attributed to <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name>. These include mintless issues of the years 91 and 92<ref target="#CH-pg21-n2">2</ref>, and a type with لا الله | لا اله ا on the obverse, and a fish with <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_029.jpg"/> above and beneath on the reverse<ref target="#CH-pg21-n3">3</ref>. The latter might just possibly have been struck in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>; in any case, whether these coins were issued on the <name type="place">African</name> or the <name type="place">European</name> side of the Straits, the suggestion of a connection with the ancient types of Gades and other mintings of <name type="place">Hispania Ulterior</name> is inescapable<ref target="#CH-pg21-n4">4</ref>. That the Arabs minted coppers at an early date in the extreme west of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> we know from specimens bearing the mint name of <name type="pname">Tangier</name> (طنجة): for example, the remarkable bilingual Visigothic types first illustrated and described by <name type="pname">Lavoix</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg21-n5">5</ref>, and a number of dated (99, 100, 104 (?), 110, 113, 116 A. H.) and undated <hi rend="italic">fulūs</hi> of purely Arab type<ref target="#CH-pg21-n6">6</ref>.</p>
               <p>As stated above, bilingual gold types are introduced in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> in the year 98, to be followed by purely Arabic gold in 102 A. H. Two years later the first authentic silver of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> makes its appearance<ref target="#CH-pg21-n7">7</ref>, beginning a sparsely represented series of dirhems extending down to 131 A. H., the year before the fall of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>. There are many lacunae in this series, but I believe we may assume that there were issues in each year from about the year 104 until 131. Maqrīzi is, of course, in error in stating that during the reign of <name type="pname">Hishām b. 'Abd al-Malik</name> (106–125 A. H.) the minting of dirhems was discontinued everywhere except at <name type="place">Wāsiṭ</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg21-n8">8</ref>. It is true that the number of <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> mints in 'Irāq and Irān is greatly

reduced during this period, but aside from <name type="place">Wāsiṭ</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>, which are very active, the mints of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> and <name type="place">Qayrawān</name> (<name type="place">Ifrīqiyah</name>), as well as several others in the north-eastern reaches of the Empire, continue in sporadic operation. The fact is interesting, for it suggests that for a time at least a policy was adopted that restricted the minting of silver to a limited number of administrative centers at the heart, and in the western and eastern extremities, of the dominion<ref target="#CH-pg22-n1">1</ref>.</p>
               <p>The minting of gold ceases in 106 A. H. and is not resumed until the time of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>, early in the 4th century of the Hijrah<ref target="#CH-pg22-n2">2</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The question of the date of the first independent issues of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān I</name>, whose rule began in 138 A. H. (756 A. D.) must remain open. Until quite recently the earliest known dirhem of the independent emirate was of the year 148, but a specimen in a <name type="place">Turkish</name> hoard has now pushed the date back to 146; it may be that there are earlier
<pb n="23"/>
issues. Throughout the next century and a half, during all but the latter years of which dirhems were minted every year, there is no fundamental change in the original type copied from that which was adopted by the great Caliph '<name type="pname">Abd al-Malik</name> at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> about the year 75 A. H. The coins are anonymous, and so far as I have been able to determine there is no way of distinguishing the dirhems of an expiring prince from those of his successor in the year in which the succession took place. As they must, for practical reasons, be placed in one or the other rule, I have assigned the coins of these years (<hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., 172, 180, 206, 238, 273 and 275 A. H.) to the rule ending in the given year. Some justification for this choice exists in that there is reason to suppose that some if not all the coins were struck in the first part of the year. In certain cases, to be sure, as for example the year 180, in the second month of which <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam I</name> began to reign, the majority of the coins may belong to him rather than to <name type="pname">Hishām I</name>. But in 206 A. H. almost certainly all belong to <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam</name>, for '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān</name> II did not succeed to the rule until the 25th of Dhū'l-Ḥijjah (the last month of the year).</p>
               <p>A glance at the index of issues will show that throughout this period preserved dirhems are fairly common except in the first half of the 2nd century, in the early 180's, and during the rules of <name type="pname">al-Mundhir</name> and '<name type="pname">Abdullāh</name>. In the latter period the representation is very poor indeed, some years are missing altogether, and after 285 A. H. only two very doubtful specimens (both of the year 293) are known. Fabric and craftsmanship become more and more inferior, flans are increased in diameter and reduced in thickness, and finally there ensues a complete blank in the numismatic history which extends, with one or two copper exceptions (nos. 183 and 184 of the years 303 and 306), down to the resumption and reform of the coinage under '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> in 316 A. H.</p>
               <p>It is during this last quarter of the 3rd century and the first few years of the 4th that a poorly represented and inadequately studied copper coinage makes its appearance (nos. 178–184)<ref target="#CH-pg23-n1">1</ref>, an irregular and probably purely local coinage which has been attributed, rather vaguely, to the rebels, among them the most prominent of them all, '<name type="pname">Umar b. Ḥafṣūn</name>.</p>
               <p>There can be little doubt but that the cause of the dirhem scarcity and final absence of official silver issues altogether is connected with the almost fatal disintegration of the central authority resulting from the harassing tactics of rebellious leaders in various parts of the
<pb n="24"/>
peninsula<ref target="#CH-pg24-n1">1</ref>. The exact relationship between the political scene and the dearth of the coinage is by no means clear, but a few lines of future inquiry which might lead toward clarification may be indicated. The success of this study will, I think, depend in very large measure, as I have suggested elsewhere in this book in other connections<ref target="#CH-pg24-n2">2</ref>, upon a thorough examination, in the field itself, of the evidence of hoards and provenance. These are some of the considerations: (a) was the mint of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> cut off, by rebel action, from the requisite supplies of silver? (b) have we rather perhaps here evidence to support a hypothesis that <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> was not at this time, previous to '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III's</name> "establishment of the mint within the city of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>,"<ref target="#CH-pg24-n3">3</ref> the principal mint, and that the main output flowed from some other city such as <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510911">Seville</name>, which during part of this time was in rebel hands? (c) what is the provenance of the copper?<ref target="#CH-pg24-n4">4</ref> and (d) is it possible that the apparent scarcity and final exhaustion of the coinage is due not so much to reduced output as to the calling-in, melting-down and reissue of the silver of <name type="pname">al-Mundhir's</name> and '<name type="pname">Abdullāh's</name> periods by '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>, when, concurrently with his assumption of the dignities and titles of the Caliphate, he reformed the mint and the style of the coinage?<ref target="#CH-pg24-n5">5</ref> Somewhere among these considerations should lie the solution.</p>

                  <p>There appears to be some evidence that the <name type="place">Wāsiṭ</name> mint struck coins for other mints, including <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>, during the period of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>. <name type="pname">M. Marcel Jungfleisch</name> has written me that "l'atelier de Wasset (<name type="place">Irak</name>) ... a frappé pour et au nom de l'Andalous des dirhems qu'il devient difficile de considérer purement espagnoles", and has drawn attention to this fact in a recent article ("Conjectures au sujet de certaines lettres isolées se recontrant sur les solidi Byzantins du VII<hi rend="sup">e</hi> siècle", in <hi rend="italic">Bulletin de l' Institut d'Égypte</hi>, XXXI, 1948–1949, p. 111): "... les fouilles de <name type="pname">M. de Morgan</name> à Ouasset ont exhumé l'atelier monétaire arabe de cette ville et avec lui un stock important de dirhems neufs prêts à être lancés dans la circulation avec les mentions ضرب بافريقية,ضرب بالاندلس et qui fabriqués en <name type="place">Irak</name> ne furent jamais envoyés en Andalousie ni en Afrikiyah". Unfortunately I have not been able to locate de <name type="pname">Morgan's</name> account of this very interesting discovery, nor is the reference available to <name type="pname">M.

where. Here we enter the most brilliant century of Muslim Spain. To quote <name type="pname">Lévi-Provençal</name>, "Le règne de '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> marque, avec celui de son successeur <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam II</name>, et jusqu'à un certain point, l'époque où les deux premiers dictateurs 'āmirides, <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr</name> et <name type="pname">al-Muẓaffar</name>, prirent le pouvoir, le point culminant de l'occupation musulmane de la Péninsule. Jamais, par la suite, l'Espagne ne put recouvrer au regard de la Chrétienté et du monde musulman la grandeur politique et l'éclat de civilisation auxquels elle parvint à l'époque de ses grands princes umaiyades, ni jouer sur la scène de l'Occident, aussi bien en Europe qu'en Afrique, pareil rôle de premier plan."<ref target="#CH-pg25-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>From 316 until 406 A. H., under the Caliphs '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>, <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam II</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> and his short-lived rivals and successors, there is no break in the annual coinage of silver, first at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>, then for thirty years (336–366 A. H., and also in two later years) at Madīnat al-Zahrā', and again thereafter at al-Andalus. The issues of 316–330 are in some respects experimental, but from the latter year onward the dirhems are of a fixed style which alters very little in its essential traits (except for the changes in names and occasional deterioration or improvement in artisanship) during the ensuing years. Other mints, the only important one of which is <name type="place">Fās,</name> make their appearance in the latter part of the century. A few years at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> are rare, notably the early 370's; but otherwise the production of dirhems is enormous, to judge by the number of specimens that have been preserved and particularly by the quite amazing number of varieties<ref target="#CH-pg25-n2">2</ref>. Appropriately prominent on the coinage throughout the years 356 until his death in 392 A. H. is the name (in the guise of <name type="pname">'Āmir</name>) of the great "<name type="pname">Almanzor</name>", <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr Muḥammad b. abī-'Āmir</name>, whose energies and abilities dominate the whole history of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> in the second half of the 10th Christian century<ref target="#CH-pg25-n3">3</ref>.</p>
               <p>The preserved gold is not nearly so plentiful as the silver, but doubtless the proportion between dinars struck and dinars preserved is much lower than in the case of the dirhems, for the great preponderance of the gold must have been melted down in subsequent

times. Although there are some lacunae in the annual representation of gold (especially in the 370's – roughly the same years in which silver is rare), I see no reason to believe that dinars were not minted every year.</p>
               <p>The political instability and rivalry of the closing days of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate is reflected in the coinage. In 399 A. H. there are issues of both <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> and of <name type="pname">Muḥammad II</name>; in 400 of <name type="pname">Muḥammad</name>, <name type="pname">Sulaymān</name> and <name type="pname">Hishām</name> in his second reign; in 401–403 of <name type="pname">Hishām</name> and <name type="pname">Sulaymān;</name> in 404–406 of <name type="pname">Sulaymān;</name> in 414 and 415 of <name type="pname">Muḥammad III</name>; and in 422 of <name type="pname">Hishām</name> III, the intervening "Caliphs" being unrepreseted. There are many confusing coins of this revolutionary period from 399 down to about 426 A. H., overlapping with the final <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> issues and with the first of the regular series of the <name type="pname">Ḥammūdids</name>. In general I have followed <name type="pname">Prieto y Vives</name> in excluding the coins struck by "personajes desconocido"<ref target="#CH-pg26-n1">1</ref> and the "monedas falsas"<ref target="#CH-pg26-n2">2</ref> of the early 5th century, from the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> corpus, although in the latter category there are some whose authenticity I see no reason for doubting and which therefore have been included. The "unknown persons" of this period properly belong to the <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="pname">Mulūk al-Ṭawā'if</name>

               <p>The early bilingual dinars bear the simple inscription, محمد رسول الله "<name type="pname">Muḥammad</name> is the Messenger of <name type="pname">Allāh</name>," in the center, with the mintdate formula, lacking the <hi rend="italic">basmalah</hi>, in the margin. Beginning with the year 102 and continuing until 106, when gold disappears from the coinage to reappear again only under '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> early in the 4th century of the Hijrah, the obverse carries in the area the first part of the declaration of faith, لا اله الا الله وحده, "There is no God but <name type="pname">Allāh</name>, He is One"; and the full <hi rend="italic">basmalah</hi>, بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم, "In the name of <name type="pname">Allāh</name>, the Compassionate, the Merciful," appears on the reverse. The margins bear respectively the verse Qur'ān IX, 33 (or LXI, 9): محمد رسول الله ارسله بالهدي و دين الحق ليظهره على الدين كله ولو كره المشركون "<name type="pname">Muḥammad</name> is the Messenger of <name type="pname">Allāh</name>; He sent him with guidance and the religion of truth, that he may make it victorious over every other religion, even though the infidels abhor it";<ref target="#CH-pg27-n1">1</ref> and the mint-date formula without the <hi rend="italic">basmalah.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">basmalah</hi> is not really lacking, however, for the reverse area is to be read as the introduction to the mint-date formula, and for this reason بسم الله is lacking in the margin.</p>
               <p>These legends, while thoroughly conventional, differ in several respected from those on the contemporary and earlier dinars in the East: on the latter the first part of the declaration of faith is supplemented
<pb n="28"/>
by لا شريك له, "There is no partner with Him," a phrase which remained customary on the coinage of most Islamic dynasties for hundreds of years; and the reverse area carries in the area <hi rend="italic">sūrah</hi> Qur'ān CXII: الله احد الله الصمد لم يلد ولم يولد (lacking the first two words (قل هو, "Say: He...") and the fourth verse, which always appears on the silver), "He is God alone; God the Eternal. He begetteth not, and He is not begotten; (and there is none like unto Him)"; while in the reverse margin of the eastern dinars the mintdate formula is introduced by بسم الله. These differeness may be viewed as an early manifestation of that independence of the emirs in the West which was later to become a political fact of great significance.</p>
               <p>When two hundred years later gold again makes its appearance in the coinage of the <name type="place">Umayyads of Spain</name> the inscriptions are altered to reflect '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān's</name> assumption of new political dignities and in general conformance with the accompanying changes in the dirhem types. The phrase, لا شريك له, as at all times on the silver, completes the first part of the declaration of faith on the obverse. A radical innovation, however, is introduced into the reverse with the appearance of the Caliph's name and titles. In '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān's</name> early gold issues there is considerable variation in these reverse legends. The first known dinar, of the year 317, has محمد رسول الله, followed by امير المؤمنين عبد الرحمن "Commander of the Believers, '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān</name>," introduced by the preposition <hi rend="italic">li</hi>, "to" or "for". In the following year محمد رسول الله is relegated to the obverse, and room is made for the addition of the Caliph's other title الامام, "Al-Imām," and his honorific الناصر لدين الله, "Al-Nāṣir li-dīn Allāh" ("the Aider – or Defender – of the Religion of Allāh), on the reverse. Thenceforth, until about the year 330, there are minor changes in the distribution of the various elements, the fractional dinars as a rule retaining the formulae of the year 317. From 330 forward the three-line inscription الامام الناصر لدين الله عبد  الرحمن امير المؤمنين, becomes the general rule. At first, and for some time, the mint-date formula is found in the reverse margin, Qur'ān IX, 33, being in the obverse. Later in '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān's</name> rule, and under
<pb n="29"/>
his successors, the functions of the margins are generally interchanged, just as in the East under the '<name type="place">Abbāsids</name>, a hundred years earlier, the mint-date formula had moved from the reverse to the obverse.</p>
               <p>Throughout the catalogue, in view of the variability of the dinar legends with respect not only to protocol but to distribution of words and position of the marginal legends, all the gold coins are described in full, and resort is not had to the expedient of abbreviated descriptions, which has been deemed desirable in dealing with the more standardized silver.</p>
               <p>After '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> and throughout the remainder of the life of the dynasty, the only significant changes in the conventional inscriptions are those of the succeeding Caliphs' protocols, and these with few variations conform with the silver (see below).</p>

               <p>The pattern of the conventional legends on the silver coinage for nearly two hundred years is set with the very first dirhem known, that of the year 104. In every respect (except, of course, the name of the mint) the legends are identical with those on the reformed dirhems of the great <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate struck at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> and at numerous other mints in '<name type="place">Irāq</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_130758">Irān</name>. The fall of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate in the East in 132 A. H. (750 A. D.) brought about numerous changes in the content of the inscriptions carried by the dirhems, but no such alteration occurred in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> in the long period between the beginning of the 2nd and the end of the 3rd (8th to early 10th) centuries. These legends are given in full in the catalogue under no. 4 (b): the first part of the declaration of faith لا اله الا الله وحده لا شريك له in the obverse area, and all of Qur'ān CXII<ref target="#CH-pg29-n1">1</ref> in the reverse area. The margins bear respectively the mint-date formula and Qur'ān IX, 33. These inscriptions not being repeated in the catalogue, the reader is to understand that they are always present on the dirhems down to the end of the 3rd century of the Hijrah. The position of any supplementary legends or symbols with reference to the conventional area inscriptions is indicated by a horizontal line. Thus ∴ / معاذ at the left side of the page indicates a symbol of pyramided pellets above, and the name معاذ beneath, the obverse area.</p>

               <p>After the strange lapse in the coinage during the rule of '<name type="pname">Abdullāh</name> (275–300 A. H. = 888–912 A. D.), '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> introduces new elements in the legends on the dirhems paralleling those on the dinars described above. On the first issue known, that of the year 316 (no. 185), no change is made on the reverse; but on the obverse the declaration of faith is rendered in two lines and لامير المؤمنين عبد الرحمن is added in two further lines beneath. In the same year at "<name type="place">Sikkat al-Andalus</name>" (no. 186) محمد رسول الله is appended to the obverse, and the reverse introduces the full style and titles of the Caliph الامام الناصر لدين الله عبد الرحمن امير المؤمنين. On one issue of 317 the reverse carries two marginal legends, the mint-date formula and Qur'ān XXX, 3–4, an <name type="pname">'Abbāsid</name> convention (on the obverse beginning early in the 3rd century). Also in the year 317 we find the phrase ايده الله beneath the reverse, an invocation which incidentally occurs following the Caliph's name and titles in a building inscription of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān's</name> dated 333 A. H.<ref target="#CH-pg30-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the immediately ensuing years Qur'ān CXII disappears entirely, while various experiments are made in the distribution of the religious and political legends on obverse and reverse. Throughout this transitional period the inscriptions on the dirhems are rendered in full in the catalogue lest the reader be in doubt as to the exact type in question. Finally, after the year 336, when the manner of presenting '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān's</name> titles and name is stereotyped thus:</p>
               <p>الامام الناصر</p>
               <p>لدين الله عبد الرحمن</p>
               <p>امير المؤمنين</p>
               <p>the conventional area inscriptions of both obverse and reverse are no longer given in the catalogue, it being understood that they are always present. The position of supplementary symbols and names is indicated as before.</p>
               <p>With the succeeding Caliphs the fundamental inscriptions of the obverse remain constant (with the exception naturally of mint and date) and the only change is in the reverse area. The usual protocols of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>'s successors are:</p>

               <p>As before, the above protocols on dirhems are not usually repeated in the catalogue after their first appearance. However, any alteration in the arrangement of words or lines is invariably noted: as, for example, with <name type="pname">Hishām's</name> earlier issues at <name type="place">Fās</name> where the second and third lines are interchanged, or when the usual three-line legend is increased to four or five by placing the words الامام or المؤيد, etc. on separate lines. And also, as before, unless otherwise noted, the obverse margin is understood to bear the mint and date, the reverse Qur'ān IX, 33. It should be remarked that in the latter fourth and early fifth centuries these marginal legends are seldom complete. This lack of completeness with respect to the date, while annoying enough, is rarely a serious hazard to correct attribution. The century, of course, is easily deduced. When the decade is abbreviated or lacking altogether, there is cause for some embarrassment, but the correct figure can usually be arrived at by a combination of various criteria, such as the Caliphal protocol, the auxiliary names and the type of ornament. Obviously when one works with a large mass of material the difficulties of attribution diminish; the collector with a few specimens only is handicapped, but he should find that the compilation and indices in the present catalogue will furnish him with the necessary guides to precise identification. For obvious reasons the degree of completeness of marginal legends is not indicated in the descriptions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">fulūs</hi> in the East, irregular in the content and style of their inscriptions, but they are simple and are transcribed in full throughout the catalogue. Those assigned to the latter part of the 3rd century of the Hijrah bear, for the most part, the conventional ('<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name>) type of obverse and reverse area legends: <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., the first part of the <hi rend="italic">shahadah</hi> on the obverse, and محمد رسول الله on the reverse. Supplementary names which appear above and beneath the areas are dealt with elsewhere. Marginal legends are usually lacking in this class. The remainder of the copper (or billon) issues are mostly probable forgeries and their legends in general are similar to those of the silver.</p>

               <p>The only mint name on the coinage down to the year 336 A. H. is <name type="pname">al-Andalus</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg33-n1">1</ref>, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> "Andalusia" or "Spain." The identification of this name, which is that of a province and later of an independent state, rather than that of a city, has been the subject of much discussion. Almost universally it has been accepted to signify <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> (<name type="place">Qurṭubah</name>), the capital<ref target="#CH-pg33-n2">2</ref>. While it was the predominant practice of the Arabs in the early days of Islam to name their mints on the coinage by the city in which they were located, the designation of the capital by the name of the province is not without parallel. We have, for example, in <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> times, <name type="place">Ifrīqiyah</name> (<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</name>)<ref target="#CH-pg33-n3">3</ref>, representing the capital <name type="place">Qayrawān</name>, and <name type="place">Maghrib</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg33-n4">4</ref>, a more embracing appellation including all of <name type="place">north-west Africa</name>, also for <name type="place">Qayrawān</name>; <name type="place">Armīnīyah</name> (<name type="place">Armenia</name>), for <name type="place">Dabīl</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg33-n5">5</ref>; <name type="place">Adharbayjān</name>, for <name type="place">Ardabīl</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg33-n6">6</ref>; <name type="place">Sijistān</name>, for <name type="place">Zaranj</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg33-n7">7</ref>; and, of course, <name type="place">Miṣr</name>, for <name type="place">Fusṭāṭ</name> and later <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cairo">Cairo</name>. In most cases (except the last named) the practice was later discontinued, but in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> it persisted for four hundred years; and, to the embarrassment of numismatists, for well over two hundred years <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> was the only mint-name, if not the only mint, in the whole peninsula, a very remarkable fact especially if we consider the large number of Visigothic mints which were in operation in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> down to the time of Wittiza, and the very numerous <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> and '<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name> mints in the eastern provinces.</p>
               <pb n="34"/>
               <p>That the name <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> on the coins did not in later days always signify <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> is a matter which I shall shortly discuss, but there can be little doubt that this was the location of the principal mint after the capital was established in that city, probably about the year 100 (719 A. D.), when the governor <name type="pname">al-Ḥurr b.</name> '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān al-Thakafi</name> and his successor <name type="pname">al-Samḥ b. Mālik al-Khawlāni</name> fixed their residence there<ref target="#CH-pg34-n1">1</ref>. Previously the provincial capital of the governors had been <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510911">Seville</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg34-n2">2</ref>, and we must assume that the early Latin types and (unless the chroniclers are in error by two years in the date of the establishment of the capital at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>) the bilingual issues of 98 A. H., were struck at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510911">Seville</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg34-n3">3</ref>, although it has been suggested that it was at <name type="place">Toledo</name> that the earliest dinars were minted<ref target="#CH-pg34-n4">4</ref>. With the appearance of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā'</name> in 336, the disappearance and reappearance later of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>, and the emergence of several other mints at later dates in the 4th century, it is self-evident that at certain times from 336 onward there was more than one mint. <name type="pname">Vives</name> has argued – and the evidence, while by no means conclusive, is persuasive – that the name <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> was sometimes used on dirhems of <name type="place">Fās</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg34-n5">5</ref>. Finally, there can be no doubt that in the confusing period of the collapse of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate at the beginning of the 5th century of the Hijrah, and thereafter in the early days of the <name type="pname">Mulūk al-Ṭawā'īf</name>, the name <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> was frequently employed on
<pb n="35"/>
the coinage for reasons of political pretence or prestige by sundry princes who were not in possession of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>, and whose mints were obviously located in other provincial cities, such as <name type="place">Ceuta</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510911">Seville</name>, <name type="place">Saragossa</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2521420">Badajoz</name>, etc<ref target="#CH-pg35-n1">1</ref>.</p>
               <p>Thus, while accepting the almost incontravertible primary identification of the mint-name <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> throughout most of the period during which that name appears on the coins, we must acknowledge that at times, both early and late in the history of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> state, the name "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>" indisputably served as an appellation for other cities. This being so, there can be no escaping a corollary possibility: <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., that even during the relatively stable 2nd and 3rd centuries, when <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> is the only mint-name, and during the 4th when it alternates and sometimes coincides with the occurrence of other names, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> may signify not only the mint of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> but also one or more other mints located elsewhere in the peninsula. The question is not a new one. <name type="pname">Vives</name>, recognizing in characteristics of the coins themselves the possibility that more than one mint was represented by the name of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>, proposed a classification by <hi rend="italic">acuñaciones</hi>, of which he distinguished four with distinct traits and others unclassfiable<ref target="#CH-pg35-n2">2</ref>. These categories of <name type="pname">Vives</name>' are examined more fully in the discussion of mint techniques<ref target="#CH-pg35-n3">3</ref>. He did not attempt to locate the different "mintings" or mints. <name type="pname">Codera</name> examined the question in several articles, notably in his important treatment of the <name type="place">Alhama</name> hoard; and the matter is one which has troubled me greatly in the preparation of the present study. Let me say at the outset that the question has not been resolved and that I seem to have made no perceptible advance toward its solution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A priori</hi>, as I have suggested above, one would expect more than one mint to have been established in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> after the conquest was consolidated<ref target="#CH-pg35-n4">4</ref>. The coinage itself would seem to bear out this hypothesis. Aside from some slight differences of flan and engraving tech-
<pb n="36"/>
niques<ref target="#CH-pg36-n1">1</ref>, there is the matter of multiplicity of dies. The number of varieties of dirhems in given years is, as I have remarked elsewhere<ref target="#CH-pg36-n2">2</ref>, almost incredible. To cite only a few of many examples: in the year 379, all the 18 HSA specimens (with one possible exception) are different in their ornamentation, and so also are the 34 specimens in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</name> collection; in the year 389, among 297 specimens recorded, there are more than fifty varieties; and in 391, of 323 specimens, over sixty varieties. By varieties I mean different combinations of obverse and reverse types, without reference to different dies of the same type, which by and large (for obvious reasons) I have not attempted to record. In each of these instances the number of varieties mentioned is only a fraction of what must have been the total of varieties, for: (a) dies are not considered, (b) a large proportion of the specimens recorded from the literature is not described in detail, so that their attribution to this or that variety is impossible, and (c) the total of specimens recorded is only a fraction of those preserved but unpublished, and a minute fraction of those originally struck. <name type="pname">Codera</name> observed that he had seen 73 varieties of the year 379 and 69 of the year 380<ref target="#CH-pg36-n3">3</ref>, and remarked that it was difficult to suppose that all these had been struck at one mint; on another occasion he pointed out that it was a very rare occurrence to find two dirhems struck from the same set of dies, and this has been my experience too, although I readily acknowledge that I have not submitted each "duplicate" to the exhaustive scrutiny necessary to substantiate this impression.</p>
               <p>Any arguments, however, based exclusively on the multiplicity of varieties loses its force when the same criterion is applied to the only other well-represented mint of the <name type="place">Umayyads of Spain</name>, that is, <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>', which cannot signify any other place than the famous city of that name. For example, of the year 356 at <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' I have recorded more than 35 varieties; and here again, if
<pb n="37"/>
the same limitations in recording as those mentioned above are observed, it can readily be seen that the total of varieties issued must have been several times this number. One concludes therefore that the occurrence of many varieties does not imply many mints, or, for that matter, more than one mint.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Codera</name>, enjoying the advantage of examining many thousands of specimens, including those from some large hoards the provenances of which were known, made use of additional and more cogent arguments in support of the hypothesis that the name "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>" represented more than one mint. In his study of the <name type="place">Alhama</name> hoard<ref target="#CH-pg37-n1">1</ref> he arrived at the following conclusions based upon the application of <name type="pname">Vives</name>' system of <hi rend="italic">acuñaciones</hi> to the coins in question: that there were three mints in the period represented by the hoard (153–262 A. H.), and that <name type="pname">Vives</name>' second <hi rend="italic">acuñación</hi> (my style B) was located in the region of Granada. At the same time he made some tentative deductions, based on the provenance of collections, with regard to the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> mint-name in the period of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg37-n2">2</ref>. It appears that most of the ornaments on the dirhems of the second half of the 4th century in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</name> Museum differ from those in <name type="pname">Codera's</name> collection<ref target="#CH-pg37-n3">3</ref>, and that most of the Museum's coins of this period (at that time) were from a find of more than 3000 pieces, from which the Museum acquired, "in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>," some 700, whereas more than 900 specimens in <name type="pname">Codera's</name> private collection came from a hoard found in the province of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3658666">Cuenca</name>. The lack of duplication in the mass of the two collections suggested to <name type="pname">Codera</name> that most of the Museum's pieces were of Andalusian provenance, and that most of his own had been struck in the <hi rend="italic">Frontera Superior</hi>, perhaps at <name type="place">Saragossa</name>. This quite plausible argumentation was put forward more as an example of the nature of conclusions that might be drawn from the examination of large bodies of material than as the basis for definitive attributions.</p>
               <p>The suggestion of <name type="pname">Codera</name> with regard to striking differences in the ornaments on the coins in two large collections of different provenance is in harmony with my own observations in the course of cataloguing the Hispanic Society and American Numismatic Society collections: in some instances where a given year is represented by a large number of specimens in the former collection and there is a general similarity
<pb n="38"/>
in the character of the ornaments on those specimens, one or more pieces of the same year in the American Numismatic Society collection show quite a different type of ornament<ref target="#CH-pg38-n1">1</ref>. The same is true occasionally with illustrated specimens from other collections. One is tempted, therefore, to conclude that certain types circulated in different parts of the country. It does not necessarily follow, of course, that the different types were the products of different mints (all named <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>); they might all have been struck at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> (with the exception of some issued at <name type="place">Fās</name> and those of the revolutionary period which must have been minted elsewhere), but with distinguishing characteristics for various administrative districts. There is in any case no doubt whatever that the only way in which the problem can be solved, if indeed there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a problem with regard to the significance of the name "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>" on the coins, is by a systematic study of hoards, provenance and distribution. However extensive the material, such a study cannot be made on the basis of information available at present. In the absence of any quantity of published data on provenance it can only be made in the provincial museums, antique shops and private collections of Spain.</p>
               <p>As previously noted, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> is the only mint-name until the appearance of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' in 336 A. H., in which year there are specimens from both mints. In the year 337, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> disappears and, with one exception, does not reappear as a mint until 365 when it resumes activity, continuing uninterruptedly as an <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> mint down to 406 and thereafter alternately in the control of the <name type="pname">Umayyads</name> and their successors. The exception to the period of inactivity is the year 343, when there are several specimens (including one in the Hispanic Society collection) of an anomalous, semi-barbaric issue, which <name type="pname">Vives</name> and <name type="pname">Codera</name> attributed to <name type="place">Fās</name>, but which may be a contemporary counterfeit of African origin<ref target="#CH-pg38-n2">2</ref>. The mint of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> issued gold under the governors in 98, 102–104, and 106 A. H., and under the Caliphate for many years beginning with the year 317. Although there are numerous lacunae in the chronological list of preserved gold issues from 317 to 422, I believe it is not unlikely that dinars were minted in every year from 316 (?) forward<ref target="#CH-pg38-n3">3</ref>. The bulk of the coinage, of course, was silver. Copper was issued in various years (see table).</p>
               <pb n="39"/>
               <p>There are very few historical references to the mint at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>. According to a puzzling report, repeated by several Muslim historians and later by European writers, '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān II</name> was the first to establish a mint at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>. Like so much other information furnished by Arab writers relating to aspects of archaeology, this tradition is undoubtedly compounded of a certain modicum of truth with generous quantities of misinformed interpretation. <name type="pname">Lévi-Provençal</name>, in his <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place">L'Espagne</name> musulmane au X<hi rend="sup">ème</hi> Siècle</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg39-n1">1</ref>, gives us the most exhaustive rendering of the tradition as found in a short anonymous work entitled <hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-Zahrāt al-manthūrah fi'l-akhbār al-ma'thūrah</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg39-n2">2</ref>. According to the author:</p>
               <q>"les habitants de l'Espagne musulmane n'eurent pas, depuis l'époque de la conquête jusqu'au règne de l'émir '<name type="pname">Abd ar-Raḥmān II</name>, de véritable monnaie nationale. Ils se servaient des pièces, dīnārs et dirhems, apportées en petit nombre dans le pays par les voyageurs musulmanes. La monnaie était dès lors très rare et presque toutes les transactions se faisaient simplement par voie d'échange. Cette situation se prolongea pendant cent vingt-cinq ans, jusqu'au moment où, sur le conseil de <name type="pname">Ḥāriṯ b. Abi'š-Šibl</name>, '<name type="pname">Abd ar-Raḥmān II</name> fit frapper des pièces à son nom à <name type="place">Cordoue</name>. Mais les émissions en furent d'un nombre très réduit, et la plupart des dīnārs et des dirhems qui circulaient en <name type="place">Espagne</name> sous le règne de ce prince demeurèrent de frappe maġribine ou orientale."</q>
               <p>I do not know the date of this anonymous treatise, but a less elaborate, and probably the fundamental, version is to be found in <name type="pname">Ibn 'Idhāri</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg39-n3">3</ref>, who says simply واتّخذ السكة بقرطبة, a phrase which has been the basis of statements to the effect that '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān II</name> was the first to strike coins at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg39-n4">4</ref>, and further carelessly extended to signify that he was the first to issue coinage in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>. It would seem to me that what <name type="pname">Ibn 'Idhāri</name> intended was only that '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān II</name> took over, or took possession of, the mint at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>; that is, that the existing mint, which had not formerly been under direct
<pb n="40"/>
governmental supervision was transferred to the administration in line with other executive reforms accomplished under that prince's rule. With so much of the report, and so interpreted, there is no problem. If we look for some reflection of the event in the coinage itself, it may be that we can find it in the reform that created style B in the year 229 A. H.<ref target="#CH-pg40-n1">1</ref>.</p>
               <p>As for the more elaborate tradition that there was no true national coinage until the period of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān II</name> and that currency was very scarce in the country until after his time, I would suggest that we have here an example of that compounding of truth and error to which I have alluded. A true national coinage <hi rend="italic">was</hi> introduced, not under '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān II</name>, but under '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>. It was the latter who "struck pieces in his own name." Until that time the style was in every respect, except for inevitable change in the character of the epigraphy, that of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphs of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, not a "national" coinage. And except for the early issues under the governors there was no gold (the fundamental monetary sign of sovereignty) until '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>. Have we not simply a confusion of two individuals by the same name, and was not the specific lapse of years made up to suit the mistaken identity? Finally, to use the relative rarity of specimens of the 2nd and 3rd centuries as a gauge, there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a scarcity of coin until well after the middle of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>'s reign. More specifically, and making a not unreasonable allowance for still further confusion, there was an even greater scarcity down to about the year 150 A. H.; in this respect the tradition about the dearth of coin and the use of dinars and dirhems from overseas may well apply not to '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān II</name> or III, but rather to the first '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān</name>, the founder of the dynasty. Somewhere among these speculations lies the truth. At all events, except insofar as these traditions may bear on the location of the mint, the matter is of secondary importance, for in other respects the prime evidence is the preserved coinage itself.</p>
               <p>There is another report in <name type="pname">Ibn 'Idhāri</name> which is quite interesting and intelligible<ref target="#CH-pg40-n2">2</ref>. Speaking of the year 316:</p>
               <p>و فيها امر الناصر باقامة دار السكّة داخل مدينة قرطبة لضرب الدنانير والدراهم</p>
               <p>يوم الثلثا لثلث عشرة ليلة بقيت من[حدير]وولى الخطة احمد بن موسى بن جدير</p>
               <pb n="41"/>
               <p>شهر رمضان و اقام الضرب فيها من هذا التاريخ من خالص الذهب و الفضة و صحح </p>
               <p>فى ذلك احمد بن موسى و تحفّظ و كانت مثاقيله و دراهمه عيارا محضا</p>
               <q>"And in this year <name type="pname">al-Nāṣir</name> ['<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>] ordered the establishment of the mint within the city of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> for the striking of dinars and dirhems. He appointed to the office <name type="pname">Aḥmad b. Mūsā b. Ḥudair</name> on Tuesday, thirteen days before the end of Ramaḍān [Sept. 6 (?), 928 A. D.]<ref target="#CH-pg41-n1">1</ref>. From this date the strikings in the mint were of pure gold and silver. <name type="pname">Aḥmad b. Mūsā</name> was rigorous in accuracy and care, and his mithqāls and dirhems were of the highest purity."</q>
               <p>The date conforms perfectly with the preserved numismatic evidence: in the year 316 appear the first issues of the reformed, national coinage of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg41-n2">2</ref>. The implication would be that in connection with '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān's</name> assumption of new titles and the reform of the coinage, he undertook a complete reorganization of the mint, including perhaps the consolidation of the establishment, which may have consisted of several <hi rend="italic">atéliers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">officinae</hi> scattered around the city, within the confines of the administrative capital itself<ref target="#CH-pg41-n3">3</ref>. In any case the mint, or the workshops of the mint, of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> must have been in a very run-down state (if indeed they were functioning at all) after the long period of inactivity, so far as silver (and, of course, gold) was concerned, lasting from <hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. 293 to 316 A. H., and consequently the use of the word <hi rend="italic">iqāmah</hi>, "establishment," may be taken quite literally; that is, '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān's</name> mint was perhaps to all intents and purposes a new one. This interpretation would do away with the necessity of any speculation regarding the centralization of the mint within the administrative district.</p>
               <p>The troublesome but interesting question of the etymology of the name <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> (= <name type="place">Andalusia</name>) is not of primary concern in the present monograph. <name type="pname">Dozy</name> in 1881 summed up the research and theory to that date in his <hi rend="italic">Recherches</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg41-n4">4</ref>. Convenient modern statements of the problem are to be found in <name type="pname">C. F. Seybold's</name> article in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia of Islām</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg41-n5">5</ref>, and in Cagigas' monograph entitled "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>" in the
<pb n="42"/>
journal by the same name<ref target="#CH-pg42-n1">1</ref>. The heretofore commonly accepted derivation, Vandalicia, a hypothetical name presumed to have been given to the peninsula by the Vandals, is now discredited. Certainly we have our earliest documentary evidence of the use of the name in the Arabic legends (not the Latin legends, where Spania is the name) of the bilingual coins of the year 98 A. H. As for the Arab historians<ref target="#CH-pg42-n2">2</ref>, they say that <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> was the name of the peninsula<ref target="#CH-pg42-n3">3</ref>, later called the <name type="place">peninsula of Ṭarīf</name> (<name type="place">Ṭarīfah</name>,) opposite <name type="place">Tangier</name>, where the Muslims first landed. The later geographers' pseudo-etymologizing (<name type="place">Andalus</name>, son of <name type="pname">Tubal</name>, son of <name type="pname">Japhet</name>) follows in due course. But the fact remains that there is a void behind the sudden appearance of the name on the dinars of 98 A. H. <name type="pname">Cagigas</name>' recently proposed theory is ingenious but certainly inconclusive. He argues that the many errors in the epigraphy as well as in the chronological indications<ref target="#CH-pg42-n4">4</ref> of the early Latin and bilingual types of Muslim Spain<ref target="#CH-pg42-n5">5</ref> suggest ignorance on the part of the die-engravers with respect to both the Arabic language and to Christian chronology. Were these artisans then Jews?<ref target="#CH-pg42-n6">6</ref> And were they the translators of "Spania" into "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>"? Very tentatively Cagigas suggests on the basis of some indications in Biblical neolithic toponymy that the root of the name <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> might lie in <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place">Adna</name>
                  </hi> or <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="place">Anda</name>
                  </hi> (<name type="place">Eden</name>); or else that, as an exotic, perhaps bookish or pedantic, name it was brought into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> across <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</name> from the East, whence came the first eminent (<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, "literate) Muslims<ref target="#CH-pg42-n7">7</ref>. I should imagine that the explanation is to be found somewhere in the latter direction.</p>

                  <p>Marked differences of style or technique would not be prerequisite to the hypothesis that coins bearing the name <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> were struck at more than one mint. As evidence of the remarkable uniformity which the supervisor of the coinage was able to achieve in the early days of the Arab empire we need only point out the striking similarity of most <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> (and to a lesser degree '<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name>) dirhems in the East, issued by mints separated from each other by many hundreds of miles. Frequently the only recognizable difference is the name of the mint. Cf. p. 22, footnote 1, above. Centralized control of the general design and character of the coinage is abundantly apparent in late Muslim times as well: <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>., the extraordinary similarity of the silver from many mints under the <name type="pname">Ilkhānid Abū-Sa'īd</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name> in the 14th century.</p>

               <p>This variant occurs only once, in the year 381 A. H. (no. 290), on a dinar which <name type="pname">Lavoix</name> (and <name type="pname">Vives</name> after him) described as an imitation. To judge by <name type="pname">Lavoix's</name> indication that his transcriptions are "rectified" or normalized, it would seem that barbarous epigraphy is the basis for designating the coin an imitation, but there may have been other reasons. Unless the dinar is patently and imitation or counter­feit, I would be inclined to accept it as another irregular issue of this year in which there are two other remarkable issues: <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā'</name> and <name type="place">Madīnat Qurṭubah.</name>

               <p>
                  <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' was the famous residence and capital built by '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> and supposedly named after a concubine by the name of <name type="pname">Zahrā'</name> (meaning "bright," "serene," "blooming", and an epithet given to <name type="pname">Fatima</name>). It was situated five miles west of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> in the foot-hills of the <name type="place">Sierra Morena</name> overlooking the <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q14309">Guadalquivír</name>. The construction of the magnificent city, begun early in the year 325 (936 A. D.)<ref target="#CH-pg43-n3">3</ref>, continued over many years – as many as twenty-five or forty, according to some repors<ref target="#CH-pg43-n4">4</ref>. So far as the mint is concerned,
<pb n="44"/>
the evidence of the coins and the testimony of the chroniclers are in complete agreement. <name type="pname">Ibn 'Idhāri</name> writes<ref target="#CH-pg44-n1">1</ref>, under the year 336 A. H.:<hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> و نقل السكّة من مدينة قرطبة الى الصحراء, "And he['<name type="pname">Abdal-Raḥmān III</name>] transferred the mint from the city of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> to <name type="place">al-Ṣaḥrā'</name> [read <name type="place">al-Zahrā</name>']". It is exactly in that year that the name of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' first appears on the coinage. If the proportion of coins preserved from each of the two mints is a dependabee measure, the transfer must have taken place late in the year, for there are many more specimens from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> than from the new mint. For the next twenty-nine years <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' is the sole mint in operation<ref target="#CH-pg44-n2">2</ref>, but early (?) in 365 A. H. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> again appears, and in the same year <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>', after issuing a dirhem with a curiously confused legend<ref target="#CH-pg44-n3">3</ref>, closes down.</p>
               <p>The historians throw no direct light upon this removal of the mint from <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' to (presumably) <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> again, but I believe there can be little doubt that the event is connected with the increasing independenee of the great <name type="pname">
                     <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi> Muḥammad b. abi-'Āmir</name> and his gradual withdrawal from the company of the Caliph<ref target="#CH-pg44-n4">4</ref>. His earlier appointment as director of the mint is discussed elsewhere<ref target="#CH-pg44-n5">5</ref>; by this time his control of the treasury as well as the mint was becoming absolute, and doubtless it was he who arranged to separate the latter establishment from the Caliph's ménage at <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> where he was complete master. The construction of his own residential capital at <name type="place">al-Madīnat al-Zāhirah</name> only three years later is an indication of a trend that had already set in<ref target="#CH-pg44-n6">6</ref>.</p>
               <p>The reappearanee of the name of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' on the coinage in four later years, 366, 381, 388 and 400, requires comment. There is a unique dirhem of <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam's</name> of 366<ref target="#CH-pg44-n7">7</ref>, a unique dinar of 381 in the British Museum<ref target="#CH-pg44-n8">8</ref>, an equally unique dirhem of 388, also in the British Museum<ref target="#CH-pg44-n9">9</ref>, and numerous dirhems together with a few dinars
<pb n="45"/>
of 400<ref target="#CH-pg45-n1">1</ref>. The first is possibly a misattribution, but if it is not, the solution may lie in the slip of a die-engraver. The next two are "freaks" which I am unable to explain, but for which there must be some explanation. As remarked in section 3 above, there are several numismatic aberrations in the year 381 (<name type="place">Madīnat al-Andalus</name> and <name type="place">Madīnat Qurṭubah</name>, as well as the coin in question here); for these we can only speculate that there was some abortive administrative reform in the mint, but I am aware of no documenation<ref target="#CH-pg45-n2">2</ref>. <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' was by this date already declining<ref target="#CH-pg45-n3">3</ref>, and a suggestion of a revival of its importance as a center of governmental affairs is surprising<ref target="#CH-pg45-n4">4</ref>. By the same token the plentiful coinage struck at the Caliphal residence in the year 400 is the more remarkable. But in this latter instance, in spite of the decline and imminent total destruction of the famous city, there is an adequate explanation ready to hand. <name type="pname">Sulaymānal-Musta'īn</name> was proclaimed Caliph in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> on 17 Rabī' I, 400. The coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> bearing his name<ref target="#CH-pg45-n5">5</ref> must have been struck at the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> mint immediately thereafter. His hold on the Cordoban populace was never secure<ref target="#CH-pg45-n6">6</ref>, and his Ṣanhājian leader <name type="pname">Zāwi b. al-Zīri</name> with his Berber following found themselves so unpopular that they chose in the ensuing months to remove themselves to <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>'. As a result of Sulaymān's defeat at the battle of '<name type="place">Aqabat al-Baqar</name>, <name type="pname">Muḥammad al-Mahdi</name> reentered <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> and was raised again to the "Caliphate" on 6 Shawwāl, 400, that is, only a little more than six months after Sulaymān's original success. In flight Zāwi and his followers paused to pick up their families at <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>'<ref target="#CH-pg45-n7">7</ref>. Thus <name type="pname">Sulaymān's</name> coins issued at <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>'<ref target="#CH-pg45-n8">8</ref> must have been struck between roughly Rabī' II and Ramaḍān, during the period when the hostility of the natives in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> made it seem wise to <name type="pname">Sulaymān's</name> faction to remove the mint to a safer or more congenial atmosphere. These issues of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' are valuable documentary evidence to the effect that that city had not yet been abandoned, an implication sometimes met with in the historical literature.</p>
               <pb n="46"/>
               <p>There remains a unique dirhem of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' of the year 400, struck by <name type="pname">Hishām</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg46-n1">1</ref>. I suspect that the attribution although deliberate is mistaken, but it is just barely possible that some dirhems were minted there before the transfer of the mint back to Cordoba.</p>

                  <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> was the well-known city in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</name>, capital of the <name type="place">Midrārids</name>, located about 200 miles south-south-east of Fās<ref target="#CH-pg46-n2">2</ref>. A mint was located there well before the temporary allegiance of the city to the <name type="place">Umayyads of Spain</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg46-n3">3</ref>. The years, so far as we know, in which coins (all dinars) were struck at <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> in the name of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> were 378, 381, 383, 384 and, with the name written <name type="place">Madīnat Sijilmāsah</name> (and of very doubtful date) 395. It is probably safe to assume that there were issues in 379, 380 and 382 as well, but no specimens have come to light. All but one of these issues is represented by unique specimens, and there are only two of the remaining issue. In addition there are eleven inadequately described dinars of <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> with dates lacking (see the note following no. 353 in the catalogue).</p>
               <p>The pertinent historical facts are scanty: in 366 (976/7 A. D.), or in 369, according to another account, a Maghrāwi chief by the name of <name type="pname">Khazrūn b. Falfūl b. Khazar</name> besieged and captured the city of <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> from the <name type="place">Midrārids</name>. He had acted upon the instigation of the <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi>
                  <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr</name>, and the latter thereupon appointed him as governor of the city. <name type="pname">Khazrūn</name> of course acknowledged <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> as sovereign, and in the words of <name type="pname">Ibn Khaldūn</name>, the authority of the <name type="pname">Umayyads</name> was for the first time recognized in <name type="place">Maghrib al-Aqṣa</name> (extreme <name type="place">north-west Africa</name>)<ref target="#CH-pg46-n4">4</ref>. Recognition on the coinage naturally followed that in the prayes. We know also that the region remained intermittently under the control of <name type="pname">Khazrūn</name> and his son <name type="pname">Wānūdīn</name>, the latter also acknowledging <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> sovereignty and confirmed as governor by <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> authority, until the collapse of the dynasty in Spain<ref target="#CH-pg46-n5">5</ref>. These events account adequately for the issues of coinage in

question, even for that of the very doubtful one of 395 (the date ending with the digit). Actually the name on the obverse of this last coin may be that of <name type="pname">Wānūdīn</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg47-n1">1</ref>, in which case the date 395 is not unlikely. Perhaps future discoveries will bring to light issues dating between 366 (or 369) and 378, and after 384.</p>
               <p>The subsequent history of the mint of <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> under the <name type="pname">Murābiṭs</name>, <name type="pname">Marīnids</name>, etc., does not concern us here.</p>

               <p>Two issues only, of the years 384 and 395, bear the mintname Madīnat Sijilmāsah. There is no reason to believe that they are the products of a different mint from that simply named Sijilmāsah.</p>

               <p>There are only two dinars<ref target="#CH-pg47-n2">2</ref> of this mint (one of them with <name type="place">Madīnat</name>), one dated 384 and the other lacking the date but also struck under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name>.

This scant evidence of a mint at Sfax in <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> times scarcely justifies further speculation. It is possible that the complex exigencies of Maghribian politics in the latter 10th century brought part of <name type="place">Tunisia</name> temporarily under <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> sovereignty, but the connection could only have been nominal or fictitious<ref target="#CH-pg47-n4">4</ref>.</p>

               <p>Only one specimen of this mint<ref target="#CH-pg47-n5">5</ref> has come to my attention: a dirhem of the year 380, in the possession of <name type="pname">Mr. Philip Thorburn</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg47-n6">6</ref>. The place,

named after the leader of the first Muslim forces who crossed the straits and landed there in 91 A. H., and originally known as <name type="place">Jazīrah Ṭarīf</name>, is located at very nearly the southernmost point in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2267430">Iberian Peninsula</name>, not far from <name type="place">Algeciras</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg48-n1">1</ref>. Its location naturally caused it to be a place of prominence in maritime and commercial affairs, but aside from its frequent mention in the Arabic chronicles in connection with the history of the conquest, it receives scant notice in later <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> days. An interesting archaeological remain is the castle at <name type="place">Ṭarīfah</name> where the foundation inscription, dated in Ṣafar, 349 (April, 960 A. D.) is preserved<ref target="#CH-pg48-n2">2</ref>. It is believed that this fortress was built in anticipation of a possible <name type="pname">Fāṭimid</name> invasion across the straits<ref target="#CH-pg48-n3">3</ref>.</p>
               <p>There appears to be no ready explanation of this unique appearance of a mint at <name type="place">Ṭarīfah</name> in the year 380<ref target="#CH-pg48-n4">4</ref>. As suggested in the discussion of other exceptional issues of 381 A. H. (<name type="place">Madīnat al-Andalus</name>, <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>', and (below) <name type="place">Madīnat Qurṭubah</name>), there would appear to have been an attempt to decentralize the activities of the mint at about this time. Apparently the reform, if such is the explanation, did not continue long in effect. I can only hint at the possibility that there is some connection between these unusual issues and <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr Ibn abī-'Āmir's</name> military reforms which were put into effect about this date and which evidently provided for the dissolution of the fiefs and a distribution of the troops into corps made up of recruits from different areas and different racial or tribal groups<ref target="#CH-pg48-n5">5</ref>. It might also be suggested that <name type="place">Ṭarīfah</name> was a convenient location for a mint serving extreme <name type="place">north-west Africa</name> where at the time the great <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi> was very active.</p>

The existence of a mint there in the 3rd century of the Hijrah under the <name type="pname">Idrīsids</name> is attested by coins bearing the mint-name <name type="place">al-'Alīyah</name>, and there has recently been published a dinar of <name type="place">Fās</name> dated 348 A.

               <p>The preserved dates of <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> dirhems struck at <name type="place">Fās</name> are 367, 370, 371, 377 to 400 inclusive, and 403<ref target="#CH-pg49-n4">4</ref>. Of these the first is doubtful (see the note after no. 265 in the catalogue), but historically there appears to be no objection<ref target="#CH-pg49-n5">5</ref>. A <name type="pname">Fāṭimid</name> dirhem of <name type="place">Fās</name> of the year 369 is testimony to the success of the expedition of <name type="pname">Buluggīn b.

ed historical events<ref target="#CH-pg50-n1">1</ref>. A more detailed discussion of the political implications of this coinage will be found in the relevant places in the section on <hi rend="smallcaps">names</hi>. The final issue, of the year 403 and struck in <name type="pname">Hishām's</name> name, is of doubtful date, and speculation with regard to the political connotation, while historically supportable, would be fruitless.</p>
               <p>For the most part the craftsmanship in the <name type="place">Fās</name> mint ranks certainly with the worst in any part of the Muslim world at any time<ref target="#CH-pg50-n2">2</ref>. The fabric is poor, the epigraphy and ornamentation crude and almost barbaric. In consequence a very large proportion of specimens are virtually illegible and often the date is exceedingly doubtful. The relative rarity of coins of <name type="place">Fās</name> is probably more apparent than real: the numismatic "market" in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</name> has been restricted, <name type="place">Fās</name> itself has long been inimical to Europeans, and few collectors have cared to acquire or to attempt to read such miserable specimens as have come their way<ref target="#CH-pg50-n3">3</ref>.</p>

                  <name type="pname">Vives</name> suggested that the <name type="place">Fās</name> mint sometimes issued dirhems in the name of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>

here. The occurrence of the name is tantalizing in that it suggests a solution to an aspect of the "<name type="place">al-Andaus</name>" mint problem, but the unique example leaves me completely puzzled. Was it simply a new and short-lived atelier within the city, or was the "<name type="place">al-Andaus</name>" mint at this time no longer in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> proper?

               <p>The name (without Madīnat) reappears under the <name type="pname">Bani Jahwar</name> in 439–442, and (with Madīnat) under the <name type="pname">Dhū'l-Nūnids</name> in 467 and the '<name type="pname">Abbādids</name> in 461–480 A.

               <p>I have little hesitation in asserting that the piece in the Hispanic Society collection was <name type="pname">Codera's</name> (although there is no published illustration to make the identification positive), and that this is the same one cited by <name type="pname">Vives</name>

               <p>Only two specimens of this mint are known. One has an obscurely preserved date, perhaps 395, and on this piece the mint-name is not at all clear. It appears to be written المنصوة, and as this is unintelligible I have assumed the letter <hi rend="italic">ra</hi> to be omitted. In fact there is a very faint trace of what may be the tail of the <hi rend="italic">ra.</hi> The other specimen (no. 356) lacks the date, but is again an issue of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name>'s, and there appears to be no question about the spelling of the name. I have not succeeded in identifying the place. We may be certain that it is not the Fāṭimid capital at <name type="place">Qayrawān</name> (formerly <name type="place">Ṣabrah</name>), founded in 336 or 337 A. H. by the third Fāṭimid Caliph <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr</name>, known to some of the geographers as <name type="place">al-Manṣūrah</name> and well represented as <name type="place">al-Manṣūrīyah</name> on coins of that dynasty<ref target="#CH-pg51-n3">3</ref>. Nor can it be the <name type="place">al-Manṣūrah</name> a few miles west of <name type="place">Tlemcen</name>, founded by the <name type="pname">Marīnids</name> between 698 and 702 A. H.<ref target="#CH-pg51-n4">4</ref>. There is no trace of a <name type="place">Manṣūrah</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, nor
<pb n="52"/>
of a suitable one in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</name>, and I suspect that we have in these rare coins representatives of a temporary mint, established perhaps in a siege encampment preparatory to or following a victory<ref target="#CH-pg52-n1">1</ref>. With this in mind, and with all reserve, especially in view of the dubious date of no. 331, I can only suggest the possibility that the <name type="place">Manṣūrah</name> in question is the title given to an encampment of the <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi> '<name type="pname">Abd al-Malik</name> during his campaign of 395 (1005 A.

                  <ref target="#CH-pg52-n6">6</ref>, but we meet with no coins until the latter part of the 4th century of the Hijrah, the years I have recorded being 372, 387, 396 and 397. The first date is given only by <name type="pname">Codera</name> in his <hi rend="italic">Çecas</hi>, and is questioned. The 387 issue is represented by four specimens, one of <name type="pname">Codera's</name> and one of <name type="pname">Vives</name>' (the date questioned by <name type="pname">Vives</name>), and two in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3658666">Cuenca</name> hoard, apparently of certain date. There are several specimens of the year 396 and 397, including a doubtful one of the latter year in the Hispanic Society collection. Obviously more evidence is needed to reconstruct the numismatic history of <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> influence in the little principality. The princes appear usually to have been loyal to the Umayyads, but early in the year 387 <name type="place">Nākūr</name> must have been under the control of

               <p>Aside from the early 2nd century and late 3rd century (H.) coppers, there are several groups of issues which bear no mint-name: gold of 319–322, of 324–328 (or perhaps down to 330, cf. no. 218), and of <hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. 332–334; some dubious dateless gold fractions and dirhems of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name>'s (no. 351), including a dirhem with Qur'ān IX, 33, in both margins; and a doubtful dirhem of 385 (no. 307). Most of these belong to the transitional period of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>'s coinage and were issued simultaneously with similar coins carrying the name of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>. The omission of the mint-name in these series is surely not an inadvertence (as it probably was in the miscellaneous coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name>), and in the absence of any helpful clue I can only suggest that the mintless, and the "<name type="place">al-Andaus</name>" dinars of the period in question are the products of two separate workshops at <name type="place">Cordoba.</name>

            <p>The identification of most of the names of individuals on the coinage of the <name type="place">Umayyads of Spain</name> is far more difficult than on that of the '<name type="pname">Abbāsids</name> and tributary or successor dynasties in the East, chiefly because of the lack of the patronymic. There are a few entirely satisfactory identifications, but it will be observed that many of the names in the following list are identified only tentatively or not at all. Another inherent difficulty is our lack of understanding of the governmental function which the isolated names on the coinage are in each case supposed to represent; in some instances there is no doubt whatever about the office that the individual filled, but in others we do not know whether his name is represented as <hi rend="italic">ḥājib,</hi> mint-master, lesser mint official, assayer, or what<ref target="#CH-pg55-n1">1</ref>.

               <p>Dates 391–2 (and an imitation or forgery spuriously dated 388, no. 313 (aaa)). This name has been discussed by a number of writers, including <name type="pname">Fraehn</name>, <name type="pname">Karabacek</name>, <name type="pname">Stickel</name>, <name type="pname">Codera</name>, <name type="pname">Tiesenhauenn</name> and <name type="pname">Dozy</name>. The suggestions of <name type="pname">Karabacek</name> and <name type="pname">Stickel</name> were fanciful. <name type="pname">Fraehn</name> recognized the name, and <name type="pname">Dozy</name> later supported him and devoted a brief monograph to the subject<ref target="#CH-pg58-n5">5</ref>.

                  <name type="pname">Tamlīḥ</name>, is well documented. A certain <name type="pname">Muḥammad b.

                  <ref target="#CH-pg58-n8">8</ref> and <name type="pname">Ṣā'id al-Andalusi</name>; and his connection with the en-

largement of the mosque at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> was known to the latter. His death occurred in 361, so he cannot of course be the person whose name is on the coins of 391 and 392, but <name type="pname">Dozy</name> suggested that <name type="pname">Muḥammad b. Tamlīḥ</name> may well have been our man's father. There are other examples of the use of a patronymic alone on the coinage<ref target="#CH-pg59-n1">1</ref>.</p>
               <p>There is a problem with respect to the spelling, and hence the pronunciation, of the name. In the Kufic inscriptions there are of course no diacritical points, so one cannot say whether the final letter is <hi rend="italic">jīm, ḥā,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">khā.</hi>
                  <name type="pname">Codera</name> read <hi rend="italic">jīm.</hi>
                  <name type="pname">Dozy</name>, relying on the best of several manuscripts of <name type="pname">Ibn abī-Uṣaybī'ah</name>, read <hi rend="italic">ḥā</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg59-n2">2</ref>. <name type="pname">Lévi-Provençal</name>, however, basing his choice on the writing of the name in <name type="pname">Ibn al-Faraḍi</name> and <name type="pname">Ṣā'id</name>, transcribes <hi rend="italic">khā, i. e.</hi>, <name type="pname">Tamlīkh</name>. I have chosen to retain <name type="pname">Dozy's</name> spelling <name type="pname">Tamlīḥ</name> for two reasons. In the first place, in spite of <name type="pname">Lévi-Provençal</name>'s authoritative testimony, I am not in a position to verify the pointing on MSS of <name type="pname">Ibn al-Faraḍi</name> and <name type="pname">Ṣā'id</name>; and secondly, there are specimens of the coinage<ref target="#CH-pg59-n3">3</ref> which are clearly pointed (a most remarkable exception to the general rule), with two dots over the <hi rend="italic">tā</hi> and two under the <hi rend="italic">yā,</hi> a fact which <name type="pname">Codera</name> had observed (C., p. 95). The pellet which appears frequently after the name is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a diacritical point: it is larger, and in some cases there are two pellets instead of one. Furthermore, the stem ملح seems to be a more likely one than ملخ for the derivation of the name, if indeed it has an Arabic origin. If, on the other hand, the name is of foreign derivation, the orthography may not have been fixed and it could have been written either <name type="pname">Tamlīkh</name> or <name type="pname">Tamlīḥ</name>

               <p>As for the title itself, it was, in Arab <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, the supreme dignity of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> governmental hierarchy. In other parts of the Muslim world the office developed in different ways. Originally it signified simply the functionary who, by controlling the curtain separating the leader from the public, prevented or permitted the entry of petitioners; in other words, a chamberlain<ref target="#CH-pg61-n1">1</ref>. But in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> the <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi> became in time the head of the entire administration, immediately under the Caliph (over him, in the end), the senior vizier<ref target="#CH-pg61-n2">2</ref>, the prime minister in charge of the three principal divisions of government, <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., the court and royal monopolies, the chancellery, and the public finances; finally, also, the minister of war and the commander-in-chief<ref target="#CH-pg61-n3">3</ref>. The <hi rend="italic">ḥājib par excellence</hi> was the famous <name type="pname">Muḥammad b. abī-'Āmir, al-Manṣūr</name>. The prestige which he brought to the office carried over into the days of the <hi rend="italic">reyes de taifas</hi> with the result that independent princes were inclined to prefer the title of <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi> to any other, including that of <hi rend="italic">malik,</hi> "king"<ref target="#CH-pg61-n4">4</ref>.

                  <name type="pname">Muḥammad ibn abī-'Āmir</name>, the great <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi> of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> and eventual dictator of all <name type="place">Arab Spain</name>. Born in 327 and died in Ramaḍān, 392 (August, 1002 A. D.), his life and career are too well known to require general review here<ref target="#CH-pg67-n2">2</ref>. We must, however, concern ourselves with the connotations of his name on the coinage. For a long time writers on Arab-Spanish numismatics were in doubt as to the significance of the name "'<name type="pname">Āmir</name>" on the coins, and it was only during the course of <name type="pname">Codera's</name> studies that the latter became completely satisfied that "'<name type="pname">Āmir</name>" was <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg67-n3">3</ref>. It is to be admitted that the use of the simple name '<name type="pname">Āmir</name> for the patronymic <name type="pname">Ibn abī-'Āmir</name>, or for <name type="pname">Muḥammad's</name> own <hi rend="italic">kunyah</hi>
                  <name type="pname">Abū-'Āmir</name>, is curious; but the family name was one of much prestige,
<pb n="68"/>
and no doubt Muḥammad felt not only that it was distinctive but also that he would in the end bring to it even greater distinction<ref target="#CH-pg68-n1">1</ref>.</p>
               <p>The name first appears on the coins in 356, the very year in which <name type="pname">Ibn abī-'Āmir</name> received his appointment as master of the mint<ref target="#CH-pg68-n2">2</ref>. At the beginning of the year there are other names on the coins, those of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān</name> and <name type="pname">Shuhayd</name> (<hi rend="italic">q</hi>. <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.), but both of these disappear in the following year. The young official took full advantage of the power which his appointment gave him to "win friends and influence people," and we have a charming picture of him in an anecdote – probably basically authentic – relating to this early phase of his career. It is worth quoting in part, for we seldom meet with so intimate a picture of a mint-master, whose name is preserved on the coins, portrayed against the back-drop of the mint itself: <name type="pname">Muḥammad b. Aflaḥ</name>, a client of <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam's</name>, went to the mint to sell some silver ornaments which he possessed.</p>
               <q>"I had spent at my daughter's wedding more money than I could well afford, so that I was actually reduced to poverty, and had nothing left save a bit and bridle ornamented with silver, which I took to the mint, in order to obtain its value in money. Being introduced to <name type="pname">Muḥammad b. abi-'Āmir</name>, who was at that time master of the mint, and whom I found sitting behind piles of coined dirhems, I made known to him my errand, and told him how I had been reduced to poverty by my daughter's wedding. Having listened attentively to my account...... and having weighed bridle, iron, leather, and all, he gave me the weight in dirhems, with which he filled my cap. I could hardly believe my senses..... I need not add, that, upon counting down the money, I found there was enough to pay my daughter's dowry; which I did, and had besides a large sum left for my own private use."<ref target="#CH-pg68-n3">3</ref>

               <p>One wonders what sort of auditing system there was under <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr's</name> administration of the mint. Certainly one may assume that it was more efficient in later days when the master of the mint was his servant.</p>

ereignty, and it is as <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi> rather than as master of the mint that his name occurs on the bulk of the coins. Until 361 (and perhaps until 367) the name appears doubtless in the latter capacity, or as Treasurer. In the latter year he was elevated to the position of "Chief of the Middle <hi rend="italic">Shurṭah</hi>," and in the following year we note that, with one dubious exception, his name disappears from the coinage; but during that year only. Whatever the reason for this apparent break in the series of coins bearing his name, in the following year the name '<name type="pname">Āmir</name> is restored and continues, with only one possible interruption (the year 373, of which only two specimens, details lacking, are preserved) until <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr's</name> death in 392 A. H. From 13 Sha'bān, 367, onward there can be no doubt that his name figures on the coinage as <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg69-n1">1</ref>, for it was on that date that <name type="pname">al-Manṣūr's</name> predecessor <name type="pname">al-Muṣḥafi</name>, was deposed and arrested<ref target="#CH-pg69-n2">2</ref>.</p>
               <p>Between 393 and 398 the name 'Āmir continues to appear occasionally on coins of <name type="place">Fās</name>, <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> and <name type="place">Nākūr</name> (also at <name type="place">al-Manṣūrah</name> in 395 (?)).

                  <name type="pname">abī-'Āmir's</name> son and successor, '<name type="pname">Abd al-Malik</name>. Finally, in the year 399, there are a number of dirhems of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> with the name '<name type="pname">Āmir</name>, issued in the name of <name type="pname">Hishām</name>.

               <head>53. الامام الناصر لدين الله عبد الرحمن امير المؤمنين</head>
               <p>(<name type="pname">Al-Imām <name type="pname">al-Nāṣir</name> li-dīn Allāh '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān</name> Amīr al-Mu'minīn</name>).</p>
               <p>The full name and titles of the Caliph '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> as they appear most commonly on the coins from 316 to 350 A. H. There are variations as follows:</p>
               <p>316–319, 321–322, 324–328: امير المؤمنين عبد الرحمن (preceded by the preposition <hi rend="italic">li</hi>)</p>
               <p>319–320: عبد الرحمن امير المؤمنين</p>
               <p>318: الامام الناصر لدين الله امير المؤمنين عبد الرحمن</p>
               <p>The form of the protocol in inscriptions on stone and other media is usually: عبد الله عبد الرحمن امير المؤمنين<ref target="#CH-pg72-n1">1</ref>, but the following also occur: امير المؤمنين عبد الرحمن بن محمد, and عبد الله عبد الرحمن امير المؤمنين الناصر لدين الله <ref target="#CH-pg72-n2">2</ref>.</p>
               <p>These honorifics of course are symbolical of the most important development in the entire history of the <name type="place">Umayyads of Spain</name>, for with the adoption of the titles <hi rend="italic">imām</hi> and <hi rend="italic">amīr al-mu'minīn</hi>, together with the <hi rend="italic">laqab</hi> or epithet <hi rend="italic">al-nāṣir li-dīn Allāh</hi> (roughly "Defender of the Faith"), '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> arrogated to himself the style, dignity and prerogatives of the Caliphate. The event, its background and its consequences, have been much discussed and need not be entered into in detail here<ref target="#CH-pg72-n3">3</ref>. The date, Dhū'l-Ḥijjah, 316, is established by <name type="pname">Ibn 'Idhāri</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg72-n4">4</ref> and is supported conclusively by the coins. It was thus sixteen years after his accession as <name type="pname">Amīr</name> of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> principate of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> that '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān</name> felt himself strong enough to declare to his own people and to the world in general that he was the most powerful of Muslim rulers and the evident defender of the faith against

Christian foes without and Shī'ite enemies within the Dār al-Islām. The <name type="pname">'Abbāsid</name> Caliph in Baghdad, who since the collapse of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> kingdom of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> had been recognized as the leader of Islam, was now so feeble that he had become the puppet of his Turkish slaves, and across the deserts of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> there was reaching the arm of the Fāṭimid heresy. '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān's</name> pronounce­ment in effect restored the "true" faith and the "legitimate" Umay­yad political heritage, and initiated a renaissane of Islam in the far West. The reformed coinage, bearing the outward symbols of these claims and inherent power, is tangible testimony of the event.</p>

               <p>Dates: 212, 222, 320–321, 330, 332–346<ref target="#CH-pg76-n3">3</ref>, 360(?), 374(?), 385–392, 400–404. There is certainly no more difficult name to identify when bereft of a patronymic or family name. Quite obviously there are several different individuals represented. The name on the coins of 212 and 222, being placed obscurely between the lines in the area, would be that of one of those unidentifiable mint officials or die-engravers such as 'Ali and Yaḥyā. The Muḥammad of 320 and 321 is probably a different person from the one whose series begins in 330, for the name of Sa'īd (<hi rend="italic">q. v.</hi>) intervenes. Aside from integrating the evidence of the coinage with the numismatically unsupported testi­mony with regard to mint masters given by <name type="pname">Ibn 'Idhāri</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg76-n4">4</ref>, <name type="pname">Codera</name> did not attempt to identify these two Muḥammad's<ref target="#CH-pg76-n5">5</ref>, nor can I make any profitable suggestion, although there are of course innumerable possible personages to whom one could hypothetically assign the office. The single issue of 360 (no. 253 (hh)) must be considered doubt­ful, that of 374 (no. 275) is probably a counterfeit or imitation, and those of 385 and 386 are represented by unique specimens (nos. 305 (v) and 308 (ee)), possibly misreadings by Lavoix.</p>
               <p>Beginning with the year 387 we have a clear series running down to 391 (392 at Fās). <name type="pname">Codera</name> rightly argues that this Muḥammad cannot be Muḥammad b. abi-'Āmir, because the name 'Āmir is present on
<pb n="77"/>
these issues and he would not be mentioned twice<ref target="#CH-pg77-n1">1</ref>. One possibility, perhaps far-fetched, comes to mind. Might not this Muḥammad be the same Tamlīḥ whose name occurs on the coins of 391 and 392 and whose identity has been discussed in article no. 13 above? At some time during the year 391 the name Muḥammad disappears from the coins and is replaced by Tamlīḥ, and I suggest that Muḥammad took a leaf from the <hi rend="italic">ḥājib</hi> al-Manṣūr's book and began to call himself by his family name. He could not, of course, have been the Muḥammad b. Tamlīḥ who had a hand in the restoration of the mosque at Cor­doba (see the article referred to), but that Muḥammad may have had a son by the same name.</p>
               <p>In the year 400, under the Caliph <name type="pname">Muḥammad</name>, another Muḥammad is quite well represented. <name type="pname">Codera</name> suggested<ref target="#CH-pg77-n2">2</ref> that he and Ibn Maslamah (<hi rend="italic">q. v.</hi>) may have been the same person and that he is to be identified with Abū-'Āmir Muḥammad b. '<name type="pname">Abdullāh</name> b. Muḥammad b. Masla­mah, a vizier under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name>, but this is pure guesswork. The other rare occurrences of the name on odd and doubtful coins of 400–404 are equally elusive<ref target="#CH-pg77-n3">3</ref>.</p>

               <p>On a curious dirhem of "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>," 343 A.

A specimen of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> of the year 402 (no. 346 (p)) is probably to be rejected as a misattribution. The name also occurs as <name type="pname">Mu'izz</name> (390 (?) A. H.), <hi rend="italic">al-ḥājib</hi>

                  <name type="pname">Codera</name> and <name type="pname">Vives</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg80-n1">1</ref> attributed the first, anomalous, coin to <name type="place">Fās</name> in spite of the mint-name "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>," because of the name <name type="pname">al-Mu'izz</name>; my own view is that the coin is a counterfeit or imitation of later date. From 393 on, certainly, the individual in question is <name type="pname">al-Mu'izz</name>, son of <name type="pname">Zīri b. 'Aṭīyah al-Maghrāwi</name> to whom reference has been made in the discussion of <name type="place">Nākūr</name> and in article 33, above. As for the issue of 390, <name type="pname">Codera</name> expressed doubts over the date<ref target="#CH-pg80-n2">2</ref>, and in view of the fact that <name type="pname">Zīri b. 'Aṭīyah</name> did not die until 391<ref target="#CH-pg80-n3">3</ref>, and it was only in that year that <name type="pname">al-Mu'izz</name> succeeded to the leadership of the <name type="pname">Maghrāwa</name> and to his father's position as vassal to the <name type="pname">Umayyads</name>, I am inclined to doubt that the issue of 390 exists. The coins of 397 and 398, with the title <hi rend="italic">al-ḥājib,</hi> are interesting in that they may be taken to confirm the date, 396, given by <name type="pname">Ibn Khaldūn</name> for the letter from '<name type="pname">Abd al-Malik al-Muẓaffar</name> to <name type="pname">al-Mu'izz</name>, announcing in very formal terms the latter's appointment as virtual viceroy of the Maghrib<ref target="#CH-pg80-n4">4</ref>. Other dates for the event have been given<ref target="#CH-pg80-n5">5</ref>. Finally, the curious issues under <name type="pname">Sulaymān</name> of "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>" (probably Fās) of 402, and of <name type="place">Fās</name> (?) with date lacking,

               <p>This legend is alleged to occur on a single dinar of <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name>, possibly dated 395 A. H. (no. 329). There are, furthermore, several dinars of the same mint, issued under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name>, and supposedly bearing such names as "<name type="pname">Ouazir</name>" and "<name type="pname">Ben el Ouazir</name>" (see the note after no. 353 in the catalogue). In discussing the mint of <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name>
                  <ref target="#CH-pg84-n2">2</ref>, I have suggested the possibility that وازير may be a misreading for <name type="pname">Wānūdīn</name>, the son of <name type="pname">Khazrūn b. Falfūl. Wānūdīn</name>, we know from <name type="pname">Ibn Khaldūn's</name> account, was entrusted with the government of <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> on behalf of the <name type="pname">Umayyads</name> in 390 A. H.; we are also told that in 396 <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> was specifically omitted from <name type="pname">al-Mu'izz b. Zīri's</name> province because <name type="pname">Wānūdīn</name> was still charged with that city; and finally that he declared himself independent at <name type="place">Sijilmāsah</name> upon the break-up of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate<ref target="#CH-pg84-n3">3</ref>. Admittedly <name type="pname">Wānūdīn</name> (وانودين) does not look very much like وازير, but until I have seen a specimen myself (none is illustrated), or until some reader who has seen one categorically denies the possibility, the suggestion may be allowed to stand.</p>

This <name type="pname">Yaḥyā</name> is well identified; see the following article (no. 105).

               <hi rend="bold">METROLOGY</hi>
            </head>
            <p>In view of the conflicting and often unintelligible statements of the Arab writers<ref target="#CH-pg87-n1">1</ref>, the only really reliable information with respect to Spanish-Umayadd metrology is to be derived from the coins them­selves. The tables of issues and weights at the end of this volume provide the figures on which the following summary is based<ref target="#CH-pg87-n2">2</ref>. While the bulk of the data has been arrived at by weighing all the speci­mens in the Hispanic Society and American Numismatic Society collections, all other reliable published weights (such as those in the British Museum, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_berlin">Berlin</name> catalogues) have been averaged in. With due allowance for loss of weight resulting from wear, clipping, mutilation, etc., these figures probably give quite a fair representation of the average weights of dinars and dirhems in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> from the be­ginning of the 8th to the beginning of the 11th Christian centuries.</p>
            <p>There are four denominations of gold: full dinars, and one-half, one-third and one-quarter dinars. In the earliest years the one-quarter dinar appears not to have existed, but there are dinars of the years 98, 102, 103,104 and 106, and one-half and one-third dinars (actually so named, <hi rend="italic">nisf</hi> and <hi rend="italic">thulth,</hi> in the mint-date formula)<ref target="#CH-pg87-n3">3</ref> of the year 102. At the outset the weight of the dinar conforms quite closely with the standard in the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> East, that is, 4.25 grams, a weight derived from that of the Byzantine solidus, from which the dinar evolved<ref target="#CH-pg87-n4">4</ref>. Actualy, most
<pb n="88"/>
of the few specimens preserved from this early period are heavier than the general run of those in the East, the average weighing about 4.28 grams; and one dinar is as heavy as 4.34 grams <ref target="#CH-pg88-n1">1</ref>. During the next two hundred years no gold was struck in Spain. I have met with no attempt­ed explanation of this remarkable phenomenon, and as the matter is of some interest a brief digression will not be out of place.</p>
            <p>During the period in question dinars were struck widely and in great quantities in <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> and the East, not only by the <name type="pname">Umayyads</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> until their downfall but by the '<name type="pname">Abbāsids</name>, <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnids</name>, <name type="pname">Aghlabids</name> and other secondary dynasts in the <name type="pname">'Abbāsid</name> dominion, not to mention the later <name type="place">Fāṭimids</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>
               <ref target="#CH-pg88-n2">2</ref>. Why did the coining of gold cease in <name type="place">Arab Spain</name>? We must remember that the question is primarily one of the disappearance of <hi rend="italic">minted</hi> currency, for, as we know from the Arab literature, gold in theory and probably in the form of bullion, continued throughout this period to be the fundamental metal in which value was calculated and large commercial affairs were transacted. Was there an actual shortage of gold? If so, was it because the Arab and Berber conquerors were unable, or did not make the effort, to exploit the <name type="place">Iberian</name> deposits which had already been neglected under the later <name type="place">Visigoths</name>? If this were the explanation, or part of it, we would have to assume that the early Spanish dinars were minted from imported gold, except perhaps for those very impure pieces which are quite common among the Latin types. Or did the cessation of gold-minting come about primarily because the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> emirs, unlike many eastern princes, did not presume, for juridicial and theological reasons, to arrogate to themselves the prerogatives of gold coinage?<ref target="#CH-pg88-n3">3</ref> The absence of gold between 106 and 132 A. H., at least, may be the result of a decision of the supreme authority in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>. Subsequently, while entirely independent in fact of the <name type="pname">'Abbāsid</name> dominion, the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> emirs of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> continued to recognize the <hi rend="italic">caliphal</hi> authority of the '<name type="pname">Abbāsids</name> (a psychological, rather than a substantial or political, allegiance)<ref target="#CH-pg88-n4">4</ref>.</p>

               <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> such that there was no need of minted gold? Or should we seek for some relationship between the complete withdrawal of coined gold from circulation in Muslim <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> and the universal dearth of indigenous minted gold in the Christian West during later <name type="pname">Merovingian</name> and in <name type="pname">Carolingian</name> times? This latter condition was due to a number of causes, including an unfavorable balance of trade with the East, hoarding motivated by insecurity, and the ecclesiastical freezing of gold in churches and monasteries<ref target="#CH-pg89-n1">1</ref>. These considerations are possible lines of inquiry, along which the proper explanation may lie. The subject is one deserving of special research by a competent student in the field of economc and commercial history.</p>
            <p>The resumption of gold minting under '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> is more easily explained than its discontinuation in the days of the governors two centuries before. The revival of the coinage, both silver and gold, in 316 A. H., after a generation of anarchy, is intimately associated, as I have pointed out elsewhere, with the political accomplishments and aspirations of the great Caliph. It is entirely in keeping with the nature of the circumstances that simultaneously with his assumption of the titles and dignities of the Caliphate he should revive the sov­ereign prerogative of gold minting. Dinars were being struck by his avowed rivals in the East, the '<name type="pname">Abbāsids</name> and the <name type="place">Shī'ite Fāṭimids</name>
               <ref target="#CH-pg89-n2">2</ref>, and it is to be expected that as the new defender of the true faith he would issue gold. Furthermore the task of internal pacification and consolidation of power which consumed the first years of his reign was now accomplished and '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān</name> was then about to devote himself to a great program of building and public works within, and of military expansion and commercial activity beyond, the bor­ders of the kingdom of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>. Political theory and the new economy called for gold in circulation, and the mint produced it from reserves that must have been in being and which the ruler's military successes must have augmented.</p>

            <p>When the dinars and fractions of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> make their appearane, although there appears to be a slight falling-off in weight, the same standard as that which had been established two hundred years before and which by and large had prevailed in other Muslim lands during the interval, was doubtless still in effect. I have the weights of only a few dinars dating between 317 and 350 A. H., but the more common thirds and quarters work out at a figure indicating an average of around 4.10 to 4.20 grams for the dinar<ref target="#CH-pg90-n1">1</ref>. Thereafter, during the rules of <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam II</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> and the latter's successors, the average weights are less constant, ranging between 3.79 and 4.42 grams, with individual dinars weighing as little as 3.43 and as much as 4.71 grams. Obviously in this later period, as so commonly elsewhere and in other times, gold payments in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> were made by weight and not by number. There are in fact numerous references in the literature to purchases or payments <hi rend="italic">bi'l-wāzanah</hi>, that is, "by weight"<ref target="#CH-pg90-n2">2</ref>.</p>
            <p>As with the gold, the earliest silver of the dependent emirate, dating between 104 and 131 A. H., approximates the weight of <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> dirhems in the East<ref target="#CH-pg90-n3">3</ref>. The data are limited, as I have weights for only 13 dirhems of this period, but the few figures available show 2.96 grams as the maximum and 2.58 as the minimum, the average being 2.81 grams. Thereafter, until the end of the 3rd century, there is a diminution in dirhem weights; but with '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> individual weights and the averages increase, and under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> and his successors the average at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> and <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>' rises to 3.11, and at <name type="place">Fās</name> to 3.13, grams.

            <p>Throughout the 3rd and 4th centuries there are striking deviations from the theoretical norm or the average, some specimens even though unclipped weighing less than two grams, many exceeding three, and some weighing over four grams. The heaviest dirhem I have recorded (a specimen of the year 389 A. H.) weighs 5.34 grams. One must conclude that after the mid-second century of the Hijrah the weight of the dirhem ceased to have any economic or metrological significance, and that all important commercial transactions were executed by weight. Clipping was a common practice, as elsewhere in the Middle Ages. In the catalogue I have noted, down to about the year 234 A. H., each clipped coin, and have omitted them from the calculation of averages, but thereafter so many specimens are either clipped or else originally struck on flans too small for the die, that except where they are very markedly reduced in size, I have omitted mention of clipping and have included all weighed specimens in the averaging.</p>
            <p>I have made no independent study of the fineness of the gold and silver. The statements of Arab writers cast little light on the question, although occasional passing remarks give some indication of the relationship between pure and coined gold. For example, in the year 327 A. H., 400 pounds of virgin gold <hi rend="italic">(dhahab al-tibr)</hi> were worth 45,000 dinars<ref target="#CH-pg91-n1">1</ref>.

            <p>I imagine that the cited fineness of the dirhem of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> is not typical and is much lower than the average (although the debasement in his earlier years is noticeable), but the figures for his successors are, to judge by appearanes, probably representative.</p>
            <p>Mediaeval Arab writers have furnished a quantity of confusing and contradictory testimony with regard to the relationship of the dirhem to the dinar<ref target="#CH-pg92-n1">1</ref>, but in general it may be accepted that, as in other parts of the Islamic world, the traditional weight relation of 1 dirhem = 7/10 dinar (or mithqāl) applied<ref target="#CH-pg92-n2">2</ref>. As for the value of the dinar in terms of dirhems, this was a widely variable relationship: the scattered notices that have come to my attention, for the most part assembled by <name type="pname">Sauvaire</name> in his <hi rend="italic">Matériaux</hi>, scarcely give us a systematic conception of the changing market prices of gold and silver throughout the years. Ten to one is a proportion frequently named in other parts of the Muslim world; <name type="pname">Ibn 'Idhāri</name>, writing of the year 303 (915/6 A. D.), mentions the price of wheat during a famine in terms of 3 dinars or 40 dirhems (about 13 to 1)<ref target="#CH-pg92-n3">3</ref>; Ibn Ḥawqal (middle 10th century) reported an equivalence of 200,000 dinars = 3, 400,000 dirhems (17 to 1)<ref target="#CH-pg92-n4">4</ref>.</p>
            <pb n="93"/>
            <p>Some idea of the purchasing power of the dinar is furnished by occasional bits of information in the literature: for example, '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān I</name> paid 80,000 dinars for the construction of the mosque at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>
               <ref target="#CH-pg93-n1">1</ref>; '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> spent three dinars for each block of marble, and eight dinars for each column, transported from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</name> for the building of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>'<ref target="#CH-pg93-n2">2</ref>; and the same prince expended five <hi rend="italic">amdā'</hi> and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">akyāl</hi> of dirhems for the construction of the minaret of the mosque at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>; and 25 <hi rend="italic">amdā',</hi> 6 <hi rend="italic">aqfizah</hi> and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">akyāl</hi> of dirhems in the building of the palaces of <name type="place">al-Zahrā</name>'<ref target="#CH-pg93-n3">3</ref>. But the meanings of the qualifying phrases and measures that usually accompany these figures (as in the passage last cited) are usually confusing and obscure, so that we achieve only a very hazy idea of the true value of the currency.</p>
            <p>The size of the early dinars is the same as that of the Eastern <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> dinar, about 19 or 20 mm.; and the halves and quarters are about 16 and 14 mm. respectively. The fourth century dinars are generally a little larger, some measuring as much as 24 mm., while the quarters of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> range between 12 and 14 mm. The silver varies considerably in size. In the period of the dependent <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> emirate the diameter of the dirhem is about 26 mm., but it increases under '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān I</name> to 28 mm., thereafter decreasing to about 24 mm. in the early part of the reign of Muḥammad I. About 250 A. H., when several new styles of dirhems make their appearance, a very large flan begins to be used, some specimens measuring no less than 32 mm. '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III's</name> early dirhems are approximately 26 mm., but later in his reign the diameter is reduced to about 24 mm., which approximate size continues, with few exceptions, until the collapse of the dynasty.</p>
            <p>As for the sources of metal for the coinage, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> was rich in deposits of gold, silver and copper that had been worked since the earliest historical times.

<pb n="94"/>
Arab times. Unfortunately we are lacking specific information about the exploitation and administration of the mines by the Arabs, but the geographers make frequent mention of the location of deposits, particularly of gold and silver<ref target="#CH-pg94-n1">1</ref>. <name type="pname">Maqqari</name> tells us that gold was extracted in large quantities from the sands of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2518917">Darro</name>, the <name type="place">Tagus</name> near <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2267057">Lisbon</name>, and the <name type="place">Lerida</name>; and that the richest gold mine in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, according to <name type="pname">Ibn Sa'īd</name>, was near <name type="place">Santiago</name>
               <ref target="#CH-pg94-n2">2</ref>. The Segre was another river from which placer gold was obtained<ref target="#CH-pg94-n3">3</ref>. Silver was mined in the regions of <name type="place">Murcia</name>, <name type="place">Alhama</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>, near <name type="place">Hornachuelos</name>, and at <name type="place">Totalica</name> in the district of <name type="place">Beja</name>
               <ref target="#CH-pg94-n4">4</ref>.</p>
            <p>One other matter which may have some bearing on the metrology of the coinage must be discussed. Beginning with the reign of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> it will be observed that a very considerable number of the dirhems (not the dinars) in the collections to which I have had access (and in others where the fact is noted) are pierced, and that the piercing in the great majority of cases is double. Previous to '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name>, in the 3rd century, one occasionally sees a dirhem with a single piercing, and I have noted one coin dated 198 A.H. with a double piercing; but these are only scattered instances, and I imagine that these piercings are modern. In the 4th century, however, the practice becomes so common and the incidence of double piercing (although sometimes there are three or even four holes) so regular, that the observer cannot fail to suspect some significance. The holes are usually, but not always, toward the edge of the flan, and are irregularly spaced but most frequently about a half-inch apart; in some cases they are on opposite edges of the flan. Almost always the hole is jagged and irregular as though made with a nail or some similar not very sharp instrument, but sometimes the piercing appears more like a slit caused by a knife blade. One thing is clear, that the intention was not to remove metal from the coin either to standardize its weight (which is out of the question anyway in view of the extreme irregularity of the weights) or to amass bits of silver for melting down and sale, for in most instances no metal has been taken away. Around the edges of the hole the metal usually protrudes on the opposite face of the coin from the one on which it was struck; sometimes the protruding edges have been hammered down flat, and on some specimens the piercing has virtually been closed up again either by beating back the pressed-out metal or by filling with a plug.</p>

            <p>What was the purpose of these holes? I confess that I have discovered no satisfactory explanation. The first thought that comes to mind is that the coins were pierced in post-Arab, perhaps relatively modern, times, so that they might be fitted to a necklace as ornaments. But there are two objections to this view. In the first place, it is a reasonable assumption (though the proof is lacking) that most of the dirhems in the Hispanic Society collection came from hoards and were not acquired from individuals – villagers and peasants – who wore them, or whose antecedents wore them, as ornaments. This assumption, furthermore, is borne out by a statement of <name type="pname">Codera's</name>. Writing of the <name type="place">Alhama</name> hoard<ref target="#CH-pg95-n1">1</ref>, he tells us that in practically all 4th century dirhem hoards many of the specimens predating the time of burial are pierced in the manner described. In the <name type="place">Alhama</name> hoard (2nd and 3rd century dates) there were none; and <name type="pname">Codera</name> noted that in the collections with which he was familiar, dirhems of dates previous to the rule of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> are not so pierced – an observation which confirms my own. His wide first-hand acquaintance with hoards establishes the fact that the piercing is not modern. <name type="pname">Codera's</name> conclusion was that dirhems predating the hoard burial date were pierced (in the 4th century) so that they might be threaded as ornaments, the implication being that the issues of previous rules were not valid currency. We lack, so far as I know, any corroboration of this implication, but even if the possibility be admitted, the necessity remains of explaining the purpose of the double piercing. Why should there be two holes (or three, or four) instead of one?</p>
            <p>The same objection – that one hole would suffice – would be pertinent to two other suggestion: (a) that non-current dirhems were officially invalidated by piercing them, or (b) that money-changers pierced the coins to test the quality of the metal. And neither of these suggestions is satisfactory for other obvious reasons. For example, if dirhems were invalidated, why would they not be taken by their owners to the mint or a silversmith and sold as bullion? In short, it is apparent that I am able only to raise objections to possible explanations and that the solution must await some more ingenious mind<ref target="#CH-pg95-n2">2</ref>.</p>

               <p>One piece, not belonging to the period of multiple piercing in question, deserves special passing notice. A dirhem of the year 231 (HSA 14334, no. 123(a)) has been pierced and refilled with a fragment of another coin. See the description in the catalogue.

               <hi rend="bold">MINTING TECHNIQUE</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The Arab writers tell us virtually nothing about the operation of the mint and the technique of coining. <name type="pname">Ibn Khaldūn</name> describes in a few words the fundamental minting process in his time, the engraving of dies with the titles of the sovereign attesting the validity of the coin, and the striking of the dies with a hammer against pieces of gold or silver of the requisite weight<ref target="#CH-pg96-n1">1</ref>; and <name type="pname">Ibn 'Idhāri</name> has reported one or two facts about the mint <hi rend="italic">(dār al-sikkah)</hi> at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name> which I have noted elsewhere<ref target="#CH-pg96-n2">2</ref>. The geographer <name type="pname">Ibn al-Faqīh</name> (late 3rd century of the Hijrah) states that the mint was in his day located near the <name type="place">Bāb al-'Aṭṭārīn</name>
               <ref target="#CH-pg96-n3">3</ref>, which, according to <name type="pname">Ibn Bashkuwāl</name>, was the seventh gate of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3860259">Cordoba</name>, also known as the Gate of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510911">Seville</name>
               <ref target="#CH-pg96-n4">4</ref>. The <hi rend="italic">dār al-sikkah</hi> was directed by the <hi rend="italic">ṣāḥib al-sikkah<ref target="#CH-pg96-n5">5</ref>,</hi> a high functionary of state, whose name is sometimes recorded in the chronicles, as I have noted in various places in dealing with the names on the coinage. <name type="pname">Al-Manṣūr Muḥammad b. abī-'Āmir</name> was the most famous <hi rend="italic">ṣāḥib al-sikkah;</hi> the beginning of his great career was in that office<ref target="#CH-pg96-n6">6</ref>. Previous to the governmental regularization of the mint which took place in the time of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān II</name> (and perhaps in part thereafter), there is reason to believe that minting privileges were farmed out<ref target="#CH-pg96-n7">7</ref>. But aside from these scraps of information about the mint and occasional dubious statistics on output, we are left in the dark as to operation, procedure and technique. The following observations are based entirely on the internal evidence of the coins themselves.</p>
            <pb n="97"/>
            <p>All Spanish <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> coins are struck with dies; I have seen no cast coins<ref target="#CH-pg97-n1">1</ref>. Examinaiion of nearly twenty-five hundred specimens reveals no systematic relationship between the position of obverse and reverse; in other words, fixed dies were not in use. Muling is indiscriminate; there are many cases of the interchange of dies, that is of the employment of several reverse dies with the same obverse, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>
               <ref target="#CH-pg97-n2">2</ref>. But obverse and reverse dies were always carefully paired, for I have seen no flan bearing two obverses or two reverses; although I know of one case where the die-engraver (not the coin-striker) became confused and inscribed an obverse margin on the reverse die (no. 297 (y)), and another where he used the Qur'ānic verse IX, 33, on both obverse and reverse (no. 351(d)). The number of dies must have been enormous, as I have pointed out elsewhere, and although the indications are that out-put was very large, it would appear that the life of a die, particularly that of the obverse (presumably the trussell) was short.</p>
            <p>Careful study of the execution of the inscriptions convinces me that from the outset punches were used in constructing the die. Most of these punches are simple horizontal and vertical strokes, curves, circles, etc.<ref target="#CH-pg97-n3">3</ref>, which were combined to make various letters of the alphabet, others contain whole letters, and still others carried groups of letters forming words or even groups of words. Examples which betray the use of punches of this latter type are: HSA 14330 (no. 122(e)), where a single punch ومائتين was imprinted at an angle at the end of the marginal legend, the و falling on top of the end of the decade; and an ANS dirhem of 262 A. H. (no. 155(a)), where the first two quarters of the marginal legend are rectilinear and end with a punch bearing the letters الد, the rest of the word (هم) having been omitted. There are in addition a great many instances of overlapping or over-extending rectilinear marginal segments which appear to me to be un-
<pb n="98"/>   
mistakable evidence of the use of long punches for conventional parts of the mint-date formula, especially for the words between <hi rend="italic">bi'sm</hi> and the name of the mint<ref target="#CH-pg98-n1">1</ref>.</p>
            <p>Mention of this matter of rectilinear marginal segments brings us to a consideration of the important question of <name type="pname">Vives'</name> so-called <hi rend="italic">acuñaciones</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">agrupaciones</hi>) which, in his opinion, were possibly the products of different mints represented by the one name, "<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>"<ref target="#CH-pg98-n2">2</ref>. <name type="pname">Vives'</name> differentiation of styles in the 2nd and 3rd centuries is well conceived, but I am convinced that these different <hi rend="italic">acuñaciones</hi> are not necessarily the products of different mints. The following are his classes:</p>
            <p>(1): The only mint from 148–229 A. H.; and the last date is 263. Characteristics: the first words of the margin rectilinear, and the whole legend more polygonal than circular; the word "200" written مئتين.</p>
            <p>(2): 229–263 A. H. Characteristics: perfectly circular margin, and the word "200" written مائتين.</p>
            <p>(3): 250–279 A. H. Characteristics: the first words of the margin rectilinear, and the rest perfectly circular; the word "200" written مائتين; larger flans and more elegant style<ref target="#CH-pg98-n3">3</ref>.</p>
            <p>(4): 250–269 A. H. Characteristics: circular margin; the word "200" written مائتين; larger flans and more elegant, like (3).</p>
            <p>"Acuñación varia:" All specimens which do not conform to the above.</p>
            <p>I have not been able to arrange all the coins of the 2nd and 3rd centuries according to <name type="pname">Vives'</name> groupings, and have therefore found it necessary to distinguish the following "styles" (<name type="pname">Vives'</name> equivalents being indicated in parentheses):</p>
            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">Style A</hi> (V. 1): 146–230, 236–240 A. H. Characteristics: 1st, 2nd and sometimes 3rd quarters of margin rectilinear; from about 200 A. H. on, mostly 1st and 2nd quarters rectilinear; the borders are mostly triple-beaded, but sometimes double-beaded, single-beaded or double-linear; the only style with "200" written مئتين.</q>
            <pb n="99"/>
            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">Style B</hi> (V. 2): 229–237, 240–252, 261 (263?) A. H. Characteristics: circular margin; neat, careful epigraphy; inner linear border regularly at first, and later occasionally; usually double-beaded outer border.</q>
            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">Style C</hi> (V. 3): 250–258, (263), 269–270, 276, 278, (279) A. H. Characteristics: 1st quarter of margin rectilinear, rest circular; larger flans; mostly good, legible epigraphy; triple-linear border with annulets between outer and 2nd borders.</q>
            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">Style D:</hi> 250 A. H. Characteristics: like C, but 1st and 2nd quarters of margin rectilinear, rest circular; triple-linear border.</q>
            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">Style E</hi> (V. 4): 250, 259 A. H. Characteristics: like B, with circular margin, but larger flan; triple-linear border with annulets between outer and 2nd borders.</q>
            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">Style F:</hi> 252–258, 260–262 A. H. Characteristics: 1st quarter of margin rectilinear, rest circular; large, clear 2nd century epigraphy; fine, legible reverse; large flan; triple-beaded border.</q>
            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">Style G:</hi> 261–262, 264–266, 271–275 A. H. Characteristics: like F, but triple-linear border.</q>
            <q>
               <hi rend="italic">Style H:</hi> 267–268 A. H. Characteristics: circular margin; improved style; triple linear border.</q>
            <p>Even this break-down of styles fails to embrace the entire range of differences, for as the reader will observe in the corpus it has been necessary to list some specimens as "variants," and furthermore, additional sub-headings are required in order to take care of specimens categorized by <name type="pname">Vives</name> according to his system which I have not seen<ref target="#CH-pg99-n1">1</ref>. The net result of the analysis is disappointing in one sense in that it fails to provide clear-cut criteria upon which an orderly hypothesis of mint differentiation might be based. There can be no doubt, however, that in 229 A. H., and about 250 A. H.<ref target="#CH-pg99-n2">2</ref>, quite strikingly new styles were introduced, and that these new styles affect the old and each other to a greater or lesser degree<ref target="#CH-pg99-n3">3</ref>. In some instances the new styles deteriorate, and in others they improve. While the new styles <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be the product of new mints or ateliers, it can equally well be argued that they are simply the work of new die-engravers. This
<pb n="100"/>
latter is my view: that is, the existence of several mints named "al-Andalus" in the 2nd and 3rd centuries is not improbable (in fact it is quite likely), but it is certainly not established by the evidence of the "styles" differentiated above. Let us consider one or two specific points.</p>
            <p>In the first place there are instances of different styles on the obverse and reverse of the same coin: <hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., dies of two styles were present in the same shop<ref target="#CH-pg100-n1">1</ref>. Secondly, to judge by the coins preserved, intermediate years in the series of certain styles are unrepresented. It would seem to me more likely that a certain engraver, or certain tools, were inactive in those years, than that an entire mint was closed down<ref target="#CH-pg100-n2">2</ref>.</p>
            <p>Finally, the circular or rectilinear character of the obverse margin, which is <name type="pname">Vives'</name> principal criterion, in my opinion proves nothing. An examination of dirhems dating before the fall of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> demonstrates that circular, rectilinear, and partly rectilinear margins were common to the same mints. In other words, the manner of engraving the margin was a matter of the choice of technique by the individual die-engraver. The margins of most of the dirhems of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> in this period that I have seen are almost square; yet of the year 116 I have seen one that is almost square and another circular. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> always has circular margins, but most other mints have two, three or even four styles of margins. For example, <name type="place">Wāsiṭ</name> has circular margins and margins with the first quarter rectilinear, the first and second quarters rectilinear, the first, second and third quarters rectilinear, and all four quarters rectilinear. So has Iṣṭakhr. Examples can be multiplied, but needlessly. Furthermore the rectilinear first quarter margin is revived in the 4th century in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>
               <hi rend="italic">(ca.</hi> 357, perhaps before), after a period of disuse, and is used indiscriminately thereafter, along with the circular margin, as noted in the catalogue, both types occurring in the same years at the one mint of <name type="place">Madīnat al-Zahrā</name>'. Also, incidentally, the use of rectilinear margins carries over from <name type="place">al-Zahrā</name>' to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name> in the resumption of activity by the latter mint in 365 A. H.</p>
            <p>It would appear, therefore, that the die-engraver was at liberty to use a several letter rectilinear punch, or punches, for the beginning of his marginal legend, or to engrave the whole margin with individual punches. In the 4th century one observes an interesting relationship
<pb n="101"/>
between the shape of the margin and the ornamentation, or lack of it, at the top of the obverse area. When the margin is entirely circular there is room for an elaborate ornament above the first line of the area; but when the first quarter of the margin is rectilinear and does not in this segment follow the periphery of the flan, thus reducing the area enclosed by the marginal legend, there is room only for a simple ornament or symbol, or sometimes no room for an ornament at all. In other words, the shape of the margin dictated the type, or even the presence or absence, of area ornamentation. Among many examples illustrating this factor in designing technique are the excellent ones of the years 392 and 393 A. H. Another related aspect of the same question is the treatment of the <hi rend="italic">rā</hi> of the phrase <hi rend="italic">lā-sharīka lahu:</hi> when it is floral, there is no ornament beneath the obverse area, simply because the floral flourish fills the available space. Both of these observations have a bearing on the question of the meaning of the ornaments; for they certainly appear to lend support to the view that in the 4th century at least, the ornaments have no technical or administrative significance<ref target="#CH-pg101-n1">1</ref>.</p>
            <p>One or two other observations about the internal evidence of the coins with reference to technique and administration. Frequently in the 3rd century, and very commonly in the 4th, the die-engravers failed to estimate correctly the amount of space required for the mint-date formula, with the result that the date is more frequently incomplete than not. They were systematic, however, in beginning the marginal legend at the upper right; I have noted only three exceptions, two of the year 351 (nos. 243 (j) and (q)), beginning at the bottom, and one of the year 400 (no. 343(f)), beginning at the lower right. The variant distribution of the usual three-line reverse area legends into four or more lines under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> and his successors appears to have been dictated merely by the whim of the engraver, and is not evidence of a different mint: <hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., nos. 316 (vv) and (ggg), with reverse lines differently distributed, have obverses struck from the same die. Finally there is excellent evidence that at certain times at least, not only mint officials, but the technical functioning of the mint, were not affected by even the most violent of political changes. The obverse die of no. 342 (j) (<name type="pname">Muḥammad II</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>, 400 A. H.) and of no. 342 (qq) (<name type="pname">Sulaymān</name>, same mint and date) is identical, the die quite naturally being in a more worn state when the latter dirhem was struck.</p>

The"fuzziness" of many dirhem dies, especially in the late 4th century of the Hijrah, suggests this likelihood, but I have not been able to make the necessary meticulous study to establish the point.</p>

            <p>The epigraphy of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> coinage in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> is essentially conservative. Considering the long period with which we are dealing and the development of the Kufic alphabet in other media during these centuries, it is remarkable that numismatic epigraphy undergoes so relatively few changes. The alphabet in use on the early 2nd (8th) century coins differs in no way from that of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> coins in the East; the Kufic is simple and unadorned. Unfortunately the perfection of the engraving, so characteristic of the dirhems and dinars down to the fall of the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> Caliphate of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> in 132 A. H., does not persist in the ensuing years in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, and by the late 2nd century of the Hijrah a deterioration in legibility sets in, which with only occasional exceptions continues throughout the history of the coinage, and which at times reaches the absolute nadir of Arabic numismatic epigraphy. Indeed, by and large, the inscriptions on the dirhems of the <name type="place">Umayyads of Spain</name> are the most difficult to read of all Islamic coins legends, and if it were not for their very largely conventional nature and the limited number of mint and personal names, correct attribution of many coins would be exceedingly difficult. In view of the prevailing miserable standard of legibility, the occasional examples of beautiful engraving and perfect legibility are the more remarkable.</p>
            <p>The following table illustrates the principal forms of the letters throughout the coinage:</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-3">
               <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_110.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <pb n="103"/>
            <p>Before the middle of the 3rd century the die-engravers began to exhibit their individuality by adding floral flourishes to the terminations of certain letters, especially to the <hi rend="italic">sīn</hi> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_al-andalus">Al-Andalus</name>, and the final letters of the digits and decades in the date, thus<ref target="#CH-pg103-n1">1</ref>:</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-4">
               <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_111a.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Shortly after 250 A. H. the <hi rend="italic">lām-alifs</hi> of the obverse area are sometimes furnished with crockets <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_111b.jpg"/>, but aside from these occasional flourishes and elaborations there is no fundamental or general change in the alphabet. Even in the first half of the 4th century the essential character of the Kufic remains the same, although the number of individual letters which receive flourishes increases: for example, the <hi rend="italic">rā</hi> of <hi rend="italic">lāsharīka lahu</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">rā</hi> of <hi rend="italic">'Āmir,</hi> the final <hi rend="italic">nūn</hi> of <hi rend="italic">almu'minīn</hi> frequently, and certain <hi rend="italic">dāls</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kāfs</hi> occasionally, are floral or flourished. Also there are isolated examples of distinctive ornamental styles which demonstrate the fact that die-engravers were aware of the decorative use of the alphabet in other media and were at liberty to develop their own style. A good exampe is HSA 14621 (no. 231(b) of 341 A. H. (plate V)), the reverse of which (but not the obverse) displays a highly developed ornamental form of Kufic with crocketed letters.</p>
            <p>A gradual evolution takes place in the second half of the 4th century which changes the style of the lettering somewhat but very seldom alters the elementary shapes. Most of the letters are thicker, the writing as a whole is more crowded, and some characters have distinctive shapes: for example, initial <hi rend="italic">bā</hi>, <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_111c.jpg"/>; <hi rend="italic">kāf</hi>, <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_111d.jpg"/>; final <hi rend="italic">nūn</hi>, <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_111e.jpg"/>; <hi rend="italic">hā</hi>, <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_111f.jpg"/>; and <hi rend="italic">lām-alif</hi>
               <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_111g.jpg"/>.</p>
            <p>Pointed letters are relatively rare, and the significance of the pointing, if any, in most cases escapes me. One is inclined to believe that the occasional points found on letters in the marginal legends of the early dinars have some "secret" meaning, but a more thorough study of the question as it relates to the coinage throughout the whole <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> empire is prerequisite to any reliable conclusion<ref target="#CH-pg103-n2">2</ref>. Later instances, it seems to me, are probably devoid of meaning. In the
<pb n="104"/>
3rd century the <hi rend="italic">ḍād</hi> of <hi rend="italic">ḍuriba</hi> quite frequently receives a point, and in the 4th century occasionally a minute annulet in place of a point: <hi rend="italic">e. g</hi>., 226, 228, 237, 239, 340, 386 A. H. There are instances of a point over the <hi rend="italic">dhāl</hi> of <hi rend="italic">hadha</hi> (<hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi>, 237 A. H.). Sometimes there is a point over the <hi rend="italic">mīm</hi> of <hi rend="italic">bi'sm</hi>, and an annulet over the <hi rend="italic">ṣād</hi> of <hi rend="italic">al-Nāṣir</hi> (<hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi>, 340 A. H.). About the year 350 a series of points begins to appear in many obverse margins, but these points only occasionally conform with the true pointing of the cursive alphabet. For exampe, in the latter half of the 4th century points frequently occur over the <hi rend="italic">hā</hi> of <hi rend="italic">al-dirham</hi> and <hi rend="italic">al-Zahrā</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">rā</hi> of both <hi rend="italic">al-dirham</hi> and <hi rend="italic">al-dīnār</hi>, as well as over the <hi rend="italic">zā</hi> of <hi rend="italic">al-Zahrā</hi>', the <hi rend="italic">nūn</hi> of <hi rend="italic">sanah</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">khā</hi> of <hi rend="italic">khamsīn;</hi> and in many instances it is difficult to say whether points over certain letters are free-standing or whether they are not simply point-punches used in engraving the top of the letter itself. In the 380's and later, the obverse, and sometimes the reverse, margins are furnished with groups of points and other elements which are quite clearly pure ornamentation: <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi>, •, ∴, <graphic url="Hispanic1-Part1_112.jpg"/>, etc.</p>
            <p>A few other isolated, and patently orthographic, points deserve mention: a point beneath the <hi rend="italic">fā</hi> of the name <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Mufarrij</name>
               </hi> in 386 A. H.; two points each over the <hi rend="italic">tā</hi> and beneath the <hi rend="italic">yā</hi> of the name <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Tamlīḥ</name>
               </hi> on a few specimens of the year 391 (nos. 320 (ppp) and (ttt))<ref target="#CH-pg104-n1">1</ref>; and a point beneath the <hi rend="italic">jīm</hi> of the name <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Jahwar</name>
               </hi> in 399 A. H.</p>
            <p>It has been observed elsewhere (in the sections on <hi rend="smallcaps">minting technique</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">symbols and ornaments</hi>) that there is plentiful evidence of the use of punches in the engraving of the legends, and that some of the letter punches were used in the execution of ornaments. Careless use of these punches has frequently resulted in more than usually illegible inscriptions and in some very curious aberrations. For exampe, late in the 4th century <hi rend="italic">lām-alifs</hi> are often very clumsily composed of vertical bars based on an annulet looking like a <hi rend="italic">mīm;</hi> and in the late 'seventies and early 'eighties the initial <hi rend="italic">alifs</hi> at the right side of the reverse area legend are sometimes made up of a continuous vertical series of strokes and knobs that look as though they might be a combination of medial '<hi rend="italic">ayn</hi> and final <hi rend="italic">bā</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tā</hi>. Also, in the 390's, there are many examples of the use of vertical rows of dots to indicate the <hi rend="italic">alifs</hi> in the same position, so carelessly applied that they continue meaninglessly through the line beginning with the names of <name type="pname">Hishām</name> or <name type="pname">Muḥammad</name>, where of course no <hi rend="italic">alif</hi> should be. Another example of conventionalization and careless engraving is the '<hi rend="italic">ayn</hi> of the name '<hi rend="italic">Āmir</hi>, which is often quite unrecog-
<pb n="105"/>
nizable. At <name type="place">Fās</name> particularly the horizontal punch at the beginning of the name extends far to the right of the crescent which forms the '<hi rend="italic">ayn</hi>, with the result that the name appears not to begin with '<hi rend="italic">ayn</hi> at all but with some other letter.</p>
            <p>The word <hi rend="italic">sanah</hi> is sometimes omitted (<hi rend="italic">e. g</hi>., 390 A. H.), and occasionally is preceded by the preposition <hi rend="italic">fī</hi> (<hi rend="italic">e. g</hi>., 360 A. H.). Mention is made elsewhere of the very common occurrence of incomplete dates; and in some instances the conjunction between the digit and the decade is lacking (<hi rend="italic">e. g</hi>., 228 A. H.). Digits are almost always, as generally in Islamic coinage elsewhere, in the masculine form, but there are instances of the feminine (<hi rend="italic">e. g</hi>., اربعة in 384 A. H.).</p>

               <hi rend="bold">SYMBOLS AND ORNAMENTS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>An effort has been made to record in the catalogue with some accuracy the very large number of symbols and ornaments which occur on the coins. The failure on the part of most writers to reproduce or otherwise describe these symbols has made it impossible to determine how many varieties of coins with certain inscriptions were issued in each year, and the lack of these details has added to the complexity of the corpus because of the necessity for special subcategories under which coins whose ornamentation is unknown could be listed. It is of some interest, although perhaps of questionable significance, to follow the development of these symbols and ornaments throughout the history of the coinage.</p>
            <p>The earliest ornaments to appear are the annulets in the obverse and reverse borders resembling those on the <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> dirhems from other mints in the East. Wherever possible the obverse annulets, which occur in varying numbers, sizes and combinations, have been recorded, but by the middle of the 3rd century they are so frequently omitted, or they become so obscure, that it is no longer possible to describe them with any accuracy. In the 4th century, while occasionally present, they are most commonly off the flan, and no consistent effort has been made to describe them. I am convinced, in any event, that the annulets are purely ornamental and that they have no special significance.</p>
            <p>I have not attempted to describe the borders enclosing the legends on each individual coin. There are many varieties in the number and style of these circles, but in general they conform to certain patterns. On the silver there is no border separating the obverse area from the marginal legend, but from the beginning two or three beaded circles enclose the marginal legend, outside which are annulets in turn enclosed by one or two outer beaded circles. Some attention is devoted to the types of borders in the discussion of the various styles of the 3rd century. In the 4th and early 5th centuries the circles enclosing the obverse marginal legend are more frequently linear than beaded, and there are usually three or four of them, with occasional annulets between the outer circle and the next outer; and in this period the
<pb n="107"/>
vertical letters in the margin are so elongated that they extend straight through the borders to the edge of the flan. From the 2nd century onward the reverse area as well as the reverse margin are each enclosed by a circle, usually beaded; and in the 4th century the border around the reverse area is sometimes double. The gold differs from the silver in that there are single, double or triple circles of various styles (beaded, hatched, chevroned, etc.) enclosing the obverse area, as well as outer obverse borders, and the usual reverse borders.</p>
            <p>Early in the coinage of the independent emirate there begin to appear in the area a series of symbols such as pellets, small circles, crescents and stars, which one cannot view as ornamental but which rather would appear to have some meaning. What the exact meaning is can perhaps never be determined, but it is safe to assume that these marks (which occur also, but not so plentifully, in the contemporary eastern Muslim coinages) relate to the differentiation of the work of die-engravers and perhaps ateliers<ref target="#CH-pg107-n1">1</ref>. At first we find pellets in the midst of the reverse area, later above and below the reverse area. In addition to the pellets we soon meet with various combinations of the other simple symbols mentioned above, and toward the end of the 2nd century sundry similar symbols appear between the lines of the obverse area. Early in the 3rd century these latter begin to alternate with single letters and combinations of letters, and finally names, usually in very small characters above the third line<ref target="#CH-pg107-n2">2</ref>.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the 3rd century the ornaments above and beneath the area, mostly on the reverse, begin to be more complex, and while some of the simple symbols continue to appear, there gradually develops a taste for twigs, branches, tendrils and relatively uncomplicated scrolls, which suggest that the die-engravers were beginning to assert their individuality, which, in view of the strict and continuing uniformity of the purely epigraphical types, they could not express in any other manner<ref target="#CH-pg107-n3">3</ref>. At this point one begins to wonder whether these ornaments have any actual significance with respect to the mint organization. One is inclined to say not, but on the other hand the simple type of symbol never is by any means completely
<pb n="108"/>
dispensed with but continues plentifully off and on to the very end; and hence the already obscure question becomes increasingly complex and apparently insoluble. Aside from such theories as I have suggested elsewhere in discussing the mints, one should consider the possibility that both simple symbols and the more intricate ornaments were the marks of assayers by which the products of their terms of responsibility could later be traced; not that each separate symbol was the mark of a different assayer, but that certain classes or styles (and there definitely are such) were proper to one assayer and that he varied them, possibly with some significance with respect to the daily or weekly "runs" of strikings.<ref target="#CH-pg108-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>With the coinage of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān III</name> a new phase commences. In the early years (<hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 316–330) there are in both obverse and reverse a few of the straightforward symbols such as stars and pyramided pellets that we have met with before; also a few simple scrolls somewhat resembling those in the latter 3rd century. With the year 330 A. H. and eight (sometimes six)-pointed rosette makes its appearance, and soon thereafter the repertory of ornament is immensely increased by the gradual introduction of a seemingly endless variety of petals, flowers, fleurs-de-lis, pomegranates, scrolls and arabesques of all sorts. The simple annulets, pellets, etc. do not cease but they appear for the moment to take a subsidiary place. It is curious that after the first burst of complicated floral ornaments there are years in which the variety of ornamentation is curtailed (compare, for exampe, the years 337 and 338); and for a time in the late 'forties there is a return to nothing but the relatively simple geometrical symbols. One can only imagine that the mintmaster (or his superior) disapproved of the artistic liberties, or frivolity so to speak, that the engravers were manifesting. The whole matter is obscure.</p>
            <p>During the rule of <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam II</name> the ornaments reach their greatest complexity, with many new combinations of annulets and pellets and a great variety of vine-like and wing-like scrolls, for the most part above and beneath the obverse area. But here again (for example from the year 360 on) there are inexplicable reversions to relatively simple symbols, mostly in the reverse. The coinage of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_hisham_ii_al-muayyad_billah">Hishām ii</name> begins with combinations of geometrical symbols and simple ornaments of older types, with the addition of a few new kinds, including
<pb n="109"/>
the oval "tear-drop." Gradually many original varieties of complex floral ornaments appear, but they tend more to conform to the "double-wing" or elaborate "fleur-de-lis" type; and while there are some arabesques somewhat resembling those of <name type="pname">al-Ḥakam's</name> coinage they are never so numerous or involved. Toward the very end, during <name type="pname">Hishām's</name> second reign, and during those of Muḥammad and Sulaymān, most of the elaborate ornaments disappear and the commonest symbols are the annulet and "tear-drop" in various combinations.</p>
            <p>An index of the ornaments has been provided with a double end in view. In the first place, it may prove useful to art historians in that it comprises a concentrated and rather large corpus of miniature ornament, as represented on the coinage at least, during three centuries of Muslim Spain. Secondly, it should serve to assist collectors with little knowledge of Arabic in identifying and attributing their coins. The arrangement in the index is conceived as a logical one, proceeding from various beginnings toward the complex from the simple. It should be observed that not all the different <hi rend="italic">combinations</hi> of symbols are recorded in the index; to have done so would have added immeasurably to its complexity and would have made it more cumbersome than useful. Also it is hardly necessary to point out that the ornaments, while accurately drawn in their essential outline, are in the great majority of instances somewhat conventionalized. Thus a single fleur-de-lis of one type represents many varieties of that type; the same with the "pomegranate," whether the sphere is solid or open, or whatever the curve of its foliage, which is frequently less reentrant than it appears in the conventionalized drawing.</p>
            <p>This conventionalization, or standardization, has been necessary for several reasons: wear, mutilation, faulty striking, die-breaks, etc. have frequently obscured part of the ornament or rendered its details uncertain; very seldom are two examples of the same ornament (except the simplest symbols) exactly alike; frequently an ornament is obviously imperfectly executed but the intention of the die-engraver to execute such-and-such a figure is quite apparent; the scale of the ornaments with respect to the inscriptions varies, etc., etc. Patently, to have represented each and every ornament with absolute fidelity would have been wholly impracticable; as it is, nearly eight hundred different symbols and ornaments have been drawn. The actual total, throughout the three centuries, must have been many times this number. For example, in a single year such as 352 A. H., I have seen (or seen represented) about 40 specimens, and among these I have distinguished some 32 different ornaments; yet these 40 specimens are only a fraction of the total of 292 specimens which I have recorded
<pb n="110"/>
for that year. In many years, for the sake of economy and simplification, I have placed a number of specimens on which the ornaments are nearly but not identical under one subheading (with the word "variations" after the ornament), so that even the listed dies are less than the known total. It is obvious, therefore, that the ornaments represented in the present catalogue, however numerous, are only a sampling.</p>
            <p>A careful study of the design of the ornaments reveals the fact that, like the letters of the inscriptions, they are constructed of a fairly limited number of punches, the most important elements being pellets, small annulets, simple strokes, curves and crescents. Most of these were used in engraving the legends themselves. The technique of combining these punches applied to even the most complicated floral scrolls and arabesques. In all probability the ornament was not even sketched out before it was impressed on the die; within such limits as may have been prescribed by the "system" or meaning of the symbols for the year or issue, the die-engraver probably gave his fancy free play, using the punches which he had used for the inscriptions in various combinations. I am inclined to believe that some of the more intricate scrolls and floral ornaments during a given span of years were the product of one artisan, as they resemble each other very closely in general style, differing only in minute detail. Indeed, in some cases these scrolls are virtually identical except for some one very small particular, such as the addition of a tiny tendril, leaf or petal<ref target="#CH-pg110-n1">1</ref>.</p>

               <p>There are many aspects to the problem. For example, one would expect, if the ornaments have any technical significance, that their position in any given year with reference to obverse and reverse would remain invariable, but sometimes we find the same ornament appearing on different faces in the same year: <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi>, nos. 318 (z) and (kk).</p>

               <p>For many years the late Howland Wood, Curator of the American Numismatic Society, kept a note-book in which he recorded the dates and mints of <name type="pname">Umayyad</name> dirhems that came to his attention.

the notation "Schulman Cat. April, 1935." Prolonged search fails to reveal the existence of such a catalogue<ref target="CH-pg122-n1">1</ref>, and for the time being we must consider these years unrepresenedd in spite of <name type="pname">Mr. Wood's</name> entries. Obviously he saw the coins listed somewhere, but as they would be unique and authenticated only (apparently) in a sales catalogue, there is insufficient justification for their acceptance.</p>

H. in the key to the plates, but which in another place (p. 5 of the reprint) he refers to as 135 A. H. It certainly is not 129; but in view of the nature of the reproduction (half-tone) it is virtually impossible to verify the reading 135. The digit 5 is clear, but the decade is obscure. However, I am inclined to believe that 135 is correct. The appearanee of this specimen, which has not appeared before in any of the catalogues or studies dealing with the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3117735">Madrid</name> collection, would (if the date is actually 135) tend to support the attribution of a dirhem which I had heretofore doubted: one of the year 137 which <name type="pname">Longpérier</name> (p. 5) listed but had not seen. Otherwise there are no dirhems preserved between 131 and the first issue of '<name type="pname">Abd al-Raḥmān</name> I in 146.</p>

Historically 90 is impossible. <name type="pname">Lavoix's</name> comparison of these coins with <name type="pname">Codera's</name> pl. II, 6 (see no. 33 above) is not accurate.</p>
               <p>Most of these coppers bearing the mint name are very thick (<hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. 3-3.5 mm.), as are those lacking the mint name. The latter (group A) have been assigned to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> simply because of their presence in the Hispanic Society Collection; they were, therefore, in all probability acquired in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>, and as coppers almost never travel far they hence would be indigenous. There are probably many other mintless Spanish coppers similar to these in the numismatic literature, but in the absence of any knowledge of their fabric and provenance it is impossible to distinguish them from the numerous other <name type="pname">Umayyad</name>

            <p>"The Medal in <name type="place">America</name>" was the subject of the thirteenth Coinage of the <name type="place">Americas</name> Conference in 1997, just as it had been a decade earlier. As the earlier conference had been held in conjunction with the opening of the exhibit "The Beaux-Arts Medal in <name type="place">America</name>," so this year's conference was in the context of three exhibits at the Society's headquarters. This year's exhibits were oriented to the medal of the mid- and late-twentieth century. "A Life in the Arts: Medallic Works of <name type="pname">Gilroy Roberts</name>," a retrospective look at the works of the former Chief Engraver of the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint, traveled to the ANS from our sister institution, the American Numismatic Association, where it had been curated by <name type="pname">Robert W. Hoge</name>. "The American Medallic Sculpture Association, 1982-1997," featured contemporary work by the members of that group, co-curated by <name type="pname">Jacqueline Lorieo</name> and <name type="pname">Alan M. Stahl</name>. A complementary exhibit, "The British Art Medal Society, 1982-1997," was organized by <name type="pname">Philip Attwood</name> of the British Museum. The latter two exhibits were the subject of a joint catalogue, <hi rend="italic">2 Sides</hi>, published by AMSA.</p>
            <p>The conference itself was organized in sessions over the weekend of November 8 to 9. Saturday was devoted to the history of the American medal, and featured the first eight papers published in this volume. It ended with a formal opening of the exhibits, followed by dinner for the participants at the historic Keen's Chop House. Sunday began with the screening of <hi rend="italic">The Medal Maker</hi>, a film produced by the American Numismatic Society in 1929 and recently restored by <name type="pname">Mike Craven</name> Productions with a new introduction written by <name type="pname">Dick Johnson</name> featuring <name type="pname">Elizabeth Jones</name>. The rest of the day was devoted to hands-on demonstrations of the techniques of medal making. <name type="pname">Virginia Janssen</name> explained and demonstrated both the pantographic and direct
<pb/>
approaches to die making. <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name>, assisted by <name type="pname">Joe Rust</name>, used equipment transported from the Gallery Mint Museum of Hot <name type="place">Springs, AR</name>, to show the technique of direct die engraving and striking. Participants in the congress then struck examples of a special medal, whose obverse die had been prepared in advance by <name type="pname">Janssen</name> using a pantographic reduction and whose reverse die had been carved on the spot by <name type="pname">Landis</name>. Both demonstrators kindly contributed discussions of their work for inclusion in this volume.</p>

            <p>Ten years after the first conference and volume on <hi rend="italic">The Medal in <name type="place">America</name>,</hi> we return with new studies on the topic. The two sets of papers have much in common, a result of the way in which the medal is viewed in this country. In general terms, the medal in <name type="place">America</name> is approached as three distinct subjects, each exemplified in this year's conference. The medals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century are treated as subjects for historical and numismatic inquiry, while those of a century later are objects of art historical analysis. American medals since the First World War are scarcely considered worthy of scholarly study at all.</p>
            <p>The paper in this volume by <name type="pname">John Adams</name> is a preview of his forthcoming book on a series of Indian Peace Medals which are among the most intriguing in the series, those in the name of <name type="pname">George III</name>. The heraldic group is problematic enough, with the portrait of a young king paired with shields from both early and late in his reign, but the "Lion and Wolf" medal has long been a complete mystery in terms of date, iconography and purpose. <name type="pname">Adams</name> has combined extensive documentary and numismatic research to his solution to these questions. <name type="pname">Chris Neuzil's</name> paper on Moritz Fürst is an example of the most basic and valuable tool in medallic study, a fully documented corpus of the work of an artist set into a biographical narrative. It is of special importance in covering the work of an artist of major importance in the early development of the American medal, and one whose work has been little known until now. The paper of <name type="pname">Paul Rich</name> and <name type="pname">Guillermo De Los Reyes</name> on Masonic medals is more of a plea for inclusion and introductory overview than a detailed study. Medals, decorations and tokens of fraternal organizations have long been relegated to the edges of medallic inquiry, even though they had an enormous presence in the culture of the times.</p>
            <pb n="x"/>
            <p>Five of the papers in this volume deal with what has become the core area of study for the art of the American medal, the period from the Columbian Exposition to the First World War. <name type="pname">Thayer Tolles</name> tells the tumultuous story of the most important medal by the most influential of American medalists, the Columbian Exposition Award medal of <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name>. Three authors treat the works of individual artists with comprehensive surveys of their work. <name type="pname">Barbara A. Baxter</name> writes on the classical nature of the work of one of the leading members of the first generation of American Beaux-Arts medalists, <name type="pname">A. A. Weinman</name>. <name type="pname">Scott Miller</name> examines and catalogues the medals of <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name>, important in the turn-of-the-century sculpture of <name type="place">England</name> as well as <name type="place">America</name>. <name type="pname">Bob Mueller</name> treats the use of mythological iconography in the medals of <name type="pname">Paul Manship</name>, an artist whose work can be seen as the culmination of the Beaux-Arts movement in <name type="place">America</name> and the basis of the Art Deco style which dominated figurative sculpture here for much of the twentieth century. In her essay on <name type="pname">Charles De Kay</name> and the Circle of Friends of the Medallion, <name type="pname">Susan Luftschein</name> deals with issues of patronage and reception, situating the art medal in the aesthetic development of the age.</p>
            <p>The contributions of the conference and this volume to the American medal of the late twentieth century are only potential. The Sunday workshops of <name type="pname">Virginia Janssen</name> and <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name> were of great interest to historians of the medal in illustrating the processes of many of the phenomena to be studied on the objects themselves, but may have even more importance for their effect on the artists present, who could see traditional techniques employed in the hands of modern practitioners.</p>
            <p>What would we like to see in a third volume of The Medal in <name type="place">America</name>, perhaps in 2007? There are eight decades of American medals between the War of 1812 and the Columbian celebration of 1892 which remain virtually unexplored and uncatalogued; leading medalists such as <name type="pname">C. C. Wright</name> and <name type="pname">George H. Lovett</name> remain little more than names to modern scholars. From the perspective of the next century, we should be able to look back at the twentieth century and find much of interest in the American medals of its last eight decades. And, of course, there will already be a few years of the twenty-first century American medal to subject to examination and study.</p>

            <p>The reign of <name type="pname">George III</name> lasted for 60 years, from 1760 to 1820. This period spans the War of the Conquest, <name type="pname">Pontiac's Revolt</name>, the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Our interest in <name type="pname">George III</name> centers on the Indian Peace Medals issued in his name. These medals tell a story at two levels. At the numismatic level, the story has been told by such distinguished hobbyists as <name type="pname">Robert McLachlan</name> (1882), <name type="pname">C. Willys Betts</name> (1894), <name type="pname">Victor Morin</name> (1916) and <name type="pname">Melville Jamieson</name> (1936). Much of what has been written by these authors is in error. We attempt to correct the earlier errors, proceeding further to define die varieties, methods of manufacture and quantities issued.</p>
            <p>More important than the story at the numismatic level is the story at the historical level. The peace medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> tell an eloquent, if cynical, story of relations between the white man and Native Americans. This story spans many of the critical turning points in the development of a continent. The paper that follows attempts to summarize key findings that will be treated at greater length in a book in press for 1999 (<name type="pname">Adams</name> 1999).</p>

                  <name type="pname">George</name> the Second died on October 24, 1760, and his 22 year old grandson was proclaimed the following day. The coronation of <name type="pname">George III</name> took place on September 22, 1761, followed almost immediately by his marriage to <name type="pname">Charlotte of Mecklenberg</name>. Newly crowned and newly wed, the young King was also basking in the glow of his grandfather's victories. In the prior year, <name type="pname">Wolfe</name> had defeated Montcalm before Montreal, driving the French from <name type="place">Canada</name> after a long, bitterly contested war.</p>
               <p>Indians played a prominent role in the so-called "War of the Conquest." The Six Nations of the Iroquois League had fought on the side of the British. The Seven Nations of <name type="place">Canada</name> had fought on the side of the French, as had the tribes in the Great Lakes region—the <name type="place">Ottawas, Chippewas, Hurons</name> and <name type="place">Pottawatomies</name>. On the western border of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, the Delawares and Shawnees had begun the war as allies of the colonials but then switched sides to the French before switching back as momentum swung to the British.</p>
               <p>Originally, each colony had conducted its own Indian affairs. In large part because of the troubles in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, <name type="pname">George II</name> decided to centralize the responsibility for relations with the Indians. The new Superintendent of Indian Affairs bypassed the colonial governments,
<pb n="3"/>
reporting directly to the Commander in Chief for <name type="place">North America</name>. From 1755 until his death in 1774, Sir <name type="pname">William Johnson</name> held the position of Superintendent in the Northern District. In 1760, at the beginning of the reign of <name type="pname">George III</name>, the Commander in Chief was Major General <name type="pname">Jeffrey Amherst</name>. He was succeeded in 1763 by General <name type="pname">Thomas Gage</name> of Bunker Hill fame.</p>
               <p>A large landowner in upstate <name type="place">New York</name>, <name type="pname">William Johnson</name> began his career as a trader, assuming the ways of the Indians and learning their language. Adopted by the <name type="pname">Mohawks</name>, the easternmost of the <name type="place">Iroquois nations</name>, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> enjoyed a special relationship with the natives. It was he who saw the inroads being made by the <name type="pname">French</name>, prompting him to recommend a centralized approach to Indian relations (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1754). With his appointment to the Superintendency, Sir <name type="pname">William</name> soon became the most notable figure in colonial <name type="place">America</name>. He led combined British-colonial-Indian forces to important victories over the <name type="pname">French</name> at <name type="place">Lake George and Niagara</name>. With his Indians, he accompanied Wolfe to the climactic battle for <name type="place">Montreal</name> in 1759.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Johnson</name> started for <name type="place">Montreal</name> with over 500 Indians but, between whimsical desertions and regular disagreements with the British military establishment, ended up with less than half that number. However, his supreme accomplishment was persuading the French Indians to remain neutral. <name type="pname">Pierre Pouchet</name> wrote in his memoirs "<name type="pname">Johnson</name> alone was able to quiet them and make them forget their ancient political system in this war" (<name type="pname">Pouchet</name> 1866, 1:30). Indeed, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> was the only figure in colonial <name type="place">America</name> respected by the Indians, the colonists and the British alike.</p>
               <p>For his part, <name type="pname">Amherst</name> had a low regard for Indians. Nonetheless, it was he who recommended the so-called "<name type="place">Montreal</name> medal" to <name type="pname">Johnson</name> and then saw to its execution (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 10:461). <name type="pname">Johnson</name> viewed the medals as a reward for service whereas <name type="pname">Amherst</name> considered them an identification badge by which "good" Indians could be distinguished in the future.</p>
               <p>In their paper in <hi rend="italic">The Medal in <name type="place">America</name>,</hi>
                  <name type="pname">Fuld</name> and <name type="pname">Tayman</name> did a commendable job of describing both the <name type="place">Montreal</name> medals and the Happy While United medals of 1764 and 1766 (<name type="pname">Fuld</name> and <name type="pname">Tayman</name> 1988). We will elaborate on these issues in our forthcoming book. Suffice for now to observe that there is an ironic connection between the two. Having eliminated the French, <name type="pname">Amherst</name> decided to suspend the sale of guns, powder and other supplies to the Indians and bar their entrance into British forts (save, presumably, for those natives wearing
<pb n="4"/>
                  <name type="place">Montreal</name> medals). The hard line taken by <name type="pname">Amherst</name> led to growing unrest, culminating in the conspiracy of 1763. Indeed, the Pontiac Conspiracy is often called "<name type="pname">Amherst's</name> War" by modern historians.</p>

                  <p>1. Medal for the wedding of <name type="pname">George III</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name>, ANS 1925.173.5.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>By long tradition, the <name type="pname">George</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> medal has been attributed to 1761 (<ref target="#fig-2">fig. 1</ref>). <name type="pname">Robert McLachlan</name> writes "<name type="pname">George III</name> was married September 8, 1761. On this occasion, the Indians, ever profuse in their expressions of loyalty, forwarded to the 'Great Father' an address of congratulation, which the King gratefully acknowledged by causing these medals to be struck and distributed among the faithful red men" (<name type="pname">McLachlan</name> 1882, 11). This statement is romantic balderdash. There were very few "faithful" Indians to be found—<name type="pname">Amherst</name> had seen to that.</p>
               <p>The undated <name type="pname">George III</name> peace medals of standard design—"standard" meaning portrait on obverse, arms on reverse—come in three sizes: 76mm, 60mm and 38mm (<ref target="#fig-3">figs. 2</ref> and <ref target="#fig-4">3</ref>). The <name type="pname">George</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> medal shares its reverse with the standard medal of 38mm diameter. The latter is extremely rare; indeed only two specimens are now known. Thus, it seems logical to hypothesize that the obverse die for this medal broke early its life and that the obverse of a previously unused marriage medal was employed in its place.</p>
               <p>The "Lion and Wolf" medal has been similarly misplaced (<ref target="#fig-5">fig. 4</ref>). <name type="pname">C. Willys Betts</name> deserves the blame for this mistake, because it was he, reasoning from a specimen found in the grave of <name type="pname">Pontiac's</name> son, who then pioneered the theory that the skulking wolf represented Pontiac with the rest of the scene depicting the bliss to be had by those adhering to the British side (<name type="pname">Betts</name> 1894, 238). This flight of fancy was swallowed whole by subsequent writers including <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> (1899, 16), <name type="pname">Morin</name> (1916, 35) and <name type="pname">Jamieson</name> (1936, 13).</p>

               </figure>
               <p>In attributing the son's medal to the father, Betts ignored the matrilineal customs of Pontiac's tribe, the Ottawas. More obviously, he failed to explain why the great chief would have been pleased to receive a medal on the reverse of which he was caricatured, much less a medal of the medium-size generally issued to lesser figures. Further, none of the early writers observed that Lion and Wolf shares its obverse with the standard <name type="pname">George III</name> medal of the same diameter.</p>

               <p>Thus, both the Lion and Wolf and the <name type="pname">George</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> medals are die-linked to the undated <name type="pname">George III</name> medals of standard design. Most likely, all of these pieces were made during the same period. Our thesis is that the undated peace medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> were made beginning in 1776 and continued to be made until dated medals appeared in 1814.</p>
               <p>Our case requires two proofs. The first is that the medals were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> made at the outset of the reign of <name type="pname">George III</name> (1760) or at any time up
<pb n="8"/>
until 1776. The second proof required is that they were made thereafter. We have uncovered an abundance of contemporary evidence to support both points.</p>

               <p>After conquering the French, the British should have renewed ties with their Indian allies as well as initiating relations with the greater number of Indians who had fought against them. Instead, they took a more short sighted view reasoning that, with the French threat removed, the money previously devoted to Indian presents could be saved. This attitude was well expressed by <name type="pname">Amherst</name> writing to <name type="pname">Johnson</name> in 1761: "Yet I am of opinion that we must deal sparingly, for the future ... I can see little reason for bribing the Indians or buying their good behavior, since they have no enemy to molest them" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 10:348). The Indians were quick to sense the adverse change in their situation. In reporting to <name type="place">London</name> in the Spring of 1762, Sir <name type="pname">William Johnson</name> wrote: "On inspecting my transactions of last year, and the later meeting your Lordship will observe that the Indians are not only very uneasy, but jealous of our growing power, which the enemy [i.e., the French] had always told them would prove their ruin, as we should by degrees surround them on every side, and at length extirpate them" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 10:461).</p>
               <p>The "late meeting" referred to by <name type="pname">Johnson</name> was a council with the Great Lakes Indians at <name type="pname">Fort Detroit</name> in the Summer of 1761. This was the first formal meeting held by the English with the most powerful tribes that had fought on the side of the French. Notwithstanding the importance of the occasion, minutes of the meeting reveal no issue of medals or, as protocol would have demanded, exchange of French medals in their place. In contrast, minutes of the councils at <name type="place">Niagara</name> in 1764 and <name type="place">Oswego</name> in 1766, for which the Happy While United medals were procured, describe such exchanges. Furthermore, <name type="pname">Ensign Gorrell</name>, who was sent to <name type="pname">Michillimackinac</name>, the second most important post in the West, wrote that his predecessor was asked by the Indians for medals in 1761 but there were none to give out then or now (<name type="pname">Gorrell</name> 1903 1:33[6/25/1762]; 1:38[5/18/1763]). Thus it seems clear that no medals were given out in 1761 and 1762.</p>
               <p>During the year 1763, the frontiers were aflame with <name type="pname">Pontiac's Revolt</name>. For the treaties held in 1764 and 1766 there is ample documentation in the papers of <name type="pname">General Gage</name> and Sir <name type="pname">William Johnson</name> that
<pb n="9"/>
the medals issued were of local manufacture. Indeed, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> complained about the quality of this work because the French medals being exchanged were both finer and thicker (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 12:23). <name type="pname">Gage</name> responded: "I will inquire whether there is any good engravers at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. The die in my possession was done by <name type="pname">one de Bruls</name> who was reckoned the best in these parts of the world" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 12:34).<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Despite the existence of a local source, medals remained in short supply. In 1765, Indian agent <name type="pname">William Howard</name> wrote from <name type="place">Michillimackinac</name> that three important chiefs requested medals but he had none to give out (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 11:806-7). <name type="pname">George Croghan</name>, who was one of <name type="pname">Johnson's</name> most active lieutenants, took Happy While United medals on his mission to the <name type="place">Illinois</name> in 1765 but, in early 1767, was forced to order 20 silver medals from <name type="pname">Myer Myers</name>, a <name type="place">silversmith in New York</name> (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 12:265). Thus, there is no evidence of English-made medals being issued from 1763 through 1767.</p>
               <p>Nowhere was the lack of quality medals felt more keenly than in the case of the Treaty of <name type="pname">Fort Stanwix</name> in 1768. Preparing more than two years in advance for an event that would cede 20,000,000 acres of Indian land to the Crown, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> wrote to his civil supervisor at the Lords of Trade: "In my last letters I mentioned what the Indians then inclined to agree to with regard to the boundary between us and them ... and with the assistance of a proper present and some good medals [i.e., English made] struck on the occasion for the chief <name type="pname">sachems</name> and principal warriors, I do not despair of effecting it" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 12:32). Incredibly, the Lords of Trade denied this modest request as well as subsequent applications for medals to be issued at following councils. <name type="pname">Benjamin Roberts</name>, Sir <name type="pname">William's</name> agent in <name type="place">London</name>, reported the bad news: "I spoke to him about the medals, upon the whole his answer was that he would not augment the expense" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 7:607). And again, "also the article of the Medals but he still persisted in thinking a limit should be fixed to the expense" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 7, 732). In effect, His Majesty's government graciously accepted the 20,000,000 acres for which é15,000 had been paid but it would not spend another one hundred pounds to dignify the occasion.</p>

               <p>After the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and its confirmations, the Indians became a forgotten force. <name type="pname">Johnson's</name> budget was greatly reduced, as trou-
<pb n="10"/>
bles with the colonists moved to center stage. Seven years later, the situation was wholly reversed. With both the colonists and the British seeking allies in the struggle that began at <name type="place">Lexington</name>, the Indians held the balance of power. Both sides conducted councils, vying to gain influence. The "peace" medals awarded in the process are enduring symbols of this hypocritical courtship.</p>
               <p>In our book, we will discuss the individuals who promoted the use of medals as well as what can be learned in the absence of mint records for this period. Suffice for now to observe that British medals appear as early as June 5, 1776, when a German officer describes a reception held in <name type="place">Montreal</name>, "After the ceremony was over, the General [Governor-General Sir <name type="pname">Guy Carleton</name>] ordered uniforms ... for these chiefs, and presented them with big silver medallions upon which the likeness of the King was stamped" (<name type="pname">Du Roi</name> 1911, 38). A few months later, similar treatment was accorded to Wabasha, the legendary chief of the <name type="pname">Mdewankton Sioux</name> and his companion, "The Governor presented each chief with a large silver medal bearing a bust of King <name type="pname">George</name> on the obverse side and Great <name type="place">Britain's</name> coat of arms on the reverse. These were hung around their necks on ribbons of royal purple. <name type="pname">Wabasha wore</name> his above a similar French medal" (<name type="pname">Stevens</name> 1990, 46).</p>
               <p>Many more such references have been located in archives on both sides of the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>. In our book, we explore at length the likelihood that the 300 "Burgoyne medals" (<name type="pname">Clinton</name> 1900, 2:781) given out at <name type="place">Fort Niagara</name> in December 1777 were of the Lion and Wolf design. Nonetheless, the first explicit mention of this medal we have located is in a letter dated 4/7/1781 which lists: "50 large silver medals with the Kings bust, the Lion, Wolf, etc." (<name type="pname">Knox</name> 1781). Our earliest citation for the <name type="pname">George</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> medal occurs on an indent written in 1777 listing "70 silver medals, King and Queen's" (<name type="pname">Knox</name> 1777). Thus, both <name type="pname">George-and-Charlotte</name> and Lion-and-Wolf can be ascribed with certainty to the Period of the Revolutionary War. Notwithstanding an extensive search of archives on both sides of the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>, no earlier references to these or any of the undated <name type="pname">George III</name> peace medals have been found.</p>
               <p>After the Treaty of <name type="place">Paris</name> in 1783, the British continued to award peace medals to Indians in the Great Lakes region as well as to a few tribes west of the <name type="place">Mississippi</name>. With the advent of the War of 1812, there was another surge in issuance culminating with the new, dated design in 1814. As our census (see below) would suggest, there were half as many of the 1814 medals distributed in a few years as there were undated medals awarded over a few decades. By the year 1815, the
<pb n="11"/>
demand was pretty well saturated: "Formerly a chief would have parted with his life rather than his medal. Now very few think it worth preserving" (<name type="pname">Bulger</name> 1815, 13:114).</p>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">George III</name> medals got off to a very slow start in <name type="place">U.S.</name> numismatics. Early commentators thought them rarer than the French counterparts. Indeed, the Bushnell Collection, one of the great treasure troves of <name type="place">Americana</name>, contained but a single example.</p>
               <p>The cause of the initial scarcity of <name type="pname">George III</name> medals is eminently logical: having fought on the side of the British in the Revolutionary War, most of the recipients chose to relocate in <name type="place">Canada</name>. Thus, it wasn't until important Canadian collections came on the market that the supply began to improve. The <name type="pname">Gerald Hart sale</name> in 1888 contained four specimens; the <name type="pname">Hunter</name> (1920) and <name type="pname">W.W. C. Wilson</name> (1925) collections contained many more.</p>
               <p>In point of fact, thousands of the <name type="pname">George III</name> medals were made—perhaps tens of thousands. We list several hundred in the condition census in our book. With specimens residing among Indians and in small institutions across <name type="place">Canada</name>, we are confident that more examples will be available to numismatists as time wears on.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Jamieson</name> (1936) lists a number of die varieties of the <name type="pname">George III</name> medals of which two are duplicates. All in all, his was a good first effort but we will describe a number of additional die varieties in our book. So numerous are the dies that one could infer from their number alone a total emission of 60,000 to 100,000 pieces. This estimate is almost certainly high; two other approaches described in our book yield estimates ranging between 5000 and 15,000.</p>
               <p>The large medals were manufactured by one of three processes:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item n="1)">Some were struck on planchets cut to size, using a collar;</item>
                  <item n="2)">Some were struck as shells and then joined;</item>
                  <item n="3)">Some were struck on very thin planchets, with a thick rim added around the circumference to support a hanger.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the absence of mint records, one can only speculate as to why three methods of manufacture were employed. It seems logical to hypothesize that methods #2 and #3 were used to save money: Method #1 consumed more than twice the silver required for #2 and for #3. Data on weight, diameter, styles of hanger and other such features are now being gathered.</p>

               <p>As a check on relative rarity, as well as to minimize duplication, we have designed our census in two parts. The first includes collections, auction appearances, and fixed price lists from 1860 to 1975. The second or modern census extends from 1975 to present day. As can be seen from Table 1, the two censuses reveal quite similar results. Thus one can be tolerably confident that the large undated medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> are the most common, followed by the large 1814s, Lion-and-Wolf and <name type="pname">George-and-Charlotte</name> in that order. The small undated medal of <name type="pname">George III</name> is by far the rarest of the group, which gives rise to our theory that the obverse die broke early in its life, leading to the substitution of <name type="pname">George-and-Charlotte</name>.</p>

               <p>If the medium-sized medals were issued to warrior chiefs and the small ones to ordinary warriors, one or both must have been made in much greater quantities than the large designs intended for the political chiefs or sachems. One explanation for the lower survival rate is alcohol: Indians were all too easily addicted to spirits and, given the silver content, medals must have been a fungible source of payment. At formal councils with the white men, chiefs made frequent complaints about the volume of rum dispensed by the traders but only a handful of tribes were successful in barring the substance from their dominions.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Inasmuch</name> as chiefs drank at least as copiously as warriors, the higher survival rate of the large medals can probably be attributed to inherent political value. Within the Indian community, chiefs' medals were a confirmation of authority. Outside the community, chiefs were expected to
<pb n="13"/>
wear their medals as symbols of loyalty to the Great White Fathers.</p>
               <p>Whereas our census captures relative rarity, the total population now extant can only be guessed. The several hundred examples listed in our book could be relatively complete. More likely, in our opinion, is that another one to three times as many await re-discovery. Only time will tell. Whatever the ultimate census may show, it is clear that the population of <name type="pname">George III</name> medals is greater than generally thought. The good news is that they are sufficiently available to be an eminently collectable item.</p>

               <p>The generals of <name type="pname">George III</name> regarded native Americans as idle, drunken and undependable. For their part, the Indians regarded the British as grasping and deceitful. Both sides had their points.</p>
               <p>From an historical perspective, the medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> serve to sift through conflicting opinions and create a demonstrable fact: the British policy toward Indians was entirely self-serving. When, as was the case in the 1760s, the government placed a low value on the good will of the North American natives, the medals issued to them were small and/or of crude workmanship. When, with the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the services of the Indians became indispensable, the medals got bigger and better.</p>
               <p>Be it said that the medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> do more than enshrine the hypocrisy of His Majesty's government. They recall the enlightened Superintendency of Sir <name type="pname">William Johnson</name>. They mark the ebb and flow of events from the triumph at <name type="place">Montreal</name> in 1759, to the disasters of <name type="pname">Pontiac's revolt</name>, to the attempt to create a permanent boundary at the Treaty of <name type="pname">Fort Stanwix</name> in 1768. With the Revolutionary War, the issue of medals reached a crescendo, commemorating the early battles for <name type="place">Montreal</name>, Burgoyne's disastrous campaign, the border wars of <name type="place">New York</name> and formal alliances in the West. Medal-giving reached another, smaller, peak during the War of 1812. Indians played prominent roles at <name type="pname">Detroit, Chrysler's Farm</name> and <name type="pname">Chateaugay</name>.</p>
               <p>Without denigrating the peace medals issued by our own government, we note that the medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> mark a period when the Indians were still a force on the scene. These medals mark the last period during which Indians played at center stage. They recall the independence, the bravery and the cunning of proud cultures that were soon subsumed by the tide of events.</p>

            <p>Artist and die engraver <name type="pname">Moritz Fürst</name> was 26 years old when he came to <name type="place">America</name> from <name type="place">Europe</name> in late 1807. Between 1807 and about 1840, when he returned to <name type="place">Europe</name>, he hand-engraved the dies for numerous Congressional award medals for the War of 1812 as well as presidential portrait dies for 12 different Indian Peace Medals. He also made a large number of medal dies as private and institutional commissions and, apparently, as speculative ventures. The medals from these dies preserve a remarkable collection of portraits, allegorical representations, historical scenes, and other iconography of early nineteenth century <name type="place">America</name>.</p>
            <p>Inexplicably, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> has received scant attention from numismatists. Although many of his medals have been described in various publications, notably the compilations of American medals by <name type="pname">Loubat</name> (1878) and <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977), the only attempt to catalogue <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> American medals specifically was by <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b) more than 40 years ago. A great deal has been learned since <name type="pname">Chamberlain's</name> pioneering study, but the findings have not been collected and organized, and some of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> medallic work remains unpublished or unrecognized. Moreover, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> himself remains a shadowy figure, with many questions surrounding his professional and personal life.</p>
            <p>In this paper I examine <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> career and present an updated compilation and discussion of his American medals. Both a census of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> medal dies in tabular form and an illustrated catalogue of medals from the dies are included, and appear in an appendix. The die census is useful for analysis because many of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> dies were paired with more than one of his other dies, with dies of other makers, or used without mate dies. In addition, it is the dies rather than the medals that measure <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> output and provide a framework for understanding his engraving career.</p>

                  <name type="pname">Fürst</name> was born to <name type="pname">Jewish</name> parents in the town of Boesing, near <name type="place">Pressburg</name>, <name type="place">Hungary</name> (now <name type="place">Bratislava</name>, <name type="place">Slovak</name> Republic) in March 1782 (<name type="pname">Dunlap</name> 1834, 221). Little is known about his early years. His training took place in <name type="place">Vienna</name>, then about a two-day journey from <name type="place">Pressburg</name>. There, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> relates (<name type="pname">Dunlap</name> 1834, 221), he studied die sinking under <name type="pname">Johann N. Wirt</name>, the engraver at the <name type="place">Vienna</name> Mint. Wirt directed an Academy of Engraving (<name type="pname">Forrer</name> 1904, 6:567), and <name type="pname">Fürst presumably</name> was a student there. <ref target="#fig-6">Figure 1</ref> presents an example of Wirt's medallic work. Later, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> studied under an engraver named <name type="pname">Megole</name>, who superintended

the mint in <name type="place">Lombardy, Italy</name> (<name type="pname">Dunlap</name> 1834, 221). <name type="pname">Megole</name> had earlier been in <name type="place">Vienna</name>, perhaps also as Wirt's student, and it is likely that he met <name type="pname">Fürst</name> there. While working in <name type="place">Italy</name>, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> made the acquaintance of <name type="pname">Thomas Appleton</name>, the American Consul in <name type="place">Livorno</name>.</p>

               <p>A pamphlet published by <name type="pname">Fürst</name>, or on his behalf, in about 1825 (Proceedings n.d.) outlined the artist's version of his intercourse with <name type="place">Appleton</name>. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> engraved seals for the Consul, whereupon <name type="place">Appleton</name> requested a meeting with the engraver through <name type="pname">Francis Wittenberg</name>, who acted as <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> business agent. The pamphlet describes <name type="place">Appleton</name>, after some discussion of coinage designs, explicitly offering <name type="pname">Fürst</name> a position as engraver at the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint with an annual salary of $2,000. The offer was later attested by <name type="place">Wittenberg</name>, whose notarized statement to that effect appears in the pamphlet. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> recounts that he accepted the offer and sailed with <name type="place">Wittenberg</name> to <name type="place">New York</name>, arriving in September 1807 (Proceedings n.d.).</p>
               <p>As represented in the pamphlet, <name type="place">Appleton's</name> offer is difficult to reconcile with events that followed. It seems unlikely that <name type="place">Appleton</name> had authority to engage an engraver for the Mint, particularly at a salary of $2,000; by the time <name type="pname">Fürst</name> arrived in <name type="place">America</name>, the German-born engraver John Reich had been hired, at a salary of $600, to assist Mint engraver <name type="pname">Robert Scot</name>. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> eventually met with Mint Director <name type="pname">Robert Patterson</name>, Chief Coiner <name type="pname">Henry Voigt</name>, and <name type="pname">Reich</name> (Proceedings n.d.). However, <name type="pname">Patterson</name> apparently did not offer him the position he expected.</p>
               <p>Although we do not know what transpired in his meeting with
<pb n="20"/>
Patterson, it is clear that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> believed that he would eventually obtain the promised appointment (Proceedings n.d.).<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> He took up residence in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> and started engraving dies and seals (<name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> 1954a, 590). Unfortunately, a <name type="place">U.S.</name> embargo in response to British and French trade policies caused a depression beginning in 1808. Economic disruption, social unrest, and even threats of civil war (<name type="pname">Hickey</name> 1989) marked <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> early years in <name type="place">America</name>. In 1812, the year <name type="pname">Fürst</name> turned 30, friction between the <name type="place">U.S.</name> and <name type="place">Britain</name> led to war and the British Navy was soon threatening American coastal cities, including <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> adopted home of <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. In 1814 panic swept the country when the British succeeded in burning <name type="place">Washington</name> (<name type="pname">Lord</name> 1972, 215). <name type="pname">Fürst</name> can hardly have prospered during this turmoil. Ultimately, however, it was the War of 1812 that catapulted <name type="pname">Fürst</name> to prominence as a die engraver.</p>
               <p>Congress voted some 27 medals to Army and Navy commanders during and following the war. By 1814 the Navy had begun to procure medals mandated for its officers. <name type="pname">Reich</name> was contracted for the work, but he completed only four dies (for two medals) by 1817, a clear indication that he would be unable to complete all of the needed dies (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 147). This led the Navy to contract with <name type="pname">Fürst</name> to cut dies for the medal to Captain <name type="pname">William Bainbridge</name>. Meanwhile, <name type="pname">Reich's</name> eyesight deteriorated sufficiently to affect his work (<name type="pname">Witham</name> 1993, 18, 19); his portrait die for Captain <name type="pname">Stephen Decatur</name> was not accepted by the Navy. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> was contracted to make a new portrait die and also made a new reverse after <name type="pname">Reich's</name> shattered while being hardened. After completing the Bainbridge and Decatur dies, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> wrote Navy Secretary Crowninshield asking that the Navy "make a regular contract with me for the other medals which remain to be executed" (<name type="pname">Witham</name> 1993, 18). Whether or not he obtained such a comprehensive contract, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> ultimately did all the remaining medal dies for the Navy awards and then did all the dies for the Army awards. Creditable workmanship and the unavailability of <name type="pname">Reich</name> made <name type="pname">Fürst</name> the artist of choice for official medals. In 1817, in addition to working on the War of 1812 awards, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> engraved the Indian Peace Medal portraits of President <name type="pname">James Monroe</name>. He later did the Indian Peace Medal portraits for all the presidents through <name type="pname">Van Buren</name>.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Reich's</name> disability caused Mint Director <name type="pname">Robert Patterson</name> to seek another assistant for Mint engraver <name type="pname">Scot</name>. An offer was made to <name type="pname">Christian Gobrecht</name>, which <name type="pname">Gobrecht</name> refused (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 109). Curiously, there is no evidence that <name type="pname">Patterson</name> gave any consideration to
<pb n="21"/>
                  <name type="pname">Fürst</name>, who continued to make medal dies under contract to the War and Navy Departments. Perhaps these contractual obligations were too heavy to allow <name type="pname">Fürst</name> to work at the Mint; he had then only begun work on the dies for the War of 1812 medals, a project that would occupy him for some years. I believe it likely that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> also was not interested in the assistant's position at the smaller salary.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Scot</name> died in late 1823. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> clearly believed that he was rightfully <name type="pname">Scot's</name> successor, but seems to have realized that he faced competition for the post. I have elsewhere suggested (<name type="pname">Neuzil</name> 1991, 140) that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> engraved the dies for the <name type="pname">Monroe</name> presidential medal (medal 44 in the appendix) in an effort to promote himself for the engraver's position he had sought for so long. However, <name type="pname">William Kneass</name> was appointed the Mint's new engraver based on the recommendation of his personal friend, Chief Coiner <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name> (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 109). Compounding the injury to <name type="pname">Fürst</name>, <name type="pname">Kneass's</name> appointment roughly coincided with the end of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> lucrative contracts for War of 1812 medal dies, which were essentially completed the following year. The fact that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> did not obtain the appointment as Mint engraver evidently incited him to petition the Congressional Committee on Claims for compensation. Asserting that he had been promised the position of Mint engraver before his arrival in 1807, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> asked the Committee for back pay (Proceedings n.d.). He explained the filing of his grievance 15 years after the fact by claiming unfamiliarity with American law and custom although in reality he may have been mollified by the income he enjoyed from the War of 1812 contracts. The petition was rejected, allegedly because no written record existed of <name type="pname">Appleton's</name> original offer (Proceedings n.d.).</p>
               <p>In 1835 <name type="pname">Kneass</name> suffered a stroke. <name type="pname">Gobrecht</name> this time accepted the assistant's position (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 171), and when <name type="pname">Kneass</name> died in 1840, assumed the mantle of engraver. Probably seeing himself in direct competition with <name type="pname">Fürst</name>, Gobrecht had actively promoted himself for the engraver's position (<name type="pname">Breen</name> 1988, 433). <name type="pname">Fürst</name>, by then in his late fifties, returned to <name type="place">Europe</name>.</p>
               <p>Although <name type="pname">Gobrecht's</name> appointment probably was the immediate reason for <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> return to <name type="place">Europe</name>, other factors probably contributed to his decision to leave. <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> government contracts had dwindled to the point that his official work was limited to the infrequent Indian Peace Medal dies for new presidents. Even the income from these infrequent contracts was at risk. The nature of medal making and the role of medals themselves were changing fundamentally in the late 1830s. The
<pb n="22"/>
Contamin portrait lathe, purchased by the Mint in 1836, could mechanically reduce bas-relief models to make dies (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 150). The new process was much less expensive than hand-engraving, and threatened to make die engraving by hand obsolete.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> Presaging an even more fundamental change, photography was becoming practical (<name type="pname">Dibner</name> 1967, 461) and promised an alternative to medallic and other forms of miniature portraiture. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> would certainly have seen these changes as threats to his livelihood.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the Old World offered <name type="pname">Fürst</name> some respite from the forward march of technology. Following his return to <name type="place">Europe</name>, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> continued to hand-engrave medal dies for some years. <name type="pname">Forrer</name> (1904, 7:333) lists a medallist under the name "<name type="pname">Fürst</name>" who was active in <name type="place">Munich, Germany</name>, from 1841 to 1847. We can surmise that this was <name type="pname">Moritz Fürst</name> because of a <name type="place">German</name> medal dated 1841 and signed with the same letter punches <name type="pname">Fürst</name> used in <name type="place">America</name> (<ref target="#fig-7">Figure 2</ref>). <name type="pname">Forrer's</name> listing implies that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> engraved dies until about the age of 65. Nothing more is known of this phase of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> life.</p>

               <p>A die census presented in the appendix (Table 2) reveals that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> made more American medal dies than previously realized. Slightly over 100 dies can be identified that are attributable to <name type="pname">Fürst</name> while he was in <name type="place">America</name>. However, as discussed in the appendix, it is quite likely that the actual total is larger, perhaps 113 or even more.</p>
               <p>When the date of completion of a die is known or can be reasonably constrained, it has been noted in Table 2 (<name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977) and other
<pb n="23"/>
authorities noted in Table 2 are the source of most of the dates). The availability of dates for most of the dies presents the possibility of examining <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> die-making activity in a quantitative fashion. Using the information in Table 2, I have plotted by year the number of dies <name type="pname">Fürst</name> produced in <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref>. This plot shows 97 dies; it does not include seven for which the dates of completion are very uncertain, nor does it include any of several unverified dies from Table 2. When interpreting the plot, one should bear in mind that some of the completion dates are somewhat uncertain.</p>

The plot breaks down <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> production into official (US and PA) and unofficial (IO) dies (see the Appendix for a fuller explanation of these categories and identification of the dies). Replacement dies for US-24, 40, 50, and 54 are included in the plot, but dies IO-2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 27, and 30 are not included because of uncertain completion dates. Where a range of years is given in Table 2, the latest date was used, except for dies US-43, 47, 54, and 60 for which the earliest date was used.</p>

               <p>
                  <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> shows that <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> die-making fluctuated dramatically, with most of the activity after 1816 and before 1823. It was during these middle years that he executed dies for the Navy and Army awards of the War of 1812 (denoted as US and PA dies in <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> and Table 2). The Navy awards were his dominant activity from 1817 through 1820. The Army awards, nearly all of which were done during 1821 through
<pb n="24"/>
1824, account for the second prominent peak in 1822. The plot implies that in 1817 he made 17 dies (including replacements of three dies that broke during hardening), an average of one die every three weeks. The year 1822 is shown being nearly as busy, with 15 dies (counting one replacement die).<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> Between the beginning of 1817 and the end of 1824 the count is at least 58 dies (including replacements), an average of more than 7 dies per year. This eight-year stretch, roughly one fourth of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> time in <name type="place">America</name>, accounts for over half of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> known output of medal dies. In contrast, the years before 1817 and after 1825 are distinguished by both lower overall rates of die production and production of most of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> unofficial or nongovernment dies (denoted as IO in <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> and Table 2).</p>
               <p>Payments cited by <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977) suggest that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> typically received between $300 and $400 per die. The amount varied according to the difficulty of the die and other expenses involved. Interestingly, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> asked more for battle scenes than for portraits, presumably reflecting the engraving time required. Probably included in the fees were the cost of materials, polishing the dies after hardening (Proceedings n.d.) and, in some cases, travel in order to make portrait sketches. Assuming that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> completed about 100 dies that actually provided income,<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> his fees from this activity were in the neighborhood of $35,000 over about 33 years, or close to an average of $1,000 per year. During 1817 through 1824, the busy middle years of his career, <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> annual fees from diemaking averaged, by this analysis, between $2,000 and $3,000. By comparison, <name type="pname">Reich's</name> average annual income from 1800 to 1817 is estimated to have been about $700 (<name type="pname">Witham</name> 1993, 46).<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Reliable data on wages and income are sparse for this period, but it appears that in 1830 wages to laborers were about $0.75 to $1.00 per day while craftsmen and land-owning farmers had incomes of about $1.00 to $1.50 per day (<name type="pname">Larkin</name> 1979, 2; <name type="pname">Kuiken</name> 1997). <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> income from a single die thus exceeded a laborer's earnings for a year, and his average annual income between 1817 and 1824 was nearly ten times that amount. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> also had income, which may have been significant, from other activities (see next section). All told, he enjoyed a rather substantial, although unsteady, income. However, even during his most active years, <name type="pname">Fürst</name> reportedly lived beyond his means. Referring to the period 1821-23, <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 112) states that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> "apparently spent his funds far faster than they were received, thus fitting the classical mold of the impoverished artist. He was, nearly always, deeply in debt." The loss of the income from the War of 1812 dies, beginning in 1825,
<pb n="25"/>
must have been financially devastating to <name type="pname">Fürst</name> after eight years of relatively high income. This was undoubtedly the impetus behind <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> petition to the Committee on Claims and publication of the pamphlet detailing the claim (Proceedings n.d.) after it was rejected.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954a, 590) and <name type="pname">Albert</name> (1974) have reported that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> engraved seals and at least one die for uniform buttons. However, the fact that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> also engraved dies for decorative embellishments on silverware is largely unrecognized by numismatists. At the turn of the eighteenth century, the making of silverware was evolving toward increasing mechanization, allowing cheaper and more rapid fabrication (<name type="pname">Plaut</name> n.d., 7). Before this, <name type="pname">silversmiths</name> cast or engraved the ornamentation for silverware. Die-struck embellishments were easier to produce in quantity and often more elaborate and expressive than engraved or cast ornamentation. This presented opportunities for die-sinkers like <name type="pname">Fürst</name> to make and sell die-struck ornamentation or dies themselves to makers of silverware.</p>
               <p>I have identified five dies by <name type="pname">Fürst</name> that were used for making decorative embellishments, all made before 1817. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> probably did not make decorative dies and similar items after he became busy with the War of 1812 dies in 1817. Whether he made decorative dies after 1824, when he had largely completed the War of 1812 contracts, is not known. It is also unclear whether <name type="pname">Fürst</name> sold the decorative dies themselves, or sold the embellishments that he made from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> known decorative dies are of two types. The simplest was a cylinder die with a repeating grapevine pattern that produced a decorative silver strip. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> signed the die, and his signature appears about every 15.7 cm along the strip (<name type="pname">Skerry</name> 1986), indicating that the cylinder had a diameter of approximately 5 cm. Decorative silver strips from this signed die were incorporated into a tea service now at the Yale Museum of Decorative Arts in <name type="place">New Haven, Connecticut</name> (<ref target="#fig-9">Figure 4</ref>) and a ewer now at the <name type="place">Winterthur</name> Museum in <name type="place">Wilmington, Delaware</name>. These pieces have been dated to between 1810 and 1817 (Yale University Art Gallery 1984). Decorative strips from the same die also appear on a silver tea service dated to circa 1835 (<name type="pname">Christie's</name> 1988, 40).</p>
               <p>Decorative dies of the second type were used to impress designs on square silver panels or sheets. The panels were applied to flat surfaces on silverware. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> cut at least four such dies, comprised of two different

compositions in large (56 by 56 mm) and small (34 by 34 mm) versions. One design features <name type="pname">Zeus</name> as an eagle tended by his daughter <name type="pname">Hebe</name> (<ref target="#fig-10">Figure 5</ref>) and the other is a classically-garbed female leaning on a rock. Panels struck from these dies were used to decorate a silver tea service (<ref target="#fig-11">Figure 6</ref>), made in <name type="place">New York</name> about 1810 (<name type="pname">Southeby's</name> 1985), that is now in a private collection. The panels are not fastened, but slide into slots on the sides of the pieces.</p>

               <p>Because the decorative dies carry classical or purely decorative motifs, they cannot clearly be assigned an American origin. The embellishments first appear on American silverware dated between 1810 and 1817, and it is possible that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> cut the dies before coming to <name type="place">America</name>. However, I believe it likely that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> made the dies after coming to <name type="place">America</name>, and probably while establishing his engraving business in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>.</p>
               <p>Other decorative dies by <name type="pname">Fürst</name> may exist. <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954a, 592) reports that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> made presentation swords under contract to the State of <name type="place">New York</name> for several War of 1812 commanders. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> may have engraved dies to produce decorative elements for these swords and their scabbards.</p>

from many earlier coins, including English and pre-Federal American issues that feature seated goddesses or allegorical female figures. For example, the late eighteenth-century coppers of <name type="place">Vermont</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> crudely portray a seated female figure with a shield and liberty cap on a pole.

               </head>
               <p>In terms of design, <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> medals are a mixed bag of his own and others' work. Most of his dies for War of 1812 Congressional awards copied portraits, battle scenes and allegorical scenes by graphic artists, both obscure and well known. Reverses for many of the Army medals, for example, were designed by the painter <name type="pname">Thomas Sully</name> (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 112). Other dies, most notably the Indian Peace Medal portraits, were composed as well as engraved by <name type="pname">Fürst</name>. The presidential portraits on the Peace Medals are especially noteworthy and valuable as they were based on <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> life studies of these men (see, for example, <name type="pname">Prucha</name> 1971, 101-103).</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Marvin Sadik</name>, writing in 1977 as Director of the National Portrait Gallery (<name type="pname">Sadik</name> 1977, 9), described <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> contribution to American medallic art by referring to his "brilliant series of twenty six [medals] for the military heroes of the War of 1812." He went on to state that:
<q>[i] n the sustained excellence evident in the work of <name type="pname">Reich</name> and <name type="pname">Fürst</name>, which forms another link in the great tradition established by <name type="pname">Pisanello</name>, one sees a worthy continuation of the high standards set for American medallic art by the trio of Frenchmen [<name type="pname">Duvivier, Dupre</name>, and <name type="pname">Gatteaux</name>] who produced our earliest medals.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A less enthusiastic evaluation was provided by <name type="pname">Vermeule</name> (1971, 39) in his book <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Art in <name type="place">America</name>.</hi> Vermeule mentions <name type="pname">Fürst</name> once in passing, referring to the "Napoleonic pictorialism and patriotic fussiness of <name type="pname">Reich</name> and <name type="pname">Fürst</name>."</p>
               <p>However one views <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> work, there is no denying that his prolific output of dies made him the leading figure in American medallic art of the early nineteenth century. Medals from most of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> dies, including all of the War of 1812 and Indian Peace series, have been
<pb n="31"/>
restruck and avidly collected since the mid-nineteenth century.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Many, in fact, continue to be periodically restruck from copy dies and sold by the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint as part of a series of "national" medals (<name type="pname">Failor</name> and <name type="pname">Hayden</name> 1972). His dominance of early nineteenth century medallic art in <name type="place">America</name> has not brought <name type="pname">Fürst</name> a corresponding level of recognition in American numismatic circles. I hope that the information presented here will provide a framework for the fuller study that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> deserves.</p>

            <p>Ninety-two medal dies can be definitely attributed to <name type="pname">Fürst</name> during his American period, but a strong case can be made that the actual number is over 100 and possibly as many as 113 or more.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> Uncertainty in the die count results from problems of attribution and the likelihood that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> made some dies that are presently lost. Sixty-one different medals (not including sporadic mulings) are known to have been struck from the dies.</p>
            <p>This appendix presents both a tabulated census of the dies and an illustrated catalogue of medals from the dies. The compilation includes several medals (representing 16 individual dies), that were not included in <name type="pname">Chamberlain's</name> (1954b) catalogue of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> work.</p>

               <p>Table 2 tallies all American medal dies that can be attributed to <name type="pname">Fürst</name>. The tabulation is based on my own observations as well as published and other authoritative sources as cited. The presentation of the dies is not chronological because their exact sequence (as opposed to their year of completion) is poorly known. Rather, the dies are arranged in four broad generic categories. First are dies done under contract to the <name type="place">United States</name> (designated by <name type="place">US</name>-numbers), comprised of presidential portrait dies for the Indian Peace Medal series and Congressionally-mandated award medals for the War of 1812. Indian Peace Medal dies and Army Congressional award dies were made under contract to the War Department whereas Navy Congressional award dies were made under contract to the Navy Department. Second are dies for medals mandated by the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> legislature and made under contract to the Commonwealth of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> (designated by <name type="place">PA</name>) as awards for the Battle of <name type="place">Lake Erie</name> in the War of 1812. Listed third are dies made for individuals, organizations, and as speculative ventures (designated by IO). Dies for individuals (such as IO-17 and 18) and organizations (such as IO-25 and 26) were private commissions. Other dies (such as IO-6 and 7) apparently were ventures intended by <name type="pname">Fürst</name> for striking medals to be sold for profit.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> The fourth and last category in Table 2 comprises dies whose existence is speculative (designated by UV, indicating "unverified"); these are dies for which there is only indirect evidence (i.e. there is a written description, reference,
<pb n="33"/>
or such, but no known medal from the die or die itself).</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Attribution</hi>. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> signed nearly all of the tabulated dies (generally using letter punches<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref>), leaving no question as to their authorship. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> indicated his authorship in various ways, ranging from an explicit statement (<name type="pname">FURST</name> DESIGNED AND SCULP, on die IO-5; see medal 44) to simply his name (<name type="pname">FURST</name> or <name type="pname">FURST F.</name>) or, on some dies, only the initial F. Eight dies included in Table 2 are unsigned (PA-3, 4, IO-1, 2, 24, 26, 27, 30). For most of these, I have relied on comparisons of engraving style or letter punches to attribute them to <name type="pname">Fürst</name>. The exception is die IO-2 (<name type="pname">John Adams</name>; medal 42), which is linked to <name type="pname">Fürst</name> anectdotally, as I describe in more detail below. Although attribution is never certain for unsigned dies, there is little question that most of the unsigned dies in Table 2 were engraved by <name type="pname">Fürst</name>. Why didn't <name type="pname">Fürst</name> sign them? Some dies, such as inscription die IO-24 (medal 55) and wreath dies IO-26, 27, 30 (medals 56 and 58), probably had too little space or were simple enough that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> declined to sign them. In the case of other dies (PA-3,4, IO-1,2; medals 40, 41 and 42) the lack of a signature is perplexing.</p>
               <p>The die memorializing <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-1; medal 41) is especially interesting with regard to the problem of attribution. This unsigned die, almost certainly by <name type="pname">Fürst</name>, features a bust of <name type="place">Washington</name> on a pedestal flanked by figures representing an Indian and a classical female. It exhibits several strong stylistic links to <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> known dies. The modelling of the human figures, especially their musculature and feet, is quite characteristic of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> work. The stance of the Indian closely matches that of a figure on die US-20, the reverse of the Congressional award to <name type="pname">William Henry Harrison</name> (medal 16), and the rendering of the tree branches on the pedestal matches that on die IO-11, one of the reverses of the <name type="pname">Benjamin Rush</name> medals (see medal 47). Attribution of this die to <name type="pname">Fürst</name> resolves a longstanding problem. <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b, 937) noted that an art exhibit in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in 1817 listed a medal of <name type="place">Washington</name> by <name type="pname">Fürst</name> and added that the medal was unknown to her. Apparently medal no. 41 (die IO-1) is the medal in question.</p>
               <p>Die IO-2 (see medal 42), an unsigned portrait die of <name type="pname">John Adams</name>, is atypical of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> work, the bust being rather stiff and not particularly natural. Differences are apparent, for example, with <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> more

lifelike portrayal of <name type="pname">Adams's</name> son, <name type="pname">John Quincy Adams</name>, on Indian Peace Medal dies US-4, 5, 6 (medals 4, 5, 6). However, as <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 31) notes, both <name type="pname">Franklin Peale</name> and <name type="pname">J.R. Snowden</name> explicitly attributed the die to <name type="pname">Fürst</name>. Peale was the <name type="place">Mint's</name> Chief Coiner from 1839 to 1854 and <name type="pname">Snowden</name> was Director from 1853 to 1861. Peale was associated with the <name type="place">Mint</name> before 1839 and thus probably had first-hand knowledge of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> work, lending credence to his attribution. Contrary evidence comes from an 1871 auction sale (<name type="pname">Bangs, Merwin</name> 1871, 69) of the collection of <name type="pname">William F. Packer</name>, a former <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> governor who died in 1870. The sale contained a <name type="pname">John Adams</name> medal (of the correct diameter for IO-2) with the cataloguer's note:
<q>I find the following memorandum in regard to this Medal in the handwriting of the late Governor Packer:</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="italic">During the Presidency of the <name type="pname">Elder Adams</name>, the die for this medal was cut</hi> and submitted to the government, but not accepted. The few Medals struck - some four or five in number - have remained in the possesion of the artist's family until very recently.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The emphasis is mine. If the die was cut during the elder <name type="pname">Adams's</name> presidency, which ended in 1801, it could not have been done by <name type="pname">Fürst</name> (but could have been done by <name type="place">Mint</name> engraver <name type="pname">Robert Scot</name>). Thus, the attribution of die IO-2 to <name type="pname">Fürst</name> is uncertain. If <name type="pname">Fürst</name> did engrave IO-2, the style must echo that of an earlier portrait, perhaps a painting, that served as the model.</p>
               <p>A number of questions surround the dies for the naval award medals authorized by the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> legislature. Two of the four dies apparently used to strike the original medals are unsigned. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> signed dies PA-1 and PA-2 (medal 39) but the unsigned dies PA-3 and PA-4 (medal 40) also appear to be his work. The unsigned portrait die of Captain <name type="pname">Oliver H. Perry</name> (PA-3) is a matter of curiosity because it features a different rendering of <name type="pname">Perry</name> than the signed die but carries the same legends in the same arrangement. It is very typical of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> style. Likewise, the rendering of the boughs tied with a ribbon on PA-4 is quite reminiscent of the design on die US-32, <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> signed reverse of the Congressional award to <name type="pname">Winfield Scott</name> (medal 22). I believe that both of the unsigned dies (PA-3 and PA-4, medal 40) are by <name type="pname">Fürst</name>.</p>
               <p>Unsigned dies IO-26, 27, and 30 are comprised of relatively simple wreath designs used as the reverses on award medals presented by the American Institute and the Mechanics Institute (medals 56 and 58). The two organizations shared at least one reverse die (IO-27), which is found paired with both obverse dies (IO-25 and IO-29). Die IO-26 is

apparently the earliest reverse and clearly seems to be <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> work. The wreath of boughs tied with a bow is also quite similar to the wreath on the reverse of the <name type="pname">Winfield Scott</name> medal (medal 22). IO-27 is a later die, but stylistically similar and probably also by <name type="pname">Fürst</name>. The authorship of IO-30, a still later reverse die, is questionable. Unlike the oak leaves on IO-26 and 27, which were made with a punch, those on IO-30 are individually engraved. Die IO-30 is quite possibly the work of another engraver copying <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> original design.</p>
               <p>Problems of attribution extend to the provenance of the dies. My intent is to include only "American" medal dies in the tabulation, that is, dies made by <name type="pname">Fürst</name> while he was in <name type="place">America</name>. <name type="pname">Fürst</name> may have engraved medal dies before coming to <name type="place">America</name> and he certainly did so after returning to <name type="place">Europe</name> (see main text). In most cases the dies in Table 2 are clearly from his American period, but for a few (dies IO-31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36) an American origin is disputable because foreign subjects or interests are represented. Inclusion of these dies in Table 2 reflects the fact that they appear to date from <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> American period. They may represent commissions from foreign interests, perhaps diplomatic or trade missions, that were in the <name type="place">United States</name> at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Intended Die Pairings.</hi> The intended pairing is firmly established for most of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> dies, and is indicated in Table 2. For example, although the dies for the Army medals of the War of 1812 were muled extensively at the <name type="place">Mint</name> during the latter half of the nineteenth century, the intended pairing for these dies is well documented (even if it is not always self-evident). In a few instances, however, dies appear to have been muled so consistently that the mulings have come to be accepted as the intended pairings. In other cases, it is not clear what the intended pairing was or, indeed, whether mate dies ever existed.</p>
               <p>The confusion surrounding the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Naval award dies (PA-1, 2, 3, 4; medals 39 and 40) extends to their intended pairings. <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 166) catalogues four medals representing all possible obversereverse combinations of the two obverse with the two reverse dies. However, <name type="pname">Julian</name> also states that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> engraved only one obverse and two reverse dies for the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> medals. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the signed obverse die (PA-1; medal 39) is known only from two gold medals in institutional collections where it is paired with signed reverse die PA-2: I know of no other confirmed pairings for PA-1 (including the pairing with PA-4 that Julian speculatively catalogues). <name type="place">The Pennsylvania</name> legislature authorized gold medals for Captain <name type="pname">Perry</name>,

Master Commandant <name type="pname">Elliot</name>, and a Lieutenant <name type="pname">John J. Yarnall</name>, and silver medals of a distinct design for <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> citizens who served in the enlisted ranks in the Battle of <name type="place">Lake Erie</name> (<name type="pname">Ayers</name> 1972, 7). Perhaps the signed obverse was intended to be paired with both reverses for the two different awards. If so, how does one explain the unsigned obverse? The signed obverse die may have failed or had to be retired after a few uses, explaining the lack of restrikes from it and the need for a second portrait die. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the signed obverse was already buckled when <name type="pname">Perry's</name> gold medal was struck. Additional confusion about die pairing probably arose because unsigned obverse die PA-3 was extensively paired with signed reverse die PA-2 by the <name type="place">Mint</name> to make restrikes in the late nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> unofficial die portraying President <name type="pname">Madison</name> (IO-3) has been extensively muled. This die, paired with an unsigned reverse die, was used to strike medals (number 43) in the 1860s or earlier.<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> This pairing is the only one known for IO-3 and has come to be accepted by many as the intended one. However, multiple lines of evidence indicate that it is a mule. First, stylistic comparisons clearly indicate that the reverse die is not by <name type="pname">Fürst</name>. Second, the legend within the wreath, which refers to political issues during the War of 1812, is incompatible with the surrounding legend INDUSTRY BRINGS PLENTY. The design itself, which features agricultural implements, is at odds with the central inscription.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Third, the reverse die was reduced from a larger diameter to one matching that of IO-3. The reduction is apparent from the position of the eagle's wingtips, which extend through the border to the edge of the die (<ref target="#fig-17">Figure A1</ref>). Reduction is also indicated by prior cracking of the die below the word PLENTY, which caused that lettering to be especially close to the new edge (<ref target="#fig-17">Figure A1</ref>). Finally, by the time known medals were struck, the obverse die (IO-3) had been crudely lapped to conceal damage. The lapping obliterated part of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> name on the banner below the bust. All of these observations lead to the conclusion that the reverse die used with IO-3 was not its intended mate, but was concocted to permit restriking the <name type="pname">Madison</name> portrait from an impaired die. The intended pairing for die IO-3 is thus unknown.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">John Adams</name> "Indian Peace Medal" (medal no. 42, which uses unsigned portrait die IO-2) is also, strictly speaking, a mule. It is not a true Indian Peace Medal because the <name type="pname">Reich</name> Peace and Friendship reverse was made in 1809 (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 29), well after <name type="pname">Adams</name> held office. <name type="place">Mint</name> Director <name type="pname">J.

(<name type="pname">Prucha</name> 1971, 137). The intended pairing is thus uncertain.</p>

As seen here, (1) the eagle's wingtip extends through the border to the edge of the die and (2) the word PLENTY, with tangential cracks beneath it, is closer to the edge than BRINGS. Both observations indicate that the die was once larger and was reduced to mate with IO-3.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>Two of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> dies are known only from uniface medals. The dies portraying <name type="pname">George</name>
                  <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-1; medal 41) and <name type="pname">Gershom Seixas</name> (IO-19; medal 52) are not known to have been paired with any die (<name type="pname">Stack's</name> 1996, 40; <name type="pname">Friedenberg</name> 1990). It is possible that no mates were ever made for these dies. This is implied for the <name type="place">Washington</name> die by an entry in an 1817 art exhibit catalogue (cited by <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> 1954b, 937) that mentions the <name type="place">Washington</name> portrait but does not mention a reverse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Missing dies.</hi> Various lines of evidence suggest that I have not identified all of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> American medal dies. First, as shown by Figure 3 in the main text, relatively few dies are known from the early and late portions of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> American career; he had ample time to produce more dies than are now documented. Second, some of Fürst's dies are known to us through only one, two, or a few medals. In particular, dies that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> made as speculative ventures typically left few surviving medals. Apparently, if sufficient subscriptions were not obtained, a medal would not be struck in large quantities, or not struck at all. This may explain the rarity of medals from the <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-1; medal 41), <name type="pname">Monroe</name> (IO-4, 5; medal 44), and <name type="pname">John Q. Adams</name> inaugural (IO-6, 7; medal 45) dies, and the lack of original strikings from the <name type="pname">Madison</name> (IO-3; medal 43) and <name type="pname">Seixas</name> (IO-19; medal 52) dies.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> These medals

could easily have been lost to posterity and, by extension, it would not be surprising if others have in fact been lost. Third, indirect evidence exists for several specific dies that are currently unknown. Nine candidates for such missing dies are listed in Table 2 as "unverified" (UV).</p>
               <p>The listings of UV-1 and 2 and UV-3 and 4 are prompted by exhibit catalogues of 1811 and 1829 cited by <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b, 937). The first refers to "a medal of <name type="pname">William Penn</name>," which is unknown today. The second lists a "Cast of a medal of President <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson</name>, on reverse the Battle of <name type="place">New Orleans</name>." Unlike the Congressional award to <name type="pname">Jackson</name> (dies US-21, 22; medal 17), which features an allegorical scene on the reverse, the catalogue explicitly refers to a depiction of the battle. No such medal is known today.<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> The word <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> in the catalogue entry suggests a trial impression rather than a struck medal; perhaps no struck medals were made.</p>
               <p>The unverified die depicting Captain <name type="pname">Jesse Elliot's</name> capture of the British ships <hi rend="italic">Detroit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> (UV-5) is listed based on an unusual piece of evidence. <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b, 938) located and reproduced an early nineteenth century painting that appears to depict <hi rend="italic">two different gold</hi> medals awarded to Captain <name type="pname">Jesse Elliot</name> (<ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref>). The obverse of the Congressional award (die US-46) is shown together with its intended reverse depicting the Battle of <name type="place">Lake Erie</name> (die US-56) to the left and in the center of <ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref>. However, an undocumented reverse (die UV-5) is also shown, as seen on the right in <ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref>. Reverse die UV-5 may have been mated with the regular portrait obverse for striking an award medal for <name type="pname">Elliot</name> from the Commonwealth of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>.</p>
               <p>I also considered mateless dies to be evidence for missing dies. The <name type="pname">Madison</name> obverse die (IO-3), which is known only from mulings with an unrelated reverse die, is a good example. Did <name type="pname">Fürst</name> make a reverse die, now missing, to pair with IO-3? I believe it likely because he cut an elaborate reverse die (IO-5) for a similar portrait die of <name type="pname">Monroe</name> (IO-4; see medal 44). Dies that are now missing may also have served as reverses for the <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-1), <name type="pname">John Adams</name> (IO-2), and <name type="pname">Gershom Seixas</name> (IO-19) portrait dies, as indicated in Table 2.</p>

               <p>Damage to the dies, when present, is noted under "Comments" in Table 2. Notes on damage are based on personal examination of many medals. Table 2 reveals a surprising fact with respect to <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> official

(US and PA) dies: most of the dies for the Navy awards exhibit some sort of damage, whereas few of the Army or Indian Peace Medal dies do. More than 60% (17/28) of the Naval dies exhibit damage (or had to be replaced), whereas this is true of fewer than 10% of the Army dies (2/22) and the Indian Peace Medal dies (1/12). The damage to the Naval dies is usually buckling and cracks. The buckling occurs as a "sinking" of the die that causes it to become mildly concave and the field of the struck medal to be correspondingly convex. The sinking is generally uneven and cracks are often located along the trace of maximum buckling. Other types of damage evident on the Naval dies include stray cracks and indentations and even corrosion that may have occurred during acid "frosting" of the relief.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref>

               <p>Apparently, most of the damage occurred during the initial handling and hardening of the dies, rather than developing later in the die's life (although the damage often worsened with use). This can be established because the Naval award dies were used in a very consistent manner: first a single gold medal was struck for the honoree, and then a limited

number of silver medals were struck for his officers (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, xxii; 3 gold medals were struck in the case of the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> award to <name type="pname">Perry</name>). Original gold and silver medals therefore display very early die states. In examining several original gold and silver award medals from the Naval series, I have found that damage known from copper restrikes of the medals <hi rend="italic">generally is also present on the original gold and silver strikings.</hi> The gold medal presented to Captain <name type="pname">Oliver H. Perry</name> by <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> and now in the collection of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Naval Academy is an excellent example; this medal was presumably the first struck and shows that both dies were strongly buckled.</p>
               <p>Buckling and cracks occurred during hardening of the die (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 152), which required heating and rapid cooling by quenching in water (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 83; <name type="pname">Landis</name>, 1997). In several instances (US-24, 35, 49, 50, 52, 54), <name type="pname">Julian</name> cites contemporary documents that mention damage caused by hardening. Other types of damage, such as stray indentations, were apparently due to careless handling before hardening.</p>
               <p>Why did the Naval dies suffer more damage than the Army and the Peace Medal dies? They were the first large group of medal dies to be delivered to the <name type="place">Mint</name> for hardening and striking, and inexperience with such large dies may have led to problems. Prior to the large influx of Naval War of 1812 dies, <name type="place">Mint</name> personnel had worked mostly with small coinage dies. <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 113) reports that <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name>, the <name type="place">Mint's</name> Chief Coiner, was often very slow to harden medal dies. Risk of damage to the dies may have caused <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> to adopt a very deliberate approach to hardening. By the time the Army award dies and most of the Indian Peace medal dies were delivered to the <name type="place">Mint</name>, <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> had more experience with the quirks of large medal dies. It is also conceivable that the War Department (which contracted for both the Army's War of 1812 dies and the Indian Peace Medal dies) procured superior steel for its dies.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Medals from <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> dies are described and illustrated in the catalogue that follows. The arrangement corresponds, as closely as possible, to the listing of dies in Table 2. Cross-references to <name type="pname">Loubat</name> (1878), <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977), <name type="pname">Harkness</name> (1989), <name type="pname">Brown</name> (1980), and <name type="pname">Eimer</name> (1987) catalogue numbers are provided, while cross-references from <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977) numbers to the present catalogue numbers are provided in Table 1.</p>
               <p>The die pairings represented here are generally the intended ones. However, in some cases (which are noted) the die pairing is the most commonly encountered but not the intended one. Numerous mulings, particularly of the dies for Army Congressional awards, are known to exist<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> but are not listed.</p>
               <p>All medals illustrated are from the original dies. Note that all of the official (<name type="place">US</name> and <name type="place">PA</name>) dies as well as some of the unofficial (IO) dies have been copied and that early strikings from copy dies are often confused with those from the original dies. The best diagnostics of original and copy dies are the style and placement of the lettering.</p>

<q>On the reverse die the 5 in JULY 5 is punched over a 6, and SEP. 17 is punched over AUG. 15. The same overpunches can be seen on medals to <name type="pname">Miller</name> (die US-26), <name type="pname">Porter</name> (US-28), and <name type="pname">Scott</name> (US-32). Evidently, there was confusion about the dates of the Battles of <name type="place">Chippewa</name> and <name type="place">Fort Erie</name>. In the case of <name type="place">Fort Erie</name>, there were two significant actions - one on August 15, 1814, in which Generals <name type="pname">Edmund P. Gaines</name> and <name type="pname">Eleazer W. Ripley</name> participated, and one on September 17, 1814, in which, in addition to <name type="pname">Ripley</name>, Generals <name type="pname">Brown</name>, <name type="pname">Miller</name>, <name type="pname">Porter</name>, and <name type="pname">Scott</name> participated (<name type="pname">Hickey</name>, 1989). Apparently, the earlier date was inadvertantly used for those in the later action and then corrected. These overpunches were described by <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name> in the catalogue of the Dreyfus Sale by <name type="pname">Bowers</name> and <name type="pname">Merena</name> (1986).</q>

The result is that the reference to the battles at <name type="place">Erie</name> appears on a raised "step" on the struck medals and <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> signature is, unlike on other medals in this series, above the ground line. In addition, careful examination reveals that NOVEMBER was punched into the die fully spelled out before it was realized that abbreviation to NOVEMB. was necessary to preserve the symmetry of the inscription.</p>

                  <p>This unsigned medal is clearly by <name type="pname">Fürst</name>; the allegorical figures duplicate his style on other medals. Apparently, this is the medal mentioned in a catalogue of an art exhibit in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in 1817 and noted but not identified by <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b, 937).

                     <name type="place">Washington</name> Benevolent Society medal. This rare medal (four examples are said to be known) exists only in the form of uniface struck silver shells (Stacks 1996).</p>

                  <p>Although this pairing of dies is considered the intended one for the obverse (and may be), this is not an Indian Peace Medal.

                  <p>This uncommon silver medal is encountered with various engraved award inscriptions. The busy obverse design is crowded with symbolism. It probably postdates the American Institute obverse, having adopted the motif of the latter and added yet more symbolic elements. Wreath reverses IO-26, IO-27 and possibly IO-30 were used for the American Institute Instutute medal (no. 56 above). The pairing with IO-26 listed here is speculative.</p>

                     <p>The circumstances under which <name type="pname">Fürst</name> came to <name type="place">America</name> and his interactions with the <name type="place">U.S</name>. Mint form a troubling backdrop to his entire career. Did <name type="place">Appleton</name> overstep his authority, was there a miscommunication between him and Mint Director <name type="pname">Patterson</name>, or did <name type="pname">Fürst</name> misconstrue the actual conditions of <name type="place">Appleton's</name> offer? Part of the answer may lie in the change in Mint leadership in 1805. As early as 1801 the Mint's third Director, <name type="pname">Elias Boudinot</name>, had resisted hiring <name type="pname">Reich</name> (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 107). In July 1805 <name type="pname">Patterson</name> replaced <name type="pname">Boudinot</name> and in 1807 wrote <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> for permission to hire <name type="pname">Reich</name>. In his letter, <name type="pname">Patterson</name> stated that engraver <name type="pname">Robert Scot</name> was "so far advanced in life, that he cannot very long be expected to continue in his labors" (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 108). Perhaps <name type="pname">Patterson</name> planned on <name type="pname">Scot's</name> retirement and asked <name type="place">U.S.</name> officials, including <name type="place">Appleton</name>, to help recruit a replacement. In his meeting with <name type="pname">Fürst</name>, <name type="pname">Patterson</name> may have suggested that <name type="pname">Scot's</name> position would soon be available. If so, he greatly underestimated Scot's tenacity; <name type="pname">Scot</name> remained the Mint's engraver until his death 16 years later.</p>

                     <p>The two prominent peaks that appear in Figure 3 may, to some extent, be artifacts of inaccuracy in die completion dates. <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 112) asserts that <name type="pname">Fürst</name> worked more or less at full capacity on the War of 1812 dies once he began work on the entire series in 1817. Some dies believed completed in 1817 may actually have been completed in 1818, and some listed as completed in 1822 may fall in 1821. Even so, <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> maximum output probably was still about 10 dies per year, substantially more than <name type="pname">Reich</name> was able to accomplish. <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name> of the Gallery Mint, who works today as a hand engraver of dies, believes an accomplished engraver capable of hand-engraving more than 10 complex dies per year (<name type="pname">Landis</name> 1997).</p>

                     <p>It is very likely that several dies made on speculation, that is, in hope of profiting from the sale of medals, brought <name type="pname">Fürst</name> little, if any, income.

                     <p>In making this comparison it should be noted that the making of medal dies was distinct from <name type="pname">Reich's</name> Mint duties (making coinage dies) and brought him additional income.

                     <p>Restrikes of <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> medals were in such demand in the late nineteenth century that the dies often were not robust enough to make the number of medals (typically on the order of 100) needed to supply collectors of that era. Several failed, requiring the Mint to make copy dies by mechanical means. Some of the copy dies made by <name type="pname">Charles Barber</name> carry both <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> name and the initials C.B. Others are much more deceptive, and the medals from them are easily confused with those from the original dies. Lettering on the copy dies had to be repunched, and the style and positioning of the lettering (including <name type="pname">Fürst's</name> name) allow the copy dies to be distinguished from the originals. However, distinguishing between original and early copy dies requires experience, and because of this, collectors should exercise caution.</p>

The portrait, which features <name type="pname">Jackson</name> in civilian attire, is reminiscent of that on the middle-size and small Indian Peace Medals (dies US-8 and 9; medals 8 and 9). However, the engraving is much too crudely done to be the work of <name type="pname">Fürst</name>.

            <p>Over the years many medal enthusiasts have had the occasion to come across what appear to be a country's orders or decorations but which, finally, and after considerable frustration, turn out to be distinctions awarded by a fraternal order.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> They are not the less collectable, but certainly are less identifiable than the issues of <name type="place">sovereign states</name>.</p>

            <p>The medals of secret<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> and ritualistic<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> organizations have never received the attention in numismatic studies that the subject deserves (<name type="pname">Morris</name> 1991; <name type="pname">Anonymous</name> 1991, 1; <name type="pname">Peterson</name> 1993). Considering how widespread they are, involving all kinds of people and many countries,<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref>numismatists might give more attention to this aspect of medal scholarship.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> There are a bewildering number of these groups, ranging from those such as the Moose and Elks and Eagles whose animal names at least result in visual clues for disciphering the medal's significance, to organizations like the Odd Fellows and the Orange Order whose symbols are incomprehensible to the public and whose awards' significance defies easy interpretation.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly the most widespread and perplexing source of fraternal medals is Freemasonry. The assistance in identification that the
<pb n="121"/>
Masons themselves can provide is as spotty as the parson's egg. There are some excellent studies, albeit in somewhat obscure publications, such as Anonymous 1997, Wheeler 1992, Wheeler 1996. But much awaits research.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Freemasons in their own discussions often blur the distinctions between medals and other commemorative material such as identification pins (<name type="pname">Cubbison</name>, 90-91). The word "jewel" is used somewhat indiscriminately by them to describe Masonic items, and indeed the principal study group for Masonic medals and associated objects is simply called <hi rend="italic">Jewels of the Craft.</hi> The problem is compounded by the fact that few public or university libraries take seriously the collecting of material on the Masons, so the serious researcher must get permission to use Masonic archives and libraries, which is sometimes difficult. A number of these date from the nineteenth century and have large holdings not only of journals and books but of medals. An idea of what these libraries contain is indicated by the classifications of the Library of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite in <name type="pname">Washington</name>, which dates back to 1888 and even then had more than eight thousand volumes. There are sections for Masonry in more than seventy countries, and categories include philosophy and symbolism, church and state, paraphernalia, glassware, benevolent and educational institutions, hospitals, cemeteries, architecture, poetry and drama, humor and satire, and women in Masonry.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>While other fraternal orders claim hoary parentages which are dubious, there is no question but that Masonry's origins are ancient. They are also controversial (<name type="pname">Rich</name> 1993, 45), partly because some Masons are fond of embroidering the society's quite long history and extending its genealogy further back, to King <name type="pname">Alfred</name> or even <name type="pname">Adam</name>.</p>

            <p>While there do not appear to be any Masonic medals surviving from before the eighteenth century, there are metal objects in collections that may have been used ritualistically from as early as the sixteenth century—such as tools embellished with engravings.</p>
            <p>Masonry was widespread in the eighteenth century and is not a nineteenth-century creation like so many of the fraternal orders. Therefore its medals have an older and often considerable antiquarian interest.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> The celebrated Masonic scholar <name type="pname">Albert Mackey</name> wrote in 1917 that, "the earliest Masonic medal of which we have an authentic account is that know as the 'Freemason's ducat', which was struck at Brunswick in 1743. The number have since so greatly increased, that it would be impossible to give even a catalogue of them.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> They are struck every year by lodges to commemorate some distinguished member or some remarkable event" (<name type="pname">Mackey</name> 1917, 560).</p>
            <p>By 1767, there are reports of a proliferation of medals that were worn around the neck by members on public feast days, at funerals and other special events (<name type="pname">Mackey</name> 1917, 560). Some of these early Masonic medals, both in the <name type="place">United States</name> and <name type="place">Europe</name>, are pierced or fretted along with a certain amount of engraving, and the suggestion has been made that they were not created by specialist medal-makers but often by watchmakers: "...(they resemble) the watch 'cocks'—that is, the decorative plates, which in the old watches, carry the outer bearing of the balance-wheel. These cocks are pierced or fretted and engraved, and although only as large as a six-pence, include as many masonic emblems as many of the jewels having six times their area...The obvious suggestion is that many of the old masonic jewels of the type described were the work of watchmakers" (<name type="pname">Jones</name> 1980, 468). The establishment of Masonic supply houses in the nineteenth century brought professionalism and a degree of discipline to the field (<name type="pname">Anonymous</name> 1994b, 22).</p>
            <p>The movement's medals vary according to the particular rite involved.<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref> Any discussion of them must avoid the supposition that Masonry is a cohesive movement. That is untrue even within countries, let alone between them. Probably it is more accurate to speak of "Masonries" in the plural, for the differences are large and while in some places the Masons are conspiratorial and clandestine, elsewhere they are benign and charitable:
<q>Although Freemasonry is usually considered a singular phenomenon, it is actually a diverse and wide-ranging complex of

many different orients; orders; directorates; societies; national, provincial, and grand lodges; rites; and systems. At different times and different places Freemasonry can be politically revolutionary or reactionary, actively involved in public affairs or in retreat from the world, rational or mystic. Some orders and lodges have fallen into obscurantism, charlantry, and religious intolerance. Freemasonry has thrived in different forms in Catholic countries such as <name type="place">France</name>, <name type="place">Italy</name>, and <name type="place">Poland</name>, predominantly Protestant countries like the <name type="place">United States</name>, Orthodox countries like <name type="place">Russia</name>, Islamic countries like <name type="place">Turkey</name>, and recently in <name type="place">Israel</name>. (To this must be added the rapid revival of Freemasonry underway in <name type="place">Russia</name> and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.) Freemasons trace their founding variously to the builders of Solomon's temples, the Knights Templars of the Crusades, and the craftsmen of medieval English and European guilds (<name type="pname">Leighton</name> 1994, 28).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many Masonic rituals make specific reference to medals and orders, and quite often the ritual includes the confering of a medal on the initiate or on a member who has achieved high office or served with dedication. In the first or Entered Apprentice degree, which every Mason regardless of of ultimate rank must take, the candidate is told that membership as symbolized by the white apron is more of an honor than the Garter or the Golden Fleece (<name type="pname">Robbins</name> 1984, 64-66). In the celebrated third degree, the candidate receives a medal as part of a charade in which he thinks he has finished the initiation ceremony, only to be brought back into the lodge for the real and highly dramatic portion of the ritual.</p>

               <p>The medal of the thirteenth degree in the Ancient and Accepted Rite, Royal Arch of Solomon.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>There are a variety of Masonic medals issued in large number for the various ceremonies, such as Mark Master degree tokens and pennies. Since by the nineteenth century there were more than 1,000 different Masonic degrees or initiation ceremonies, it can be appreciated that the number of medals or tokens used in one or another of these rituals becomes numerous. All of this hoodwinking and marching around strikes the non-member as strange and it may indeed seem "obviously hokey" when "once in so often you march around your lodge room in the wake of the Grand Exalter of the Holy Mackerel and absorb a certain luster from the glittering insignia..." but that was hardly the view of the members, who as the Victorian age lengthened displayed an enormous appetite for ever more fanciful rituals (<name type="pname">Devere Allen</name>, quoted in <name type="pname">Kimmel</name> 196).</p>
            <p>Although Masons would argue vigorously that the medals conferred when receiving the various degrees are indeed honors, there is surely a distinction between them and those which are given for an actual accomplishment. Therefore a possible classification of the various medals awarded in the <name type="place">United States</name> suggests itself:</p>
            <p>I. Medals primarily used as recognition of general membership in the Masonic Order or of a branch, e.g. those incorporating Royal Arch keystones to show membership in that Masonic rite, or Shrine scimitars to show membership in that Masonic collateral body. In a similar category are some medals and medallions which are simply an indication that the member has donated to a Masonic charity (<name type="pname">Anonymous</name> 1995). When found in a dealer's odd lot box, they sometimes are pierced and were possibly used for watch chain

adornment. A British numismatist writes that "our American brethren are particularly fond of pocket pieces. These are most frequently associated with the Craft or blue lodges and have an array of masonic symbols on one side and spaces on the other side for the insertion of a brother's dates for taking the Craft degrees" (<name type="pname">Wheeler</name> 1996, 209-210). (A Revolutionary War Masonic pin was recovered from a camp site some years ago and thanks to scholarship is attributed to General <name type="pname">Otho Holland Williams</name>, who had the good fortune to be painted by Rembrandt Peale while wearing it [<name type="pname">Lang</name> 1993, 134-35]. An excellent post Civil War example of such a pocket piece was recently described in <name type="pname">Cubbison</name> 1995.)</p>

Medals showing the office, degree or level within the order achieved - e.g. the double eagle of the 32nd degree in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry or the sun between open compasses to show election as master of a symbolic blue lodge. Such medals belong in the area of regalia, in that wearing them is often compulsory, as
<pb n="128"/>
indeed it is with some of those medals in category one.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>III. Medals that indicate a distinction not earned by taking degrees or by election to office but rather given for singular achievement, e.g. The <name type="pname">Albert Gallatin Mackey </name>Medal of the Grand Lodge of <name type="place">South Carolina</name> or the <name type="pname">John Barney</name> Medal of the Grand Lodge of Vermont. The medals in this class are much rarer than those in the other two classes (<name type="pname">Anonymous</name>, 1967). The first of these to be instituted in the <name type="place">United States</name> on a regular basis was <name type="place">Massachusetts'</name> Henry Price Medal in 1888.</p>
            <p>In all three cases of this simple classification, the medal design can include universal Masonic symbols,<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref> symbols associated with the particular rite or degree, or symbols linking Masonry with patriotic themes.<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> This last patriotic theme has particular interest. While Masonry came to the <name type="place">United States</name> from <name type="place">Europe</name>, it has developed a uniquely American flavor, including a distinctive tradition in medals which reinforces other Masonic efforts to demonstrate that the organization is a staunch booster of flag and country.</p>
            <p>An example of how the Masonic mantle of myth to support this patriotic motif was woven is the Masons' embroidered version of the origins of the American flag:
<q>The Continental Congress with but three or four exceptions was composed entirely of Masons. As Col. <name type="pname">George Ross</name> was of
<pb n="129"/>
Scotch descent, the old Scotch Coventanters' "blue blanker," as it was called, may possibly have suggested the blue field for the union which has been claimed for it; but casting aside this supposition, it is evident that General <name type="pname">Washington</name>, when he designed it, had in mind the Masonic covering of the Lodge, the blue and starry decked canopy of heaven. The three colors, the five-pointed stars of fellowship or fraternity and the seven red stripes, all suggestive of the three, five and seven steps of the Masonry of the Blue Lodge, while the six stars on the Master's collar, the four stars on the Senior Warden's, the two stars on the Junior Warden's, together with the blazing star, comprised the thirteen stars of the constellation of the Masonic union, and were the symbols also of the thirteen States which formed the American Union (<name type="pname">Sherman</name>, 1, 38-39).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Actually there is no evidence that the Continental Congress was so completely composed of Masons or that General <name type="pname">Washington</name> or anyone else was thinking of a Masonic lodge when the Stars and Stripes were designed, but the story is illustrative of how Masonry has woven itself into a national fabric. The effort to do so goes on, as demonstrated by the offer of the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Masons to rebuild the great entrance arch to the national park at Valley Forge. This offer was accepted and the Masons proceeded to rededicate Valley Forge with a ceremony which included a robot programmed as <name type="pname">George Washington</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The wish to commemorate Masonic associations with American history is illustrated by a number of what we call the Class III medals. For example, since 1930 the Grand Lodge of <name type="place">New York</name> has awarded the <name type="pname">Joseph Warren</name> Medal, which is given for distinguished service. The Grand Lodge of <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> gives the General <name type="pname">John Sullivan</name> Distinguished Service Medal. Vermont confers the <name type="pname">John Barney</name> Medal. The choice of Revolutionary War heroes for these medals is illustrative of this desire of Masonry to link itself with American patriotic themes. As a group to be collected, these medals are clearly much harder to come by than many of the medals in the other two categories (<name type="pname">Anonymous</name> 1957).</p>
            <p>In proposing these three categories of Masonic medals as a way to approach the subject, and suggesting that the history of the American Masonic medal involves at times a unique combining of European Masonic and American patriotic symbolism, we still have not provided an easy solution for the problem of deciding whether the treasure discovered at a local flea market is of Masonic origin. Fortunately, as
<pb n="130"/>
noted, the Masons maintain a number of excellent libraries and museums, one of which in <name type="place">New York</name> City in the Masonic temple at 71 W. 23rd Street is more than willing to help numismatists.<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> But even with such help, the curator and the collector must exercise tact and remember that they are dealing with a secret organization. One should reflect on the fact that the phrase about giving someone the third degree as a description of a rough time did not enter the language without reason!</p>

College fraternities are an obvious example, but they involved few men and their initiations were brief and underdeveloped. Fraternal initiation was more important in Mormonism, temperance societies, the Know-Nothings and the Knights of the Golden Circle, the Grange, labor and veterans' organizations, and the life insurance industry. Historians of each of these subjects have commented on the peculiar role of initiation, which they generally have attributed to shield members from blacklisting, and fraternal life insurance firms used ritual to remind members to pay premiums.

Firstly, I would like to thank all those members of the list who replied to my earlier messages requesting directions and info regarding the rededications of the Arch... Upon arrival there we saw the Arch covered with a large cloth bearing the S&amp;C. Also in attendence was Bro. <name type="pname">George Washington</name> who was sitting on the dais...Never saw so many fancy aprons, collars and jewels. Part of the fun for me was trying to guess what position these Brothers held as many of the symbols on their aprons and jewels were not

similar to those in <name type="place">NY</name>...It turns out the Bro. <name type="pname">Geo</name> was not just a manniquin, but a animatronic (like in <name type="place">Disneyland</name>)... Regards.<lb/>

            <p>Augustus Saint-Gaudens's <hi rend="italic">World's Columbian Exposition Commemorative Presentation Medal</hi> (American Numismatic Society; <ref target="#fig-89">figs. 1</ref> &amp; <ref target="#fig-90">2</ref>) was an official award for the great fair held in <name type="place">Chicago</name> from May to October 1893 to celebrate the quadricentennial of <name type="pname">Christopher Columbus's</name> landing on this continent. This discussion will address the history of the commission, focusing on <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> controversial rejected design for the reverse and why the final appearance of the medal was far from what he originally envisioned. Instead of a piece by the greatest American sculptor of the day, the result was composite: the obverse was by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, and the reverse by <name type="pname">Charles E. Barber</name>, the Chief Engraver at the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint from 1879 to 1916.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> obverse depicts <name type="pname">Columbus</name> alighting from his vessel onto the rocky shore of the New World. He strides forcefully to the left, with right foot advanced, arms outspread, and head raised to the skies. He is dressed in armor and a cloak that partially obscure the attached sword and scabbard. The background—with its masterful illusion of depth—abounds with narrative details. On the left a banner sweeps dramatically around <name type="pname">Columbus</name>, echoing the medal's edge and reinforcing the explorer's powerful stance. To the right, still on the ship, are three somber male figures, one a standard bearer holding the staff of the banner, and two others who will presumably also disembark. At the upper right are symbolic devices: the <name type="place">Pillars of Hercules</name>, symbolizing the Rocks of <name type="place">Gibraltar</name> with the three caravels setting sail, and the inscription PLVS VLTRA. Filling the field directly below is another inscription: <name type="pname">CHRISTOPHER</name>/ COLVMBVS / OCT XII / MCCCCXCII.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> rejected effort for the reverse features a nude youth representing the "Spirit of <name type="place">America</name>," posed frontally in a modified contrapposto stance. A pencil drawing (<ref target="#fig-91">fig. 3</ref>), now destroyed, reveals a loosely sketched design, perhaps Augustus's conception for his younger brother <name type="pname">Louis</name>—also a sculptor—to carry out. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> relied on <name type="pname">Louis</name> to model the nude figure, a perfectly acceptable practice for a sculptor with numerous ongoing commissions (<name type="pname">Dryfhout</name> 1982, 202). In a proof cast from the ANS (<ref target="#fig-92">fig. 4</ref>), the supple boy, "in the full vigor of young life" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">R.C. Preston</name>, Director of <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint, November 17, 1893 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers), holds three wreaths in his left hand. He supports a tall shield inscribed "E PLVRIBVS VNVM," and decorated with an American eagle, an olive branch, and a smaller shield. In his right hand he grasps a torch. A young oak tree follows the contour of the boy's shield at the right, while at the lower left, space is provided for the name of the medal's recipient.</p>

               <name type="pname">Barber's</name> version, the final minted reverse of the medal, is a competent, traditional design. It is composed of a central tablet with inscription: WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION / IN COMMEMORATION OF THE / FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY / OF THE LANDING OF <name type="pname">COLUMBUS</name> / MDCCCXCII MDCCCXCIII. There is space below for a small insert die for the prize winner's name. Flaming beribboned torches representing light and intelligence fill the left and right margins. Above, two semi-draped females are separated by a globe marked with meridian and parallel lines. With trumpet and pen, they announce the award; the figure at the left also holds presentation wreaths. In the lower portion, <name type="pname">Columbus's</name> caravel, the <hi rend="italic">

            <p>In tracing this commission, it would be easy to reduce the controversy to petty personal jealousies between <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> and <name type="pname">Barber</name>. This element must be factored into the history of the medal; however, it is more important to consider two larger issues that led to the rejection of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> reverse: the climate for American medallic art in the late nineteenth century and public discomfort over artistic renditions of the male nude.</p>

Two years later, in 1882, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was asked to enter a competition to design the Temple Award medal for the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Academy of the Fine Arts. He did not, but revealed, "I am greatly interested in the subject of medals" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">George Corliss</name>, November 20, 1882, <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Academy of the Fine Arts Archives).

            <p>In 1891 <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was one of ten prominent artists asked by the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Treasury Department to submit designs for the first public competition for new silver coinage—coinage Mint officials felt should better express the art of the day (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 287). Rather than preparing their designs, the artists—among them <name type="pname">sculptors Daniel Chester</name>
               <name type="place">French</name> and <name type="pname">John Quincy Adams Ward</name>—wrote a joint response stating that neither the amount of time nor the monetary compensation was adequate. After the Treasury scrapped this first plan, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> served on a jury for a public competition with Mint official <name type="pname">Charles Barber</name> and <name type="place">Boston</name> engraver <name type="pname">Henry Mitchell</name>. This committee, too, was a dismal failure; from 300 submissions, no new designs were adopted. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> and <name type="pname">Barber</name> sparred over aesthetic and technical matters. In general, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> favored more artistic designs impossible to

adapt—due to a high degree of relief—to the rigors of the coinage manufacturing process. He also informed Mint Director <name type="pname">Edward Leech</name> that only four Americans were qualified to carry out this work, himself and three who resided in <name type="place">France</name>. <name type="pname">Leech</name> countered that he found it doubtful that any "high-class artist...any distinguished sculptor or designer can prepare a practical model for a coin" ([Marks] 1891, 102). <name type="pname">Barber</name> also contended that no one outside the Mint could competently design coinage, and in the end, himself prepared new designs for the 1892 dime, quarter, and half-dollar. Thus the line between <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> and <name type="pname">Barber</name>, artist and engraver, was drawn and would plague the sculptor throughout the remainder of his career (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 287-94, and <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1891, 1-3).</p>
            <p>In autumn 1892 <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was approached with a proposal from <name type="pname">John Boyd Thacher</name>, chairman of the World's Columbian Exposition's Executive Committee on Awards to complete an award for the fair. The commission was in fact controlled by the Quadro-Centennial Committee of the <name type="pname">United States</name> Senate, a fact that made the sculptor wary. He refused the project—possibly as many as three times—turning down a generous five thousand-dollar payment, "a large sum...in those years" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:66). According to his son, Homer, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> claimed (with uncharacteristic modesty), "that neither he nor any one else in the country could model a decent medal, and that it was necessary to go to <name type="place">Europe</name> for it" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:66).</p>
            <p>In the end <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> presumably accepted the commission out of loyalty to fellow artists involved in preparations for the Columbian Exposition as well as out of a spirit of patriotism. Before his involvement with the award medal, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> had a sustained, but mainly unofficial, role in preparations for the fair, an event which reflected an unprecedented spirit of cooperation among American painters, sculptors, and architects. His one submission for an ambitious outdoor sculptural program, a monumental figure of <name type="pname">Columbus</name>, now destroyed (<ref target="#fig-96">fig. 8</ref>), was modeled by his assistant <name type="pname">Mary Lawrence</name>, to whom he fully credited the work.

               <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1993, 74, and <name type="pname">Potter-Hennessey</name> 1995, 160-64).</p>

            <p>As <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> warmed to the prospect of assuming the medal commission, he had to contend with the <name type="pname">Robert Gould Shaw</name> Memorial Committee, whose members had grown impatient with his painfully slow pace on the monument planned for the <name type="place">Boston</name> Common. Under the terms of his contract, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was obliged to seek its permission to pursue additional commissions. In November 1892, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> wrote Shaw committee treasurer <name type="pname">Edward Atkinson</name> to explain that his desire to design the medal had, in part, to do with his animosity toward <name type="pname">Barber</name>:
<q>I only wish to do it to keep it out of the hands of the man at the mint who I am positively assured...will certainly do it if I don't. If I thought that it were at all possible that one of two or three other artists could obtain the work, I should certainly refuse to have anything to do with the matter (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Atkinson</name>, November 10, 1892 [copy], <name type="pname">Lee</name> Family Papers).</q>

            </figure>
            <p>So <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> explicitly confessed a desire to hold <name type="pname">Barber</name> at bay, in effect to prevent him from crossing the line from an engraver of coins to an artist of a prestigious medal. Despite Saint-Gaudens's comment that Europeans were more capable medalists, he believed that, in order to raise the status of the American artist, an American was obliged to carry out the commission. Therefore he accepted it.</p>
            <p>By October 31, 1893—when the Columbian Exposition closed— <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> had completed designs for both faces of the medal. He insisted that models be closely guarded until they were delivered to the proper officials. Apparently the obverse was readily accepted. Controversy flared, however, when a rendering of the reverse (<ref target="#fig-98">fig. 10</ref>) was prematurely circulated in January 1894. The respected journal, <hi rend="italic">The American Architect and Building News</hi>, reported that officials of the Page Belting Company of Concord, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>, to whom two medals were to be awarded, decided that a drawing of the medal would form an interesting decoration for the new calendar which they proposed to send to their customers at the beginning of the year; and, as the medal itself was not yet available, they sent a draughtsman to <name type="place">Washington</name>, to make a drawing from the dies, or from <name type="pname">Mr. St. Gaudens's</name> model <hi rend="italic">(American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49).</p>

            </figure>
            <pb n="146"/>
            <p>No sooner had the souvenir books with the pirated drawings been distributed than objections to the medal's reverse escalated. Furious that the design had been leaked, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> called the rendering "incorrect and offensive" and threatened legal action (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:68). Furthermore, he characterized the draftsman who made the sketches as an "idiot," and a "<name type="place">New Hampshire</name> ass" (<hi rend="italic">American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49).</p>
            <p>Reconstructing the ensuing sequence of events through letters and newspaper accounts reveals how terribly mismanaged the administration of the commission in fact was. The Page Belting Company publication attracted the notice of <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Senator <name type="pname">William Eaton Chandler</name>. Though Secretary of the Treasury <name type="pname">John Griffin Carlisle</name> had apparently already "formally accepted" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:67) <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> model, <name type="pname">Chandler's</name> objections forced the Quadro-Centennial Committee to reconsider the design. In January 1894 the Senatorial committee requested that "the Secretary of the Treasury...have work on the dies stopped, on the ground that the nude figure represented on the reverse of the medal was indecent" (<hi rend="italic">American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49). Secretary <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, in deference to his peers and President <name type="pname">Grover Cleveland</name>, recanted the acceptance to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> on the grounds that the nude was offensive:
<q>I am frank to say that inasmuch as there are to be over 20,000 of these medals struck, I am satisfied that it would be severely criticized by a large majority of the people in its present form....I have to request that...you will be kind enough to submit some design covering the objectionable part of the figure (<name type="pname">Carlisle</name> to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, January 23, 1894 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anticipating the likelihood of open confrontation, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> replied to <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, warning him icily: "I of course shall feel at liberty at all times to publish the correspondence between us" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, January 25, 1894 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers). Clearly <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> planned to make <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> the scapegoat for what he saw as the government's provincial and uncultured attitude toward the arts.</p>
            <p>The controversy immediately caught the attention of the press, which followed it for several weeks, often giving it front page coverage.
<pb n="147"/>
The majority of published articles were sympathetic to the sculptor, written by journalists determined to advance the concept of a viable American "school" of artists. A note in <hi rend="italic">The Collector</hi> supporting <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> is a case in point: "To fling into the face of such a man, who is an honor to this country and his art, the filth of time-serving politics, and the ignorance of the intelligences of mud, is not so much to insult him as to defame this country before all the world." ([<name type="pname">Trumble</name>] 1894, p. 101).</p>
            <p>Not surprising, artists, especially other French-trained sculptors, also rallied in support of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>. In their effort to redeem his reputation, they decried the government's censorship and poor track record as a patron of American artists. Their collective organ was the National Sculpture Society, founded in 1893 to regulate commissions for public sculpture and to advance exhibition opportunities for small works. The Society published a resolution on February 12, 1894 that concluded: "That if changes in works of art are ordered, then such changes should be made under the immediate direction of the artist" (copy in <name type="pname">Gilder</name> Papers). In fact, the exact opposite would happen.</p>
            <p>By early March, perhaps mollified by the sympathy of the press and fellow artists, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> consented to make slight, but significant, refinements. He altered his design, as he later put it, to "flatter the sensitiveness of the rampant pure'." (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:68). He experimented with several options, adding a teasingly thin ribbon across what <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> had deemed the "objectionable part" of the nude in one version (<ref target="#fig-11">fig. 11</ref>), while in another, he relied on the time-tested fig leaf (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, March 15, 1894 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers). In April, with limited explanation, the government deemed these designs unfit.</p>
            <p>Although his patience and pride were tested, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> complied with a request from <name type="pname">Robert Preston</name>, new Director of the Mint, to furnish yet another model. On May 22, 1894, the sculptor wrote to his friend, the influential journalist <name type="pname">Richard Watson Gilder</name>: "I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> doing a reverse, but am eliminating the figure entirely, confining it only to an inscription.... The figure that I had composed was composed to be nude, and I find it impossible to drape it without entirely destroying the composition." (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Gilder</name>, May 22, 1894, <name type="pname">Gilder</name> Papers). By ousting the nude, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> presumed that the acceptance of the design was all but guaranteed. In fact, Mint Director Preston had written him to that effect just days earlier, on May 18: "As soon as the Reverse is received, preparation will be made to have it engraved immediately, and to make a faithful reproduction of the same" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:71).</p>

            <p>The revised composition (<ref target="#fig-100">fig. 12</ref>), in the sculptors words, "surely avoided all erotic insinuation" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:68). It is a conventional design with an inscription as the central element: THE COLVMBIAN / EXPOSITION IN COMMEMORATION / OF THE FOVR HVNDREDTH ANNI / VERSARY OF THE LANDING OF / COLVMBVS. The sole vestiges of the earlier composition— the eagle, a small shield, and E PLVRIBVS VNVM—appear in a wreath above the longer inscription while below is a tablet-like space for an insert die with the recipient's name. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> sent this design off to Secretary <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> on June 23, believing the problem element to be eliminated. This attempt too was rejected without reason just four days later, while a model for the reverse by <name type="pname">Barber</name> that was commissioned without <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> knowledge was accepted.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> fumed at a chain of events that had ended in deception. In an incendiary letter to Secretary <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, his rage is almost palpable:
<q>You will excuse me for saying that your action in allowing me to devote time, thought and money to the elaboration of this final model, while keeping me in ignorance of the fact that another design was being prepared at the Mint for the same purpose, was something more than discourteous (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, July 3, 1894 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In a letter that <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> planned to submit for publication in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Daily Tribune</hi>, which is reprinted in his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, he set forth his "mortifying confession of criminal <hi rend="italic">naéveté</hi>," detailing the circumstances of the commission as a "moral to others moved to entertain government proposals" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:67-68). Seeking to expose the government's bad faith, he printed verbatim the letter from Mint Director <name type="pname">Preston</name> that had guaranteed acceptance of the final design. While the sculptor conceded that, legally, the government could combine his work with <name type="pname">Barber's</name>, "the rare shamelessness of such offense will be appreciated by all my confreres at home and abroad." He would, he concluded, "in all humility, await from these official gentlemen their own explanation" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:72). The sculptor, however, met a wall of silence, and by October 1894, he conceded defeat, the incident having brought him "great distress of mind" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:66).</p>
            <p>Once the decision was made to mule <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> design with

Barber's, the medal's production rested solely in government hands. In November 1893, Mint Director <name type="pname">Preston</name> asked <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to provide a list of foundries that could strike the award medals, evidence perhaps that the sculptor had requested that they not be struck at the Mint (<name type="pname">Preston</name> to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, November 13, 1893, Records of the Bureau of the Mint, <name type="place">United States</name> National Archives). Annual reports of the <name type="place">U. S.</name> Mint between 1894 and 1896 suggest that the Mint did produce the hubs and dies, but farmed out the actual striking of the medal (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 410). A sample card accompanying one of the medals in the ANS's collection reads, "Award Medal and Aluminum Case made by <name type="pname">Scoville</name> Manufacturing Company, <name type="place">Waterbury, Connecticut</name>." Thus <name type="pname">Scoville</name> was the producer of not only the medals, but the accompanying velvet-lined cases.</p>
            <p>The medal, along with an award diploma designed by <name type="pname">Will Low</name>, was finally circulated to prize winners in April 1896, a full two and a half years after the fair's closing. An article in that month's <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> noted the culmination of the protracted ordeal: "the medals...have at last been issued." Lamenting the aesthetic disparity between <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> obverse and <name type="pname">Barber's</name> reverse, the author commented: "While there is dignity and devotion finely expressed in the figure of <name type="pname">Columbus</name>, ...the general effect of the medal, as a specimen of the highest attainment of American numismatic art, is...hardly up to our hopes" <hi rend="italic">(AJN 1896,</hi> 119-20).</p>
            <p>It would be fruitful to consider the described course of events in the context of American medallic art of the late nineteenth century. In the 1880s, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was part of a growing trend by French-trained American sculptors to embrace a field monopolized by engravers and die cutters. Technological progress revolutionized the methods by which coins and medals were made and boundaries between engravers and sculptors dissolved. The refinement of a reducing machine allowed sculptors to model their designs on a larger scale and then mechanically modify them to appropriate proportions. Thus, the ability to model became the chief requisite for the creation of a medal and sculptors were able to compete on a more equal basis for the abundant commissions. For the Columbian Exposition alone, several hundred coins and medals were produced, from those of official status, such as the <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens/Barber</name> award medal to those sold for negligible sums as collectibles (see <name type="pname">Eglit ca</name>. 1965).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was also a victim of a power struggle waged by <name type="pname">Barber</name> and his chief assistant <name type="pname">George T. Morgan</name> to retain control over
<pb n="151"/>
designs of coins and medals of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint. As mentioned above, in 1891, in an effort to address dissatisfaction with the appearance of American coinage, the Mint had engaged in open competition for designs. Although the submissions were unacceptable, and <name type="pname">Barber</name> proceeded to make his own revisions, it is understandable that he and <name type="pname">Morgan</name> would resent the intrusion of lofty artistic ideals into the practical matters of producing coinage. Sculptors, for their part, perceived the Mint engravers as inferior talents because they had not undergone stringent academic training. Such is the case with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> son, <name type="pname">Homer</name>, who years later disdainfully referred to <name type="pname">Barber</name> as the "commercial medallist" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:67).</p>
            <p>As <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was mired in dispute over the award medal, <name type="pname">Barber</name> was also vying to control two other Columbian coin commissions. The <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint was, for the first time, to produce commemorative coinage, in this case to help finance the Exposition (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 32). Mrs. <name type="pname">Potter Palmer</name>, as head of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, was responsible for the commission of the Queen <name type="pname">Isabella</name> quarter dollar, authorized by Congress on March 3, 1893, in recognition of women's contribution to American society. She hired <name type="pname">Caroline Peddle</name> for the task, but <name type="pname">Barber</name> intervened and executed the coin himself (see <name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1967, 8-13). <name type="pname">Olin Warner</name>, one of the most esteemed sculptors of the day, suffered a similar fate with his half dollar. Selected by the Board of Managers of the Columbian Commission, <name type="pname">Warner</name> was the first individual outside the Mint to design an American coin. His obverse—a bust-length portrait of Columbus—was based on a medal (<ref target="#fig-101">fig. 13</ref>) that he produced to commemorate the Exposition's dedication. When <name type="pname">Barber</name> and <name type="pname">Morgan</name> prepared the dies for <name type="pname">Warner's</name> half dollar (<ref target="#fig-102">fig. 14</ref>), they not only clouded his subtle modeling, and reworked elements of the design and inscription, but added their initials, in effect obviating <name type="pname">Warner's</name> principle role (<name type="pname">Gurney</name> 1978, 3:779-80).</p>

            <p>The issue of nudity was also at the heart of the controversy over the initial design for the reverse. Despite his thorough grounding in Beaux-Arts academicism, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> rarely introduced the nude into his work. In the few instances he attempted the subject he often was embroiled in debate over its propriety in relation to the adornment of public space. Three fauns for the <name type="place">Eli Bates Fountain</name>, <hi rend="italic">Storks at Play,</hi> of 1886-87, dance among herons and cattails in <name type="place">Chicago's Lincoln Park</name>. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> originally intended the boys to be nude, but was obliged to add fig leaves at the request of the committee overseeing the commission. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> most notorious nude, the eighteen-foot <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Diana</name>
               </hi> for Madison Square Garden was the object of extensive controversy. The first version, now destroyed, stood atop the Garden's tower from November 1891 to September 1892. There and during its subsequent installation atop the Agriculture Building at the Columbian Exposition, <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Diana</name>
               </hi> had been fiercely criticized as inappropriate. <hi rend="italic">Diana's</hi> display in <name type="place">Chicago</name> may have prompted members of the Quadro-Centennial Committee to take swift action when the dispute over the nude on the medal arose. Lastly, <name type="pname">Louis St. Gaudens</name>, in consultation with Augustus, had modeled a seal (<ref target="#fig-103">fig. 15</ref>), based on a design by <name type="pname">Kenyon Cox</name>, for the main entrance of the new <name type="place">Boston</name> Public Library
<pb n="153"/>
in 1889-90. Here two nude figures supporting a shield bear a resemblance to the figure on the rejected reverse. Opposition to the seal's placement on the library erupted in the Boston press in mid-February 1894, just three weeks after the initial rejection of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> reverse for the Columbian medal. Fortunately, this design withstood the objections of its critics.</p>

            <p>Not only was the inclusion of a male nude on an American medal a gamble, the subject had a tenuous place in nineteenth-century American sculpture. Historically, nudes were acceptable so long as they did not overstep bounds with an American audience: the line between praise and castigation was a fine one. Idealized subjects far removed from modern American life stood a better chance of acceptance, such as Hiram Powers's classicizing <hi rend="italic">Fisher Boy</hi> (1841-44; The Metropolitan Museum of Art), a rare case in which the genitals are not covered, or <name type="pname">John Donoghue's</name> fig-leafed <hi rend="italic">Young <name type="pname">Sophocles</name> Leading the Chorus of</hi>

               <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">George Washington</name>
               </hi> of 1832-41 (National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution; <ref target="#fig-104">fig. 16</ref>), originally installed in the <name type="place">U.S. Capitol Rotunda</name>, provides insight into the furor over <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> nude youth. Also a governmental commission, the heroic-size seated <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">Washington</name>
               </hi> was condemned because the figure was partially nude. Many saw this as an irrational presentation of a venerated leader. Like <name type="pname">Greenough's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">Washington</name>

               <hi rend="italic">Spirit of <name type="place">America</name>
               </hi> overstepped the bounds with viewers unwilling to make the leap from realism to "a bit of artistic idealism" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:66). To its detractors, the issue was not only one of propriety, but also appropriateness: this figure was not an acceptable personification of an American youth of the 1890s. In an era of optimism, realism, and self-confidence, a <name type="pname">Huck Finn</name> or <name type="pname">Tom Sawyer</name> vision of boyhood was fitting, but a nude without a veneer of morality or virtue was direct provocation. That <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> youth was a sensual full-length, unprecedented in an American medal, caused additional governmental discomfort since the nubile youth was to be yoked with the noble <name type="pname">Columbus</name>. Furthermore, since a medal's reverse conventionally featured an artfully placed inscription, a heraldic shield, or an eagle, it is even easier to comprehend the circumstances leading to this	
clash between freedom of expression and censorship.</p>
            <p>In the end, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> original conception was not realized largely because of the incompatibility of subject and audience. Highminded aesthetics could not override moral standards and politics. The incident represented a setback for American sculptors, who through principles ingrained in their French academic training, labored to teach Americans that the nude was not common or immoral, but inspirational and pure. For his part, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> salvaged elements from the medal's reverse and incorporated them into other projects. The elongated shield is realized in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">James Garfield</name> Monument</hi>, dedicated in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in May 1896. The eagle and motto "E PLVRIBVS VNVM" on the shield were repeated on the reverse of the <name type="pname">Theodore Roosevelt</name> special inaugural medal of 1905 (ANS; <ref target="#fig-105">fig. 17</ref>) and reverse of the

            <p>Despite the regrettable close to this chapter of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> career, his contribution toward a redefined field of American medallic art is uncontested. His protean attempts to marry American sculptural and numismatic traditions paved the way for the glorious Beaux-Arts medals of <name type="pname">John Flanagan</name>, <name type="pname">Victor David Brenner</name>, and others at the turn of the century.</p>

            <p>A 1917 article on the sculpture of <name type="pname">Adolph Alexander Weinman</name> in the <hi rend="italic">Pan-American Union Bulletin</hi> concludes with a paragraph on his achievements in medallic art:
<q>As a medalist, however, he ranks probably second to none. Ingenious and skillful in this branch of artistic endeaver, he has produced some exceptionally fine work. No doubt his early training as a wood and <name type="pname">ivory carver</name> stand him in good stead. The medal of honor of the American Institute of Architects is his work, as is also the medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the <name type="place">United States</name> medal for life saving on railroads. He also did the official medal of the <name type="pname">St. Louis</name> Exposition. In all these designs he combined strength with simplicity, thus creating an object of striking charm. Most recently he has designed a series of coins for the <name type="place">United States</name> Government. New coins of the denomination of 10 cents and 50 cents are now in circulation in this country and are bringing forth much favorable comment for the beauty of design and the effective expression through it of the spirit and ideals of this country. <hi rend="italic">(PAUB</hi> 1917, 787)</q>
            </p>
            <p>The strength and clarity of design noted in this anonymous review, coupled with a rigorous adherence to classical ideals, distinguish <name type="pname">A. A. Weinman</name>'s medals from those of his contemporaries. Drawing on the evidence of previously unpublished studies, notes, and sketches that have been donated or loaned by the <name type="pname">Weinman</name> family to the American Numismatic Society and the Archives of American Art, it is possible to trace the development of <name type="pname">Weinmans</name> medallic designs and to illuminate the singularity of his artistic vision.</p>
            <p>Born in 1870 in <name type="place">Karlsruhe, Germany</name>, <name type="pname">Adolph Alexander Weinman</name> emigrated to the <name type="place">United States</name> with his family in 1880. At age fifteen, he was apprenticed to a wood and <name type="pname">ivory carver</name> in <name type="place">New York</name>. The following year, he began studying drawing and modeling in evening classes at the Cooper Union. He later said of that experience, "I liked carving, but it was all small stuff and when I saw the large work being done in the modeling class, I made up my mind then and there to quit carving and try to become a sculptor" (<name type="pname">Weinman</name>, Typescript of a public address, April 13, 1948; AAA). When he learned that the sculptor <name type="pname">Philip Martiny</name>, a former pupil and assistant of Augustus <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, was taking on apprentices, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> signed on for the job of "push[ing] a studio broom, keep[ing] the potbellied stove going and mix[ing] barrels of good, wet clay" (<name type="pname">Weinman</name>, April 13, 1948; AAA). Working during the day in <name type="pname">Martiny's</name> studio, <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, like so many of
<pb n="159"/>
his contemporaries, continued his studies in the evening classes taught by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> at the Art Students League. Through these classes, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> transmitted the Beaux-Arts tradition of bronze sculpture to an entire generation of American sculptors.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After a brief assistantship with <name type="pname">Olin Levi Warner</name>, cut short by <name type="pname">Warner's</name> untimely death, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> joined <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> studio in 1895. He worked closely with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> for the next ten years, before establishing his own studio. While assisting <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> also worked at times with the sculptors <name type="pname">Charles Niehaus</name> and <name type="pname">Daniel Chester French</name>. <name type="pname">Weinman</name> described <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, whom he and other studio assistants referred to as "the Saint," as "a man of remarkably magnetic personality, intensely temperamental and of striking personal appearance, whom I shall always remember with great affection, despite the fact that there was one fault in his general makeup, he habitually forgot to pay his assistant at a specified time and that is the way he was about money in general" (<name type="pname">Weinman</name>, April 13, 1948; AAA).</p>
            <p>Surviving documentation clearly shows that <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> held <name type="pname">Weinman</name> in high regard and bestowed on him the primary responsibility for carrying out important commissions. Likewise, <name type="pname">Daniel Chester</name>
               <name type="pname">French</name> trusted <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> abilities, writing in a letter of September 10, 1903: "I do want all the time you can give me from the first of next month on indefinitely ... I am sorry to stand in the way of your working with Mr. <name type="pname">St. Gaudens</name> but I need you too much to be generous" (<name type="pname">French</name> to <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, September 10, 1903; HKW).</p>
            <p>The exhibition of European medals at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in <name type="place">Chicago</name> first sparked <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> interest in medallic sculpture. His subsequent experience in the studios of <name type="pname">Warner</name> and <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, both of whom received critical acclaim for their masterful portrait plaquettes and medallions in the 1880s and early 1890s, further inspired his early efforts at medallic portraiture.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> earliest surviving portrait medallion is a silvered galvano depicting his mother, Catharina, sculpted in 1896 (Baxter 1987, cat. no. 165, illustrated p. 47).The soft, atmospheric modeling and format of this piece are very much in the Beaux-Arts tradition. The style of inscriptions and use of the Latin "FECIT" in the artist's signature follow <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> practice, inspired by Italian Renaissance models.</p>
            <p>During his tenure with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> modeled other portrait plaquettes and medallions for relatives and acquaintances, but his first commission for a commemorative medal did not come until
<pb n="160"/>
1904. When he received the commission for the official medal of the 1904 <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase Exposition, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> seized the opportunity, crafting a unique series of commemorative and awards medals (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 38-39). The <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase medals are innovative for their use of varying planchet shapes to distinguish the different classes of awards. All of the medals share the same central obverse and reverse designs, but the motifs around the edges of the planchets differ. The format for the Gold Medal and official Commemorative Medal is a triangular planchet with curved sides (<ref target="#fig-107">fig. 1</ref>). The Grand Prize Medal is struck on a shield-shaped flan, the Silver Medal a square, and the Bronze Medal a circle.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> design for the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase medals anticipates many of his later medallic achievements. On the obverse, the central medallion features an image of Liberty cloaking herself and a younger figure beside her in the American flag, with a rising sun in the background. The circular field on the reverse is filled by a heroic eagle with outstretched wings perched on a rectangular plaque bearing the inscription, with a pair of opposed dolphins flanking a scallop shell below. The graceful, curving line, restrained composition, and strong forms evident in this piece are hallmarks of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> mature style. <name type="pname">Weinman</name> became a specialist in the modeling of eagles, and this magnificent bird initiates a lengthy series of variations on the theme.</p>
            <p>In a letter of July 14, 1905 that undoubtedly refers to the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase medal, <name type="pname">Daniel Chester French</name> indicates that he has seen the models for the medal in Ward's studio and congratulates <name type="pname">Weinman</name> on his achievement. He goes on to add:
<q>Mr. <name type="pname">Ward</name> said, that he had called your attention to the drapery in the lower part of the principal figure. This does not seem to me as happy in arrangement as the rest of the drapery. At the same time I hesitate about criticising it, or making any suggestion, the whole thing is so fine. I still fell [feel] that your Dolphins have not squirm enough. I think that the curves in the outlines of them are too true, and that some little breaks in the outlines and some little suggestion of unevenness in the modeling would take away from the regidity I feel in them. You know I criticised them before. (<name type="pname">French</name> to <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, July 14, 1905; HKW)</q>
            </p>
            <p>A somewhat awkward relationship between the drapery and the lower part of the figure of Liberty is evident in the finished medal. <name type="pname">French's</name> comment about the dolphins is also very telling. In the modeling of his medallic compositions, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> favors smooth surfaces
<pb n="161"/>
and clarity of outline over the more nuanced surface modulations preferred by <name type="pname">French</name> and <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>. This stylistic difference reflects <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> closer adherence to Classical sources than to the Renaissance models emulated by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>.</p>

            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman</name> certainly adapted his work to the master sculptor's dictates when required to do so, and the Special Inaugural Medal commissioned
<pb n="162"/>
from <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> by President <name type="pname">Theodore Roosevelt</name> in 1905 is a case in point (<ref target="#fig-108">fig. 2</ref>) (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 29, 31). At a White House dinner on January 12, 1905, <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> asked <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to create a special commemorative medal for his upcoming second inaugural. A week later, the sculptor wrote back to the President:
<figure xml:id="fig-108">
                  <graphic url="COAC13_162.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <pb n="163"/>
               <q>If the inauguration medal is to be ready for March the first, there is not a moment to lose. I cannot do it, but I have arranged with the man best fit to execute it in this country [<name type="pname">Weinman</name>]. He is a most artistic nature extremely diffident but he would do an admirable thing. He is also supple and takes suggestion intelligently. He has made one of the great Indian groups at St. Louis that would have interested you if brought to your attention. He is so interested that he begged me to fix any price. I named $250 (<name type="pname">Weinman</name> to <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name>, January 20, 1905; DCL).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Letters from <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> in <name type="pname">Vermont</name> to <name type="pname">Weinman</name> in <name type="place">New York</name> document the progress of the models for the <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> medal and illustrate the nature of the working relationship between the two sculptors. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> sketched out the composition and decided on the inscriptions in consultation with the President, who agreed that the text should be kept to a minimum, following Renaissance prototypes. Weinman attended to all of the technical details, from soliciting proposals for the medal's production to choosing the color of gold for the President's specimen. The Renaissance-inspired design of the obverse features a truncated bust of the President. A noble, Ptolemaic eagle appears on the reverse, accompanied by <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> monogram. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> required that <name type="pname">Weinman</name> make numerous small revisions in the models before he was satisfied that the medal was ready for casting:
<q>Dear <name type="pname">Weinman</name>:</q>
               <q>I think the eagle without the shield is the right one. I return the model with three little corrections:</q>
               <q>No. 1, showing more of V and N in VNVM by cutting one of the feathers shorter, as I have indicated.</q>
               <q>No. 2, increasing the size of our monograms.</q>
               <q>No. 3, making the front of the rock in simpler planes, as I have also roughly indicated.</q>
               <q>As to the head, it is all right except that I think the letters might be a little thinner and longer in relief; after that is done, go ahead with the reduction</q>
               <q>(<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, March 14, 1905; AAA).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In typical <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> fashion, the first trial casts were sent back to Tiffany &amp; Company because they had not been executed "in the best possible manner," and <name type="pname">Weinman</name> tried another foundry [Roman Bronze Works] to see if better casts could be obtained (<name type="pname">Weinman</name> to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, May 3, 1905, and May 21, 1905; DCL). In the end, Tiffany did produce casts that met with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> and <name type="pname">Weinman's</name>
               <pb n="164"/>
approval, and the President finally received his medal in June 1905, more than three months after the inauguration.</p>
            <p>The success of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> designs for the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase medals and his association with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> brought him further important commissions, beginning with the <name type="place">United States</name> Medal for Life Saving on Railroads, enacted by Act of Congress in 1905. A unique study for the Lifesaving Medal, presented to the American Numismatic Society by <name type="pname">Robert A. Weinman</name> from his father's collection, shows the design in progress (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, cat. no. 172, illlustrated p. 47). <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name> originally sketched the piece as a two-figure composition, embodying the concept of rescue in a heroic, classical nude who lifts a limp victim in his strong arms. He later reduced the composition to a single, allegorical nude figure that better suits the small scale of the struck medal (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, cat. no. 173, illustrated p. 48). In the final design, the diagonal position of the figure, the tension of the musculature, and the movement of the drapery create a sense of drama appropriate to the subject.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">James Earle Fraser's Harriman</name> Memorial Medal for the American Museum of Safety, issued in 1914, makes an instructive comparison with <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> Lifesaving Medal (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 10, <ref target="#fig-115">fig. 9</ref>). <name type="pname">Fraser</name>, another of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> gifted students, gives the theme of railroad safety a more realistic treatment, using textured modeling to complement the robust image of a contemporary track walker. <name type="pname">Weinman</name> seems to have considered such a literal representation of the subject inappropriate to the format and commemorative purpose of the medal. For the duration of his career, he remained faithful to the classical, allegorical ideal, long after the Beaux-Arts tradition in sculpture and architecture had been eclipsed by what he derisively called the "stark functionalism" of modernist design (<name type="pname">Weinman</name>, April 13, 1948; AAA).</p>
            <p>For <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, the starting point for each medallic design was the search for a symbolic equivalent of the subject. A unique sketch for the 1909 <name type="pname">Edison</name> Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers shows a partially draped, seated figure holding a lightbulb, attended by a small winged genius (<ref target="#fig-109">fig. 3</ref>) (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 49, cat. no. 175). The image of a seated male nude with a lightbulb also appears in another study for this same medal by <name type="pname">James Earle Fraser</name>, suggesting that in this case the allegorical figure may have been a requirement of a design competition for the medal (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 61, cat. no. 232). <name type="pname">Fraser</name> was ultimately awarded the commission for the <name type="pname">Edison</name> medal (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 60, cat. no. 231).</p>

            <p>Sketchbooks and drawings in the collection of papers donated by <name type="pname">Robert A. Weinman</name> to the Archives of American Art give further insight into the genesis of <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name>'s medallic designs. Two undated, loose sheets of pencil sketches for medals are illustrated in <ref target="#fig-110">figures 4</ref> and <ref target="#fig-111">5</ref>. The Classicism of these designs is immediately apparent, as is the sense of monumentality in the figural compositions.<name type="pname"> Weinman</name> was an accomplished sculptor of architectural reliefs, and these studies show the austere Classicism of his large-scale relief sculpture translated into the small format of the medal (Dorr 1913). Some of these sketches bear a strong resemblance to ancient coin types, and there are examples in one of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> sketchbooks of studies from Roman coins and Greek sculpture (HKW).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> studies for medallic designs are often accompanied by penciled captions explaining the allegorical subjects of the compositions. On one sheet of studies, for example, the jotted notations include "Joy of Freedom/The narrow path of Duty" (<ref target="#fig-110">fig. 4</ref>); on another, "Adventure, Romance of History," "Adventure, Defence," "Man and his Conscience," "Peace &amp; Security/Parting of the Way," "Reason deceives us often, Conscience never./Man &amp; his conscience/Conscience, oracle of god" (<ref target="#fig-111">fig. 5</ref>) (AAA). <name type="pname">Weinman</name> kept lists of quotations and allegorical subjects for reference. One lengthy, alphabetized list begins: "Ability/Arts, The/Adventure/Adversity/[ ]/<name type="place">America</name>/Civilization/Confidence/Conquest/ Conscience, ..." (AAA).</p>

            <pb n="167"/>
            <p>On another page, the sculptor cites <name type="pname">Bartlett's</name> Quotations as the source of inspiration for a design, and in a memo to himself, he writes: "Inscribe message on Reverse of medal, instead of any devise, if found more to the point" (AAA).</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-112">
               <graphic url="COAC13_167.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>In comparison with the medals sculpted under <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> tutelage, two important commissions dating from the years just after <name type="pname">Weinman</name> established his own studio in 1906 show a new sense of maturity in their design and execution. <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> 1907 medal for the American Institute of Architects pays homage to the classical ideal, represented by the jugate busts of <name type="pname">Ictinus, Kallikrates, and Phidias</name>, the architects and chief sculptor of the <name type="place">Parthenon</name> (<ref target="#fig-112">fig. 6</ref>). On the reverse of the ALA medal, a magnificent eagle with partially extended wings appears on a rocky perch, ripping off a laurel branch in its beak. In comparison with the rather tame bird on the reverse of the <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> Special Inaugural Medal, this eagle has a great sense of power and life, enhanced by the way that the motif fills the entire field, extending right to the edge of the frame. <name type="pname">Weinman</name> achieves a remarkable amount of
<pb n="168"/>
detail in the talons and the differentiation of neck and wing feathers, the result of careful studies from nature.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-113">
               <graphic url="COAC13_168.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> 1909 medal for the National Institute of Arts and Letters is another beautiful example of the balance and grace that typify his best work (<ref target="#fig-113">fig. 7</ref>). Once more the obverse features a classical theme, the head of Apollo, god of music and poetry. A Roman lamp, symbolic of learning, burns brightly on the reverse. The relief here is higher, the surface smoother, and the forms more sharply delineated than in the AIA Medal. The obvious reference to masterpieces of ancient coinage includes the beaded treatment of the rim. Weinman's placement of the head in a slightly off-center position, with the locks of hair that ripple down the neck transgressing the border, gives the image greater vitality. The reverse complements the obverse in its simplicity and off-set composition.</p>
            <p>Another piece dating from 1909 is quite different in character and unusual in <name type="pname">Weinman's ouevre</name> (<ref target="#fig-113">fig. 8</ref>). <name type="pname">Weinman</name> exhibited the rectangular, cast bronze plaquette entitled "The Charge" in 1910 at the
<pb n="169"/>
American Numismatic Society's International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals, but it is otherwise overlooked in the literature (IECM 4). An unpublished companion piece given by <name type="pname">Robert A. Weinman</name> to the American Numismatic Society represents a naval battle (<ref target="#fig-114">fig. 9</ref>). These small reliefs may be studies for a Civil War soldiers and sailors monument. Both depict scenes of action with historical accuracy. When the nature of the commission necessitated that Weinman forgo the heroic, allegorical nude, he did adopt a greater degree of realism in his figurative sculpture, although in the traditional format of the commemorative medal he chose not to do so.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-114">
               <graphic url="COAC13_169.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>In modeling portrait plaquettes and medallions, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> was interested in creating an authentic likeness of the subject. He especially enjoyed portraying children, including his own, who are the subject of numerous reliefs. A medallic portrait of his son <name type="pname">Robert</name> (<name type="pname">Bobbie</name>) exists in two versions, both galvanos—one a plaquette with charming details, the other a circular medallion of the head alone (<ref target="#fig-115">fig. 10</ref>) (Noe, 40; Baxter 1987, cat. no. 171).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name> also played a key role in the Beaux-Arts redesign of the <name type="place">United States</name> coinage, initiated by <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> and <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> with the ten- and twenty-dollar gold pieces of 1907. In a 1916 design competition for the fractional silver coins, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> was selected as the artist for the revamped dime and half-dollar pieces.</p>
            <pb n="170"/>

            <p>The so-called "Mercury" dime, misnamed because of the wings applied to Liberty's cap, is the less successful of the two designs. An exquisite plaster sketch for the head of the Walking Liberty on the half dollar, based on ancient coin types, shows how the obverse of the dime might have looked without the problematic wings that <name type="pname">Weinman</name> deemed symbolic of "liberty of thought" (<ref target="#fig-117">fig. 11</ref>). <name type="pname">Cornelius Vermeule</name> has speculated that another reason for the wings is "because <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, in the true <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> tradition, liked the effect of feathers in relief on his coins and medals" (<name type="pname">Vermeule</name>, 145).</p>

            <p>The "Walking Liberty" half dollar is a true masterpiece of design, the highpoint of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> medallic career, drawing together elements from his earlier work in a perfect balance of strongly modeled, sculptural form and elegant, linear pattern (<ref target="#fig-118">fig. 12</ref>). Although the powerful
<pb n="172"/>
eagle on the reverse of the coin resembles the one that <name type="pname">Weinman</name> had sculpted for the 1909 AIA medal, the uplifted head of the bird creates a much stronger diagonal axis in this composition, and it links the obverse and reverse of the coin thematically. Just as the sun rises in the image on the obverse, the eagle on the reverse raises its head as if readying for flight. In comparison with the modeling of the reverse of the AIA medal, the sharpness of contour and depth of relief achieved in the small format of the half dollar are extraordinary, surpassed only by the high relief version of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> twenty-dollar gold piece.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> design for the obverse of the half dollar is reminiscent of the earlier <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase Medal in its use of the flag drapery encircling the figure of Liberty and the rising sun motif. The rising sun also figured in <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> design for the twenty-dollar gold piece. <name type="pname">Liberty's</name> striding pose echoes Roty's "Semeuse" or "Sower" on the French two-franc piece, and it has been noted before that the choice of a French-inspired design on the eve of <name type="place">America's</name> entry into World War I was not merely a personal artistic statement. <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> Walking <name type="pname">Liberty</name> is a beautiful figure. Her billowing swirls of drapery create a sense of flowing movement, echoing the circular outline of the frame, and she strides forward with strength and purpose. As in many of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> medallic compositions, the figure overlaps the inscription, accentuating her stature, and the drapery spreads out to give her lower body breadth, revealing the form beneath. In this relief, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> achieves a breathtaking synthesis of sweeping line, precise detail, and sculptural volume.</p>
            <p>The American art medal reached its apogee in the years prior to World War I, and the War effectively marked the end of the renaissance of medallic sculpture in this country. World War I did occasion an outpouring of decorations and commemorative medals, but the Beaux-Arts tradition was ill-suited to expressing the horrors of a brutal, devastating war (<name type="pname">Jones</name>, 1979, 152). Although <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> 1920 War Service Medal for <name type="pname">Mt. Sinai</name> Hospital is one of the more successful American war medals from an artistic standpoint, it illustrates the difficulties of adapting the classical, allegorical vocabulary to commemorating the events of the war (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 11, <ref target="#fig-118">fig. 12</ref>) .The grace of the central figure in <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> composition and the limp pathos of the warrior whom she protects from a menacing German soldier are faithful to their Greco-Roman sources, but the stereotypical treatment of the theme limits its effectiveness. A series of pencil sketches for the <name type="pname">Mt. Sinai</name> medal shows that <name type="pname">Weinman</name> considered several other compositions
<pb n="173"/>
before settling on the grouping of three figures (HKW). At an earlier stage of the design, he placed the wounded figure in the lower righthand corner, slumped in the posture of the famous Hellenistic sculpture of the <name type="pname">Dying Gaul</name>. The female figure towered above him, holding a caduceus in one hand and raising the other arm to ward off the advance of the threatening enemy behind her. The final design works more successfully in filling the circular format of the medal, and <name type="pname">Weinman</name> atypically adds the suggestion of a battlefield setting in the lower corner to balance the composition.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Another group of more finished pencil sketches exists for a second medal commissioned by <name type="pname">Mt. Sinai</name> Hospital, the Trusteeship Medal, "presented in recognition of 25 Years of Distinguished Service" (<ref target="#fig-119">fig. 13</ref>) (Undated; AAA). Once again, in the search for a suitable obverse design, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> conceives of the composition in terms of monumental groupings of allegorical figures.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> This severe Classicism runs as a thread through much of his later work, which lacks the subtlety and grace of his earlier medals.</p>
            <p>In 1919, when the American Numismatic Society held a design composition for a new award medal to be presented annually to an outstanding medalist, <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name>'s proposal was selected as the best among fifteen entries. <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> classic design for the <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name> Medal set a high standard for the "signal achievement in the art of the
<pb n="174"/>
medal" that the award celebrates (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, cat. no. 182, illustrated p. 89). The restrained composition, elegant line, and delicate modeling of the obverse, a symbolic representation of Medallic Art, complement the more vigorous image of Pegasus on the reverse, which is effectively set off from the lengthy surrounding inscriptions by the use of a recessed field.</p>
            <p>Fittingly, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> himself was the second recipient of the Saltus Award in 1920, in recognition of his exceptional contributions to medallic art. In his finest medallic work, <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name> transcended the limitations of a mode of expression that would soon be regarded as irrelevant to the modern age. Recasting the classical vocabulary in his own terms, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> created coins and medals that are a lasting tribute to his technical skill and innate aesthetic sensibility.</p>

            <p>The abundant wealth of the <name type="pname">Edwardian era</name>, though concentrated in the hands of a few, provided the means for a flowering of the arts that has not been matched since. It was in this world of privilege that <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name> made his mark as an artist. Although overlooked today, a century ago <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> was on the verge of becoming a fashionable society artist. His body of work includes approximately 50 medals, produced in <name type="place">England</name> and the <name type="place">United States</name>.</p>
            <p>In the introductory text, I will discuss only a portion of <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> work. The accompanying catalogue is, however, as complete as I have been able to compile. I began to accumulate information on these medals about ten years ago, and have long put off publishing anything until now because there are so many questions for which I have not been able to find answers; not the least of which are the identities of many of the small portrait medals <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> produced. However, the occasion of a second COAC on medals has inspired me to publish what I have found in the hopes that someone might be able to provide additional information about the artist and his work.</p>

            <p>For someone who had access to the highest levels of society, surprisingly little is known about <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> life. He appears to have destroyed virtually all private papers prior to his death, and is rarely mentioned in biographies and histories. Therefore, most of the little we do know comes from his highly readable, but carefully guarded 1925 autobiography.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name> was born in <name type="place">Vienna</name> in 1866 (<ref target="#fig-120">fig. 1</ref>). His father, who was born in <name type="place">Hungary</name>, married the <name type="pname">boss's</name> daughter and after moving to <name type="place">Vienna</name> became a reasonably successful businessman. In addition to an older brother who died prior to <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> birth, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> had at least one sister, <name type="pname">Renee</name>; neither sibling ever married. Raised largely by his father, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> entered the family business after leaving college. Finding he had neither the inclination nor the ability for commerce, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> obtained his father's permission and enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts where he studied sculpture and drawing. While at the Academy, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> also studied piano at the <name type="place">Vienna</name> Conservatory (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 3-12). Thus began what <name type="pname">Mark Jones</name> so aptly described as "a curious career as cosmopolitan, socialite and portraitist to the international rich" (<name type="pname">Jones</name> p.23).</p>
            <p>Shortly after the death of his parents in around 1888, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> went to <name type="place">Berlin</name> where he studied under Professor <name type="pname">Schaper</name>. The Professor's remark that <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> "...knew nothing about sculpture" apparently came as no surprise to the student (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p.13). However, after some serious study, <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> abilities seems to have improved, so that during his two years in <name type="place">Berlin</name> he was awarded a number of minor commissions from the court and a traveling scholarship to Rome (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp.16-19). While in Rome, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> embarked upon a five year project of a marble statue entitled "Mother Love," for which he eventually received a gold medal from the Art Association of <name type="place">Munich</name> (<ref target="#fig-121">fig. 2</ref>). Described by Fuchs as "a monument to the love and unflinching suffering of motherhood," it might also be described as Victorian sentimentality at its worst (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 25-30). Though poorly designed, it was well executed, and for our purposes, hints at the medallic work which would soon follow. Within the pedestal of the statue were four bronze panels (<ref target="#fig-122">fig. 3</ref>); two in high relief and two in relief that Fuchs described it as "a form of <hi rend="italic">relievo</hi> so low that it might almost be termed a painting in stone. This is the most difficult. To distinguish the modeling at all, it has to be illuminated by sharp light which will throw deep shadow. Its application is particularly well suited for medals and was practiced by Roty, Dupré and Bottée to best advantage" (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 30).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>While in Rome, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> received commissions for portraits and busts, including those from <name type="pname">Alexandra Ellis</name>, daughter of <name type="pname">Arthur Ellis</name>, Equerry to the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>, and Mrs. <name type="pname">Carl Meyer</name>, whose husband was the manager for the <name type="place">London</name> Rothschilds. As the bust of Mrs. <name type="pname">Meyer</name> could not be finished prior to her return to <name type="place">London</name>, <name type="pname">John Singer Sergeant</name> offered Fuchs the use of one of his <name type="place">London</name> studios (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 32).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> arrived in <name type="place">London</name> in the summer of 1897. Having soon set up his own studio in <name type="place">Kensington</name>, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> continued to work on his bust of Mrs. <name type="pname">Meyer</name>, as well as receive new commissions. He was also introduced to General <name type="pname">Arthur Ellis</name> and received a commission for a bust of his youngest daughter (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 35-37). Beginning in 1898 <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> executed a series of small portrait medals of <name type="place">London</name> society. Among the first was a commission by <name type="pname">Lady Randolph Churchill</name> shortly after the
<pb n="181"/>
return of her son <name type="pname">Winston</name> from <name type="place">South Africa</name> (Catalogue no. 3). According to <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>, she "commissioned me to make a small medal with the profiles of her two boys one on each side, which she always wore around her neck. It was considered a novel idea and led to a sort of fashion..." (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 50-51).</p>

            <p>Other medals commissioned according to this "fashion" include two for the <name type="pname">Rothschilds</name>. Mrs. <name type="pname">Leopold de Rothschild</name> commissioned a medal of her boys <name type="pname">Anthony and Evelyn</name> (catalogue no. 4), while <name type="pname">Baron Alphonse de Rothschild</name> ordered one of his daughter <name type="pname">Charlotte Beatrix</name>, who married <name type="pname">Maurice Ephrussi</name> (catalogue no. 25). Medals were struck
<pb n="182"/>
for Sir <name type="pname">Ernest Cassel</name> and his daughter <name type="pname">Maude</name>, who was married to <name type="pname">Wilfred Ashley</name> (catalogue no. 2); their daughter <name type="pname">Edwina</name> later married <name type="pname">Lord Louis Mountbatten</name>. The memorial to <name type="pname">Maude Ashley</name> in <name type="pname">Ramsey Cathedral</name> by Fuchs includes the image from his medal of her (catalogue no. 9; <ref target="#fig-123">fig. 4</ref>).</p>

            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> probably owed much of his popularity as a medalist to another patron, however, the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>. Shortly after the youngest <name type="pname">Miss Ellis's</name> engagement, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> prepared a small portrait medal of her father, which he attached to a small chain as a bracelet and presented as a wedding present (catalogue no. 1). Not surprisingly, the General was
<pb n="183"/>
pleased with his portrait and ordered more, which he had placed in ashtrays, cigarette cases and other small objects which were distributed as Christmas presents. Among the recipients was the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>, who ordered a similar medal in June 1899. At one of the sittings, the Prince prepared two autographs with his initials and the date September 9, 1899 and requested that the medals be ready by that time (catalogue no. 6). Unfortunately, the significance of that date has so far proven elusive. A second reverse was also paired with the same portrait, displaying the Prince's insignia of feathers and the date 1899 (catalogue no. 7). One hundred such medals were ordered and distributed at Christmas of the same year (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 64-67).</p>
            <p>Additional commissions from the royal family followed the medal for the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>. One of these was for a large silver medal depicting the Princess of Wales (catalogue no. 20). According to <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>, <name type="pname">Alexandra</name> was greatly interested in the production of this medal. In a note dated December 6, 1900, <name type="pname">Charlotte Knollys</name> (Lady in Waiting to the Princess of Wales) informed <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> that, "The Princess's favorite flower is the rose, but H.R.H. is very anxious that you should make the background of the medal as <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> and delicate as the one in the 'War and Peace'<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> medal, which she admires particularly. I may tell you in confidence that the Princess does not wish to have her name placed in <hi rend="italic">relief</hi>, as in the case of the reverse of the Prince's medal, as she thinks it makes it look hard and cutting." In another note dated December 29, <name type="pname">Knollys</name> wrote, "The Princess says you were consulting together about the inscription to be put on the back of her medal, so I write one line to tell you privately that I am sure the one she would like best would be 'Princess of Pity,' as several of the newspapers have called her lately" (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 115-117).</p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> adopted these suggestions. The Princess's name, found beneath the bust is incuse, and the border design consisting of ribbons and roses is softly modelled. To complement the description of the "Princess of Pity" is the reverse design of Faith, Hope and Charity. These medals, which were struck in two sizes, were used as Christmas presents in 1901.</p>
            <p>At the request of Queen <name type="pname">Victoria</name>, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> produced two medals to mark the entry of her reign into the new century. The larger of the two, which was also produced in two sizes, depicts a crowned bust of the Queen on the obverse, and a figure standing on a globe and bearing a facsimile autograph on the reverse (catalogue no. 18). The second medal, a smaller, more informal medal meant for the Queen's family,
<pb n="184"/>
portrays <name type="pname">Victoria</name> in the cloth cap she normally wore, and her signature on the reverse (catalogue no. 17; Fuchs pp. 101-109). Shortly afterwards, in January 1901, Queen <name type="pname">Victoria</name> died and was succeeded by her son, the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>, now <name type="pname">Edward VII</name>. Along with the new reign came additional commissions for <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-124">

               <p>fig. 5</p>
            </figure>
            <p>On April 23, 1901 the King asked <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> his views concerning a coronation medal and soon received a commission for one medal. Following a practice initiated with <name type="pname">Victoria's</name> Golden Jubilee in 1887, two official medals were issued, a table medal for sale to collectors and a military medal to be awarded to participants. Basing his design on the <name type="pname">St. Helena</name> medal, which was instituted under <name type="pname">Napoleon III</name> and awarded to veterans of <name type="pname">Napoleon's</name> campaigns (<ref target="#fig-124">fig. 5</ref>), <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> prepared two slightly different versions of the military medal (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> 161-162). The first, awarded to those who took part in the coronation ceremony, is slightly oval and depicts crowned busts of <name type="pname">Edward</name> and <name type="pname">Alexandra</name>, left, within a border composed of laurel wreaths surmounted by a crown; on the reverse is the royal cypher within a similar border (catalogue no. 32). A second version, on a round planchet with the portraits reversed was issued to <name type="pname">Lord Mayors</name> and other civic officials who took part in the ceremonies (catalogue no. 33). In comparison is the official commemorative medal by de Saulles (<ref target="#fig-125">fig. 6</ref>). Besides the enormous difference in style, the cross on top of the crown is noteworthy; most artists depict the cross on top of the crown sideways so that it is recognizable as a cross. In fact, when seen from the side, one would only see a vertical bar; <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>, despite his impressionistic style, often strove for accuracy in detail.</p>
            <pb n="185"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-125">

            </figure>
            <p>Considering his relative obscurity today, it is perhaps surprising to note that some of <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> medals were enormous commercial successes. <name type="pname">Elkington</name>, which struck the military style coronation medals received permission to use the reversed portraits on commercial medals. For this, Fuchs designed a reverse portraying a seated Britannia with Westminster Abbey in the background. On the shield is the date of the coronation, June 26, 1902 (catalogue no. 34). When the King suffered an attack of acute appendicitis, the date for both the coronation and the medal were changed to August 9. <name type="pname">Elkington</name> also paired the obverse design with many local reverse dies. Altogether, some 950,000 medals were sold, although orders for 40,000 were canceled when the King became ill (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 162).</p>
            <pb n="186"/>
            <p>While in <name type="place">England</name>, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> also designed a number of medals relating to the Boer War. Three relate to heroes of the war, General Sir <name type="pname">Robert Baden-Powell</name> (catalogue no. 26), <name type="pname">Field Marshall Lord Roberts</name> (catalogue nos. 22 and 23) and General Sir <name type="pname">George White</name> (catalogue no. 24). In 1900 <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> prepared a medal marking the end of the war and bearing the inscription TO THE/ MEMORY OF THOSE/WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR/QUEEN AND COUNTRY (catalogue no. 21). In 1902, when the war finally did end, the medal was reissued, but with the new date and the inscription changed to read KING AND COUNTRY (catalogue no. 36).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> came to the <name type="place">United States</name> for the first time in order to finish a portrait and began the custom of spending his winters in <name type="place">New York</name>, supplying art for the rich, though not necessarily discerning Americans (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p.188). In 1906 Fuchs received his first medallic commission in this country, a membership medal for the Hispanic Society of <name type="place">America</name> (catalogue no. 39). At the time, the Society consisted of up to 300 corresponding members; between 1906 and 1924 they were awarded bronze membership medals. From those 300, no more than 100 members were named and presented with silver medals (HSA p. 38).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> produced a second medal for the Hispanic Society when he was commissioned to design their Medal of Arts and Literature (catalogue no. 40). Approximately 4 inches in diameter, this impressive medal has been awarded since 1907 to "men and women distinguished in the field of Hispanic art, history, or literature" (HSA p. 38). The obverse depicts the seated figure of Inspiration surrounded by eight female figures representing the arts, while on the reverse is a Genius seated on a sarcophagus, kissing a standing female. This medal was first struck by <name type="pname">Tiffany</name> &amp; Co., and later by the Medallic Art Co..</p>
            <p>Between 1908 and 1913, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> designed three medals for the American Numismatic Society. The first was a double commemorative honoring both the 50th anniversary of the A.N.S. and its President, <name type="pname">Archer M. Huntington</name> (catalogue no. 41). During the Fiftieth Anniversary meeting<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>
               <name type="pname">Huntington</name> cancelled the Society's $25,000. loan, leaving the Society free from debt (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> pp. 148-150). A resolution by <name type="pname">George F. Kunz</name> was unanimously adopted calling for a medal in <name type="pname">Huntington's</name> honor bearing a portrait of <name type="pname">Huntington</name> on the obverse and a picture of the new building on the reverse. Although <name type="pname">Victor D. Brenner</name> had previously submitted some sketches for just such a medal to <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name> for circulation among the members of the committee on medals, the commission was eventually given to
<pb n="187"/>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>. In keeping with <name type="pname">Huntington's</name> wishes, his portrait was not used. On the obverse, therefore, is a coining press with a male figure on either side while a third male is seated in front examining a coin; above is the inscription <name type="pname">ARCHER MILTON HUNTINGTON</name> MEDAL. On the reverse a standing female figure holds a scroll upon which is a representation of the Society's building and an appropriate inscription noting the organization's 50th anniversary. One gold medal was struck and presented to <name type="pname">Huntington</name>; of the eleven silver specimens struck, one was reserved for the Society's cabinet. Since 1918, silver specimens have been awarded to individuals in recognition of outstanding achievement in numismatic scholarship. In addition, bronze medals were both offered for sale to members and presented to contributors to the Exhibition of <name type="place">United States</name> Coins held from January 17 to February 18, 1914, and to the Exhibition of March 26 to May 15, 1914 (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> pp. 175-177).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> second medal on behalf of the American Numismatic Society was struck in 1909 to mark the <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> Celebration (catalogue no. 42). Issued in conjunction with the <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> Celebration Commission, it was struck in six sizes in a variety of medals, and might rank as the most common of all <name type="place">United States</name> commemorative medals, with a total of 124,698 struck. The obverse portrays <name type="pname">Hudson</name> and his men on the deck of his ship, the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Halve Maene</name>
               </hi>, while the reverse depicts allegorical representations of Steam Navigation, History and Commerce beneath a portrait of <name type="pname">Robert Fulton</name>; in the background are views of <name type="place">New York</name> in 1807 and 1909 (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> pp. 177-178).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> went to great lengths to insure the accuracy of design of this medal including several trips to <name type="place">Holland</name> to obtain official sanction for his portrayal of the <hi rend="italic">Half Moon.</hi> Surprisingly, the greatest difficulty seems to have come from the name of the ship; after the determination that the proper spelling was 'Halve Maene,' dies were prepared, only to have papers received from <name type="place">Holland</name> illustrating the reproduction of <name type="pname">Hudson's</name> ship, the 'Halve Maen.' Frantic cables to Dutch authorities confirmed their original determination that the name of the ship should include the final 'e' (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> pp. 179-180). Similar problems arose with the depiction of the Claremont; after the plaster models were delivered to the die sinker, they were altered twice as changes were made in the construction of the replica of the ship (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> p. 180).</p>
            <p>In 1913 <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> was commissioned to design a medal in memory of <name type="pname">John Pierpont Morgan</name>, who had died earlier that year (catalogue no.
<pb n="188"/>
43). According to the Society's annual report for 1913, the medal was issued in recognition of <name type="pname">Morgan's</name> work in support of art <hi rend="italic">(ANS Proceedings</hi>, p.12). Struck in the exceedingly low relief which characterizes many of <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> medals, the obverse depicts the facade of a building with four columns; from a niche in the center descends Art; the allegorical groups on either side represent painting and sculpture. On the reverse, flanked by allegorical figures representing Fame and Industry, is a plaque with the simple inscription <name type="pname">JOHN/PIERPONT/MORGAN</name>. The single gold specimen was presented to Mr. <name type="pname">Morgan's</name> family and resides in the famed library today; additional specimens in bronze and silver were, as usual, available for purchase.</p>
            <p>For a number of years <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> divided his time between <name type="place">England</name> and the <name type="place">United States</name>. He had previously suffered verbal attacks as a foreigner when he was commissioned to design the new postage stamps for <name type="pname">Edward VII</name>. Now, even though a naturalized British subject, he suffered even more as a result of the anti-German feeling prevalent after the start of World War I. In this he was not alone; even <name type="pname">George V</name> was not exempt. <name type="pname">H. G. Wells</name>, who had urged the formation of Republican societies, referred to the Court as "alien and uninspiring." In his characteristic bluntness, the king remarked "I may be uninspiring but I'll be damned if I'm an alien!" (<name type="pname">Edwards</name> p. 300). <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> decided to wait out the war in the <name type="place">United States</name>. When, after the armistice he had written to a friend<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> to see if popular feelings had changed, he was advised to wait a year or so (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 175). By that time, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> had become engaged in another project and eventually gave up the idea of returning to <name type="place">England</name>,<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> and was naturalized as a <name type="place">United States</name> citizen in 1924 (Petition).</p>
            <p>The end of World War I was marked not only by <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> disappointment in not returning to <name type="place">England</name>, but also by a commemorative plaquette issued by <name type="pname">Cartier</name> (catalogue no. 44). World War I changed the popular notion of war from that of a gentlemanly pursuit to an act of horror. This change is reflected in <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> work; whereas the Boer War medal depicts war and its resultant deaths in sentimental terms, the World War I medal depicts it as something more graphic and personal.</p>
            <p>Even though he was now living in a republic, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> had not given up on his attachment to the upper class, producing medals for the <name type="pname">Cartier</name> and <name type="pname">Heinz</name> families, as well as a number of corporate pieces. One of these, for the <name type="pname">H. J. Heinz</name> Company, was struck in gold for presentation to those employees who had served the company twelve years (catalogue no. 46). First issued in 1922, over 500 medals were issued
<pb n="189"/>
the first year (<hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi>, May 1922 p. 235).</p>
            <p>In 1926 Fuchs produced two medals for the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Times;</hi> one was for The National Oratorical Contest on the Constitution of the <name type="pname">United States</name>, open to all students in secondary schools (catalogue no. 55). The country was divided into seven regions, each under the sponsorship of a different newspaper. The region for the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Times</hi> consisted of the Metropolitan area and parts of <name type="place">New York State, New Jersey</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name>. Students in each of 64 districts submitted essays on any of ten subjects related to the Constitution, with each school picking its own winner. The winners would then compete at the district, regional, national and international level. Although cash prizes were awarded to all winners at the district level and higher, medals were presented to the winners at each school.</p>
            <p>According to the report on the oratorical contest, response to the contest was one of optimistic enthusiasm; of the 417 schools entered, only 275 produced actual candidates for competition. Nationally, an estimated 15,000 students participated. Although a number of suggestions were made that separate contests be held for boys and girls, the idea was rejected; to quote the report "But the holding of dual contests would be a tremendous, if not unworkable, proposition. Boys and girls nowadays are supposed to enjoy equality in all things - why not in competition?" (Report "Separating Boys and Girls").</p>
            <p>The second <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> medal, for the Intercollegiate Current Events Contest (catalogue no. 56), was instituted to "stimulate undergraduate interest in what is going on in the world outside college walls as such happenings are reflected in the printed news from day to day." The winners in each school were awarded a medal and $250, and the intercollegiate champion $500. Eleven schools participated in the first year of competition, increasing to 19 schools for the second year in 1927 <hi rend="italic">(<name type="place">New York</name> Times</hi>, Nov. 7, 1926 p. 4).</p>
            <p>Although he achieved a moderate success in the <name type="place">United States</name>, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> never attained here the social position or happiness he enjoyed in <name type="place">England</name>. In fact, although the idea of writing his memoirs emerged, at the earliest, in 1924, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> makes little mention of his work after 1914. There are, however, hints of his becoming less fashionable.<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> In addition, the times were changing, and Fuchs did not appreciate the new art, claiming that "In the present tendency in sculpture in <name type="place">America</name> I notice a leaning of a group of gifted young sculptors towards Byzantinism, if I may so call it. I believe it is as great a waste of their energies, their time and their talents as it was for <name type="pname">Thorvaldsen</name> and
<pb n="190"/>
               <name type="pname">Canova</name> with their imitations of classicism" (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 238).</p>
            <p>On January 13, 1929 <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name> shot and killed himself in his studio and apartment at the Hotel des Artistes in <name type="place">New York</name> City. He had been unsuccessfully operated on for stomach cancer the preceding June, and although the exact nature of his illness was kept from him, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> knew he was dying. He left a note to his sister which read:
<q>Dear <name type="pname">Renee</name>:</q>
               <q>You can see with your own eyes that I am going down every day. You would not like to see me wasting away much more. As it is now, I am already a burden to myself and a burden to my surroundings.</q>
               <q>There are moments in life when we have to accept in humble resignation what is decreed to us. To live longer would only mean prolonging my agony. Fondest love.</q>
               <q>Your brother, <name type="pname">EMIL</name>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon his death, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> was described by his secretary as "modest, sensitive. He would never consent to have his picture taken. He would not even sit for a portrait for any of his best artist friends. I only know of one picture of him—although there are probably others—and that is a snap shot I made of him myself" <hi rend="italic">(<name type="place">New York</name> Times Jan.</hi> 14, 1929 p. 1).</p>

                  <p>Although Brown attributes this and the following medal to 1901, in which year Roberts was created an Earl and Knight of the Garter, I have placed it under 1900; the date on the medal itself. A number of pieces, such as the 1902 coronation medal, indicate a design which predates issuance; in such cases I have placed the medals in the year of the event noted. However, in cases such as the Roberts medals, where there is no clear indication of a specific event, I have used, when indicated, the date placed with the artist's signature.</p>

                  <p>This medal was extremely popular, with 950,000 having been sold at the time the coronation was postponed due to the King having been stricken with an attack of appendicitis. As a result, orders for 40,000 were cancelled. The 64mm medal is also seen with the date of the actual coronation, 9 August 1902. The obverse was paired with many local reverse dies, and the large number of medals ordered presumably includes these.</p>

                  <p>The 76 mm medals were issued by the American Numismatic Society. Two gold medals were struck and presented to the presidents of the American Numismatic Society and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. An additional eight medals were struck in <name type="pname">virgin Alaskan</name> gold by Tiffany &amp; Co. for presentation to the heads of nations represented by warships at the <name type="pname">Hudson—Fulton</name> celebration, the United States, Great Britain, the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, <name type="place">Germany</name>, <name type="place">France</name>, <name type="place">Italy</name>, <name type="place">Mexico</name>, and the Argentine Republic; the edge of each was engraved "To the Government of (name of Government) from the <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> Celebration Commission, September 25 - October 9, 1909" (Hall 1112). The design was adopted by the <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> Celebration Committee for the official medal; a total of 124,698 medals were issued. Apart from the eight gold presentation medals, all were struck by <name type="pname">Whitehead &amp; Hoag</name>. The accompanying chart (<ref target="#fig-151">fig. 7</ref>: Hall p. 81) indicates the sizes, compositions and uses of each. The single 76mm gilt bronze specimen known to the writer is marked SAMPLE BRONZE on the edge.</p>
                  <p>Officially, there is no obverse or reverse. According to <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name> "By reason of the importance and distinctive character of each design, neither supplementing the other, and because the events commemorated occurred two hundred years apart, the faces of the medal do not properly come under the customary designation of obverse and reverse. There is no reverse to describe or illustrate the obverse; each side is complete by itself. Chronologically the Hudson side would be the obverse and the Fulton side the reverse. Practically this technical relation will change according to the artistic tastes or sympathies of the observer. In order to facilitate the exhibition and examination of each

side, from time to time, as may be desired, some of the cases prepared by the Commission for the presentation examples have been made to hang or stand, so that the medal may be reversed in position" (Hall p. 82).</p>

                  <p>Issued by Cartier, the bronze medals were priced at $10. and the silver at $20. Fuchs had previously submitted a design to the American Numismatic Society for its Peace medal. The Society eventually awarded the commission to Chester Beach. Although there is no documentation to support this theory, it is possible that this medal reflects that rejected design.</p>

            <p>The turn of the twentieth century in the United States saw an unprecedented rise of interest in medallic art. One of the most intriguing manifestations of this interest was the formation of a group called the Circle of Friends of the Medallion, organized by <name type="pname">Charles De Kay</name> and <name type="pname">Robert Hewitt</name> Jr. in 1909. The Circle was an organization with one goal in mind: to support the production and appreciation of medallic art. Or in the words of Charles De Kay, "It has been the aim of the founders of this little circle to call the attention of American sculptors and art amateurs to sculpture in the miniature, with the hope that in the course of time improvements will be made in our coinage and our monuments" (De Kay). The background of the Circle has been detailed before; I intend to concentrate on the role of Charles De Kay in its founding, and more importantly, its character as regards the dissemination of aesthetic taste in the United States during the early years of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>To briefly summarize the history of the Circle: <name type="pname">Robert Hewitt</name>, real estate speculator, long-time numismatist, and one of the founders of the American Numismatic Society, came up with the idea of issuing a series of medals which probably developed as a result of his travels to Europe and from the success of his private issuance of a Lincoln commemorative medal bound in a book. In Europe he was able to see the products of two societies, the Société des Amis de la Medaille Franéaise in <name type="place">Paris</name>, and the Société Hollandaise Beige des Amis de la Medaille d'Art in Brussels, both of which issued medals in this fashion. At some point, and the details are sketchy, <name type="pname">Hewitt and De Kay</name> came together, and began working on a project that would culminate in the Circle. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was the perfect person to work with <name type="pname">Hewitt</name>. He was very well known in <name type="place">New York</name> literary and cultural circles. He was a graduate of Yale, wrote poetry, served as the literary and art critic for the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Times</hi> from 1877 to 1894, and had a second career as a frequenter and founder of clubs. Among those he was influential in founding were the Author's Club in 1881, the Fencers' Club in 1888, the National Sculpture Society in 1893, and the National Arts Club in 1898. While Hewitt provided the funds for the organization, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was responsible for publicity, and authored most of the texts that accompanied each issue. He provided the contacts and the organizational know-how to launch the fledgling Circle.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">De Kay</name> and <name type="pname">Hewitt</name> envisioned a charter membership of several hundred individuals interested in small sculpture and medallic art. It was intended that the membership would receive medals and perhaps

little bas-reliefs or statuettes. An early announcement of the Circle stated, "Such small portable works for the library and office do more than monuments to give people a feel for sculpture and form the habit of looking at art works with understanding and appreciation" (<hi rend="italic">Art News</hi> 1910). The name for the organization was chosen to reflect the hope that "from a modest beginning it may extend its influence in all directions, like the widening circle a stone makes when it plumps into still water" (De Kay 1913). De Kay wrote of the Circle at the time of the issuance of Isidor Konti's medal in honor of the Home,
<q>Little organizations of this kind, of which the public rarely hears, perform a serious work in the encouragement of art. Though it may be true that the great artists of the Renaissance flourished principally by reason of the support received from munificent patrons—aristocrats of Church and State—in our different times it is very appropriate that the individual patron should be partly relieved by an organization of patrons working for the best interests of art, with the wisdom which mutual council gives (De Kay).</q>

            <p>The first medal was issued in September 1909, to coincide with the Hudson-Fulton Celebration; the second appeared in May 1910. In total, 12 medals were issued, approximately two per year (see Appendix).<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> The works were distributed to the membership of the Circle, who paid ten dollars a year in dues, and received their medals

            </figure>
            <p>The process of selecting a design for issuance in medallic form was left in the hands of the Circle's Art Committee. The Committee would choose a subject, and then ask a particular sculptor to work up a design. If that sculptor saw something in the subject, he would make a sketch; if not, he would come up with his own subject and design. As De Kay wrote, "The object is to get the best a man has in him" (De Kay 1913). The choice of sculptors was by commission, not by competition.</p>
            <p>De Kay's motives in co-founding the Circle were many and varied. He was concerned with the role of artists in contemporary American society, the role of art in the same, the aesthetic education of the public, and the furtherance of an appreciation of sculpture, specifically in the form of medallic art. In one of the many articles he authored, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> discussed the role of artists in contemporary society.
<q>The problem for our artists consists in making their products popular in the higher sense, not vulgarly popular, but adapted to the present needs of their fellow-countrymen. Portraits and mural paintings ordered by municipality or private citizen meet this problem so far as they go. But their scope is very limited....[T]he ordinary well-to-do citizen is far from feeling the need of sculpture and painting as an integral part of the surroundings of his home. One reason for this fact is the aloofness of painters and sculptors from the daily life of the communities in which they live....Our artists should realize the situation and meet it. For one thing they should react against their very unfortunate but very natural ten-
<pb n="239"/>
dency to segregate themselves into small circles, or retire entirely to themselves in their studios. They should remember that, no matter what particular phrase or school of art they admire and try to work in, there is a larger aspect of the problem in which these things sink to the second plane (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900a, 23).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In other words, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> believed artists must learn to embrace other disciplines/professions and their practitioners. Doing so would enable them to stay in touch with the tastes of their audience, thereby remaining viable. By creating works like medals to be distributed to a wide audience, sculptors would literally be making themselves more relevant to contemporary American society.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">De Kay</name> realized that there were two sides to this discussion. He also believed that lay people needed to become involved in aesthetic appreciation. Therefore, to explain his interest in the founding of an organization like the Circle, De Kay wrote,
<q>Although the issuing of medals has increased greatly in this country in recent years, sculptors feel the need of a wider education of the public in that branch of their art. Such organizations as the Circle of Friends of the Medallion and the Numismatic Society, while their medals appeal especially to the artist and the collector, also hope to foster a proper interest and appreciation among laymen. For a collection of medallions and other small bas-reliefs is apt to promote a taste for and an understanding of sculpture (<name type="pname">De Kay</name>).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In publication after publication De Kay tried to impress upon numismatists the aesthetic value of their treasured objects. In order to fully appreciate medals, their clubs and societies should look at them from the viewpoint of the artist. To illustrate the importance of an aesthetic appreciation of medals, he made pointed references to the societies in Paris, Brussels and Vienna as precursors to the Circle. What would make the Circle different however, was the mounting of the medals in a book, which not only made the works easier to forward to the membership, but was also done for the convenience of those without a wall-case or other piece of furniture designed for displaying medals.</p>
            <p>The role of medallic art in daily life was a topic that occupied much of <name type="pname">De Kay's</name> time. He wrote,
<q>It is indeed remarkable what a hold small sculpture—whether in the round or in high relief or in plaque and medal—has taken on modern life.... Perhaps the growth of great cities has something
<pb n="240"/>
to do with [the increase of interest in small works]. Certainly it has become more and more costly to own city homes which have sufficient wall space for large paintings....But even small easel pictures find scant wall accommodation in the homes of the cliff-dwellers' of <name type="place">New York</name>. There is still room, however, for a fine medallion or medal, a bit of animal bronze, or a figurine for the mantel or table (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1909, 25).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Obviously, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> saw medallic art, in which he had a vested interest, as a way of introducing art into the home. This is just another example from De Kay's writings that illustrate his many motives for co-founding the Circle.</p>
            <p>As part of his role within the Circle, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> authored many articles publicizing the medals. One of the more interesting was published in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> in 1913. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> offered these words:
<q>[The] seven pieces [issued so far] are truly works of fine art wrought by our own sculptors, each working according to his own method. The result is no stereotyped series, but in every instance the expression of a separate individual....There is no other society like the Circle which devotes itself to the spreading of a love of sculpture in relief among amateurs and stimulates artists to work in this charming branch (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1913a, 136).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the same spirit of publicity <name type="pname">De Kay</name> also published articles on <name type="pname">Isidor Konti</name> and <name type="pname">Sigurd Neandross</name>, two of the medalists commissioned by the Circle. Konti's medal, issued in 1910, was described by <name type="pname">De Kay</name> as striking the fancy of connoisseurs. "Konti's medal has made a very real appeal....[T]hough the subject lends itself easily to dramatic treatment, the sculptor...has been particularly fortunate in the simplicity and sincerity of his work" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name>). <name type="pname">Sigurd Neandross</name>, who designed the 8th issue in 1913, was a sculptor whom <name type="pname">De Kay</name> greatly admired. "He belongs to the rarer kind of sculptor who makes one think....He is a sculptor with temperament who goes his own way, endeavoring to express lovely and innocent and poetic feelings to the best of his ability through his chosen art" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1914, xxii.).</p>
            <p>He also discussed some of the other medals in articles devoted to such topics as "fine art in medals." Of the power of <name type="pname">John Mowbray-Clarke's Saint Brendan</name> to appeal to the public he wrote, "The sculptor...has imagined the doughty Saint as a man better suited to steer a ship and swing a spear than to expound the Christian faith to men and women of peace." Of <name type="pname">Victor David Brenner's</name> Motherhood medal he had this to say: "By bringing out the Motherhood medal the
<pb n="241"/>
Circle seems to wish to accentuate the policy of departing now and again from the custom of reserving medals and plaques as honors for individuals. It is well to remember that sculpture on a small scale has a wider scope than merely portraiture or the commemoration of events in history" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1911,21). The first medal issued by the Circle was obviously dear to De Kay's heart, and he wrote of it, <name type="pname">John Flanagan's</name>
               <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> medal, "Here we find, in the delicate modeling of Fulton's profile, the contrast between <name type="pname">Elizabethan ruff</name> and <name type="pname">Georgian jabot</name>, the dignity given to the lettering; how differently from a painter a sculptor will treat a theme" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1909, 25). This last comment was directed at the official medal of the Celebration, by <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name>. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> does not seem to have approved of Fuchs's medal; he wrote,
<q>the official is pictorial and popular, while the Circle's will appeal to those who have learned by study to appreciate the sculpturesque side of such small works of art. Viewed from the sculptor's camp, the modelling of the Fuchs medal is soft and evasive in form, while the <name type="pname">Flanagan</name> attacks the problem and carries it out to the best of the sculptor's ability. The painter tries skillfully to evade the difficulty of human figures and draperies, and enlists interest in the general picture; the sculptor, while he does not solve these problems at all points in the very best way, does not avoid the issue, but meets them as they rise (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1909, 25).</q>
               <q>De Kay's comments on the Circle's medals reveal a not unexpected bias in their favor; at the same time, however, they express a heartfelt belief in the relevance of the Circle and its mission.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of interest is how <name type="pname">De Kay</name> came to be so actively involved with the Circle. As mentioned, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was a strong force in the organization of a number of institutions in <name type="place">New York</name> in the late years of the nineteenth century. Two of these organizations, the National Sculpture Society and the National Arts Club, figure prominently in this investigation.</p>
            <p>The National Sculpture Society, of which almost all of the Circle's medalists were members, was conceived as a counterpart to the specialized artists' clubs and societies that set exhibitions as their priority, and as a professional society that could control quality and set standards. Because of its priorities, personalities, and relationships with other organizations, it relied on the involvement of non-sculptors. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was instrumental in convincing sculptor <name type="pname">Frederic Ruckstull</name> help him develop the idea for the Society after hearing of an "altercation" over the poor placement of Ruckstull's works at a Society of American Artists exhibition. <name type="pname">Ruckstull</name> had persuaded <name type="pname">De Kay</name> that sculpture shown with
<pb n="242"/>
painting would never receive the kind of installation it deserved. In turn, De Kay became convinced that a sculpture society that held its own exhibitions would solve these kinds of problems, and convinced <name type="pname">Ruckstull</name> to help him organize it. In order to recruit members they needed to overcome the sense of individualism felt by American sculptors. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> and <name type="pname">Ruckstull</name> were afraid that the idea of a society devoted exclusively to sculpture would sound too commercial and nonprofessional and it would be impossible to get sculptors to join. After securing the cooperation of <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name>, <name type="pname">Olin Levi Warner</name> and <name type="pname">John Quincy Adams</name> Ward, De Kay became the primary force behind the organizational drive. He sent invitations to prospective members, inviting them to an organizational meeting at the home of his brother-in-law and <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> editor <name type="pname">Richard Watson Gilder</name>. As a result of his efforts, the Society became a reality on May 30, 1893.<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref> Of primary interest is the fact that De Kay was instrumental in pushing lay participation. As <name type="pname">Michelle Bogart</name> has pointed out, "An American sculpture society could not be like those of <name type="place">Europe</name>; it had to be in keeping with the distinctive social and political framework of a democratic republic to advance truly national forms of artistic expression" (Bogart 1989, 53). The American artists' organizations that were forming during these years were closing the gap between art and the larger public, both well-to-do and working class. This broad public was, in De Kay's view, the American audience for art. A society like the NSS, with lay members who were asked to share the burden of "keeping their society alive" better suited, in De Kay's view, the social and political ideas of Americans. These lay people would act as the backing for the artists, drumming up support, acting as spokesmen. In defending the NSS De Kay wrote, "What country other than ours has arrived at any period at such a pitch of the cultivation and subdivision in the cultivation of the fine arts as to establish a separate society for sculptors, and to give independent exhibitions of sculpture without the aid of painting or some other of the more popular arts?...We are better off as we are than <name type="place">France</name> or <name type="place">Germany</name>, and the proof is that the biennial exhibitions of the National Sculpture Society surpass anything the old countries have to show" (De Kay 1898, 140). The presence of laymen within the Society was of primary importance to <name type="pname">De Kay</name>. He wrote, "With a wider and deeper feeling for the arts, the world of amateurs will take more interest in bronzes for the decoration of houses within and without....To aid the spread of this taste is one of the objects of the National Sculpture Society, which seeks to encourage the making of figurines and small
<pb n="243"/>
groups that come within the means of people of moderate fortune...." (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1895, 112).</p>
            <p>The second, and more relevant, organization which De Kay was instrumental in founding was the National Arts Club. More relevant because, for its entire existence, the Circle was headquartered at the Club and, in fact, the Club was designed with artists and lay people equally in mind. The Club was conceived in a conversation between <name type="pname">De Kay</name> and <name type="pname">John DeWitt Warner</name>, President of the Reform Club of <name type="place">New York</name>, after a February 1898 meeting of the National Sculpture Society, of which they were both members. <name type="pname">De Kay</name>, while serving as the American Consul-General in Berlin from 1894 to 1897, had noted the eagerness of European governments to encourage, through exhibitions, the application of art to industry in order to enable them to keep in touch with movements in other countries. By June of 1898 the National Arts Club was incorporated.</p>
            <p>The United States was, in the late years of the nineteenth century, a recent entry into the arena of the application of art to industry. No American museums were devoted to it, there were no societies to look after the interests of those practicing it. The National Arts Club was founded specifically to remedy this situation. The mission of the Club was threefold: first, to champion applied and decorative arts; second, to create an organization that crossed existing arts organizational boundaries; and third, to encourage the participation of lay people in the arts community. One observer wrote,
<q>There are abundant purposes a truly National Arts Club might cherish, abundant aims it might set before it. There is the encouragement of industries on which art has been expended, leaving the fine arts to the established societies and clubs. There is the giving of exhibitions of special work, at which employers of skilled labor could see which designers and workers are inventive and talented, and artists and art students pick up suggestions for bread-winning. There is the binding together with the bonds of a common interest the art lovers of the whole country, enabling men and women from San Francisco and New Orleans when visiting <name type="place">New York</name> to find themselves in congenial atmosphere, if they are amateurs themselves, and giving manufacturers of the most varied sort ideas how to handle their products so as to surpass their rivals abroad (<hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> 1899, 350-351).</q>
            </p>
            <p>The National Arts Club was founded in an effort to bring the layman in touch with the connoisseur, and the artist and craftsman with
<pb n="244"/>
both. A 1909 article in the <hi rend="italic">Craftsman</hi> discussing the Club cited Victor David Brenner as an example of the ideal member. "Ever enthusiastic, sincere, and a loyal and hard worker, his influence is widely felt as something constructive and in accord with the Club's ideals. On the walls of the club rooms hangs a permanent exhibition of Brenner's work, which cannot but have an uplifting influence upon medallic art in this country" (Teall 1909, 613). We can extrapolate this praise of the influence of Brenner's work to those lay people who visited the Club and could not help but see the artist's work so prominently displayed. The singling out of <name type="pname">Brenner</name> also indicates the importance of medallic art within the Club. We can only credit De Kay with fostering this atmosphere.</p>
            <p>The role of the artist within the larger artistic community, and the Circle of Friends, was a problem that De Kay often wrote about. The lack of recognition of American artists, caused by their self-segregation, was the cause, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> believed, for our disadvantageous position when compared to <name type="place">Europe</name>. "The prestige of European art is against us;...the American artist and artisan must exert themselves more than their European brothers" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 85). And yet the fact that art was not so familiar in the United States gave Americans an advantage, a greater freedom of mind from prejudice and tradition. "In other words, the United States should be a very open field for experiments in the fine arts, and especially in the industrial, because the innovator here should find less of tradition, less of prejudice to encounter" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 85). <name type="pname">De Kay</name> saw the trend in <name type="place">Europe</name> toward centralization of the arts, specifically the role European governments played; the situation in this country, however, was different. There was just as much activity to be found in <name type="place">Chicago</name>, <name type="place">Boston</name>, <name type="pname">St. Louis</name>, etc. as in <name type="place">New York</name>. Annual exhibitions and exhibition organizations were, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> believed, a hindrance because they tended to substitute official and routine art for the natural expression of a nation. Also, one large exhibit, like those held by the Royal Academy in <name type="place">London</name>, or even the National Academy of Design in <name type="place">New York</name>, compelled the formation of huge exhibitions which defeated their own object by their very size. Traditional European shows catered to a specific audience, one very unlike that to be found in the United States. "What we are after in the United States is to close the gap between art and the great body of people, not merely the wealthy, or the well-to-do, but the anxious, hard-working public" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 89). But art would never be healthy here until the public recognized artists the way it did lawyers and merchants. "What
<pb n="245"/>
we should do is to look about for some kind of an organization that exactly fits our ideas, social and political, and appeals to the sentiments and habits of thought of our own people, and avoids any clash with the opinions of the public at large, in so far as no artistic principle is involved and the concession can be made with dignity" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 90). The success of the NSS could be found in its appeal, from the start, to the lay public. The National Arts Club was the next step. "It shows that Americans are realizing very keenly the honor which great artists confer upon the country, and their duty in assisting the development of the national arts on the broadest lines" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 95).</p>
            <p>By headquartering the Circle within the National Arts Club, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was declaring not only the validity of medallic art, but also the relationship between medallic art, as the representative of the "fine" arts, and applied art. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was quoted by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> as saying, "It is for the art lovers of this great city to call attention to the neglect of these forms of art which, for reasons that I need not specify, are ranked by so many people lower than what are called sometimes, the pure arts, such as easel painting and sculpture, and I maintain that even those who strenuously deny that they are art lovers, or know anything about art, should feel it their duty to help art lovers to correct this neglect because it has become a matter of patriotism" (NYT 1899, 5).</p>
            <p>No understanding of the impact of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion can be gained without thoroughly examining De Kay's general aesthetic attitudes, available to us, fortunately, through the numerous articles published by <name type="pname">De Kay</name> on both non-medallic and medallic art.</p>
            <p>To appreciate what <name type="pname">De Kay</name> has to say about medallic art and the sculptors who practice it, we must look briefly at his comments on artists in general. He believed, and rightly so, that artists in the United States did not hold the position in society that they should. "So little weight do artists...carry in the general estimation that it is very common to see long accounts in the papers of monuments and wall paintings opened for the first time to public view without a mention of the men who designed them" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900a). The social status of artists was lower in the United States than in <name type="place">Europe</name> because they were neglected and overlooked. Only a small segment of the population had the aesthetic knowledge to appreciate and understand the output of Americas artists. "...Painting and sculpture, like music, must be enjoyed for their own sake, on their own merits, after considerable acquaintance with the best ancient and modern examples and with the distinct perception that they are things by themselves, have a language
<pb n="246"/>
of their own, and to be truly relished must have from their admirers just as true and faithful service as lovers of other arts give to their special affection...." (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900a).</p>
            <p>The example of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion in regards to De Kay's ideas about organization among artists is instructive. The choice of sculptors who were almost primarily known as medalists, and the awarding of, with one exception, only one commission to each artist, was a way of creating variety, of introducing a large number of practitioners to a wide audience. By commissioning so many different sculptors, the Circle was attempting to elevate the role of the sculptor within American culture. The choice of subjects also serves the same purpose. The subjects of the Circle's medals ran the gamut from commemorations of historic events (<name type="pname">Mowbray-Clarke's</name> Centennial of American and British peace) to portraits of relatively obscure historical figures (<name type="pname">Louis Potter's Abdul Baha</name>) to difficult to classify subjects (<name type="pname">Brenner's</name> medal celebrating Motherhood.)</p>
            <p>The social set which <name type="pname">De Kay</name> frequented was hinged around his brother-in-law, <name type="pname">Richard Watson Gilder</name>. For this group, art served an indispensable purpose in a materialistic age. It had to be beautiful, in "good taste," and exist independent of any moral message. The style favored by Gilder, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> and their circle was a realism tempered by idealism, a not uncommon preference of the period. In an 1890 article on Albert Pinkham Ryder, an artist whose work fit their description perfectly, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> wrote, "But perhaps American art, like American mechanics, literature, politics, has a mission of its own. Perhaps it may teach the great lesson in the Fine Arts which the United States is teaching in many other fields — individuality, freedom, rejection of authority of any one school."<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref> We can easily apply this attitude toward art to the campaign <name type="pname">De Kay</name> successfully waged to incorporate art more fully into American life, of which the Circle was the ultimate expression.</p>
            <p>De Kay's attitude toward medals was gleaned from a number of sources; one of the more interesting was his interest in quality over quantity. In writing about the sculpture for the new Appellate Courthouse in <name type="place">New York</name> City <name type="pname">De Kay</name> stated, "Size alone does not give importance; on the contrary, by enlarging a figure its effect is sometimes lessened" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1901, 1797). The same sentiment about the disparity between size and quality appeared in an article on miniature painting published in 1901.
<q>How many of us stop to remember that 'miniature' the word has nothing to do with size in its original meaning?...[T]his matter
<pb n="247"/>
of size has always acted as a slur on the esteem in which miniatures have been held, very much as the material in which a work of art is fashioned has always affected men's estimate of the artistic quality belonging to a given object. It is hard for the average man to understand that a medal in bronze may have higher artistic quality than the same medal cast in gold, or a carving in wood surpass in beauty the same object in ivory (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1901a, 333).</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is interesting that De Kay would make pointed reference to medallic art in an article on painting; whenever he had the chance to act as a booster for medals, he seized the opportunity. And while he never comes right out and says so, his comment on size in the previous quote can also be construed as being directed at critics of medallic art. Later in the same article on miniature painting he writes that medalists must "pack much in little room and remain true and graceful, thoughtfill and artistic....The medalists of the old school are still shaking their heads over innovators who model medals large and reduce them to medal size and treat the old stiff rules of medaldom with scant respect in more than one regard" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1901a, 336). The issue of size was one that intrigued De Kay. "It is not easy for a man engaged in monumental work to change off to modelling in very low relief and meet the other requirements that a medal forces upon him....[H]e must have the habit of seeing things on the medallic scale; he must have the practice of subtle planes" (De Kay 1907, 158). In yet another article he writes, "Bronze is apt to be associated too closely with monuments that stand in public places, because the enjoyment of small bronze-work is not general. The lover of bronzes, however, regards size no more than does the lover of paintings. He finds a zest in figurines or medallions or small objects...." (De Kay 1895, 111). It seems obvious that De Kay's priorities during the early years of the twentieth century, even before the founding of the Circle, were toward spreading art and culture to the general public through the use of small, intimate, and therefore easily digested works like medals, and medals created by sculptors who were ardent students of the craft of working in miniature, a scale appropriate to the medium.</p>
            <p>De Kay had a special, and obvious, fondness for medals. Two aspects of these small bronzes that especially pleased him were the commemorative nature of medals and the variety of colors that could be applied. Medals, along with coins and tokens, "...[have] kept the record of men and peoples utterly vanished from history" (De Kay 1895, 110). They were another way of recording history, an important part of De Kay's
<pb n="248"/>
aesthetic, and yet they functioned and appeared differently than coins and tokens as historical markers. Their commemorative function worked within, not separately from, an aesthetic one, unlike tokens and coins, and this made them unique. As for color, "A collection of bronzes satisfies the love inherent in mankind for form, and pleases not a little his love of color. From bright green to bright yellow, from brown to black to invisible green or blue, there is a great range of colors for the skilled collector" (De Kay 1895, 112). This emphasis on the range of colors possible with gold, silver and bronze was another attempt at convincing the public that medallic art was indeed a worthy branch of the arts, comparable to painting for variety and emotional expression.</p>
            <p>De Kay believed that medals also played a significant role in influencing popular taste. Medals had, in the past, suffered the reputation of "things of use" rather than things of beauty. He hoped the Circle would remedy this. One of the goals of the Circle, for De Kay, was to teach the public about the inherent beauty of these small sculptures. "It is still a small band of amateurs who encourage the passion, and not all of these can shake off the collector's tendency to value an object for its rarity or historical worth more than for its intrinsic beauty; but no one can indulge long in the passion without making comparisons between one medal and another...and gradually separating in his mind those which please the aesthetic side of him from those which merely excite his interest for other reasons" (De Kay 1907, 153). The Circle would awaken in its members the aesthetic "passion," the ultimate complement to the historical, long the sole province of medals.</p>
            <p>The relationship between the design of medals and coins was obvious, De Kay believed. Medals have long had an influence on coinage, and the best example of this was <name type="place">France</name>. "We may safely reason that neglect of medallic study in the United States is responsible for the flat and tasteless appearance of our own coinage...." (De Kay 1907, 154). Another reason for the founding of the Circle was to elevate medallic art to a level where the general public would realize that our coins needed the same kind of aesthetic attention as medals, or small sculptures. The only American, De Kay believed, who had made a thorough study of medals was <name type="pname">Victor David Brenner</name>, who was commissioned to design the fourth issue for the Circle. Coin designers, of which <name type="pname">Brenner</name> was one, had different problems to solve than medalists, and it was to <name type="pname">Brenner's</name> credit that he was able to switch roles so easily.</p>
            <p>Brenner's example was perfectly suited to illustrate the importance of medals in the education of the public about aesthetics. A sculptor

who could so easily and expertly switch genres, teach in both, and write eloquently about the processes, was the embodiment of the type of artist De Kay championed. "It is strange that a country in which education engages so much thought and ability as does ours should fail to perceive the value of medals as a means of instruction and lay so little stress on them. They do not teach history alone, but when designed by the proper hands they teach art" (De Kay 1907, 162). By studying medals, the public would naturally learn to appreciate larger works. "The value of such portable small sculpture is not easily overrated; it leads to the...thousand and one sculptured objects which add so much atmosphere to a room furnished in the common way with pictures only..." (De Kay 1907, 163). In De Kay's mind, medals formed a stepping-stone to some of the most refined pleasures in the world.</p>
            <p>The Circle of Friends of the Medallion folded just after the onset of the First World War. The reasons for its disappearance are not known, but can certainly be surmised. First, De Kay and Hewitt never reached their goal of 1000 subscribers, so it is possible that it was not financially feasible to keep the Circle going. Second, the nation's attention was beginning to focus on the war in <name type="place">Europe</name> and <name type="place">America's</name> looming role in it, leaving very little time and thought for personal consumption of art. Third, the slowly growing interest in modernism and its highly subjective styles may have begun to undermine the traditional, i.e., social, value De Kay and Hewitt attached to medals, and art in general. However, De Kay's contributions to American aesthetic thought were invaluable. During his tenure with the Circle he produced countless articles, in addition to those cited, for many nationally prominent magazines and newspapers on a wide spectrum of artistic matters. It is inarguable that De Kay was one of the most influential cultural figures in the United States in the years before the First World War, and almost singlehandedly responsible for elevating medallic art to a popular level.</p>

            <p>Since the invention of money, the gods and goddesses, heroes and beasts of mythology have been portrayed on coinage to commemorate a particular event or associate a ruler with his patron deity. Nowhere was this more prevalent than in the coinage of ancient <name type="place">Greece</name> resulting in some of the most beautiful designs ever produced in this medium. The primitive methods used to produce these coins dictated that the designs be engraved directly onto the dies at the actual size they were to be struck. When looking at these miniature works of art one is amazed by the fineness of detail and the ingenuity of the designers' use of iconography in so limited a space. Much later, during the Italian Renaissance, artists such as <name type="pname">Pisanello</name>, <name type="pname">L'Antico</name>, <name type="pname">Fiorentino</name> and <name type="pname">Cesati</name> used the creatures and characters of mythology on portrait medals to convey certain messages about their subjects. Meanings hidden to the ordinary person could easily be deciphered by their well educated aristocratic patrons. In twentieth century <name type="place">America</name>, the sculptor <name type="pname">Paul Manship</name> was greatly impressed by the work of the ancient <name type="place">Greeks</name> and the Renaissance medalists. Like them, he was an artist whose career was linked to wealthy patrons, those self-made tycoons who formed the apex of American society and manipulated the taste of the nation. Archeological discoveries in the nineteenth century infused these classic mythical themes with new vigor. Manship's mastery of archaic form, coupled with fresh originality and fluid handling of spatial relationships made him a favorite of Americas elite.</p>
            <p>"His feeling for the sculptural medium also inspired unique achievement in medallic art. Following the introduction of mechanical means for cutting dies from larger models, medallists had departed from the appropriateness of scale that had been imposed upon the ancient die cutters... Manship revived the clarity of design and treatment that had been the charm of the Greek gems and coins as well as of the early Renaissance medals" (Hancock 1966). Manship himself expressed his unhappiness with the effects achieved by modern technology: "The mechanical reduction, which is to perhaps to be wondered at for its fineness, produces a result which is false and inartistic, because it is obviously not the direct work of the human hand. The beautiful coins of the Greeks and the artistic medals of Pisanello and his contemporaries were of necessity made at their final size. I believe that this mechanics in art is one of the reasons why the art of the medalist has sunk today to such a low state" (<name type="pname">St. Paul Pioneer</name> 1915). This admiration and desire to achieve the "appropriateness of scale" influenced his methods in "the designing of modern medals, he carved the most intricate
<pb n="265"/>
designs and exquisite lettering directly in the plaster mould <hi rend="italic">(sic)</hi> ... Had Manship confined himself solely to making medals he would have achieved wide acclaim" (<name type="pname">Richards</name> 1966).</p>
            <p>Many collectors of medallic art are familiar with some of the works produced by this giant of American sculpture but very few realize how prolific a medalist Paul Manship really was. In his lifetime, Manship created well over a hundred medals, decorations and small bas-reliefs.</p>
            <p>Mythological themes are no stranger in Manship's sculpture and are evident in such works as Centaur and Dryad, Infant Hercules Fountain, <name type="pname">Diana and Acteon</name>, <name type="place">Europa</name> and the <name type="pname">Bull</name> and his most famous work, The Prometheus Fountain in New York's Rockefeller Center. Among his medallic efforts the best known is <name type="pname">Dionysus</name>, which was the second issue of the Society of Medalists. He also created two presidential inaugural medals: the first in 1931 for <name type="pname">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</name>, the second for <name type="pname">John Fitzgerald Kennedy</name> in 1960, and although neither contains a mythological theme, they are noteworthy nonetheless.</p>
            <p>For those not familiar with Manship and his work, we must take a brief look at the influences that moulded him as an artist. The most important was that he learned through the traditional apprenticeship, allowing him to acquire the techniques he needed to develop his own distinctive style and not be stamped in the mold of a particular school. Above all, he was a craftsman of the highest degree and tried to instill this quality in others throughout his career.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Paul Howard</name> Manship was born on <name type="pname">Christmas Eve</name>, 1885 in <name type="pname">St. Paul, Minnesota</name>, the seventh child of <name type="pname">Charles</name> Manship and <name type="pname">Mary Etta</name> Friend. He first studied art at the <name type="pname">St. Paul</name> Institute where he decided to try his hand at painting. Discovering he was color blind, he switched to modeling in clay, and by the age of 15 decided to become a sculptor. Leaving high school at 17, he opened his own design business in <name type="pname">St. Paul</name>. For a year he did sign painting and lettering, which remained of great interest to him and shows strongly in his medallic work.</p>
            <p>Manship went to <name type="place">New York</name> in 1905 where he entered the <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> Students League and after a few months of formal study, served as an assistant to <name type="pname">Solon Borglum</name> until 1907. In the autumn of that year he enrolled at the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Academy of Fine Arts where he studied life modeling with sculptor <name type="pname">Charles Grafly</name>. From 1908 to 1909 Manship assisted <name type="pname">Isidore Konti</name>, who taught him the techniques of low relief modeling and persuaded <name type="pname">Paul</name> to compete for entry into the American Academy in Rome which he won. He was also greatly responsible for drawing Manship away from the influence of Rodin whose style was
<pb n="266"/>
emulated by most of the sculptors of the period, thus giving him the freedom to pursue his own style which would in time set him above all his peers. Manship later acknowledged his debt and fondness toward the elder sculptor with one of his first portrait medals.</p>
            <p>Manship's stay in <name type="place">Rome</name> was probably the single most influential period in his life as well as his work. It would bear a significant impact on the way he viewed sculpture in general and how he interpreted that view in his own art. Surrounded by antiquity he was able to study and then synthesize the ancient forms to achieve a fresh new look which would become known as Archaism. Within a year of his arrival at the Academy, his work shows a dramatic change from the <name type="pname">Neo-Baroque</name> style he had previously been working in. During his fellowship he also made trips around the Mediterranean studying Archaic Greek, Minoan, Assyrian and Egyptian forms.</p>
            <p>The lessons and inspiration derived from antiquity were not the only influences on the young sculptor. Also during his time in <name type="place">Italy</name>, Manship was able to study the Renaissance masters Michaelangelo and Donatello as well as the medals of Pisanello and his contemporaries.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>It was in Italy, the birthplace of modern medallic sculpture, that Manship created the first of what was to be many works in this genre. Frederic Crowninshield (1845-1918), a painter, had been associated with American Academy in Rome since 1900, and its director from
<pb n="267"/>
1909-1911. He resigned as the director following a merger with the School of Classic Studies, which he opposed, and as a farewell, the fellows presented Crowninshield and his wife with a plaque modeled by Manship.</p>
            <p>The Crowninshield Medallion (<ref target="#fig-176">fig. 1</ref>) depicts the winged figure of Iris holding a trumpet-blowing putto in one hand and two doves in the other. Iris was the messenger of Zeus, along with Hermes, and was the faithful servant of Hera. She also helped the other gods, unharnessing their chariots and giving the steeds nectar and ambrosia. She is a fitting symbol for this tribute to Crowninshield who was a dedicated, faithful servant of the Academy and well liked among the fellows. Iris hangs her head in sorrow at the loss of one who embodied her role at the institution. The putto blows a fanfare in recognition of his accomplishments and loyalty while the doves symbolize an offering of peace and happiness for the couple. The medallion remained within the Crowninshield family until 1990 when it was sold at auction in <name type="place">New York</name>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>After his return to the states in 1913, Manship had several highly successful exhibitions and won national acclaim becoming one of the hottest properties in the art world. Commissions flocked to him, among which was one to design the first gold Civic Forum Medal Of Honor (<ref target="#fig-177">fig. 2</ref>) to be awarded to <name type="pname">George W. Goethals</name>, Engineer of the Panama Canal. The obverse depicts Athena with a winged victory in her right hand and the torch of enlightenment in her left. In Greek mythology Athena is credited for giving many valuable services to mankind including the art of taming horses, invention of the potters wheel, the weaving of cloth and embroidery. The medal was given "FOR DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE" and was awarded to such notables as <name type="pname">Thomas Edison</name> (1915); <name type="pname">Alexander Graham Bell</name>

(1917); <name type="pname">Herbert Hoover</name> (1920) and <name type="pname">Richard E. Byrd</name> (1930).</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1914, the Manships vacationed in Italy with their friend <name type="pname">Barry Faulkner</name>, a mural painter, whom Paul had met at the American Academy. Ending their tour in Rome, Manship modeled the Infant Hercules Fountain and presented it to the Academy as his gift. Circling the base of the fountain are six low relief panels portraying the Labors of Hercules. They were not to be cast as individual plaquettes until 1955. All show Hercules wrestling with an opponent either animal or human in form. These are probably the most archaic in style of any of Manships medallic works and could be mistaken at first as works of antiquity.</p>
            <p>One of these (<ref target="#fig-178">fig. 3</ref>) depicts the wrestling match between Hercules and Nereus, The Old Man of the Sea. The hero had to defeat this shape changing deity to discover the route to the Garden of the Hesperides in his quest to steal the Golden Apples of Hera. An early 6th century BC, black figure vase in the <name type="pname">Louvre</name> (<ref target="#fig-179">fig. 4</ref>), shows Nereus with a fish tail that sprouts the head of a lion and a snake, attesting to his power of mutation (<name type="pname">Boardman</name> 1974, 223). By mid century, Nereus changed identity to Triton, which was probably more politically symbolic than a relation to any myth (<name type="pname">Boardman</name> 1974, 223, n.2). Nereus appears on later vases but in full human form and with none of the manifestations of the earlier examples.</p>

            <p>The Manships rented a house the next summer in Cornish, New Hampshire. Other artists had been attracted to the colony founded by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, among them were <name type="pname">Stephen</name> and <name type="pname">Maxfield Parrish</name>, <name type="pname">Charles Adams Platt</name>, <name type="pname">Kenyon Cox</name> and <name type="pname">Thomas W. Dewing</name>. There Manship started a series of portrait medals of his artist friends beginning with <name type="pname">Barry Faulkner</name> (<ref target="#fig-180">fig. 5</ref>). This is the first medal by the sculptor dedicated to an individual rather than an event or award.</p>
            <p>The reverse of this medal portrays Orpheus and Eurydice with the inscription: "TO THE ULTIMATE DO WE PURSUE THE IDEAL". Orpheus, a son of Apollo, was renowned for his remarkable singing voice and mastery of the lyre. His music was so beautiful that wild beasts and even trees would follow him. He fell in love with and married the nymph Eurydice who was bitten by a snake and died. Orpheus, heartbroken, went into the Underworld to bring back his bride. His beautiful singing charmed Hades and Persephone into letting her return on the condition that he not gaze back at her until they were out of the Underworld. Orpheus in his impatience and fearing treachery on the part of Hades turned back to look and so lost his love forever.</p>
            <p>Here Orpheus with his lyre represents artistic expression while Eurydice is the ideal to be pursued and attained. An artist will go through 'the gates of hell' to obtain the epitome of his art. But as in the myth, no matter what the effort, that goal can sometimes be lost in a moment of uncertainty. The pair are surrounded by a chain border, binding them together as an artist is bound to his art. This medal was closely followed by one honoring Maxfield Parrish (<ref target="#fig-181">fig. 6</ref>).</p>
            <p>The Parrish medal is of particular interest as it is the first depiction of Pegasus in Manship's sculpture. The winged steed became a favorite subject of the artist and appears again in five other medals as well as numerous sculptures. Here Pegasus appears to be in the throes of trying to break free from the world below, even the bronze in which he is cast. The wings of the fabled steed are strikingly archaic in appearance and the stylized rays behind lend an urgency to the scene. In Manship's iconography, Pegasus represents artistic inspiration or a means of transport to higher realms. The latter is particularly appropriate in this instance as the paintings of Maxfield Parrish depict fantasy worlds, utopias bathed in ethereal light, or the fancies of nursery rhymes and fairy tales. Pegasus becomes a means for the viewer to visit those realms so skillfully wrought by Parrish.</p>
            <p>Seeing the two of these medals together is enough to confirm Manship's status as an heir to Pisanello in the finest traditions of medallic

sculpture through his combination of fine portraiture and use of symbolism to reflect on the personality of the individual.</p>
            <p>It was also in 1915 that The National Sculpture Society commissioned Manship to create a small bronze ashtray to be presented to its lay members. Although this work is not a true medal, during the year 1914-1915 there were 145 lay members in the NSS making this one the most highly produced reliefs by Manship to be discussed here. The artist chose the goddess Diana as the subject and created a gem in bronze that became the first of a series of small relief dishes illustrating mythological scenes and astrological signs.</p>
            <p>Looking at the <name type="pname">Diana Ashtray</name> (<ref target="#fig-182">fig. 7</ref>), the viewer is first taken by the great illusion of motion and speed of the figures. Diana with her bow flies through the surrounding flora, her swiftness easily matching the speedy hound beside her. Her figure is freely modeled and extremely fluid in form, her long hair flowing in serpentine waves on both sides of her head and is reminiscent of early Minoan frescoes.</p>
            <p>While <name type="pname">Diana</name> shows lithe gracefulness, the hound, in comparison, exudes pure physical power and lightning speed as he adoringly follows at her side. Both are encircled but not completely contained in a raised beaded border giving the illusion that they might at any moment leap from the confines of the bowl. This border is then contained within a second zig-zag motif just inside the rim and adding to the dynamic energy of the piece.</p>
            <p>The figure of <name type="pname">Diana</name> appeared again in a later bronze (<ref target="#fig-183">fig. 8</ref>). Looking at both pieces together, the distinct similarities become very
<pb n="272"/>
apparent. This small dish can be considered the earliest study for one of Manship's most popular and beautiful sculptures.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-184">
               <graphic url="COAC13_272a.jpg"/>

            </figure>
            <p>Appropriately, Manship modelled the <name type="pname">St. Paul</name> Institute Medal (<ref target="#fig-184">fig. 9</ref>), as that was where he received his first formal art training. The obverse portrays a kneeling Muse with her <name type="pname">cithara</name>, her right hand holding a winged victory bearing two laurel wreaths. On the reverse Pegasus appears again, high above the earth with a pattern of vertical rays rising behind. The almost Egyptian style of the kneeling muse on the obverse was several years ahead of its time as the revival of interest in Egyptian art did not fully occur until after the discovery by <name type="pname">Howard Carter</name> of King Tutankamun's tomb in 1921. Manship himself considered this piece a radical departure from his previous work (<name type="pname">St. Paul Pioneer</name> 1915).
<q>I have thought to get away from the stereotyped models generally used in this connection to suggest the whole idea in an abstract manner, and so, instead of representing the figure of Art with a palette in one hand and a work of sculpture in the other, I have pictured, for the obverse of the medal, the Muse that inspires
<pb n="273"/>
and extols, kneeling before the figure of Victory, who bestows the recognition of artistic accomplishment. But for the reverse of the medal, the idea of the Pegasus arising from the globe itself, appealed to me, apart from its decorative effect, as being suggestive of the flight of Fancy, and its vehicle of transport to the higher realms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There was also a smaller study for the obverse of the <name type="pname">St. Paul</name> Institute medal of which only a few casts were made (<ref target="#fig-185">fig. 10</ref>). Although the modeling is more simplistic, the figure of the muse in this version seems more natural. You can sense the movement of the hand just having plucked the strings and you find yourself straining to hear the notes of the melody she sings towards the heavens, four stars twinkling above her head. The border of raised dots forms a halo, or glow, around the figures or could be interpreted as the vault of the heavens which, like artistic inspiration, knows no limits. It also creates the illusion of being reflected in a pool beneath the figures. The inscription forms a cradle which embraces the figures and solidifies the design.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-186">
               <graphic url="COAC13_273.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Welles Bosworth, the architect, was the subject of another portrait medal. He and Manship had been friends since the sculptor's return from Rome in 1913, and it was through him that several important early commissions were received. The reverse of the Welles Bosworth Portrait Medal (<ref target="#fig-186">fig. 11</ref>) depicts a winged female figure kneeling on a plinth and holding a column in both hands. To the left, in Greek characters reads "EUPHROSYNE," one of the three Graces, whose name means "she who rejoices the heart." This symbolism has a double meaning here, the first is a reference to Bosworth's architecture which in its beauty and grace were a thing of joy to look upon. The second being to the great friendship shared by the two men which lasted their lifetimes.</p>

            <p>Orpheus and Pegasus soar above the rising sun on the obverse of The Art Directors Club Medal of 1921 (<ref target="#fig-187">fig. 12</ref>). The Club, incorporated in 1920, was intent on bringing the art of commerce to the fore. In its first 20 years the ADC awarded 129 medals and the list reads like a Who's Who of artists and designers. Among the recipients were such notables as <name type="pname">J.C. Leyendecker</name>, <name type="pname">Walter D. Teague</name>, <name type="pname">Norman Rockwell</name>; <name type="pname">Rockwell Kent</name>, <name type="pname">Peter Arno</name>, <name type="pname">James Thurber</name>, <name type="pname">Edward Steichen and P. Horst</name>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>As in the Maxfield Parrish medal, Pegasus flies over the sun; the pose and style are very similar, only this time the soaring steed faces left. His head is thrown back in joy as he listens to the wondrous song of Orpheus who rides bareback, playing his lyre. These two strong icons of artistic inspiration and expression are quite fitting for this award, bestowed for artistic merit.</p>
            <p>Manship originally met <name type="pname">John Singer</name> Sargent in 1916 and became fast friends with the elder painter who even put the sculptor up in his <name type="place">London</name> flat while on his way to serve with the <name type="pname">Red Cross</name> during WWI. It wasn't until 1923 that Manship created a portrait medal (<ref target="#fig-188">fig. 13</ref>), to honor his illustrious friend, the reverse of which portrays the slaying of Medusa by the hero Perseus.</p>
            <p>The composition is complex but full of smooth flowing interactive curves. Perseus stands above the fallen Gorgon, his helmeted head turned away so as not to look upon Medusa's countenance. The right arm juts back at a right angle and holds the downcurving blade which draws the eye to the severed head held in his left hand. The corpse follows the bottom curvature of the medal, from the severed stump springs Pegasus whose upswept wings draw our eye back to the figure of Perseus. Encircling the figures, but not containing them, is a zig-zag

border that adds to the energy of the scene. The inscription, "PEGASUS LIBERATED," pays tribute to this artist who was the embodiment of artistic inspiration as the greatest painter of his day. By the use of initials, "P.M. TO J.S.S. 1923," Manship reveals the casualness and the closeness of the friendship shared by the two men.</p>

            <p>On August 15, 1927, <name type="pname">Judge Elbert H. Gary</name>, CEO and Chairman of the United States Steel Corporation; president and founder of the American Iron and Steel Institute; namesake of <name type="pname">Gary</name>, <name type="place">Indiana</name>; philanthropist and the single most powerful and influential leader in American industry, succumbed to heart disease at age 80. His vision and commitment are responsible for many things we take for granted in business today including fair labor practices, health and safety incentives, quarterly and annual reports to the public and an 8-hour workday. It was only appropriate that his creation, the American Iron and Steel Institute, create an award to truly honor his memory.</p>
            <p>The obverse portrait (<ref target="#fig-189">fig. 14</ref>) was executed from a marble bust at the Gary residence in <name type="pname">Jericho</name>, <name type="place">Long Island</name>. Manship achieves a marvelously strong profile relief of Judge Gary in his prime that projects the power, conviction and dignity of this great man. There are no other decorative elements save the identifying legend. None are necessary, as the portrait conveys all that needs to be said. There is some flair in the letterforms, especially the "R's" that add to the impression of this man's uniqueness.</p>
            <p>The symbolism of the reverse is as strong as the portraiture of the obverse. Here Manship gives us a scene of Hephaestus resting at his forge. What more fitting tribute to a man who was this god's incarnation in modern industry, whose mills glowed like so many volcanoes
<pb n="276"/>
across the nation? Two winged figures hover above his head with the victor's laurel signifying the award. The forge and anvil are traditional symbols for Hephaestus but are also symbolic of the Iron and Steel industry from whose fiery forges a modern industrialized <name type="place">America</name> emerged. The rays around the god's head, aside from a reference to the genius of <name type="pname">Judge Gary</name>, himself connote the signal significance of the award and the distinction of the recipient. Finally, that the god is resting refers to the fact that this is a memorial to one who has passed on.</p>

            <p>The Society of Medalists (SOM) was founded in 1930 with the promise of making available to the average citizen small bas-relief works of art by America's greatest sculptors at an affordable price. The second issue of the SOM, modeled by Manship, caused quite a stir in its depiction of Dionysus (<ref target="#fig-190">fig. 15</ref>), the god of wine, frivolity and drunken debauchery. Considering that this was during the height of Prohibition the subject matter didn't sit well with many people. Manship himself, in the brief accompanying message, considered that: "The medal is not conventional. It is subtly humorous and is symbolic of a present-day attitude toward certain restraints of the times. Thus it is commemorative of an era" (SOM 2).</p>
            <p>Shortly after its release, an article appeared claiming that the medal
<pb n="277"/>
had become a "matter of contention" between "Wets" and "Drys" in the membership of the SOM, it went on further to say that it knew of at least one member who threatened to resign if "any more insults to the Constitution are perpetuated in the name of art" (Art Digest 1931).</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-190">
               <graphic url="COAC13_277a.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The SOM quickly released a statement to the effect that "the protests which had been received did not cite advocacy of Prohibition as the reason for disapproving the medal", and went on "that more letters of praise than censure had been received..." (New York Times 1931).</p>
            <p>With this singular piece Manship reaches the epitome of his art in the interpretation of modern issues through archaic forms. He did not see the issue in terms of "Wets" or "Drys" but rather as a statement on the social issue of Prohibition and a reflection of its times.</p>

bursts its way across the lower half of the medal, bolts of power fly from its wheels and a swift column of smoke streams from the stack. The tangibility of the power and speed that radiate from this image is astounding and to further emphasize these attributes the god Mercury flies above. Known for his swiftness as a messenger of the gods, Mercury was also the god of commerce. Upon his forward extended right arm is a miniature of "The Best Friend of Charleston," the locomotive whose historic (albeit short) run on Christmas day 1830 signaled the beginning of railroad transport in this country.<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> Adding to the atmosphere of the piece, the wavy rays behind symbolize the dawn of the new age that the steam locomotive brought to the economic growth of the nation. Two hundred of these much sought after medals were produced at a cost of approximately $900 (including dies) plus Manship's usual $2,500 fee (Manship, Letter).</p>

            <p>Pegasus makes his final appearance, this time with Bellerophon the Carnegie Corporation Medal (<ref target="#fig-192">fig. 17</ref>). This award, created in 1934, was presented by the Carnegie Corporation in recognition of an academic contribution to the advancement of knowledge. Bellerophon, a great lover of horses was visited in a dream by Athena one night in which she told him where to find the winged steed Pegasus. Upon
<pb n="279"/>
awakening he found a golden bridle left by the goddess and at a clearing, just as she had described, he found Pegasus, drinking from a pool of water. His stealthy approach went unnoticed until the last instant and Pegasus bolted, but Bellerophon just managed to slip the on the bridle which tamed the beast instantly. One day, according to Pindar, Bellerophon tried to reach Olympus on his fabulous beast, and Zeus in his anger at the mortal's impudence, flung him to earth, laming him for life.</p>
            <p>The symbolism here is as well thought out as the composition. In this instance, Pegasus represents knowledge and Bellerophon, man's gaining of that knowledge. Their struggle attests to the fact that though knowledge can be gained, it can be flighty and elusive and its attainment is not always easy. The waves become the symbolic carriers of knowledge and ideas to all corners of the globe. Lastly there is the warning, though not seen, to those familiar with the myth that knowledge used toward the wrong ends is a dangerous thing and the consequences can be costly.</p>

            <p>Manship's relationship with the Hercules Powder Company began in 1941 with a commission to create the <name type="pname">John Wesley Hyatt</name> Award to be given for distinguished achievement in the field of plastics. The company, a leading explosives and industrial chemicals manufacturer, was founded in 1912 by <name type="pname">Russel H. Dunham</name>. Dramatic growth and expansion during and after WWI allowed Hercules to become a major manufacturer of raw materials for the growing plastics industry. In 1945 Manship sculpted a statue for their corporate headquarters in

               <name type="pname">Wilmington, DE</name> and in 1951 was asked to create a medal commemorating Dunham's fifty years of leadership.</p>
            <p>This 3 inch uniface medal (<ref target="#fig-193">fig. 18</ref>) depicts a strident Hercules wearing the famed skin of the <name type="pname">Nemian Lion</name> and carrying a club on his shoulder. Struck in gold and bronze issues by Medallic Art Company,<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> it is a relief miniature of the sculpture done six years earlier. Compared to his earlier medals this one seems very static in composition and has lost all the decorative brilliance for which he was so well known. This lack of a more involved composition may have been due to a hasty deadline. At this point in his career, Manship's popularity had greatly declined because of his association with the "academic" art establishment and his strong opposition of the avant-garde who were now riding the crest of the wave of popularity.</p>

            <p>The last medal to be discussed here is the Century Association medal of 1955 (<ref target="#fig-194">fig. 19</ref>). Awarded annually to the Centurion by the Board of Management of the Club, the medal's obverse presents a standing Pallas Athena, patron goddess of literature, art and industry, helmeted and wearing the aegis over her chiton. In her left hand she holds the laurel of recognized achievement and with her right she touches the base of a lamp symbolizing knowledge and enlightenment. This lamp stands upon a pylon rising from the plinth upon which <name type="pname">Athena</name> stands. This representation, as Manship would have been aware, resembled the celebrated statue of the goddess by Phidas that was in the Parthenon. The reverse of this medal, as with so many of Manship's works of this period is a wonderful treatment of his seemingly endless array of a ribbons and panels. The dexterity and variety of these when viewed together is astounding. Originally conceived as an
<pb n="281"/>
annual award, this medal has been presented only 13 times to date since its creation</p>
            <p>The fifteen medals covered here merely scratch the surface of the sculptors success in this medium. But, they are indicative of the consistency of his creativity and his dedication to craftsmanship. They truly set Paul Manship among the great medallists of all time.</p>

                  <p>The locomotive "Best Friend of Charleston" was given that name by local businessmen who saw it as the means of getting goods from the port city to the newly developing inland areas. It made its famous December 25th six mile run on the partially completed track of the South Carolina Canal &amp; Railway Company. A contemporary account tells of the then dazzling speed of the train as it travelled "on the wings of the wind at the speed of 15 to 25 miles an hour, annihilating time and space and leaving the world behind...(the engine) darted forth like a live rocket, scattering sparks and flames on either side, passing over three saltwater creeks, hop, step and jump, and landed us all safe at the lines before any of us had the time to determine whether or not was prudent to be scared." Six months later the "Best Friend of Charleston" met its end when a fireman, annoyed at the hissing noise from the boiler, proceeded to hold down the safety valve. The resulting explosion blew him and the engine to kingdom come.</p>

            <p>
               <name type="pname">Die-engraving</name> for the production of coins and medallions is an age-old and increasingly rare form of art. Once, all coins were struck from hand-engraved dies, and the engraver held an honored position in government and in society. Today there are several ways to create minting dies that do not necessarily require the skilled hands of an engraver, and thus die-engravers have become almost as rare as the art that they practice.</p>
            <p>It is part of the trade's mystery that very little written information exists to aid in the education of a would-be engraver. <name type="pname">Die-engraving</name> is passed from master to apprentice, a visual and manual training that can be acquired in no other way. They say that it takes seven years to become a competent die-engraver, but, as one who has struggled with this obdurate art form for at least ten years, I suggest that it takes much longer— perhaps a lifetime. In addition, there are few schools that offer this very specific training. Die-engraving could easily disappear without some conscious effort to continue it, to pass on a fascinating and intricate decorative art form.</p>
            <p>The tools used by the engraver, ancient and unchanging, are relatively simple. Each engraver makes his own tools, as they are hand-held and so must fit each individual hand. Hardened steel chisels and a hammer are used to remove large amounts of steel from a steel die (<ref target="#fig-195">fig. 1</ref>). Small steel gravers or burins are used to remove small amounts of steel, and to add lines and details (<ref target="#fig-196">fig. 2</ref>). Hand-made steel punches have a design engraved on their faces, which is then hammered or "punched" into the face of the die. It is often true that one must make a tool to make a tool.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-195">
               <graphic url="COAC13_284.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>A die-block, or cylindrical piece of "soft" workable steel is placed in a vise called a graver's block. White paint is smeared over the surface of the die-block, and the design to be engraved is then transferred onto the face of the die, and traced again with a sharp metal scribe. This will serve as a map for the engraver. It is at this point that the work begins.</p>
            <pb n="285"/>

               <graphic url="COAC13_285a.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Each engraver has a slightly different way of approaching a job, and so I may only speak for myself. I begin with my chisels and a heavy hammer. Chisels and gravers both have different "faces," that are either round, flat, or v-shaped. Depending on the cut needed, I then hammer my chisel along within the design, removing the mass of the design. This may also be accomplished with a flexible shaft tool, or other similar mechanical grinding tool. The chisel can leave ragged marks in the steel, and these are then smoothed somewhat with a wide flat graver.</p>
            <p>Fine details and lettering may be added with a small graver. As demonstrated by master engraver Ron Landis, lettering may also be added with individual letter punches. Punches guarantee a uniformity of image, and are particularly useful when a design element is repeated within the image.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-197">

            </figure>
            <p>Modern dies are created with a different method, and with the skills of another artist. As demonstrated by Laura Gardin Fraser in a recently restored video, "The Medal Maker," a die may be made from an original "sculpt" which is actually much larger than the finished product. <ref target="#fig-197">Figure 3</ref> shows the passage of an idea through design to finished sculpture. The artist's design is translated into a three-dimensional sculpture through clay and plaster. Lettering is usually carved into the negative plaster model, from which a positive is poured in plaster. This model is then cast in bronze at a foundry, or cast in a hard epoxy resin. The original
<pb n="286"/>
must be made of some very hard material that will withstand a lot of machining.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-198">
               <graphic url="COAC13_286a.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The model is placed on a machine called a pantograph reduction machine (fig. 4). Two of the most common machines are the Janvier and the Augenstein, which vary slightly in design, but achieve the same result. A stylus traces the relief of the model in a series of concentric circles, moving slowly from the center out toward the edges of the model. At the other end of the machine's long arm, a steel cutter repeats the motion at a reduced ratio, thus creating a smaller version of the original model. This, when finished, will be the "hub" from which a negative die will be made. The hub is checked by the engraver for flaws, often left behind by the reduction machine, and then the steel hub is hardened. The hardened hub will be impressed into a "soft" piece of steel, thus creating the die from which a coin or medal will be struck. <ref target="#fig-199">Figure 5</ref> shows a hub, the "soft" steel that it will be impressed into, and the resulting die.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-199">
               <graphic url="COAC13_286b.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Historically, the striking of coins and medals has involved ingenious and not always efficient machinery. It is this requirement that makes the art of the struck medal different from other forms of sculpture; limitations are imposed by the capacities of the machine upon design and relief of modeling. The trick is to combine art, inspiration, and mechanical restraints into a very small beautiful space, and in the most successful of coins and medallions this always occurs. <ref target="#fig-200">Figure 6</ref> shows one such medallion.</p>
            <p>At a workshop held in conjunction with the 1997 conference, a
<pb n="287"/>
combination of both old and modern techniques in die-engraving and striking was demonstrated. I prepared an obverse die from a sculpt, and <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name> prepared a reverse die, engraved by hand. Playing with the "Coinage of the Americas Conference" theme, we both designed an image that had to do with <name type="place">North and South America</name>. The obverse, reduced from a larger sculpt, shows a Liberty head mirrored by an aztec goddess head (<ref target="#fig-201">fig. 7</ref>). The reverse, hand-engraved directly into the steel die, juxtaposes an eagle with a phoenix-like bird. These two dies were struck together to produce small medals commemorating "the Medal in America," the theme of the conference (<ref target="#fig-202">fig. 8</ref>).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Through this demonstration we sought to answer some questions about the vanishing art of die-engraving. Only continued interest will help this art form survive as it always has, passed on from teacher to student, hand to hand.</p>

            <p>After several years of struggling to become a hand engraver, I found myself exploring many facets of this simple, yet challenging art form. In 1982, I acquired a small coining press and was inspired to create small medals which I peddled at <name type="pname">Renaissance</name> Fairs across the country, dragging several tons of minting equipment along to demonstrate with. Being a hand engraver of limited means, I created the dies the only way I knew how—the same way I engraved wax seals and signets, by cutting the design in reverse directly with hand held chisels called gravers.</p>
            <p>Trying to stay true to the historic theme of the Renaissance period, I was compelled to try to make my coining demonstration as true to form as I could, and by 1991, had built a water wheel powered mint at the Texas Renaissance Festival. We demonstrated hammered coining methods as well as the "modern" milled coining techniques developed in the sixteenth century using screw presses, bellows blast furnace, drop hammer, hand cranked edge mill, and water wheel powered rolling mills to demonstrate roller milled coining.</p>
            <p>In my initial research, I was surprised that there was really nowhere that was set up to show these obscure methods. I always thought that an art form that played such an important role in our development as a civilization should have a place to exist at a living history museum, like Colonial Williamsburg. After teaming up with my machinist partner, Joe Rust, we vowed to make it our responsibility to create a museum that would be a place where this, and other related technical arts such as paper making, printing, and bookbinding, can exist and thrive.</p>
            <p>Hand engraving has been all but replaced with the advent of new technologies such as pantographs, reduction lathes, spark erosion technology, and computer guided lasers. In order for it to exist as a trade, it must be put in a historic context the same way Colonial Williamsburg provides an environment were silversmiths, broom makers, and other obsolete trades and folk arts can thrive.</p>
            <p>It is important to preserve rare and historic coins, medals, currency, postage stamps, and other historic documents. Likewise, it is important to preserve the art forms that created these artifacts as a living, breathing part of our culture.</p>
            <p>The art of hand engraving, although just a shadow of the thriving trade it once was, still has its place and still offers unique and rewarding opportunities for the artist determined to master these hard learned skills. There is still a demand for high quality stationary, wax seals, ornamental engraving on guns, knives, hollow ware, jewelry, musical instruments, and even motorcycles to name a few. The distinctive styles
<pb n="291"/>
and delicate sharpness and human qualities of the hand cut line can be mimicked, but never truly captured by mechanical means. Portraits on paper currency are still engraved by hand in most countries for this reason. To my knowledge, there hasn't been a machine invented yet that can cut a line with the same delicate finesse as a true master engraver.</p>
            <p>I'm straying from the subject of medals a bit, but there is a relationship between all these trades that I wanted to point out merely to entice medalists to ponder the depth of possibilities this traditional art form still has to offer. My personal interest is the historic coin making techniques developed from its earliest, and most primitive forms.</p>
            <p>To my knowledge, there are no books specifically devoted to early die engraving techniques, so I am learning by trial and error, reproducing early coins using, as close as I can determine, the same techniques used to create the originals. In the process, we hope to parallel the developments that occurred in the early mints through the same sort of natural order of "evolution" as early mints did. We will never figure out all the exact methods and tools used in a given mint for a specific coin, but we can learn the general methods of given time periods, and thus gain an overall basic knowledge of the development of minting processes through hands-on trial and error experience.</p>
            <p>My latest obsession has been to reproduce Early American coins. The techniques employed to produce dies for these coins were also used to produce tokens and medals of the period. The big difference between engraving a medal die and a coining die is that coining dies need to be reproduced quickly and with great consistency. Most mints developed a method of producing dies from hand-engraved punches so that the time consuming engraving process is only done once, and the dies could be executed from these punches by a die sinker. Therefore, individual punches are made so that Miss Liberty for example, looks exactly the same from die to die. The terms engraving and die sinking are often used synonymously, but in practice, they are really two separate operations most likely performed by two specialists in larger mints. In his "Treatises of Goldsmithing and Sculpture," sixteenth century goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini mentions the security feature of using punches as opposed to directly engraving dies;
<q>The tools used for this purpose have two names, in some instances they are called punzoni (punches), and in other cases madre (matrices), and of a truth they are the mothers that may be said to beget the figures and all the other things you fashion in the die of your coins. The men who did the best work in coining
<pb n="292"/>
always did the whole of the work upon either the punches or the matrices, and never once touched up the dies with either gravers or chisels, for that would be a great blunder, as all the various dies necessary for making many impressions of the same coins, would be a bit different, and thus cause slight differences in the coins themselves, and that would be making thing easy for forgers, whereas coins well wrought in the way described could be less easily copied.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am finding there are other advantages to making the main device punches from matrices. By engraving the reverse matrix, or master die, and then producing the positive punch from this master matrix, the steel can be worked back and forth in the same manner that modern coin sculptors work in plaster. Things like incised lettering and belly buttons, for example, can be added in the positive much easier and cleaner than trying to engrave all around the detail. Combined with several sets and sizes of letter punches, dies for simple medals and tokens can be quickly and easily executed with a sharpness of detail inherent to these methods.</p>
            <p>When the New World mints of Spain began operating, they received from the mother land a mint "kit" so to speak. This kit contained not only a start-up set of dies, but all the punches to create new coining dies as needed. If a punch broke or wore out, a new one could be produced from the matrix which was a plate with all the letters and design elements used for a particular coin. This made it possible for the early Spanish Colonial Mints to operate without the skills of a master engraver. An apprentice with little or no artistic background can be trained to sink dies of a set pattern in a relatively short time compared to learning to engrave.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate how quick die sinking really can be, I sunk a die at the Coinage of Americas Conference held at the American Numismatic Society in NY. I only worked on it about fifteen minutes, hastily composing a simple eagle design from feather punches, and adding the legend with letter punches. I then spent no more than a half hour finishing it up when I returned to Arkansas. So in less than one hour, I was able to create a die, designing it as I went. Had I spent more time, it would certainly have been better designed, but I only wanted to illustrate how efficient this method can be for producing simple token dies, for example.</p>
            <p>Many early tokens and medals have been made using these basic techniques of die sinking, and often combined with direct engraving of
<pb n="293"/>
the main device. Since medals and tokens are made on more limited runs than coins, in many cases, it is more economical to hand cut the main device directly into the working die, instead of spending extra time to create a master die, and device punch. When using these large punches, there is always extra time in the machine shop to turn the distorted die blank back to round after punching in a complete eagle, for example. In other words, engraving a large device does not mangle the shape of the die like applying 100 tons of pressure to stamp it in.</p>
            <p>In doing our reproductions, I am always trying to figure out things like if a design element is hand cut in the die, punched in the matrix, punched in the punch or a combination. I am discovering there really are no rules for this, and I think all die sinkers and engravers gravitate to what they think is best to achieve the result they are looking for.</p>
            <p>During my short apprenticeship under George Bickley, he was trying to get me to think beyond the basic rules that I learned in trade school. He explained that at some point you need to throw out the rule book and become the master of your own bench. The final result is what you are going after, and there can be different roads to the same destination. Engravers develop their own ways that work for them. This is why I don't like to think of myself as a master. As long as there is a new or better, or different way to do something, I remain a student, just scratching the surface (pun intended).</p>
            <p>I enjoy exploring various kinds of numismatic engraving. One of my greatest loves is <name type="pname">carving nickels</name>. Based on the folk art of "<name type="pname">Hobo Nickels</name>," this is a simple, spontaneous way of creating small medals from available pocket change. Many hoboes of the Great Depression used to recarve Buffalo nickels into various novel designs such as hobo heads, and then give these <name type="pname">Hobo Nickels</name> in exchange for favors received along the way. Although somewhat of a novelty, the original <name type="pname">Hobo Nickels</name> of yesterday are a uniquely American form of medal that has a charm all its own.</p>
            <p>Carving nickels is an excellent way to learn portrait engraving. If you goof it up, you have only lost a nickel. Also, it is a very free form of medallic expression that does not require extensive equipment and dozens of highly technical steps to complete. The coin is carved, and then it's done. It also makes for a quick, convenient way to sketch medal designs in 3-D. Taking this concept of carved coins a step beyond the more primitive folk art of the hoboes, coin carving can be done on larger coins, or used to create medals by directly engraving the original from a solid block of metal, then molding and casting to duplicate
<pb n="294"/>
the finished piece, thus returning us full circle to an earlier time when some medals were created this way. I love the way all this ties together.</p>
            <p>Certainly the most challenging and rewarding aspect of my work at Gallery Mint is the early U.S. coin reproductions. Although I am often criticized for this type of work, it has taught me much about coin design and portrait engraving. I find that by copying the work of earlier engravers, I am gaining a better eye for sculpting portraits, just as when apprentice painters copied the work of their masters to learn color and composition. This is a demanding discipline that I find most rewarding. And let's face it, like all artists, I'm always copying something, whether it's my sketch on paper, a photograph of a coin, a profile of a person, or just an idea in my head. To me, the execution of these designs is the act of creating which is the real art. But using these quaint, antiquated methods is part of the ritual, an exercise that carries on a traditional art form that is thousands of years old, and makes me feel connected with something very basic and ancient.</p>
