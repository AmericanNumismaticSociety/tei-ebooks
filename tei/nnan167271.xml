            <p>"The Medal in <name type="place">America</name>" was the subject of the thirteenth Coinage of the <name type="place">Americas</name> Conference in 1997, just as it had been a decade earlier. As the earlier conference had been held in conjunction with the opening of the exhibit "The Beaux-Arts Medal in <name type="place">America</name>," so this year's conference was in the context of three exhibits at the Society's headquarters. This year's exhibits were oriented to the medal of the mid- and late-twentieth century. "A Life in the Arts: Medallic Works of <name type="pname">Gilroy Roberts</name>," a retrospective look at the works of the former Chief Engraver of the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint, traveled to the ANS from our sister institution, the American Numismatic Association, where it had been curated by <name type="pname">Robert W. Hoge</name>. "The American Medallic Sculpture Association, 1982-1997," featured contemporary work by the members of that group, co-curated by <name type="pname">Jacqueline Lorieo</name> and <name type="pname">Alan M. Stahl</name>. A complementary exhibit, "The British Art Medal Society, 1982-1997," was organized by <name type="pname">Philip Attwood</name> of the British Museum. The latter two exhibits were the subject of a joint catalogue, <hi rend="italic">2 Sides</hi>, published by AMSA.</p>
            <p>The conference itself was organized in sessions over the weekend of November 8 to 9. Saturday was devoted to the history of the American medal, and featured the first eight papers published in this volume. It ended with a formal opening of the exhibits, followed by dinner for the participants at the historic Keen's Chop House. Sunday began with the screening of <hi rend="italic">The Medal Maker</hi>, a film produced by the American Numismatic Society in 1929 and recently restored by <name type="pname">Mike Craven</name> Productions with a new introduction written by <name type="pname">Dick Johnson</name> featuring <name type="pname">Elizabeth Jones</name>. The rest of the day was devoted to hands-on demonstrations of the techniques of medal making. <name type="pname">Virginia Janssen</name> explained and demonstrated both the pantographic and direct
<pb/>
approaches to die making. <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name>, assisted by <name type="pname">Joe Rust</name>, used equipment transported from the Gallery Mint Museum of Hot <name type="place">Springs, AR</name>, to show the technique of direct die engraving and striking. Participants in the congress then struck examples of a special medal, whose obverse die had been prepared in advance by <name type="pname">Janssen</name> using a pantographic reduction and whose reverse die had been carved on the spot by <name type="pname">Landis</name>. Both demonstrators kindly contributed discussions of their work for inclusion in this volume.</p>

            <p>Ten years after the first conference and volume on <hi rend="italic">The Medal in <name type="place">America</name>,</hi> we return with new studies on the topic. The two sets of papers have much in common, a result of the way in which the medal is viewed in this country. In general terms, the medal in <name type="place">America</name> is approached as three distinct subjects, each exemplified in this year's conference. The medals of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century are treated as subjects for historical and numismatic inquiry, while those of a century later are objects of art historical analysis. American medals since the First World War are scarcely considered worthy of scholarly study at all.</p>
            <p>The paper in this volume by <name type="pname">John Adams</name> is a preview of his forthcoming book on a series of Indian Peace Medals which are among the most intriguing in the series, those in the name of <name type="pname">George III</name>. The heraldic group is problematic enough, with the portrait of a young king paired with shields from both early and late in his reign, but the "Lion and Wolf" medal has long been a complete mystery in terms of date, iconography and purpose. <name type="pname">Adams</name> has combined extensive documentary and numismatic research to his solution to these questions. <name type="pname">Chris Neuzil's</name> paper on Moritz FÃ¼rst is an example of the most basic and valuable tool in medallic study, a fully documented corpus of the work of an artist set into a biographical narrative. It is of special importance in covering the work of an artist of major importance in the early development of the American medal, and one whose work has been little known until now. The paper of <name type="pname">Paul Rich</name> and <name type="pname">Guillermo De Los Reyes</name> on Masonic medals is more of a plea for inclusion and introductory overview than a detailed study. Medals, decorations and tokens of fraternal organizations have long been relegated to the edges of medallic inquiry, even though they had an enormous presence in the culture of the times.</p>
            <pb n="x"/>
            <p>Five of the papers in this volume deal with what has become the core area of study for the art of the American medal, the period from the Columbian Exposition to the First World War. <name type="pname">Thayer Tolles</name> tells the tumultuous story of the most important medal by the most influential of American medalists, the Columbian Exposition Award medal of <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name>. Three authors treat the works of individual artists with comprehensive surveys of their work. <name type="pname">Barbara A. Baxter</name> writes on the classical nature of the work of one of the leading members of the first generation of American Beaux-Arts medalists, <name type="pname">A. A. Weinman</name>. <name type="pname">Scott Miller</name> examines and catalogues the medals of <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name>, important in the turn-of-the-century sculpture of <name type="place">England</name> as well as <name type="place">America</name>. <name type="pname">Bob Mueller</name> treats the use of mythological iconography in the medals of <name type="pname">Paul Manship</name>, an artist whose work can be seen as the culmination of the Beaux-Arts movement in <name type="place">America</name> and the basis of the Art Deco style which dominated figurative sculpture here for much of the twentieth century. In her essay on <name type="pname">Charles De Kay</name> and the Circle of Friends of the Medallion, <name type="pname">Susan Luftschein</name> deals with issues of patronage and reception, situating the art medal in the aesthetic development of the age.</p>
            <p>The contributions of the conference and this volume to the American medal of the late twentieth century are only potential. The Sunday workshops of <name type="pname">Virginia Janssen</name> and <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name> were of great interest to historians of the medal in illustrating the processes of many of the phenomena to be studied on the objects themselves, but may have even more importance for their effect on the artists present, who could see traditional techniques employed in the hands of modern practitioners.</p>
            <p>What would we like to see in a third volume of The Medal in <name type="place">America</name>, perhaps in 2007? There are eight decades of American medals between the War of 1812 and the Columbian celebration of 1892 which remain virtually unexplored and uncatalogued; leading medalists such as <name type="pname">C. C. Wright</name> and <name type="pname">George H. Lovett</name> remain little more than names to modern scholars. From the perspective of the next century, we should be able to look back at the twentieth century and find much of interest in the American medals of its last eight decades. And, of course, there will already be a few years of the twenty-first century American medal to subject to examination and study.</p>

            <p>The reign of <name type="pname">George III</name> lasted for 60 years, from 1760 to 1820. This period spans the War of the Conquest, <name type="pname">Pontiac's Revolt</name>, the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Our interest in <name type="pname">George III</name> centers on the Indian Peace Medals issued in his name. These medals tell a story at two levels. At the numismatic level, the story has been told by such distinguished hobbyists as <name type="pname">Robert McLachlan</name> (1882), <name type="pname">C. Willys Betts</name> (1894), <name type="pname">Victor Morin</name> (1916) and <name type="pname">Melville Jamieson</name> (1936). Much of what has been written by these authors is in error. We attempt to correct the earlier errors, proceeding further to define die varieties, methods of manufacture and quantities issued.</p>
            <p>More important than the story at the numismatic level is the story at the historical level. The peace medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> tell an eloquent, if cynical, story of relations between the white man and Native Americans. This story spans many of the critical turning points in the development of a continent. The paper that follows attempts to summarize key findings that will be treated at greater length in a book in press for 1999 (<name type="pname">Adams</name> 1999).</p>

                  <name type="pname">George</name> the Second died on October 24, 1760, and his 22 year old grandson was proclaimed the following day. The coronation of <name type="pname">George III</name> took place on September 22, 1761, followed almost immediately by his marriage to <name type="pname">Charlotte of Mecklenberg</name>. Newly crowned and newly wed, the young King was also basking in the glow of his grandfather's victories. In the prior year, <name type="pname">Wolfe</name> had defeated Montcalm before Montreal, driving the French from <name type="place">Canada</name> after a long, bitterly contested war.</p>
               <p>Indians played a prominent role in the so-called "War of the Conquest." The Six Nations of the Iroquois League had fought on the side of the British. The Seven Nations of <name type="place">Canada</name> had fought on the side of the French, as had the tribes in the Great Lakes regionâthe <name type="place">Ottawas, Chippewas, Hurons</name> and <name type="place">Pottawatomies</name>. On the western border of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, the Delawares and Shawnees had begun the war as allies of the colonials but then switched sides to the French before switching back as momentum swung to the British.</p>
               <p>Originally, each colony had conducted its own Indian affairs. In large part because of the troubles in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, <name type="pname">George II</name> decided to centralize the responsibility for relations with the Indians. The new Superintendent of Indian Affairs bypassed the colonial governments,
<pb n="3"/>
reporting directly to the Commander in Chief for <name type="place">North America</name>. From 1755 until his death in 1774, Sir <name type="pname">William Johnson</name> held the position of Superintendent in the Northern District. In 1760, at the beginning of the reign of <name type="pname">George III</name>, the Commander in Chief was Major General <name type="pname">Jeffrey Amherst</name>. He was succeeded in 1763 by General <name type="pname">Thomas Gage</name> of Bunker Hill fame.</p>
               <p>A large landowner in upstate <name type="place">New York</name>, <name type="pname">William Johnson</name> began his career as a trader, assuming the ways of the Indians and learning their language. Adopted by the <name type="pname">Mohawks</name>, the easternmost of the <name type="place">Iroquois nations</name>, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> enjoyed a special relationship with the natives. It was he who saw the inroads being made by the <name type="pname">French</name>, prompting him to recommend a centralized approach to Indian relations (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1754). With his appointment to the Superintendency, Sir <name type="pname">William</name> soon became the most notable figure in colonial <name type="place">America</name>. He led combined British-colonial-Indian forces to important victories over the <name type="pname">French</name> at <name type="place">Lake George and Niagara</name>. With his Indians, he accompanied Wolfe to the climactic battle for <name type="place">Montreal</name> in 1759.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Johnson</name> started for <name type="place">Montreal</name> with over 500 Indians but, between whimsical desertions and regular disagreements with the British military establishment, ended up with less than half that number. However, his supreme accomplishment was persuading the French Indians to remain neutral. <name type="pname">Pierre Pouchet</name> wrote in his memoirs "<name type="pname">Johnson</name> alone was able to quiet them and make them forget their ancient political system in this war" (<name type="pname">Pouchet</name> 1866, 1:30). Indeed, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> was the only figure in colonial <name type="place">America</name> respected by the Indians, the colonists and the British alike.</p>
               <p>For his part, <name type="pname">Amherst</name> had a low regard for Indians. Nonetheless, it was he who recommended the so-called "<name type="place">Montreal</name> medal" to <name type="pname">Johnson</name> and then saw to its execution (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 10:461). <name type="pname">Johnson</name> viewed the medals as a reward for service whereas <name type="pname">Amherst</name> considered them an identification badge by which "good" Indians could be distinguished in the future.</p>
               <p>In their paper in <hi rend="italic">The Medal in <name type="place">America</name>,</hi>
                  <name type="pname">Fuld</name> and <name type="pname">Tayman</name> did a commendable job of describing both the <name type="place">Montreal</name> medals and the Happy While United medals of 1764 and 1766 (<name type="pname">Fuld</name> and <name type="pname">Tayman</name> 1988). We will elaborate on these issues in our forthcoming book. Suffice for now to observe that there is an ironic connection between the two. Having eliminated the French, <name type="pname">Amherst</name> decided to suspend the sale of guns, powder and other supplies to the Indians and bar their entrance into British forts (save, presumably, for those natives wearing
<pb n="4"/>
                  <name type="place">Montreal</name> medals). The hard line taken by <name type="pname">Amherst</name> led to growing unrest, culminating in the conspiracy of 1763. Indeed, the Pontiac Conspiracy is often called "<name type="pname">Amherst's</name> War" by modern historians.</p>

                  <p>1. Medal for the wedding of <name type="pname">George III</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name>, ANS 1925.173.5.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>By long tradition, the <name type="pname">George</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> medal has been attributed to 1761 (<ref target="#fig-2">fig. 1</ref>). <name type="pname">Robert McLachlan</name> writes "<name type="pname">George III</name> was married September 8, 1761. On this occasion, the Indians, ever profuse in their expressions of loyalty, forwarded to the 'Great Father' an address of congratulation, which the King gratefully acknowledged by causing these medals to be struck and distributed among the faithful red men" (<name type="pname">McLachlan</name> 1882, 11). This statement is romantic balderdash. There were very few "faithful" Indians to be foundâ<name type="pname">Amherst</name> had seen to that.</p>
               <p>The undated <name type="pname">George III</name> peace medals of standard designâ"standard" meaning portrait on obverse, arms on reverseâcome in three sizes: 76mm, 60mm and 38mm (<ref target="#fig-3">figs. 2</ref> and <ref target="#fig-4">3</ref>). The <name type="pname">George</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> medal shares its reverse with the standard medal of 38mm diameter. The latter is extremely rare; indeed only two specimens are now known. Thus, it seems logical to hypothesize that the obverse die for this medal broke early its life and that the obverse of a previously unused marriage medal was employed in its place.</p>
               <p>The "Lion and Wolf" medal has been similarly misplaced (<ref target="#fig-5">fig. 4</ref>). <name type="pname">C. Willys Betts</name> deserves the blame for this mistake, because it was he, reasoning from a specimen found in the grave of <name type="pname">Pontiac's</name> son, who then pioneered the theory that the skulking wolf represented Pontiac with the rest of the scene depicting the bliss to be had by those adhering to the British side (<name type="pname">Betts</name> 1894, 238). This flight of fancy was swallowed whole by subsequent writers including <name type="pname">McLachlan</name> (1899, 16), <name type="pname">Morin</name> (1916, 35) and <name type="pname">Jamieson</name> (1936, 13).</p>

               </figure>
               <p>In attributing the son's medal to the father, Betts ignored the matrilineal customs of Pontiac's tribe, the Ottawas. More obviously, he failed to explain why the great chief would have been pleased to receive a medal on the reverse of which he was caricatured, much less a medal of the medium-size generally issued to lesser figures. Further, none of the early writers observed that Lion and Wolf shares its obverse with the standard <name type="pname">George III</name> medal of the same diameter.</p>
               <pb n="7"/>

               <p>Thus, both the Lion and Wolf and the <name type="pname">George</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> medals are die-linked to the undated <name type="pname">George III</name> medals of standard design. Most likely, all of these pieces were made during the same period. Our thesis is that the undated peace medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> were made beginning in 1776 and continued to be made until dated medals appeared in 1814.</p>
               <p>Our case requires two proofs. The first is that the medals were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> made at the outset of the reign of <name type="pname">George III</name> (1760) or at any time up
<pb n="8"/>
until 1776. The second proof required is that they were made thereafter. We have uncovered an abundance of contemporary evidence to support both points.</p>

               <p>After conquering the French, the British should have renewed ties with their Indian allies as well as initiating relations with the greater number of Indians who had fought against them. Instead, they took a more short sighted view reasoning that, with the French threat removed, the money previously devoted to Indian presents could be saved. This attitude was well expressed by <name type="pname">Amherst</name> writing to <name type="pname">Johnson</name> in 1761: "Yet I am of opinion that we must deal sparingly, for the future ... I can see little reason for bribing the Indians or buying their good behavior, since they have no enemy to molest them" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 10:348). The Indians were quick to sense the adverse change in their situation. In reporting to <name type="place">London</name> in the Spring of 1762, Sir <name type="pname">William Johnson</name> wrote: "On inspecting my transactions of last year, and the later meeting your Lordship will observe that the Indians are not only very uneasy, but jealous of our growing power, which the enemy [i.e., the French] had always told them would prove their ruin, as we should by degrees surround them on every side, and at length extirpate them" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 10:461).</p>
               <p>The "late meeting" referred to by <name type="pname">Johnson</name> was a council with the Great Lakes Indians at <name type="pname">Fort Detroit</name> in the Summer of 1761. This was the first formal meeting held by the English with the most powerful tribes that had fought on the side of the French. Notwithstanding the importance of the occasion, minutes of the meeting reveal no issue of medals or, as protocol would have demanded, exchange of French medals in their place. In contrast, minutes of the councils at <name type="place">Niagara</name> in 1764 and <name type="place">Oswego</name> in 1766, for which the Happy While United medals were procured, describe such exchanges. Furthermore, <name type="pname">Ensign Gorrell</name>, who was sent to <name type="pname">Michillimackinac</name>, the second most important post in the West, wrote that his predecessor was asked by the Indians for medals in 1761 but there were none to give out then or now (<name type="pname">Gorrell</name> 1903 1:33[6/25/1762]; 1:38[5/18/1763]). Thus it seems clear that no medals were given out in 1761 and 1762.</p>
               <p>During the year 1763, the frontiers were aflame with <name type="pname">Pontiac's Revolt</name>. For the treaties held in 1764 and 1766 there is ample documentation in the papers of <name type="pname">General Gage</name> and Sir <name type="pname">William Johnson</name> that
<pb n="9"/>
the medals issued were of local manufacture. Indeed, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> complained about the quality of this work because the French medals being exchanged were both finer and thicker (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 12:23). <name type="pname">Gage</name> responded: "I will inquire whether there is any good engravers at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. The die in my possession was done by <name type="pname">one de Bruls</name> who was reckoned the best in these parts of the world" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 12:34).<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Despite the existence of a local source, medals remained in short supply. In 1765, Indian agent <name type="pname">William Howard</name> wrote from <name type="place">Michillimackinac</name> that three important chiefs requested medals but he had none to give out (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 11:806-7). <name type="pname">George Croghan</name>, who was one of <name type="pname">Johnson's</name> most active lieutenants, took Happy While United medals on his mission to the <name type="place">Illinois</name> in 1765 but, in early 1767, was forced to order 20 silver medals from <name type="pname">Myer Myers</name>, a <name type="place">silversmith in New York</name> (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 12:265). Thus, there is no evidence of English-made medals being issued from 1763 through 1767.</p>
               <p>Nowhere was the lack of quality medals felt more keenly than in the case of the Treaty of <name type="pname">Fort Stanwix</name> in 1768. Preparing more than two years in advance for an event that would cede 20,000,000 acres of Indian land to the Crown, <name type="pname">Johnson</name> wrote to his civil supervisor at the Lords of Trade: "In my last letters I mentioned what the Indians then inclined to agree to with regard to the boundary between us and them ... and with the assistance of a proper present and some good medals [i.e., English made] struck on the occasion for the chief <name type="pname">sachems</name> and principal warriors, I do not despair of effecting it" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 12:32). Incredibly, the Lords of Trade denied this modest request as well as subsequent applications for medals to be issued at following councils. <name type="pname">Benjamin Roberts</name>, Sir <name type="pname">William's</name> agent in <name type="place">London</name>, reported the bad news: "I spoke to him about the medals, upon the whole his answer was that he would not augment the expense" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 7:607). And again, "also the article of the Medals but he still persisted in thinking a limit should be fixed to the expense" (<name type="pname">Johnson</name> 1921, 7, 732). In effect, His Majesty's government graciously accepted the 20,000,000 acres for which Ã©15,000 had been paid but it would not spend another one hundred pounds to dignify the occasion.</p>

               <p>After the Treaty of Fort Stanwix and its confirmations, the Indians became a forgotten force. <name type="pname">Johnson's</name> budget was greatly reduced, as trou-
<pb n="10"/>
bles with the colonists moved to center stage. Seven years later, the situation was wholly reversed. With both the colonists and the British seeking allies in the struggle that began at <name type="place">Lexington</name>, the Indians held the balance of power. Both sides conducted councils, vying to gain influence. The "peace" medals awarded in the process are enduring symbols of this hypocritical courtship.</p>
               <p>In our book, we will discuss the individuals who promoted the use of medals as well as what can be learned in the absence of mint records for this period. Suffice for now to observe that British medals appear as early as June 5, 1776, when a German officer describes a reception held in <name type="place">Montreal</name>, "After the ceremony was over, the General [Governor-General Sir <name type="pname">Guy Carleton</name>] ordered uniforms ... for these chiefs, and presented them with big silver medallions upon which the likeness of the King was stamped" (<name type="pname">Du Roi</name> 1911, 38). A few months later, similar treatment was accorded to Wabasha, the legendary chief of the <name type="pname">Mdewankton Sioux</name> and his companion, "The Governor presented each chief with a large silver medal bearing a bust of King <name type="pname">George</name> on the obverse side and Great <name type="place">Britain's</name> coat of arms on the reverse. These were hung around their necks on ribbons of royal purple. <name type="pname">Wabasha wore</name> his above a similar French medal" (<name type="pname">Stevens</name> 1990, 46).</p>
               <p>Many more such references have been located in archives on both sides of the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>. In our book, we explore at length the likelihood that the 300 "Burgoyne medals" (<name type="pname">Clinton</name> 1900, 2:781) given out at <name type="place">Fort Niagara</name> in December 1777 were of the Lion and Wolf design. Nonetheless, the first explicit mention of this medal we have located is in a letter dated 4/7/1781 which lists: "50 large silver medals with the Kings bust, the Lion, Wolf, etc." (<name type="pname">Knox</name> 1781). Our earliest citation for the <name type="pname">George</name> and <name type="pname">Charlotte</name> medal occurs on an indent written in 1777 listing "70 silver medals, King and Queen's" (<name type="pname">Knox</name> 1777). Thus, both <name type="pname">George-and-Charlotte</name> and Lion-and-Wolf can be ascribed with certainty to the Period of the Revolutionary War. Notwithstanding an extensive search of archives on both sides of the <name type="place">Atlantic</name>, no earlier references to these or any of the undated <name type="pname">George III</name> peace medals have been found.</p>
               <p>After the Treaty of <name type="place">Paris</name> in 1783, the British continued to award peace medals to Indians in the Great Lakes region as well as to a few tribes west of the <name type="place">Mississippi</name>. With the advent of the War of 1812, there was another surge in issuance culminating with the new, dated design in 1814. As our census (see below) would suggest, there were half as many of the 1814 medals distributed in a few years as there were undated medals awarded over a few decades. By the year 1815, the
<pb n="11"/>
demand was pretty well saturated: "Formerly a chief would have parted with his life rather than his medal. Now very few think it worth preserving" (<name type="pname">Bulger</name> 1815, 13:114).</p>

               <p>
                  <name type="pname">George III</name> medals got off to a very slow start in <name type="place">U.S.</name> numismatics. Early commentators thought them rarer than the French counterparts. Indeed, the Bushnell Collection, one of the great treasure troves of <name type="place">Americana</name>, contained but a single example.</p>
               <p>The cause of the initial scarcity of <name type="pname">George III</name> medals is eminently logical: having fought on the side of the British in the Revolutionary War, most of the recipients chose to relocate in <name type="place">Canada</name>. Thus, it wasn't until important Canadian collections came on the market that the supply began to improve. The <name type="pname">Gerald Hart sale</name> in 1888 contained four specimens; the <name type="pname">Hunter</name> (1920) and <name type="pname">W.W. C. Wilson</name> (1925) collections contained many more.</p>
               <p>In point of fact, thousands of the <name type="pname">George III</name> medals were madeâperhaps tens of thousands. We list several hundred in the condition census in our book. With specimens residing among Indians and in small institutions across <name type="place">Canada</name>, we are confident that more examples will be available to numismatists as time wears on.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Jamieson</name> (1936) lists a number of die varieties of the <name type="pname">George III</name> medals of which two are duplicates. All in all, his was a good first effort but we will describe a number of additional die varieties in our book. So numerous are the dies that one could infer from their number alone a total emission of 60,000 to 100,000 pieces. This estimate is almost certainly high; two other approaches described in our book yield estimates ranging between 5000 and 15,000.</p>
               <p>The large medals were manufactured by one of three processes:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item n="1)">Some were struck on planchets cut to size, using a collar;</item>
                  <item n="2)">Some were struck as shells and then joined;</item>
                  <item n="3)">Some were struck on very thin planchets, with a thick rim added around the circumference to support a hanger.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the absence of mint records, one can only speculate as to why three methods of manufacture were employed. It seems logical to hypothesize that methods #2 and #3 were used to save money: Method #1 consumed more than twice the silver required for #2 and for #3. Data on weight, diameter, styles of hanger and other such features are now being gathered.</p>

               </head>
               <p>As a check on relative rarity, as well as to minimize duplication, we have designed our census in two parts. The first includes collections, auction appearances, and fixed price lists from 1860 to 1975. The second or modern census extends from 1975 to present day. As can be seen from Table 1, the two censuses reveal quite similar results. Thus one can be tolerably confident that the large undated medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> are the most common, followed by the large 1814s, Lion-and-Wolf and <name type="pname">George-and-Charlotte</name> in that order. The small undated medal of <name type="pname">George III</name> is by far the rarest of the group, which gives rise to our theory that the obverse die broke early in its life, leading to the substitution of <name type="pname">George-and-Charlotte</name>.</p>

               <p>If the medium-sized medals were issued to warrior chiefs and the small ones to ordinary warriors, one or both must have been made in much greater quantities than the large designs intended for the political chiefs or sachems. One explanation for the lower survival rate is alcohol: Indians were all too easily addicted to spirits and, given the silver content, medals must have been a fungible source of payment. At formal councils with the white men, chiefs made frequent complaints about the volume of rum dispensed by the traders but only a handful of tribes were successful in barring the substance from their dominions.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Inasmuch</name> as chiefs drank at least as copiously as warriors, the higher survival rate of the large medals can probably be attributed to inherent political value. Within the Indian community, chiefs' medals were a confirmation of authority. Outside the community, chiefs were expected to
<pb n="13"/>
wear their medals as symbols of loyalty to the Great White Fathers.</p>
               <p>Whereas our census captures relative rarity, the total population now extant can only be guessed. The several hundred examples listed in our book could be relatively complete. More likely, in our opinion, is that another one to three times as many await re-discovery. Only time will tell. Whatever the ultimate census may show, it is clear that the population of <name type="pname">George III</name> medals is greater than generally thought. The good news is that they are sufficiently available to be an eminently collectable item.</p>

               <p>The generals of <name type="pname">George III</name> regarded native Americans as idle, drunken and undependable. For their part, the Indians regarded the British as grasping and deceitful. Both sides had their points.</p>
               <p>From an historical perspective, the medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> serve to sift through conflicting opinions and create a demonstrable fact: the British policy toward Indians was entirely self-serving. When, as was the case in the 1760s, the government placed a low value on the good will of the North American natives, the medals issued to them were small and/or of crude workmanship. When, with the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the services of the Indians became indispensable, the medals got bigger and better.</p>
               <p>Be it said that the medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> do more than enshrine the hypocrisy of His Majesty's government. They recall the enlightened Superintendency of Sir <name type="pname">William Johnson</name>. They mark the ebb and flow of events from the triumph at <name type="place">Montreal</name> in 1759, to the disasters of <name type="pname">Pontiac's revolt</name>, to the attempt to create a permanent boundary at the Treaty of <name type="pname">Fort Stanwix</name> in 1768. With the Revolutionary War, the issue of medals reached a crescendo, commemorating the early battles for <name type="place">Montreal</name>, Burgoyne's disastrous campaign, the border wars of <name type="place">New York</name> and formal alliances in the West. Medal-giving reached another, smaller, peak during the War of 1812. Indians played prominent roles at <name type="pname">Detroit, Chrysler's Farm</name> and <name type="pname">Chateaugay</name>.</p>
               <p>Without denigrating the peace medals issued by our own government, we note that the medals of <name type="pname">George III</name> mark a period when the Indians were still a force on the scene. These medals mark the last period during which Indians played at center stage. They recall the independence, the bravery and the cunning of proud cultures that were soon subsumed by the tide of events.</p>

            <p>Artist and die engraver <name type="pname">Moritz FÃ¼rst</name> was 26 years old when he came to <name type="place">America</name> from <name type="place">Europe</name> in late 1807. Between 1807 and about 1840, when he returned to <name type="place">Europe</name>, he hand-engraved the dies for numerous Congressional award medals for the War of 1812 as well as presidential portrait dies for 12 different Indian Peace Medals. He also made a large number of medal dies as private and institutional commissions and, apparently, as speculative ventures. The medals from these dies preserve a remarkable collection of portraits, allegorical representations, historical scenes, and other iconography of early nineteenth century <name type="place">America</name>.</p>
            <p>Inexplicably, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> has received scant attention from numismatists. Although many of his medals have been described in various publications, notably the compilations of American medals by <name type="pname">Loubat</name> (1878) and <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977), the only attempt to catalogue <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> American medals specifically was by <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b) more than 40 years ago. A great deal has been learned since <name type="pname">Chamberlain's</name> pioneering study, but the findings have not been collected and organized, and some of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> medallic work remains unpublished or unrecognized. Moreover, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> himself remains a shadowy figure, with many questions surrounding his professional and personal life.</p>
            <p>In this paper I examine <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> career and present an updated compilation and discussion of his American medals. Both a census of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> medal dies in tabular form and an illustrated catalogue of medals from the dies are included, and appear in an appendix. The die census is useful for analysis because many of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> dies were paired with more than one of his other dies, with dies of other makers, or used without mate dies. In addition, it is the dies rather than the medals that measure <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> output and provide a framework for understanding his engraving career.</p>

                  <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> was born to <name type="pname">Jewish</name> parents in the town of Boesing, near <name type="place">Pressburg</name>, <name type="place">Hungary</name> (now <name type="place">Bratislava</name>, <name type="place">Slovak</name> Republic) in March 1782 (<name type="pname">Dunlap</name> 1834, 221). Little is known about his early years. His training took place in <name type="place">Vienna</name>, then about a two-day journey from <name type="place">Pressburg</name>. There, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> relates (<name type="pname">Dunlap</name> 1834, 221), he studied die sinking under <name type="pname">Johann N. Wirt</name>, the engraver at the <name type="place">Vienna</name> Mint. Wirt directed an Academy of Engraving (<name type="pname">Forrer</name> 1904, 6:567), and <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst presumably</name> was a student there. <ref target="#fig-6">Figure 1</ref> presents an example of Wirt's medallic work. Later, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> studied under an engraver named <name type="pname">Megole</name>, who superintended

the mint in <name type="place">Lombardy, Italy</name> (<name type="pname">Dunlap</name> 1834, 221). <name type="pname">Megole</name> had earlier been in <name type="place">Vienna</name>, perhaps also as Wirt's student, and it is likely that he met <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> there. While working in <name type="place">Italy</name>, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> made the acquaintance of <name type="pname">Thomas Appleton</name>, the American Consul in <name type="place">Livorno</name>.</p>

The medal honors the erection of a monument to <name type="pname">Joseph II</name> in 1806, and features a bust of <name type="pname">Francis II</name> on the obverse.</p>

               <p>A pamphlet published by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>, or on his behalf, in about 1825 (Proceedings n.d.) outlined the artist's version of his intercourse with <name type="place">Appleton</name>. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> engraved seals for the Consul, whereupon <name type="place">Appleton</name> requested a meeting with the engraver through <name type="pname">Francis Wittenberg</name>, who acted as <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> business agent. The pamphlet describes <name type="place">Appleton</name>, after some discussion of coinage designs, explicitly offering <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> a position as engraver at the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint with an annual salary of $2,000. The offer was later attested by <name type="place">Wittenberg</name>, whose notarized statement to that effect appears in the pamphlet. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> recounts that he accepted the offer and sailed with <name type="place">Wittenberg</name> to <name type="place">New York</name>, arriving in September 1807 (Proceedings n.d.).</p>
               <p>As represented in the pamphlet, <name type="place">Appleton's</name> offer is difficult to reconcile with events that followed. It seems unlikely that <name type="place">Appleton</name> had authority to engage an engraver for the Mint, particularly at a salary of $2,000; by the time <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> arrived in <name type="place">America</name>, the German-born engraver John Reich had been hired, at a salary of $600, to assist Mint engraver <name type="pname">Robert Scot</name>. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> eventually met with Mint Director <name type="pname">Robert Patterson</name>, Chief Coiner <name type="pname">Henry Voigt</name>, and <name type="pname">Reich</name> (Proceedings n.d.). However, <name type="pname">Patterson</name> apparently did not offer him the position he expected.</p>
               <p>Although we do not know what transpired in his meeting with
<pb n="20"/>
Patterson, it is clear that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> believed that he would eventually obtain the promised appointment (Proceedings n.d.).<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> He took up residence in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> and started engraving dies and seals (<name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> 1954a, 590). Unfortunately, a <name type="place">U.S.</name> embargo in response to British and French trade policies caused a depression beginning in 1808. Economic disruption, social unrest, and even threats of civil war (<name type="pname">Hickey</name> 1989) marked <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> early years in <name type="place">America</name>. In 1812, the year <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> turned 30, friction between the <name type="place">U.S.</name> and <name type="place">Britain</name> led to war and the British Navy was soon threatening American coastal cities, including <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> adopted home of <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>. In 1814 panic swept the country when the British succeeded in burning <name type="place">Washington</name> (<name type="pname">Lord</name> 1972, 215). <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> can hardly have prospered during this turmoil. Ultimately, however, it was the War of 1812 that catapulted <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> to prominence as a die engraver.</p>
               <p>Congress voted some 27 medals to Army and Navy commanders during and following the war. By 1814 the Navy had begun to procure medals mandated for its officers. <name type="pname">Reich</name> was contracted for the work, but he completed only four dies (for two medals) by 1817, a clear indication that he would be unable to complete all of the needed dies (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 147). This led the Navy to contract with <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> to cut dies for the medal to Captain <name type="pname">William Bainbridge</name>. Meanwhile, <name type="pname">Reich's</name> eyesight deteriorated sufficiently to affect his work (<name type="pname">Witham</name> 1993, 18, 19); his portrait die for Captain <name type="pname">Stephen Decatur</name> was not accepted by the Navy. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> was contracted to make a new portrait die and also made a new reverse after <name type="pname">Reich's</name> shattered while being hardened. After completing the Bainbridge and Decatur dies, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> wrote Navy Secretary Crowninshield asking that the Navy "make a regular contract with me for the other medals which remain to be executed" (<name type="pname">Witham</name> 1993, 18). Whether or not he obtained such a comprehensive contract, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> ultimately did all the remaining medal dies for the Navy awards and then did all the dies for the Army awards. Creditable workmanship and the unavailability of <name type="pname">Reich</name> made <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> the artist of choice for official medals. In 1817, in addition to working on the War of 1812 awards, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> engraved the Indian Peace Medal portraits of President <name type="pname">James Monroe</name>. He later did the Indian Peace Medal portraits for all the presidents through <name type="pname">Van Buren</name>.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Reich's</name> disability caused Mint Director <name type="pname">Robert Patterson</name> to seek another assistant for Mint engraver <name type="pname">Scot</name>. An offer was made to <name type="pname">Christian Gobrecht</name>, which <name type="pname">Gobrecht</name> refused (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 109). Curiously, there is no evidence that <name type="pname">Patterson</name> gave any consideration to
<pb n="21"/>
                  <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>, who continued to make medal dies under contract to the War and Navy Departments. Perhaps these contractual obligations were too heavy to allow <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> to work at the Mint; he had then only begun work on the dies for the War of 1812 medals, a project that would occupy him for some years. I believe it likely that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> also was not interested in the assistant's position at the smaller salary.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Scot</name> died in late 1823. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> clearly believed that he was rightfully <name type="pname">Scot's</name> successor, but seems to have realized that he faced competition for the post. I have elsewhere suggested (<name type="pname">Neuzil</name> 1991, 140) that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> engraved the dies for the <name type="pname">Monroe</name> presidential medal (medal 44 in the appendix) in an effort to promote himself for the engraver's position he had sought for so long. However, <name type="pname">William Kneass</name> was appointed the Mint's new engraver based on the recommendation of his personal friend, Chief Coiner <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name> (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 109). Compounding the injury to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>, <name type="pname">Kneass's</name> appointment roughly coincided with the end of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> lucrative contracts for War of 1812 medal dies, which were essentially completed the following year. The fact that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> did not obtain the appointment as Mint engraver evidently incited him to petition the Congressional Committee on Claims for compensation. Asserting that he had been promised the position of Mint engraver before his arrival in 1807, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> asked the Committee for back pay (Proceedings n.d.). He explained the filing of his grievance 15 years after the fact by claiming unfamiliarity with American law and custom although in reality he may have been mollified by the income he enjoyed from the War of 1812 contracts. The petition was rejected, allegedly because no written record existed of <name type="pname">Appleton's</name> original offer (Proceedings n.d.).</p>
               <p>In 1835 <name type="pname">Kneass</name> suffered a stroke. <name type="pname">Gobrecht</name> this time accepted the assistant's position (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 171), and when <name type="pname">Kneass</name> died in 1840, assumed the mantle of engraver. Probably seeing himself in direct competition with <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>, Gobrecht had actively promoted himself for the engraver's position (<name type="pname">Breen</name> 1988, 433). <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>, by then in his late fifties, returned to <name type="place">Europe</name>.</p>
               <p>Although <name type="pname">Gobrecht's</name> appointment probably was the immediate reason for <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> return to <name type="place">Europe</name>, other factors probably contributed to his decision to leave. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> government contracts had dwindled to the point that his official work was limited to the infrequent Indian Peace Medal dies for new presidents. Even the income from these infrequent contracts was at risk. The nature of medal making and the role of medals themselves were changing fundamentally in the late 1830s. The
<pb n="22"/>
Contamin portrait lathe, purchased by the Mint in 1836, could mechanically reduce bas-relief models to make dies (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 150). The new process was much less expensive than hand-engraving, and threatened to make die engraving by hand obsolete.<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> Presaging an even more fundamental change, photography was becoming practical (<name type="pname">Dibner</name> 1967, 461) and promised an alternative to medallic and other forms of miniature portraiture. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> would certainly have seen these changes as threats to his livelihood.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the Old World offered <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> some respite from the forward march of technology. Following his return to <name type="place">Europe</name>, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> continued to hand-engrave medal dies for some years. <name type="pname">Forrer</name> (1904, 7:333) lists a medallist under the name "<name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>" who was active in <name type="place">Munich, Germany</name>, from 1841 to 1847. We can surmise that this was <name type="pname">Moritz FÃ¼rst</name> because of a <name type="place">German</name> medal dated 1841 and signed with the same letter punches <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> used in <name type="place">America</name> (<ref target="#fig-7">Figure 2</ref>). <name type="pname">Forrer's</name> listing implies that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> engraved dies until about the age of 65. Nothing more is known of this phase of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> life.</p>

               <p>A die census presented in the appendix (Table 2) reveals that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> made more American medal dies than previously realized. Slightly over 100 dies can be identified that are attributable to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> while he was in <name type="place">America</name>. However, as discussed in the appendix, it is quite likely that the actual total is larger, perhaps 113 or even more.</p>
               <p>When the date of completion of a die is known or can be reasonably constrained, it has been noted in Table 2 (<name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977) and other
<pb n="23"/>
authorities noted in Table 2 are the source of most of the dates). The availability of dates for most of the dies presents the possibility of examining <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> die-making activity in a quantitative fashion. Using the information in Table 2, I have plotted by year the number of dies <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> produced in <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref>. This plot shows 97 dies; it does not include seven for which the dates of completion are very uncertain, nor does it include any of several unverified dies from Table 2. When interpreting the plot, one should bear in mind that some of the completion dates are somewhat uncertain.</p>

The plot breaks down <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> production into official (US and PA) and unofficial (IO) dies (see the Appendix for a fuller explanation of these categories and identification of the dies). Replacement dies for US-24, 40, 50, and 54 are included in the plot, but dies IO-2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 27, and 30 are not included because of uncertain completion dates. Where a range of years is given in Table 2, the latest date was used, except for dies US-43, 47, 54, and 60 for which the earliest date was used.</p>

                  <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> shows that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> die-making fluctuated dramatically, with most of the activity after 1816 and before 1823. It was during these middle years that he executed dies for the Navy and Army awards of the War of 1812 (denoted as US and PA dies in <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> and Table 2). The Navy awards were his dominant activity from 1817 through 1820. The Army awards, nearly all of which were done during 1821 through
<pb n="24"/>
1824, account for the second prominent peak in 1822. The plot implies that in 1817 he made 17 dies (including replacements of three dies that broke during hardening), an average of one die every three weeks. The year 1822 is shown being nearly as busy, with 15 dies (counting one replacement die).<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> Between the beginning of 1817 and the end of 1824 the count is at least 58 dies (including replacements), an average of more than 7 dies per year. This eight-year stretch, roughly one fourth of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> time in <name type="place">America</name>, accounts for over half of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> known output of medal dies. In contrast, the years before 1817 and after 1825 are distinguished by both lower overall rates of die production and production of most of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> unofficial or nongovernment dies (denoted as IO in <ref target="#fig-8">Figure 3</ref> and Table 2).</p>
               <p>Payments cited by <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977) suggest that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> typically received between $300 and $400 per die. The amount varied according to the difficulty of the die and other expenses involved. Interestingly, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> asked more for battle scenes than for portraits, presumably reflecting the engraving time required. Probably included in the fees were the cost of materials, polishing the dies after hardening (Proceedings n.d.) and, in some cases, travel in order to make portrait sketches. Assuming that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> completed about 100 dies that actually provided income,<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> his fees from this activity were in the neighborhood of $35,000 over about 33 years, or close to an average of $1,000 per year. During 1817 through 1824, the busy middle years of his career, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> annual fees from diemaking averaged, by this analysis, between $2,000 and $3,000. By comparison, <name type="pname">Reich's</name> average annual income from 1800 to 1817 is estimated to have been about $700 (<name type="pname">Witham</name> 1993, 46).<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Reliable data on wages and income are sparse for this period, but it appears that in 1830 wages to laborers were about $0.75 to $1.00 per day while craftsmen and land-owning farmers had incomes of about $1.00 to $1.50 per day (<name type="pname">Larkin</name> 1979, 2; <name type="pname">Kuiken</name> 1997). <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> income from a single die thus exceeded a laborer's earnings for a year, and his average annual income between 1817 and 1824 was nearly ten times that amount. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> also had income, which may have been significant, from other activities (see next section). All told, he enjoyed a rather substantial, although unsteady, income. However, even during his most active years, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> reportedly lived beyond his means. Referring to the period 1821-23, <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 112) states that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> "apparently spent his funds far faster than they were received, thus fitting the classical mold of the impoverished artist. He was, nearly always, deeply in debt." The loss of the income from the War of 1812 dies, beginning in 1825,
<pb n="25"/>
must have been financially devastating to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> after eight years of relatively high income. This was undoubtedly the impetus behind <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> petition to the Committee on Claims and publication of the pamphlet detailing the claim (Proceedings n.d.) after it was rejected.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954a, 590) and <name type="pname">Albert</name> (1974) have reported that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> engraved seals and at least one die for uniform buttons. However, the fact that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> also engraved dies for decorative embellishments on silverware is largely unrecognized by numismatists. At the turn of the eighteenth century, the making of silverware was evolving toward increasing mechanization, allowing cheaper and more rapid fabrication (<name type="pname">Plaut</name> n.d., 7). Before this, <name type="pname">silversmiths</name> cast or engraved the ornamentation for silverware. Die-struck embellishments were easier to produce in quantity and often more elaborate and expressive than engraved or cast ornamentation. This presented opportunities for die-sinkers like <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> to make and sell die-struck ornamentation or dies themselves to makers of silverware.</p>
               <p>I have identified five dies by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> that were used for making decorative embellishments, all made before 1817. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> probably did not make decorative dies and similar items after he became busy with the War of 1812 dies in 1817. Whether he made decorative dies after 1824, when he had largely completed the War of 1812 contracts, is not known. It is also unclear whether <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> sold the decorative dies themselves, or sold the embellishments that he made from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> known decorative dies are of two types. The simplest was a cylinder die with a repeating grapevine pattern that produced a decorative silver strip. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> signed the die, and his signature appears about every 15.7 cm along the strip (<name type="pname">Skerry</name> 1986), indicating that the cylinder had a diameter of approximately 5 cm. Decorative silver strips from this signed die were incorporated into a tea service now at the Yale Museum of Decorative Arts in <name type="place">New Haven, Connecticut</name> (<ref target="#fig-9">Figure 4</ref>) and a ewer now at the <name type="place">Winterthur</name> Museum in <name type="place">Wilmington, Delaware</name>. These pieces have been dated to between 1810 and 1817 (Yale University Art Gallery 1984). Decorative strips from the same die also appear on a silver tea service dated to circa 1835 (<name type="pname">Christie's</name> 1988, 40).</p>
               <p>Decorative dies of the second type were used to impress designs on square silver panels or sheets. The panels were applied to flat surfaces on silverware. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> cut at least four such dies, comprised of two different
<pb n="26"/>
compositions in large (56 by 56 mm) and small (34 by 34 mm) versions. One design features <name type="pname">Zeus</name> as an eagle tended by his daughter <name type="pname">Hebe</name> (<ref target="#fig-10">Figure 5</ref>) and the other is a classically-garbed female leaning on a rock. Panels struck from these dies were used to decorate a silver tea service (<ref target="#fig-11">Figure 6</ref>), made in <name type="place">New York</name> about 1810 (<name type="pname">Southeby's</name> 1985), that is now in a private collection. The panels are not fastened, but slide into slots on the sides of the pieces.</p>

               <p>Because the decorative dies carry classical or purely decorative motifs, they cannot clearly be assigned an American origin. The embellishments first appear on American silverware dated between 1810 and 1817, and it is possible that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> cut the dies before coming to <name type="place">America</name>. However, I believe it likely that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> made the dies after coming to <name type="place">America</name>, and probably while establishing his engraving business in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>.</p>
               <p>Other decorative dies by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> may exist. <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954a, 592) reports that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> made presentation swords under contract to the State of <name type="place">New York</name> for several War of 1812 commanders. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> may have engraved dies to produce decorative elements for these swords and their scabbards.</p>

               <p>The allegorical and classical figures on <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> medals and embellishments suggest that he could have made significant contributions to the nation's coinage, which used classical figures as embodiments of <name type="pname">liberty</name>. Although <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> never got the chance to design coins as a Mint engraver, it is possible that he did at least influence <name type="place">U.S.</name> coin design. <ref target="#fig-12">Figure 7</ref>, reproduced from <name type="pname">Taxay</name> (1983, 172), shows preliminary designs by <name type="pname">William Kneass</name>, <name type="pname">Titian Peale</name>, and <name type="pname">Thomas Sully</name> for the new seated <name type="pname">Liberty</name> coinage. These sketches, dating to 1835, clearly borrow
<pb n="28"/>
from many earlier coins, including English and pre-Federal American issues that feature seated goddesses or allegorical female figures. For example, the late eighteenth-century coppers of <name type="place">Vermont</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name> crudely portray a seated female figure with a shield and liberty cap on a pole. However, the most direct and immediate precedent for the sketches appears to be a medal by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>. <ref target="#fig-13">Figure 8</ref> shows an American Institute medal from a die (IO-25 in Table 2) made by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> in about 1830 (<name type="pname">Harkness</name> 1989, 128), some five years before the designs in <ref target="#fig-12">Figure 7</ref>. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> composition features a seated, classically-garbed female holding a liberty cap on a pole and supporting a shield, all of which are major elements in the designs that were ultimately adapted to make the new <name type="place">U.S.</name> coinage.</p>

               <p>In terms of design, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> medals are a mixed bag of his own and others' work. Most of his dies for War of 1812 Congressional awards copied portraits, battle scenes and allegorical scenes by graphic artists, both obscure and well known. Reverses for many of the Army medals, for example, were designed by the painter <name type="pname">Thomas Sully</name> (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 112). Other dies, most notably the Indian Peace Medal portraits, were composed as well as engraved by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>. The presidential portraits on the Peace Medals are especially noteworthy and valuable as they were based on <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> life studies of these men (see, for example, <name type="pname">Prucha</name> 1971, 101-103).</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">Marvin Sadik</name>, writing in 1977 as Director of the National Portrait Gallery (<name type="pname">Sadik</name> 1977, 9), described <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> contribution to American medallic art by referring to his "brilliant series of twenty six [medals] for the military heroes of the War of 1812." He went on to state that:
<q>[i] n the sustained excellence evident in the work of <name type="pname">Reich</name> and <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>, which forms another link in the great tradition established by <name type="pname">Pisanello</name>, one sees a worthy continuation of the high standards set for American medallic art by the trio of Frenchmen [<name type="pname">Duvivier, Dupre</name>, and <name type="pname">Gatteaux</name>] who produced our earliest medals.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A less enthusiastic evaluation was provided by <name type="pname">Vermeule</name> (1971, 39) in his book <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Art in <name type="place">America</name>.</hi> Vermeule mentions <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> once in passing, referring to the "Napoleonic pictorialism and patriotic fussiness of <name type="pname">Reich</name> and <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>."</p>
               <p>However one views <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> work, there is no denying that his prolific output of dies made him the leading figure in American medallic art of the early nineteenth century. Medals from most of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> dies, including all of the War of 1812 and Indian Peace series, have been

restruck and avidly collected since the mid-nineteenth century.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Many, in fact, continue to be periodically restruck from copy dies and sold by the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint as part of a series of "national" medals (<name type="pname">Failor</name> and <name type="pname">Hayden</name> 1972). His dominance of early nineteenth century medallic art in <name type="place">America</name> has not brought <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> a corresponding level of recognition in American numismatic circles. I hope that the information presented here will provide a framework for the fuller study that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> deserves.</p>

            <p>Ninety-two medal dies can be definitely attributed to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> during his American period, but a strong case can be made that the actual number is over 100 and possibly as many as 113 or more.<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref> Uncertainty in the die count results from problems of attribution and the likelihood that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> made some dies that are presently lost.

The tabulation is based on my own observations as well as published and other authoritative sources as cited. The presentation of the dies is not chronological because their exact sequence (as opposed to their year of completion) is poorly known. Rather, the dies are arranged in four broad generic categories. First are dies done under contract to the <name type="place">United States</name> (designated by <name type="place">US</name>-numbers), comprised of presidential portrait dies for the Indian Peace Medal series and Congressionally-mandated award medals for the War of 1812. Indian Peace Medal dies and Army Congressional award dies were made under contract to the War Department whereas Navy Congressional award dies were made under contract to the Navy Department. Second are dies for medals mandated by the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> legislature and made under contract to the Commonwealth of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> (designated by <name type="place">PA</name>) as awards for the Battle of <name type="place">Lake Erie</name> in the War of 1812. Listed third are dies made for individuals, organizations, and as speculative ventures (designated by IO). Dies for individuals (such as IO-17 and 18) and organizations (such as IO-25 and 26) were private commissions. Other dies (such as IO-6 and 7) apparently were ventures intended by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> for striking medals to be sold for profit.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> The fourth and last category in Table 2 comprises dies whose existence is speculative (designated by UV, indicating "unverified"); these are dies for which there is only indirect evidence (i.e. there is a written description, reference,
<pb n="33"/>
or such, but no known medal from the die or die itself).</p>

For most of these, I have relied on comparisons of engraving style or letter punches to attribute them to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>. The exception is die IO-2 (<name type="pname">John Adams</name>; medal 42), which is linked to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> anectdotally, as I describe in more detail below. Although attribution is never certain for unsigned dies, there is little question that most of the unsigned dies in Table 2 were engraved by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>. Why didn't <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> sign them? Some dies, such as inscription die IO-24 (medal 55) and wreath dies IO-26, 27, 30 (medals 56 and 58), probably had too little space or were simple enough that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> declined to sign them. In the case of other dies (PA-3,4, IO-1,2; medals 40, 41 and 42) the lack of a signature is perplexing.</p>
               <p>The die memorializing <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-1; medal 41) is especially interesting with regard to the problem of attribution. This unsigned die, almost certainly by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>, features a bust of <name type="place">Washington</name> on a pedestal flanked by figures representing an Indian and a classical female. It exhibits several strong stylistic links to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> known dies. The modelling of the human figures, especially their musculature and feet, is quite characteristic of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> work. The stance of the Indian closely matches that of a figure on die US-20, the reverse of the Congressional award to <name type="pname">William Henry Harrison</name> (medal 16), and the rendering of the tree branches on the pedestal matches that on die IO-11, one of the reverses of the <name type="pname">Benjamin Rush</name> medals (see medal 47). Attribution of this die to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> resolves a longstanding problem. <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b, 937) noted that an art exhibit in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in 1817 listed a medal of <name type="place">Washington</name> by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> and added that the medal was unknown to her. Apparently medal no. 41 (die IO-1) is the medal in question.</p>
               <p>Die IO-2 (see medal 42), an unsigned portrait die of <name type="pname">John Adams</name>, is atypical of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> work, the bust being rather stiff and not particularly natural. Differences are apparent, for example, with <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> more

lifelike portrayal of <name type="pname">Adams's</name> son, <name type="pname">John Quincy Adams</name>, on Indian Peace Medal dies US-4, 5, 6 (medals 4, 5, 6). However, as <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 31) notes, both <name type="pname">Franklin Peale</name> and <name type="pname">J.R. Snowden</name> explicitly attributed the die to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>. Peale was the <name type="place">Mint's</name> Chief Coiner from 1839 to 1854 and <name type="pname">Snowden</name> was Director from 1853 to 1861. Peale was associated with the <name type="place">Mint</name> before 1839 and thus probably had first-hand knowledge of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> work, lending credence to his attribution. Contrary evidence comes from an 1871 auction sale (<name type="pname">Bangs, Merwin</name> 1871, 69) of the collection of <name type="pname">William F. Packer</name>, a former <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> governor who died in 1870. The sale contained a <name type="pname">John Adams</name> medal (of the correct diameter for IO-2) with the cataloguer's note:
<q>I find the following memorandum in regard to this Medal in the handwriting of the late Governor Packer:</q>
                  <q>
                     <hi rend="italic">During the Presidency of the <name type="pname">Elder Adams</name>, the die for this medal was cut</hi> and submitted to the government, but not accepted. The few Medals struck - some four or five in number - have remained in the possesion of the artist's family until very recently.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The emphasis is mine. If the die was cut during the elder <name type="pname">Adams's</name> presidency, which ended in 1801, it could not have been done by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> (but could have been done by <name type="place">Mint</name> engraver <name type="pname">Robert Scot</name>). Thus, the attribution of die IO-2 to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> is uncertain. If <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> did engrave IO-2, the style must echo that of an earlier portrait, perhaps a painting, that served as the model.</p>
               <p>A number of questions surround the dies for the naval award medals authorized by the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> legislature. Two of the four dies apparently used to strike the original medals are unsigned. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> signed dies PA-1 and PA-2 (medal 39) but the unsigned dies PA-3 and PA-4 (medal 40) also appear to be his work. The unsigned portrait die of Captain <name type="pname">Oliver H. Perry</name> (PA-3) is a matter of curiosity because it features a different rendering of <name type="pname">Perry</name> than the signed die but carries the same legends in the same arrangement. It is very typical of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> style. Likewise, the rendering of the boughs tied with a ribbon on PA-4 is quite reminiscent of the design on die US-32, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> signed reverse of the Congressional award to <name type="pname">Winfield Scott</name> (medal 22). I believe that both of the unsigned dies (PA-3 and PA-4, medal 40) are by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>.</p>
               <p>Unsigned dies IO-26, 27, and 30 are comprised of relatively simple wreath designs used as the reverses on award medals presented by the American Institute and the Mechanics Institute (medals 56 and 58). The two organizations shared at least one reverse die (IO-27), which is found paired with both obverse dies (IO-25 and IO-29). Die IO-26 is
<pb n="35"/>
apparently the earliest reverse and clearly seems to be <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> work. The wreath of boughs tied with a bow is also quite similar to the wreath on the reverse of the <name type="pname">Winfield Scott</name> medal (medal 22). IO-27 is a later die, but stylistically similar and probably also by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>. The authorship of IO-30, a still later reverse die, is questionable. Unlike the oak leaves on IO-26 and 27, which were made with a punch, those on IO-30 are individually engraved. Die IO-30 is quite possibly the work of another engraver copying <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> original design.</p>
               <p>Problems of attribution extend to the provenance of the dies. My intent is to include only "American" medal dies in the tabulation, that is, dies made by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> while he was in <name type="place">America</name>. <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> may have engraved medal dies before coming to <name type="place">America</name> and he certainly did so after returning to <name type="place">Europe</name> (see main text). In most cases the dies in Table 2 are clearly from his American period, but for a few (dies IO-31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36) an American origin is disputable because foreign subjects or interests are represented. Inclusion of these dies in Table 2 reflects the fact that they appear to date from <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> American period. They may represent commissions from foreign interests, perhaps diplomatic or trade missions, that were in the <name type="place">United States</name> at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Intended Die Pairings.</hi> The intended pairing is firmly established for most of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> dies, and is indicated in Table 2. For example, although the dies for the Army medals of the War of 1812 were muled extensively at the <name type="place">Mint</name> during the latter half of the nineteenth century, the intended pairing for these dies is well documented (even if it is not always self-evident). In a few instances, however, dies appear to have been muled so consistently that the mulings have come to be accepted as the intended pairings. In other cases, it is not clear what the intended pairing was or, indeed, whether mate dies ever existed.</p>
               <p>The confusion surrounding the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Naval award dies (PA-1, 2, 3, 4; medals 39 and 40) extends to their intended pairings. <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 166) catalogues four medals representing all possible obversereverse combinations of the two obverse with the two reverse dies. However, <name type="pname">Julian</name> also states that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> engraved only one obverse and two reverse dies for the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> medals. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the signed obverse die (PA-1; medal 39) is known only from two gold medals in institutional collections where it is paired with signed reverse die PA-2: I know of no other confirmed pairings for PA-1 (including the pairing with PA-4 that Julian speculatively catalogues). <name type="place">The Pennsylvania</name> legislature authorized gold medals for Captain <name type="pname">Perry</name>,
<pb n="36"/>
Master Commandant <name type="pname">Elliot</name>, and a Lieutenant <name type="pname">John J. Yarnall</name>, and silver medals of a distinct design for <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> citizens who served in the enlisted ranks in the Battle of <name type="place">Lake Erie</name> (<name type="pname">Ayers</name> 1972, 7). Perhaps the signed obverse was intended to be paired with both reverses for the two different awards. If so, how does one explain the unsigned obverse? The signed obverse die may have failed or had to be retired after a few uses, explaining the lack of restrikes from it and the need for a second portrait die. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the signed obverse was already buckled when <name type="pname">Perry's</name> gold medal was struck. Additional confusion about die pairing probably arose because unsigned obverse die PA-3 was extensively paired with signed reverse die PA-2 by the <name type="place">Mint</name> to make restrikes in the late nineteenth century.</p>
               <p>
                  <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> unofficial die portraying President <name type="pname">Madison</name> (IO-3) has been extensively muled. This die, paired with an unsigned reverse die, was used to strike medals (number 43) in the 1860s or earlier.<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> This pairing is the only one known for IO-3 and has come to be accepted by many as the intended one. However, multiple lines of evidence indicate that it is a mule. First, stylistic comparisons clearly indicate that the reverse die is not by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>. Second, the legend within the wreath, which refers to political issues during the War of 1812, is incompatible with the surrounding legend INDUSTRY BRINGS PLENTY. The design itself, which features agricultural implements, is at odds with the central inscription.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Third, the reverse die was reduced from a larger diameter to one matching that of IO-3. The reduction is apparent from the position of the eagle's wingtips, which extend through the border to the edge of the die (<ref target="#fig-17">Figure A1</ref>). Reduction is also indicated by prior cracking of the die below the word PLENTY, which caused that lettering to be especially close to the new edge (<ref target="#fig-17">Figure A1</ref>). Finally, by the time known medals were struck, the obverse die (IO-3) had been crudely lapped to conceal damage. The lapping obliterated part of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> name on the banner below the bust. All of these observations lead to the conclusion that the reverse die used with IO-3 was not its intended mate, but was concocted to permit restriking the <name type="pname">Madison</name> portrait from an impaired die. The intended pairing for die IO-3 is thus unknown.</p>
               <p>The <name type="pname">John Adams</name> "Indian Peace Medal" (medal no. 42, which uses unsigned portrait die IO-2) is also, strictly speaking, a mule. It is not a true Indian Peace Medal because the <name type="pname">Reich</name> Peace and Friendship reverse was made in 1809 (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 29), well after <name type="pname">Adams</name> held office. <name type="place">Mint</name> Director <name type="pname">J. R. Snowden</name> considered the <name type="pname">John Adams</name> portrait die to be a private commission and noted the absence of a reverse

(<name type="pname">Prucha</name> 1971, 137). The intended pairing is thus uncertain.</p>

                  <p>Fig. A1. Detail of reverse die used with <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's Madison</name> portrait die (IO-3). As seen here, (1) the eagle's wingtip extends through the border to the edge of the die and (2) the word PLENTY, with tangential cracks beneath it, is closer to the edge than BRINGS. Both observations indicate that the die was once larger and was reduced to mate with IO-3.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>Two of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> dies are known only from uniface medals. The dies portraying <name type="pname">George</name>
                  <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-1; medal 41) and <name type="pname">Gershom Seixas</name> (IO-19; medal 52) are not known to have been paired with any die (<name type="pname">Stack's</name> 1996, 40; <name type="pname">Friedenberg</name> 1990). It is possible that no mates were ever made for these dies. This is implied for the <name type="place">Washington</name> die by an entry in an 1817 art exhibit catalogue (cited by <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> 1954b, 937) that mentions the <name type="place">Washington</name> portrait but does not mention a reverse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Missing dies.</hi> Various lines of evidence suggest that I have not identified all of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> American medal dies. First, as shown by Figure 3 in the main text, relatively few dies are known from the early and late portions of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> American career; he had ample time to produce more dies than are now documented. Second, some of FÃ¼rst's dies are known to us through only one, two, or a few medals. In particular, dies that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> made as speculative ventures typically left few surviving medals. Apparently, if sufficient subscriptions were not obtained, a medal would not be struck in large quantities, or not struck at all. This may explain the rarity of medals from the <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-1; medal 41), <name type="pname">Monroe</name> (IO-4, 5; medal 44), and <name type="pname">John Q. Adams</name> inaugural (IO-6, 7; medal 45) dies, and the lack of original strikings from the <name type="pname">Madison</name> (IO-3; medal 43) and <name type="pname">Seixas</name> (IO-19; medal 52) dies.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref> These medals

could easily have been lost to posterity and, by extension, it would not be surprising if others have in fact been lost. Third, indirect evidence exists for several specific dies that are currently unknown. Nine candidates for such missing dies are listed in Table 2 as "unverified" (UV).</p>
               <p>The listings of UV-1 and 2 and UV-3 and 4 are prompted by exhibit catalogues of 1811 and 1829 cited by <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b, 937). The first refers to "a medal of <name type="pname">William Penn</name>," which is unknown today. The second lists a "Cast of a medal of President <name type="pname">Andrew Jackson</name>, on reverse the Battle of <name type="place">New Orleans</name>." Unlike the Congressional award to <name type="pname">Jackson</name> (dies US-21, 22; medal 17), which features an allegorical scene on the reverse, the catalogue explicitly refers to a depiction of the battle. No such medal is known today.<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref> The word <hi rend="italic">cast</hi> in the catalogue entry suggests a trial impression rather than a struck medal; perhaps no struck medals were made.</p>
               <p>The unverified die depicting Captain <name type="pname">Jesse Elliot's</name> capture of the British ships <hi rend="italic">Detroit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> (UV-5) is listed based on an unusual piece of evidence. <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b, 938) located and reproduced an early nineteenth century painting that appears to depict <hi rend="italic">two different gold</hi> medals awarded to Captain <name type="pname">Jesse Elliot</name> (<ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref>). The obverse of the Congressional award (die US-46) is shown together with its intended reverse depicting the Battle of <name type="place">Lake Erie</name> (die US-56) to the left and in the center of <ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref>. However, an undocumented reverse (die UV-5) is also shown, as seen on the right in <ref target="#fig-18">Figure A2</ref>. Reverse die UV-5 may have been mated with the regular portrait obverse for striking an award medal for <name type="pname">Elliot</name> from the Commonwealth of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>.</p>
               <p>I also considered mateless dies to be evidence for missing dies. The <name type="pname">Madison</name> obverse die (IO-3), which is known only from mulings with an unrelated reverse die, is a good example. Did <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> make a reverse die, now missing, to pair with IO-3? I believe it likely because he cut an elaborate reverse die (IO-5) for a similar portrait die of <name type="pname">Monroe</name> (IO-4; see medal 44). Dies that are now missing may also have served as reverses for the <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-1), <name type="pname">John Adams</name> (IO-2), and <name type="pname">Gershom Seixas</name> (IO-19) portrait dies, as indicated in Table 2.</p>

               <p>Damage to the dies, when present, is noted under "Comments" in Table 2. Notes on damage are based on personal examination of many medals. Table 2 reveals a surprising fact with respect to <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> official
<pb n="39"/>
(US and PA) dies: most of the dies for the Navy awards exhibit some sort of damage, whereas few of the Army or Indian Peace Medal dies do. More than 60% (17/28) of the Naval dies exhibit damage (or had to be replaced), whereas this is true of fewer than 10% of the Army dies (2/22) and the Indian Peace Medal dies (1/12). The damage to the Naval dies is usually buckling and cracks. The buckling occurs as a "sinking" of the die that causes it to become mildly concave and the field of the struck medal to be correspondingly convex. The sinking is generally uneven and cracks are often located along the trace of maximum buckling. Other types of damage evident on the Naval dies include stray cracks and indentations and even corrosion that may have occurred during acid "frosting" of the relief.<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref>

               <p>Apparently, most of the damage occurred during the initial handling and hardening of the dies, rather than developing later in the die's life (although the damage often worsened with use). This can be established because the Naval award dies were used in a very consistent manner: first a single gold medal was struck for the honoree, and then a limited

number of silver medals were struck for his officers (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, xxii; 3 gold medals were struck in the case of the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> award to <name type="pname">Perry</name>). Original gold and silver medals therefore display very early die states. In examining several original gold and silver award medals from the Naval series, I have found that damage known from copper restrikes of the medals <hi rend="italic">generally is also present on the original gold and silver strikings.</hi> The gold medal presented to Captain <name type="pname">Oliver H. Perry</name> by <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> and now in the collection of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Naval Academy is an excellent example; this medal was presumably the first struck and shows that both dies were strongly buckled.</p>
               <p>Buckling and cracks occurred during hardening of the die (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 152), which required heating and rapid cooling by quenching in water (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 83; <name type="pname">Landis</name>, 1997). In several instances (US-24, 35, 49, 50, 52, 54), <name type="pname">Julian</name> cites contemporary documents that mention damage caused by hardening. Other types of damage, such as stray indentations, were apparently due to careless handling before hardening.</p>
               <p>Why did the Naval dies suffer more damage than the Army and the Peace Medal dies? They were the first large group of medal dies to be delivered to the <name type="place">Mint</name> for hardening and striking, and inexperience with such large dies may have led to problems. Prior to the large influx of Naval War of 1812 dies, <name type="place">Mint</name> personnel had worked mostly with small coinage dies. <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 113) reports that <name type="pname">Adam Eckfeldt</name>, the <name type="place">Mint's</name> Chief Coiner, was often very slow to harden medal dies. Risk of damage to the dies may have caused <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> to adopt a very deliberate approach to hardening. By the time the Army award dies and most of the Indian Peace medal dies were delivered to the <name type="place">Mint</name>, <name type="pname">Eckfeldt</name> had more experience with the quirks of large medal dies. It is also conceivable that the War Department (which contracted for both the Army's War of 1812 dies and the Indian Peace Medal dies) procured superior steel for its dies.</p>

               <p>Medals from <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> dies are described and illustrated in the catalogue that follows. The arrangement corresponds, as closely as possible, to the listing of dies in Table 2. Cross-references to <name type="pname">Loubat</name> (1878), <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977), <name type="pname">Harkness</name> (1989), <name type="pname">Brown</name> (1980), and <name type="pname">Eimer</name> (1987) catalogue numbers are provided, while cross-references from <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977) numbers to the present catalogue numbers are provided in Table 1.</p>
               <p>The die pairings represented here are generally the intended ones. However, in some cases (which are noted) the die pairing is the most commonly encountered but not the intended one. Numerous mulings, particularly of the dies for Army Congressional awards, are known to exist<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> but are not listed.</p>
               <p>All medals illustrated are from the original dies. Note that all of the official (<name type="place">US</name> and <name type="place">PA</name>) dies as well as some of the unofficial (IO) dies have been copied and that early strikings from copy dies are often confused with those from the original dies. The best diagnostics of original and copy dies are the style and placement of the lettering.</p>

<q>On the reverse die the 5 in JULY 5 is punched over a 6, and SEP. 17 is punched over AUG. 15. The same overpunches can be seen on medals to <name type="pname">Miller</name> (die US-26), <name type="pname">Porter</name> (US-28), and <name type="pname">Scott</name> (US-32). Evidently, there was confusion about the dates of the Battles of <name type="place">Chippewa</name> and <name type="place">Fort Erie</name>. In the case of <name type="place">Fort Erie</name>, there were two significant actions - one on August 15, 1814, in which Generals <name type="pname">Edmund P. Gaines</name> and <name type="pname">Eleazer W. Ripley</name> participated, and one on September 17, 1814, in which, in addition to <name type="pname">Ripley</name>, Generals <name type="pname">Brown</name>, <name type="pname">Miller</name>, <name type="pname">Porter</name>, and <name type="pname">Scott</name> participated (<name type="pname">Hickey</name>, 1989). Apparently, the earlier date was inadvertantly used for those in the later action and then corrected. These overpunches were described by <name type="pname">Michael Hodder</name> in the catalogue of the Dreyfus Sale by <name type="pname">Bowers</name> and <name type="pname">Merena</name> (1986).</q>

                  <p>This unsigned medal is clearly by <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>; the allegorical figures duplicate his style on other medals. Apparently, this is the medal mentioned in a catalogue of an art exhibit in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in 1817 and noted but not identified by <name type="pname">Chamberlain</name> (1954b, 937). The bust of <name type="place">Washington</name> appears to have been inspired by <name type="pname">Reich's</name>
                     <name type="place">Washington</name> Benevolent Society medal. This rare medal (four examples are said to be known) exists only in the form of uniface struck silver shells (Stacks 1996).</p>

Part of the answer may lie in the change in Mint leadership in 1805. As early as 1801 the Mint's third Director, <name type="pname">Elias Boudinot</name>, had resisted hiring <name type="pname">Reich</name> (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 107).

Perhaps <name type="pname">Patterson</name> planned on <name type="pname">Scot's</name> retirement and asked <name type="place">U.S.</name> officials, including <name type="place">Appleton</name>, to help recruit a replacement.

                     <p>The two prominent peaks that appear in Figure 3 may, to some extent, be artifacts of inaccuracy in die completion dates. <name type="pname">Julian</name> (1977, 112) asserts that <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name> worked more or less at full capacity on the War of 1812 dies once he began work on the entire series in 1817.

Even so, <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> maximum output probably was still about 10 dies per year, substantially more than <name type="pname">Reich</name> was able to accomplish. <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name> of the Gallery Mint, who works today as a hand engraver of dies, believes an accomplished engraver capable of hand-engraving more than 10 complex dies per year (<name type="pname">Landis</name> 1997).</p>

                     <p>Restrikes of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> medals were in such demand in the late nineteenth century that the dies often were not robust enough to make the number of medals (typically on the order of 100) needed to supply collectors of that era.

Some of the copy dies made by <name type="pname">Charles Barber</name> carry both <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> name and the initials C.B. Others are much more deceptive, and the medals from them are easily confused with those from the original dies. Lettering on the copy dies had to be repunched, and the style and positioning of the lettering (including <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> name) allow the copy dies to be distinguished from the originals.

                     <p>The reverse design of the <name type="pname">Madison</name> medal appears, minus the central inscription, on a number of different reverse dies that were used to strike award medals for the <name type="pname">St. Louis</name> Agricultural and Mechanical Association. The die used with the <name type="pname">Madison</name> obverse may, in fact, have been made for that organization. If so, the <name type="pname">Madison</name> medals can be no earlier than 1856, the year of the Association's founding.</p>

                     <p>All the medals mentioned are quite rare. There are four known medals (in the form of struck silver shells) from the <name type="place">Washington</name> (IO-l) die, one from the <name type="pname">Monroe</name> obverse (IO-4), a single electrogalvanic shell from the <name type="pname">Monroe</name> reverse (IO-5), and only a handful of examples from the <name type="pname">John Q. Adams</name> inaugural (IO-6,7) dies. In the case of the <name type="pname">Madison</name> (IO-3) and <name type="pname">Seixas</name> (IO-19) dies, no original strikes are known at all; known examples are later restrikes.</p>

                        <name type="pname">Charles McSorley</name> (n.d.) has suggested that a small unsigned medal known to numismatists as a political piece and catalogued as AJACK 1828-10 by <name type="pname">DeWitt</name> (1959, 26) may be <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> (i.e. struck with UV-3 and 4); it features a portrait of <name type="pname">Jackson</name> and the Battle of <name type="place">New Orleans</name>. The portrait, which features <name type="pname">Jackson</name> in civilian attire, is reminiscent of that on the middle-size and small Indian Peace Medals (dies US-8 and 9; medals 8 and 9). However, the engraving is much too crudely done to be the work of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst</name>. An interesting possibility thereby presents itself: could this small medal be a copy of <name type="pname">FÃ¼rst's</name> lost original?</p>

The damage is absent from the higher (field) portions of the die.</p>

            <p>Over the years many medal enthusiasts have had the occasion to come across what appear to be a country's orders or decorations but which, finally, and after considerable frustration, turn out to be distinctions awarded by a fraternal order.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> They are not the less collectable, but certainly are less identifiable than the issues of <name type="place">sovereign states</name>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The medals of secret<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref> and ritualistic<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref> organizations have never received the attention in numismatic studies that the subject deserves (<name type="pname">Morris</name> 1991; <name type="pname">Anonymous</name> 1991, 1; <name type="pname">Peterson</name> 1993). Considering how widespread they are, involving all kinds of people and many countries,<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref>numismatists might give more attention to this aspect of medal scholarship.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> There are a bewildering number of these groups, ranging from those such as the Moose and Elks and Eagles whose animal names at least result in visual clues for disciphering the medal's significance, to organizations like the Odd Fellows and the Orange Order whose symbols are incomprehensible to the public and whose awards' significance defies easy interpretation.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly the most widespread and perplexing source of fraternal medals is Freemasonry. The assistance in identification that the
<pb n="121"/>
Masons themselves can provide is as spotty as the parson's egg. There are some excellent studies, albeit in somewhat obscure publications, such as Anonymous 1997, Wheeler 1992, Wheeler 1996. But much awaits research.</p>

               <p>Award of the Grand Lodge of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> for dedicated service as a lodge treasurer.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>Freemasons in their own discussions often blur the distinctions between medals and other commemorative material such as identification pins (<name type="pname">Cubbison</name>, 90-91). The word "jewel" is used somewhat indiscriminately by them to describe Masonic items, and indeed the principal study group for Masonic medals and associated objects is simply called <hi rend="italic">Jewels of the Craft.</hi> The problem is compounded by the fact that few public or university libraries take seriously the collecting of material on the Masons, so the serious researcher must get permission to use Masonic archives and libraries, which is sometimes difficult. A number of these date from the nineteenth century and have large holdings not only of journals and books but of medals. An idea of what these libraries contain is indicated by the classifications of the Library of the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite in <name type="pname">Washington</name>, which dates back to 1888 and even then had more than eight thousand volumes. There are sections for Masonry in more than seventy countries, and categories include philosophy and symbolism, church and state, paraphernalia, glassware, benevolent and educational institutions, hospitals, cemeteries, architecture, poetry and drama, humor and satire, and women in Masonry.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>

            <p>While other fraternal orders claim hoary parentages which are dubious, there is no question but that Masonry's origins are ancient. They are also controversial (<name type="pname">Rich</name> 1993, 45), partly because some Masons are fond of embroidering the society's quite long history and extending its genealogy further back, to King <name type="pname">Alfred</name> or even <name type="pname">Adam</name>.</p>

            <p>While there do not appear to be any Masonic medals surviving from before the eighteenth century, there are metal objects in collections that may have been used ritualistically from as early as the sixteenth centuryâsuch as tools embellished with engravings.</p>
            <p>Masonry was widespread in the eighteenth century and is not a nineteenth-century creation like so many of the fraternal orders. Therefore its medals have an older and often considerable antiquarian interest.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref> The celebrated Masonic scholar <name type="pname">Albert Mackey</name> wrote in 1917 that, "the earliest Masonic medal of which we have an authentic account is that know as the 'Freemason's ducat', which was struck at Brunswick in 1743. The number have since so greatly increased, that it would be impossible to give even a catalogue of them.<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> They are struck every year by lodges to commemorate some distinguished member or some remarkable event" (<name type="pname">Mackey</name> 1917, 560).</p>
            <p>By 1767, there are reports of a proliferation of medals that were worn around the neck by members on public feast days, at funerals and other special events (<name type="pname">Mackey</name> 1917, 560). Some of these early Masonic medals, both in the <name type="place">United States</name> and <name type="place">Europe</name>, are pierced or fretted along with a certain amount of engraving, and the suggestion has been made that they were not created by specialist medal-makers but often by watchmakers: "...(they resemble) the watch 'cocks'âthat is, the decorative plates, which in the old watches, carry the outer bearing of the balance-wheel. These cocks are pierced or fretted and engraved, and although only as large as a six-pence, include as many masonic emblems as many of the jewels having six times their area...The obvious suggestion is that many of the old masonic jewels of the type described were the work of watchmakers" (<name type="pname">Jones</name> 1980, 468). The establishment of Masonic supply houses in the nineteenth century brought professionalism and a degree of discipline to the field (<name type="pname">Anonymous</name> 1994b, 22).</p>
            <p>The movement's medals vary according to the particular rite involved.<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref> Any discussion of them must avoid the supposition that Masonry is a cohesive movement. That is untrue even within countries, let alone between them. Probably it is more accurate to speak of "Masonries" in the plural, for the differences are large and while in some places the Masons are conspiratorial and clandestine, elsewhere they are benign and charitable:
<q>Although Freemasonry is usually considered a singular phenomenon, it is actually a diverse and wide-ranging complex of
<pb n="125"/>
many different orients; orders; directorates; societies; national, provincial, and grand lodges; rites; and systems. At different times and different places Freemasonry can be politically revolutionary or reactionary, actively involved in public affairs or in retreat from the world, rational or mystic. Some orders and lodges have fallen into obscurantism, charlantry, and religious intolerance. Freemasonry has thrived in different forms in Catholic countries such as <name type="place">France</name>, <name type="place">Italy</name>, and <name type="place">Poland</name>, predominantly Protestant countries like the <name type="place">United States</name>, Orthodox countries like <name type="place">Russia</name>, Islamic countries like <name type="place">Turkey</name>, and recently in <name type="place">Israel</name>. (To this must be added the rapid revival of Freemasonry underway in <name type="place">Russia</name> and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.) Freemasons trace their founding variously to the builders of Solomon's temples, the Knights Templars of the Crusades, and the craftsmen of medieval English and European guilds (<name type="pname">Leighton</name> 1994, 28).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many Masonic rituals make specific reference to medals and orders, and quite often the ritual includes the confering of a medal on the initiate or on a member who has achieved high office or served with dedication. In the first or Entered Apprentice degree, which every Mason regardless of of ultimate rank must take, the candidate is told that membership as symbolized by the white apron is more of an honor than the Garter or the Golden Fleece (<name type="pname">Robbins</name> 1984, 64-66). In the celebrated third degree, the candidate receives a medal as part of a charade in which he thinks he has finished the initiation ceremony, only to be brought back into the lodge for the real and highly dramatic portion of the ritual.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>There are a variety of Masonic medals issued in large number for the various ceremonies, such as Mark Master degree tokens and pennies. Since by the nineteenth century there were more than 1,000 different Masonic degrees or initiation ceremonies, it can be appreciated that the number of medals or tokens used in one or another of these rituals becomes numerous. All of this hoodwinking and marching around strikes the non-member as strange and it may indeed seem "obviously hokey" when "once in so often you march around your lodge room in the wake of the Grand Exalter of the Holy Mackerel and absorb a certain luster from the glittering insignia..." but that was hardly the view of the members, who as the Victorian age lengthened displayed an enormous appetite for ever more fanciful rituals (<name type="pname">Devere Allen</name>, quoted in <name type="pname">Kimmel</name> 196).</p>
            <p>Although Masons would argue vigorously that the medals conferred when receiving the various degrees are indeed honors, there is surely a distinction between them and those which are given for an actual accomplishment. Therefore a possible classification of the various medals awarded in the <name type="place">United States</name> suggests itself:</p>
            <p>I. Medals primarily used as recognition of general membership in the Masonic Order or of a branch, e.g. those incorporating Royal Arch keystones to show membership in that Masonic rite, or Shrine scimitars to show membership in that Masonic collateral body. In a similar category are some medals and medallions which are simply an indication that the member has donated to a Masonic charity (<name type="pname">Anonymous</name> 1995). When found in a dealer's odd lot box, they sometimes are pierced and were possibly used for watch chain

adornment. A British numismatist writes that "our American brethren are particularly fond of pocket pieces. These are most frequently associated with the Craft or blue lodges and have an array of masonic symbols on one side and spaces on the other side for the insertion of a brother's dates for taking the Craft degrees" (<name type="pname">Wheeler</name> 1996, 209-210). (A Revolutionary War Masonic pin was recovered from a camp site some years ago and thanks to scholarship is attributed to General <name type="pname">Otho Holland Williams</name>, who had the good fortune to be painted by Rembrandt Peale while wearing it [<name type="pname">Lang</name> 1993, 134-35]. An excellent post Civil War example of such a pocket piece was recently described in <name type="pname">Cubbison</name> 1995.)</p>

Mason.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>II. Medals showing the office, degree or level within the order achieved - e.g. the double eagle of the 32nd degree in the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry or the sun between open compasses to show election as master of a symbolic blue lodge. Such medals belong in the area of regalia, in that wearing them is often compulsory, as
<pb n="128"/>
indeed it is with some of those medals in category one.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-87">
               <graphic url="COAC13_128.jpg"/>
               <p>Three versions of the medal of a 32nd Degree member, Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>III. Medals that indicate a distinction not earned by taking degrees or by election to office but rather given for singular achievement, e.g. The <name type="pname">Albert Gallatin Mackey </name>Medal of the Grand Lodge of <name type="place">South Carolina</name> or the <name type="pname">John Barney</name> Medal of the Grand Lodge of Vermont. The medals in this class are much rarer than those in the other two classes (<name type="pname">Anonymous</name>, 1967). The first of these to be instituted in the <name type="place">United States</name> on a regular basis was <name type="place">Massachusetts'</name> Henry Price Medal in 1888.</p>
            <p>In all three cases of this simple classification, the medal design can include universal Masonic symbols,<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref> symbols associated with the particular rite or degree, or symbols linking Masonry with patriotic themes.<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> This last patriotic theme has particular interest. While Masonry came to the <name type="place">United States</name> from <name type="place">Europe</name>, it has developed a uniquely American flavor, including a distinctive tradition in medals which reinforces other Masonic efforts to demonstrate that the organization is a staunch booster of flag and country.</p>
            <p>An example of how the Masonic mantle of myth to support this patriotic motif was woven is the Masons' embroidered version of the origins of the American flag:
<q>The Continental Congress with but three or four exceptions was composed entirely of Masons. As Col. <name type="pname">George Ross</name> was of
<pb n="129"/>
Scotch descent, the old Scotch Coventanters' "blue blanker," as it was called, may possibly have suggested the blue field for the union which has been claimed for it; but casting aside this supposition, it is evident that General <name type="pname">Washington</name>, when he designed it, had in mind the Masonic covering of the Lodge, the blue and starry decked canopy of heaven. The three colors, the five-pointed stars of fellowship or fraternity and the seven red stripes, all suggestive of the three, five and seven steps of the Masonry of the Blue Lodge, while the six stars on the Master's collar, the four stars on the Senior Warden's, the two stars on the Junior Warden's, together with the blazing star, comprised the thirteen stars of the constellation of the Masonic union, and were the symbols also of the thirteen States which formed the American Union (<name type="pname">Sherman</name>, 1, 38-39).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Actually there is no evidence that the Continental Congress was so completely composed of Masons or that General <name type="pname">Washington</name> or anyone else was thinking of a Masonic lodge when the Stars and Stripes were designed, but the story is illustrative of how Masonry has woven itself into a national fabric. The effort to do so goes on, as demonstrated by the offer of the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Masons to rebuild the great entrance arch to the national park at Valley Forge. This offer was accepted and the Masons proceeded to rededicate Valley Forge with a ceremony which included a robot programmed as <name type="pname">George Washington</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The wish to commemorate Masonic associations with American history is illustrated by a number of what we call the Class III medals. For example, since 1930 the Grand Lodge of <name type="place">New York</name> has awarded the <name type="pname">Joseph Warren</name> Medal, which is given for distinguished service. The Grand Lodge of <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> gives the General <name type="pname">John Sullivan</name> Distinguished Service Medal. Vermont confers the <name type="pname">John Barney</name> Medal. The choice of Revolutionary War heroes for these medals is illustrative of this desire of Masonry to link itself with American patriotic themes. As a group to be collected, these medals are clearly much harder to come by than many of the medals in the other two categories (<name type="pname">Anonymous</name> 1957).</p>
            <p>In proposing these three categories of Masonic medals as a way to approach the subject, and suggesting that the history of the American Masonic medal involves at times a unique combining of European Masonic and American patriotic symbolism, we still have not provided an easy solution for the problem of deciding whether the treasure discovered at a local flea market is of Masonic origin. Fortunately, as

noted, the Masons maintain a number of excellent libraries and museums, one of which in <name type="place">New York</name> City in the Masonic temple at 71 W. 23rd Street is more than willing to help numismatists.<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> But even with such help, the curator and the collector must exercise tact and remember that they are dealing with a secret organization. One should reflect on the fact that the phrase about giving someone the third degree as a description of a rough time did not enter the language without reason!</p>

College fraternities are an obvious example, but they involved few men and their initiations were brief and underdeveloped. Fraternal initiation was more important in Mormonism, temperance societies, the Know-Nothings and the Knights of the Golden Circle, the Grange, labor and veterans' organizations, and the life insurance industry. Historians of each of these subjects have commented on the peculiar role of initiation, which they generally have attributed to shield members from blacklisting, and fraternal life insurance firms used ritual to remind members to pay premiums.

            <p>Augustus Saint-Gaudens's <hi rend="italic">World's Columbian Exposition Commemorative Presentation Medal</hi> (American Numismatic Society; <ref target="#fig-89">figs. 1</ref> &amp; <ref target="#fig-90">2</ref>) was an official award for the great fair held in <name type="place">Chicago</name> from May to October 1893 to celebrate the quadricentennial of <name type="pname">Christopher Columbus's</name> landing on this continent. This discussion will address the history of the commission, focusing on <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> controversial rejected design for the reverse and why the final appearance of the medal was far from what he originally envisioned. Instead of a piece by the greatest American sculptor of the day, the result was composite: the obverse was by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, and the reverse by <name type="pname">Charles E. Barber</name>, the Chief Engraver at the <name type="place">United States</name> Mint from 1879 to 1916.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> obverse depicts <name type="pname">Columbus</name> alighting from his vessel onto the rocky shore of the New World. He strides forcefully to the left, with right foot advanced, arms outspread, and head raised to the skies. He is dressed in armor and a cloak that partially obscure the attached sword and scabbard. The backgroundâwith its masterful illusion of depthâabounds with narrative details. On the left a banner sweeps dramatically around <name type="pname">Columbus</name>, echoing the medal's edge and reinforcing the explorer's powerful stance. To the right, still on the ship, are three somber male figures, one a standard bearer holding the staff of the banner, and two others who will presumably also disembark. At the upper right are symbolic devices: the <name type="place">Pillars of Hercules</name>, symbolizing the Rocks of <name type="place">Gibraltar</name> with the three caravels setting sail, and the inscription PLVS VLTRA. Filling the field directly below is another inscription: <name type="pname">CHRISTOPHER</name>/ COLVMBVS / OCT XII / MCCCCXCII.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> rejected effort for the reverse features a nude youth representing the "Spirit of <name type="place">America</name>," posed frontally in a modified contrapposto stance. A pencil drawing (<ref target="#fig-91">fig. 3</ref>), now destroyed, reveals a loosely sketched design, perhaps Augustus's conception for his younger brother <name type="pname">Louis</name>âalso a sculptorâto carry out. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> relied on <name type="pname">Louis</name> to model the nude figure, a perfectly acceptable practice for a sculptor with numerous ongoing commissions (<name type="pname">Dryfhout</name> 1982, 202). In a proof cast from the ANS (<ref target="#fig-92">fig. 4</ref>), the supple boy, "in the full vigor of young life" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">R.C. Preston</name>, Director of <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint, November 17, 1893 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers), holds three wreaths in his left hand. He supports a tall shield inscribed "E PLVRIBVS VNVM," and decorated with an American eagle, an olive branch, and a smaller shield. In his right hand he grasps a torch. A young oak tree follows the contour of the boy's shield at the right, while at the lower left, space is provided for the name of the medal's recipient.</p>

               <name type="pname">Barber's</name> version, the final minted reverse of the medal, is a competent, traditional design. It is composed of a central tablet with inscription: WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION / IN COMMEMORATION OF THE / FOUR HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY / OF THE LANDING OF <name type="pname">COLUMBUS</name> / MDCCCXCII MDCCCXCIII. There is space below for a small insert die for the prize winner's name. Flaming beribboned torches representing light and intelligence fill the left and right margins. Above, two semi-draped females are separated by a globe marked with meridian and parallel lines. With trumpet and pen, they announce the award; the figure at the left also holds presentation wreaths. In the lower portion, <name type="pname">Columbus's</name> caravel, the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Santa Maria</name>,</hi> is set in stylized waves under which <name type="pname">Barber</name> signed his name.</p>
            <p>In tracing this commission, it would be easy to reduce the controversy to petty personal jealousies between <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> and <name type="pname">Barber</name>. This element must be factored into the history of the medal; however, it is more important to consider two larger issues that led to the rejection of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> reverse: the climate for American medallic art in the late nineteenth century and public discomfort over artistic renditions of the male nude.</p>

1880, it is simple and sensitive, an exemplar of his experimentation with the sketch aesthetic. Two years later, in 1882, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was asked to enter a competition to design the Temple Award medal for the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Academy of the Fine Arts. He did not, but revealed, "I am greatly interested in the subject of medals" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">George Corliss</name>, November 20, 1882, <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Academy of the Fine Arts Archives). His first official medallic commission was the <hi rend="italic">

The composition reveals an appreciation for Renaissance coins and medals, especially those by <name type="pname">Pisanello</name>, casts of whose work <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> collected according to currently available documentation.

            <p>In 1891 <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was one of ten prominent artists asked by the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Treasury Department to submit designs for the first public competition for new silver coinageâcoinage Mint officials felt should better express the art of the day (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 287). Rather than preparing their designs, the artistsâamong them <name type="pname">sculptors Daniel Chester</name>
               <name type="place">French</name> and <name type="pname">John Quincy Adams Ward</name>âwrote a joint response stating that neither the amount of time nor the monetary compensation was adequate. After the Treasury scrapped this first plan, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> served on a jury for a public competition with Mint official <name type="pname">Charles Barber</name> and <name type="place">Boston</name> engraver <name type="pname">Henry Mitchell</name>. This committee, too, was a dismal failure; from 300 submissions, no new designs were adopted. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> and <name type="pname">Barber</name> sparred over aesthetic and technical matters. In general, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> favored more artistic designs impossible to
<pb n="142"/>
adaptâdue to a high degree of reliefâto the rigors of the coinage manufacturing process. He also informed Mint Director <name type="pname">Edward Leech</name> that only four Americans were qualified to carry out this work, himself and three who resided in <name type="place">France</name>. <name type="pname">Leech</name> countered that he found it doubtful that any "high-class artist...any distinguished sculptor or designer can prepare a practical model for a coin" ([Marks] 1891, 102). <name type="pname">Barber</name> also contended that no one outside the Mint could competently design coinage, and in the end, himself prepared new designs for the 1892 dime, quarter, and half-dollar. Thus the line between <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> and <name type="pname">Barber</name>, artist and engraver, was drawn and would plague the sculptor throughout the remainder of his career (<name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1983, 287-94, and <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> 1891, 1-3).</p>
            <p>In autumn 1892 <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was approached with a proposal from <name type="pname">John Boyd Thacher</name>, chairman of the World's Columbian Exposition's Executive Committee on Awards to complete an award for the fair. The commission was in fact controlled by the Quadro-Centennial Committee of the <name type="pname">United States</name> Senate, a fact that made the sculptor wary. He refused the projectâpossibly as many as three timesâturning down a generous five thousand-dollar payment, "a large sum...in those years" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:66). According to his son, Homer, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> claimed (with uncharacteristic modesty), "that neither he nor any one else in the country could model a decent medal, and that it was necessary to go to <name type="place">Europe</name> for it" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:66).</p>
            <p>In the end <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> presumably accepted the commission out of loyalty to fellow artists involved in preparations for the Columbian Exposition as well as out of a spirit of patriotism. Before his involvement with the award medal, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> had a sustained, but mainly unofficial, role in preparations for the fair, an event which reflected an unprecedented spirit of cooperation among American painters, sculptors, and architects. His one submission for an ambitious outdoor sculptural program, a monumental figure of <name type="pname">Columbus</name>, now destroyed (<ref target="#fig-96">fig. 8</ref>), was modeled by his assistant <name type="pname">Mary Lawrence</name>, to whom he fully credited the work. His <hi rend="italic">

               </hi> (<ref target="#fig-97">fig. 9</ref>), while not prepared specifically for the exposition, was installed on the Agriculture Building (having previously topped the tower of Madison Square Garden in <name type="place">New York</name>). <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> official appointment was as an advisor to the Department of Fine Arts, offering recommendations on the selection of paintings and sculpture (<name type="pname">Carr</name>
               <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1993, 74, and <name type="pname">Potter-Hennessey</name> 1995, 160-64).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>As <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> warmed to the prospect of assuming the medal commission, he had to contend with the <name type="pname">Robert Gould Shaw</name> Memorial Committee, whose members had grown impatient with his painfully slow pace on the monument planned for the <name type="place">Boston</name> Common. Under the terms of his contract, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was obliged to seek its permission to pursue additional commissions. In November 1892, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> wrote Shaw committee treasurer <name type="pname">Edward Atkinson</name> to explain that his desire to design the medal had, in part, to do with his animosity toward <name type="pname">Barber</name>:
<q>I only wish to do it to keep it out of the hands of the man at the mint who I am positively assured...will certainly do it if I don't. If I thought that it were at all possible that one of two or three other artists could obtain the work, I should certainly refuse to have anything to do with the matter (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Atkinson</name>, November 10, 1892 [copy], <name type="pname">Lee</name> Family Papers).</q>

               <p>fig. 9</p>
            </figure>
            <p>So <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> explicitly confessed a desire to hold <name type="pname">Barber</name> at bay, in effect to prevent him from crossing the line from an engraver of coins to an artist of a prestigious medal. Despite Saint-Gaudens's comment that Europeans were more capable medalists, he believed that, in order to raise the status of the American artist, an American was obliged to carry out the commission. Therefore he accepted it.</p>
            <p>By October 31, 1893âwhen the Columbian Exposition closedâ <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> had completed designs for both faces of the medal. He insisted that models be closely guarded until they were delivered to the proper officials. Apparently the obverse was readily accepted. Controversy flared, however, when a rendering of the reverse (<ref target="#fig-98">fig. 10</ref>) was prematurely circulated in January 1894. The respected journal, <hi rend="italic">The American Architect and Building News</hi>, reported that officials of the Page Belting Company of Concord, <name type="place">New Hampshire</name>, to whom two medals were to be awarded, decided that a drawing of the medal would form an interesting decoration for the new calendar which they proposed to send to their customers at the beginning of the year; and, as the medal itself was not yet available, they sent a draughtsman to <name type="place">Washington</name>, to make a drawing from the dies, or from <name type="pname">Mr. St. Gaudens's</name> model <hi rend="italic">(American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49).</p>
            <pb n="145"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-98">

            </figure>
            <pb n="146"/>
            <p>No sooner had the souvenir books with the pirated drawings been distributed than objections to the medal's reverse escalated. Furious that the design had been leaked, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> called the rendering "incorrect and offensive" and threatened legal action (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:68). Furthermore, he characterized the draftsman who made the sketches as an "idiot," and a "<name type="place">New Hampshire</name> ass" (<hi rend="italic">American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49).</p>
            <p>Reconstructing the ensuing sequence of events through letters and newspaper accounts reveals how terribly mismanaged the administration of the commission in fact was. The Page Belting Company publication attracted the notice of <name type="place">New Hampshire</name> Senator <name type="pname">William Eaton Chandler</name>. Though Secretary of the Treasury <name type="pname">John Griffin Carlisle</name> had apparently already "formally accepted" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:67) <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> model, <name type="pname">Chandler's</name> objections forced the Quadro-Centennial Committee to reconsider the design. In January 1894 the Senatorial committee requested that "the Secretary of the Treasury...have work on the dies stopped, on the ground that the nude figure represented on the reverse of the medal was indecent" (<hi rend="italic">American Architect and Building News</hi> 1894, 49). Secretary <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, in deference to his peers and President <name type="pname">Grover Cleveland</name>, recanted the acceptance to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> on the grounds that the nude was offensive:
<q>I am frank to say that inasmuch as there are to be over 20,000 of these medals struck, I am satisfied that it would be severely criticized by a large majority of the people in its present form....I have to request that...you will be kind enough to submit some design covering the objectionable part of the figure (<name type="pname">Carlisle</name> to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, January 23, 1894 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anticipating the likelihood of open confrontation, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> replied to <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, warning him icily: "I of course shall feel at liberty at all times to publish the correspondence between us" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, January 25, 1894 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers). Clearly <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> planned to make <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> the scapegoat for what he saw as the government's provincial and uncultured attitude toward the arts.</p>
            <p>The controversy immediately caught the attention of the press, which followed it for several weeks, often giving it front page coverage.
<pb n="147"/>
The majority of published articles were sympathetic to the sculptor, written by journalists determined to advance the concept of a viable American "school" of artists. A note in <hi rend="italic">The Collector</hi> supporting <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> is a case in point: "To fling into the face of such a man, who is an honor to this country and his art, the filth of time-serving politics, and the ignorance of the intelligences of mud, is not so much to insult him as to defame this country before all the world." ([<name type="pname">Trumble</name>] 1894, p. 101).</p>
            <p>Not surprising, artists, especially other French-trained sculptors, also rallied in support of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>. In their effort to redeem his reputation, they decried the government's censorship and poor track record as a patron of American artists. Their collective organ was the National Sculpture Society, founded in 1893 to regulate commissions for public sculpture and to advance exhibition opportunities for small works. The Society published a resolution on February 12, 1894 that concluded: "That if changes in works of art are ordered, then such changes should be made under the immediate direction of the artist" (copy in <name type="pname">Gilder</name> Papers). In fact, the exact opposite would happen.</p>
            <p>By early March, perhaps mollified by the sympathy of the press and fellow artists, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> consented to make slight, but significant, refinements. He altered his design, as he later put it, to "flatter the sensitiveness of the rampant pure'." (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:68). He experimented with several options, adding a teasingly thin ribbon across what <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> had deemed the "objectionable part" of the nude in one version (<ref target="#fig-11">fig. 11</ref>), while in another, he relied on the time-tested fig leaf (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, March 15, 1894 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers). In April, with limited explanation, the government deemed these designs unfit.</p>
            <p>Although his patience and pride were tested, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> complied with a request from <name type="pname">Robert Preston</name>, new Director of the Mint, to furnish yet another model. On May 22, 1894, the sculptor wrote to his friend, the influential journalist <name type="pname">Richard Watson Gilder</name>: "I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> doing a reverse, but am eliminating the figure entirely, confining it only to an inscription.... The figure that I had composed was composed to be nude, and I find it impossible to drape it without entirely destroying the composition." (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Gilder</name>, May 22, 1894, <name type="pname">Gilder</name> Papers). By ousting the nude, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> presumed that the acceptance of the design was all but guaranteed. In fact, Mint Director Preston had written him to that effect just days earlier, on May 18: "As soon as the Reverse is received, preparation will be made to have it engraved immediately, and to make a faithful reproduction of the same" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:71).</p>

            <p>The revised composition (<ref target="#fig-100">fig. 12</ref>), in the sculptors words, "surely avoided all erotic insinuation" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:68). It is a conventional design with an inscription as the central element: THE COLVMBIAN / EXPOSITION IN COMMEMORATION / OF THE FOVR HVNDREDTH ANNI / VERSARY OF THE LANDING OF / COLVMBVS. The sole vestiges of the earlier compositionâ the eagle, a small shield, and E PLVRIBVS VNVMâappear in a wreath above the longer inscription while below is a tablet-like space for an insert die with the recipient's name. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> sent this design off to Secretary <name type="pname">Carlisle</name> on June 23, believing the problem element to be eliminated. This attempt too was rejected without reason just four days later, while a model for the reverse by <name type="pname">Barber</name> that was commissioned without <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> knowledge was accepted.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> fumed at a chain of events that had ended in deception. In an incendiary letter to Secretary <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, his rage is almost palpable:
<q>You will excuse me for saying that your action in allowing me to devote time, thought and money to the elaboration of this final model, while keeping me in ignorance of the fact that another design was being prepared at the Mint for the same purpose, was something more than discourteous (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Carlisle</name>, July 3, 1894 [copy], <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> Papers).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In a letter that <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> planned to submit for publication in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Daily Tribune</hi>, which is reprinted in his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, he set forth his "mortifying confession of criminal <hi rend="italic">naÃ©vetÃ©</hi>," detailing the circumstances of the commission as a "moral to others moved to entertain government proposals" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:67-68). Seeking to expose the government's bad faith, he printed verbatim the letter from Mint Director <name type="pname">Preston</name> that had guaranteed acceptance of the final design. While the sculptor conceded that, legally, the government could combine his work with <name type="pname">Barber's</name>, "the rare shamelessness of such offense will be appreciated by all my confreres at home and abroad." He would, he concluded, "in all humility, await from these official gentlemen their own explanation" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:72). The sculptor, however, met a wall of silence, and by October 1894, he conceded defeat, the incident having brought him "great distress of mind" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:66).</p>
            <p>Once the decision was made to mule <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> design with
<pb n="150"/>
Barber's, the medal's production rested solely in government hands. In November 1893, Mint Director <name type="pname">Preston</name> asked <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to provide a list of foundries that could strike the award medals, evidence perhaps that the sculptor had requested that they not be struck at the Mint (<name type="pname">Preston</name> to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, November 13, 1893, Records of the Bureau of the Mint, <name type="place">United States</name> National Archives). Annual reports of the <name type="place">U. S.</name> Mint between 1894 and 1896 suggest that the Mint did produce the hubs and dies, but farmed out the actual striking of the medal (<name type="pname">Julian</name> 1977, 410). A sample card accompanying one of the medals in the ANS's collection reads, "Award Medal and Aluminum Case made by <name type="pname">Scoville</name> Manufacturing Company, <name type="place">Waterbury, Connecticut</name>." Thus <name type="pname">Scoville</name> was the producer of not only the medals, but the accompanying velvet-lined cases.</p>
            <p>The medal, along with an award diploma designed by <name type="pname">Will Low</name>, was finally circulated to prize winners in April 1896, a full two and a half years after the fair's closing. An article in that month's <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Numismatics</hi> noted the culmination of the protracted ordeal: "the medals...have at last been issued." Lamenting the aesthetic disparity between <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> obverse and <name type="pname">Barber's</name> reverse, the author commented: "While there is dignity and devotion finely expressed in the figure of <name type="pname">Columbus</name>, ...the general effect of the medal, as a specimen of the highest attainment of American numismatic art, is...hardly up to our hopes" <hi rend="italic">(AJN 1896,</hi> 119-20).</p>
            <p>It would be fruitful to consider the described course of events in the context of American medallic art of the late nineteenth century. In the 1880s, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was part of a growing trend by French-trained American sculptors to embrace a field monopolized by engravers and die cutters. Technological progress revolutionized the methods by which coins and medals were made and boundaries between engravers and sculptors dissolved. The refinement of a reducing machine allowed sculptors to model their designs on a larger scale and then mechanically modify them to appropriate proportions. Thus, the ability to model became the chief requisite for the creation of a medal and sculptors were able to compete on a more equal basis for the abundant commissions. For the Columbian Exposition alone, several hundred coins and medals were produced, from those of official status, such as the <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens/Barber</name> award medal to those sold for negligible sums as collectibles (see <name type="pname">Eglit ca</name>. 1965).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was also a victim of a power struggle waged by <name type="pname">Barber</name> and his chief assistant <name type="pname">George T. Morgan</name> to retain control over
<pb n="151"/>
designs of coins and medals of the <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint. As mentioned above, in 1891, in an effort to address dissatisfaction with the appearance of American coinage, the Mint had engaged in open competition for designs. Although the submissions were unacceptable, and <name type="pname">Barber</name> proceeded to make his own revisions, it is understandable that he and <name type="pname">Morgan</name> would resent the intrusion of lofty artistic ideals into the practical matters of producing coinage. Sculptors, for their part, perceived the Mint engravers as inferior talents because they had not undergone stringent academic training. Such is the case with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> son, <name type="pname">Homer</name>, who years later disdainfully referred to <name type="pname">Barber</name> as the "commercial medallist" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:67).</p>
            <p>As <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> was mired in dispute over the award medal, <name type="pname">Barber</name> was also vying to control two other Columbian coin commissions. The <name type="place">U.S.</name> Mint was, for the first time, to produce commemorative coinage, in this case to help finance the Exposition (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 32). Mrs. <name type="pname">Potter Palmer</name>, as head of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, was responsible for the commission of the Queen <name type="pname">Isabella</name> quarter dollar, authorized by Congress on March 3, 1893, in recognition of women's contribution to American society. She hired <name type="pname">Caroline Peddle</name> for the task, but <name type="pname">Barber</name> intervened and executed the coin himself (see <name type="pname">Taxay</name> 1967, 8-13). <name type="pname">Olin Warner</name>, one of the most esteemed sculptors of the day, suffered a similar fate with his half dollar. Selected by the Board of Managers of the Columbian Commission, <name type="pname">Warner</name> was the first individual outside the Mint to design an American coin. His obverseâa bust-length portrait of Columbusâwas based on a medal (<ref target="#fig-101">fig. 13</ref>) that he produced to commemorate the Exposition's dedication. When <name type="pname">Barber</name> and <name type="pname">Morgan</name> prepared the dies for <name type="pname">Warner's</name> half dollar (<ref target="#fig-102">fig. 14</ref>), they not only clouded his subtle modeling, and reworked elements of the design and inscription, but added their initials, in effect obviating <name type="pname">Warner's</name> principle role (<name type="pname">Gurney</name> 1978, 3:779-80).</p>

            <p>The issue of nudity was also at the heart of the controversy over the initial design for the reverse. Despite his thorough grounding in Beaux-Arts academicism, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> rarely introduced the nude into his work. In the few instances he attempted the subject he often was embroiled in debate over its propriety in relation to the adornment of public space. Three fauns for the <name type="place">Eli Bates Fountain</name>, <hi rend="italic">Storks at Play,</hi> of 1886-87, dance among herons and cattails in <name type="place">Chicago's Lincoln Park</name>. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> originally intended the boys to be nude, but was obliged to add fig leaves at the request of the committee overseeing the commission. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> most notorious nude, the eighteen-foot <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Diana</name>
               </hi> for Madison Square Garden was the object of extensive controversy. The first version, now destroyed, stood atop the Garden's tower from November 1891 to September 1892. There and during its subsequent installation atop the Agriculture Building at the Columbian Exposition, <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Diana</name>
               </hi> had been fiercely criticized as inappropriate. <hi rend="italic">Diana's</hi> display in <name type="place">Chicago</name> may have prompted members of the Quadro-Centennial Committee to take swift action when the dispute over the nude on the medal arose. Lastly, <name type="pname">Louis St. Gaudens</name>, in consultation with Augustus, had modeled a seal (<ref target="#fig-103">fig. 15</ref>), based on a design by <name type="pname">Kenyon Cox</name>, for the main entrance of the new <name type="place">Boston</name> Public Library
<pb n="153"/>
in 1889-90. Here two nude figures supporting a shield bear a resemblance to the figure on the rejected reverse. Opposition to the seal's placement on the library erupted in the Boston press in mid-February 1894, just three weeks after the initial rejection of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> reverse for the Columbian medal. Fortunately, this design withstood the objections of its critics.</p>

            <p>Not only was the inclusion of a male nude on an American medal a gamble, the subject had a tenuous place in nineteenth-century American sculpture. Historically, nudes were acceptable so long as they did not overstep bounds with an American audience: the line between praise and castigation was a fine one. Idealized subjects far removed from modern American life stood a better chance of acceptance, such as Hiram Powers's classicizing <hi rend="italic">Fisher Boy</hi> (1841-44; The Metropolitan Museum of Art), a rare case in which the genitals are not covered, or <name type="pname">John Donoghue's</name> fig-leafed <hi rend="italic">Young <name type="pname">Sophocles</name> Leading the Chorus of</hi>

               <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">George Washington</name>
               </hi> of 1832-41 (National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution; <ref target="#fig-104">fig. 16</ref>), originally installed in the <name type="place">U.S. Capitol Rotunda</name>, provides insight into the furor over <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> nude youth. Also a governmental commission, the heroic-size seated <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">Washington</name>
               </hi> was condemned because the figure was partially nude. Many saw this as an irrational presentation of a venerated leader. Like <name type="pname">Greenough's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">Washington</name>
               </hi>, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Spirit of <name type="place">America</name>
               </hi> overstepped the bounds with viewers unwilling to make the leap from realism to "a bit of artistic idealism" (<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> 1913, 2:66). To its detractors, the issue was not only one of propriety, but also appropriateness: this figure was not an acceptable personification of an American youth of the 1890s. In an era of optimism, realism, and self-confidence, a <name type="pname">Huck Finn</name> or <name type="pname">Tom Sawyer</name> vision of boyhood was fitting, but a nude without a veneer of morality or virtue was direct provocation. That <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> youth was a sensual full-length, unprecedented in an American medal, caused additional governmental discomfort since the nubile youth was to be yoked with the noble <name type="pname">Columbus</name>. Furthermore, since a medal's reverse conventionally featured an artfully placed inscription, a heraldic shield, or an eagle, it is even easier to comprehend the circumstances leading to this	
clash between freedom of expression and censorship.</p>
            <p>In the end, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> original conception was not realized largely because of the incompatibility of subject and audience. Highminded aesthetics could not override moral standards and politics. The incident represented a setback for American sculptors, who through principles ingrained in their French academic training, labored to teach Americans that the nude was not common or immoral, but inspirational and pure. For his part, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> salvaged elements from the medal's reverse and incorporated them into other projects. The elongated shield is realized in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">James Garfield</name> Monument</hi>, dedicated in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> in May 1896. The eagle and motto "E PLVRIBVS VNVM" on the shield were repeated on the reverse of the <name type="pname">Theodore Roosevelt</name> special inaugural medal of 1905 (ANS; <ref target="#fig-105">fig. 17</ref>) and reverse of the
ten-dollar gold piece of 1906-07 (ANS; <ref target="#fig-106">fig. 18</ref>).</p>

            <p>Despite the regrettable close to this chapter of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> career, his contribution toward a redefined field of American medallic art is uncontested.

            <p>A 1917 article on the sculpture of <name type="pname">Adolph Alexander Weinman</name> in the <hi rend="italic">Pan-American Union Bulletin</hi> concludes with a paragraph on his achievements in medallic art:
<q>As a medalist, however, he ranks probably second to none. Ingenious and skillful in this branch of artistic endeaver, he has produced some exceptionally fine work. No doubt his early training as a wood and <name type="pname">ivory carver</name> stand him in good stead. The medal of honor of the American Institute of Architects is his work, as is also the medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the <name type="place">United States</name> medal for life saving on railroads. He also did the official medal of the <name type="pname">St. Louis</name> Exposition. In all these designs he combined strength with simplicity, thus creating an object of striking charm. Most recently he has designed a series of coins for the <name type="place">United States</name> Government. New coins of the denomination of 10 cents and 50 cents are now in circulation in this country and are bringing forth much favorable comment for the beauty of design and the effective expression through it of the spirit and ideals of this country. <hi rend="italic">(PAUB</hi> 1917, 787)</q>
            </p>
            <p>The strength and clarity of design noted in this anonymous review, coupled with a rigorous adherence to classical ideals, distinguish <name type="pname">A. A. Weinman</name>'s medals from those of his contemporaries. Drawing on the evidence of previously unpublished studies, notes, and sketches that have been donated or loaned by the <name type="pname">Weinman</name> family to the American Numismatic Society and the Archives of American Art, it is possible to trace the development of <name type="pname">Weinmans</name> medallic designs and to illuminate the singularity of his artistic vision.</p>
            <p>Born in 1870 in <name type="place">Karlsruhe, Germany</name>, <name type="pname">Adolph Alexander Weinman</name> emigrated to the <name type="place">United States</name> with his family in 1880. At age fifteen, he was apprenticed to a wood and <name type="pname">ivory carver</name> in <name type="place">New York</name>. The following year, he began studying drawing and modeling in evening classes at the Cooper Union. He later said of that experience, "I liked carving, but it was all small stuff and when I saw the large work being done in the modeling class, I made up my mind then and there to quit carving and try to become a sculptor" (<name type="pname">Weinman</name>, Typescript of a public address, April 13, 1948; AAA). When he learned that the sculptor <name type="pname">Philip Martiny</name>, a former pupil and assistant of Augustus <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, was taking on apprentices, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> signed on for the job of "push[ing] a studio broom, keep[ing] the potbellied stove going and mix[ing] barrels of good, wet clay" (<name type="pname">Weinman</name>, April 13, 1948; AAA). Working during the day in <name type="pname">Martiny's</name> studio, <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, like so many of
<pb n="159"/>
his contemporaries, continued his studies in the evening classes taught by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> at the Art Students League. Through these classes, <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> transmitted the Beaux-Arts tradition of bronze sculpture to an entire generation of American sculptors.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After a brief assistantship with <name type="pname">Olin Levi Warner</name>, cut short by <name type="pname">Warner's</name> untimely death, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> joined <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> studio in 1895. He worked closely with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> for the next ten years, before establishing his own studio. While assisting <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> also worked at times with the sculptors <name type="pname">Charles Niehaus</name> and <name type="pname">Daniel Chester French</name>. <name type="pname">Weinman</name> described <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, whom he and other studio assistants referred to as "the Saint," as "a man of remarkably magnetic personality, intensely temperamental and of striking personal appearance, whom I shall always remember with great affection, despite the fact that there was one fault in his general makeup, he habitually forgot to pay his assistant at a specified time and that is the way he was about money in general" (<name type="pname">Weinman</name>, April 13, 1948; AAA).</p>
            <p>Surviving documentation clearly shows that <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> held <name type="pname">Weinman</name> in high regard and bestowed on him the primary responsibility for carrying out important commissions. Likewise, <name type="pname">Daniel Chester</name>
               <name type="pname">French</name> trusted <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> abilities, writing in a letter of September 10, 1903: "I do want all the time you can give me from the first of next month on indefinitely ... I am sorry to stand in the way of your working with Mr. <name type="pname">St. Gaudens</name> but I need you too much to be generous" (<name type="pname">French</name> to <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, September 10, 1903; HKW).</p>
            <p>The exhibition of European medals at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in <name type="place">Chicago</name> first sparked <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> interest in medallic sculpture. His subsequent experience in the studios of <name type="pname">Warner</name> and <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, both of whom received critical acclaim for their masterful portrait plaquettes and medallions in the 1880s and early 1890s, further inspired his early efforts at medallic portraiture.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> earliest surviving portrait medallion is a silvered galvano depicting his mother, Catharina, sculpted in 1896 (Baxter 1987, cat. no. 165, illustrated p. 47).The soft, atmospheric modeling and format of this piece are very much in the Beaux-Arts tradition. The style of inscriptions and use of the Latin "FECIT" in the artist's signature follow <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> practice, inspired by Italian Renaissance models.</p>
            <p>During his tenure with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> modeled other portrait plaquettes and medallions for relatives and acquaintances, but his first commission for a commemorative medal did not come until
<pb n="160"/>
1904. When he received the commission for the official medal of the 1904 <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase Exposition, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> seized the opportunity, crafting a unique series of commemorative and awards medals (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 38-39). The <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase medals are innovative for their use of varying planchet shapes to distinguish the different classes of awards. All of the medals share the same central obverse and reverse designs, but the motifs around the edges of the planchets differ. The format for the Gold Medal and official Commemorative Medal is a triangular planchet with curved sides (<ref target="#fig-107">fig. 1</ref>). The Grand Prize Medal is struck on a shield-shaped flan, the Silver Medal a square, and the Bronze Medal a circle.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> design for the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase medals anticipates many of his later medallic achievements. On the obverse, the central medallion features an image of Liberty cloaking herself and a younger figure beside her in the American flag, with a rising sun in the background. The circular field on the reverse is filled by a heroic eagle with outstretched wings perched on a rectangular plaque bearing the inscription, with a pair of opposed dolphins flanking a scallop shell below. The graceful, curving line, restrained composition, and strong forms evident in this piece are hallmarks of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> mature style. <name type="pname">Weinman</name> became a specialist in the modeling of eagles, and this magnificent bird initiates a lengthy series of variations on the theme.</p>
            <p>In a letter of July 14, 1905 that undoubtedly refers to the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase medal, <name type="pname">Daniel Chester French</name> indicates that he has seen the models for the medal in Ward's studio and congratulates <name type="pname">Weinman</name> on his achievement. He goes on to add:
<q>Mr. <name type="pname">Ward</name> said, that he had called your attention to the drapery in the lower part of the principal figure. This does not seem to me as happy in arrangement as the rest of the drapery. At the same time I hesitate about criticising it, or making any suggestion, the whole thing is so fine. I still fell [feel] that your Dolphins have not squirm enough. I think that the curves in the outlines of them are too true, and that some little breaks in the outlines and some little suggestion of unevenness in the modeling would take away from the regidity I feel in them. You know I criticised them before. (<name type="pname">French</name> to <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, July 14, 1905; HKW)</q>
            </p>
            <p>A somewhat awkward relationship between the drapery and the lower part of the figure of Liberty is evident in the finished medal. <name type="pname">French's</name> comment about the dolphins is also very telling. In the modeling of his medallic compositions, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> favors smooth surfaces
<pb n="161"/>
and clarity of outline over the more nuanced surface modulations preferred by <name type="pname">French</name> and <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>. This stylistic difference reflects <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> closer adherence to Classical sources than to the Renaissance models emulated by <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman</name> certainly adapted his work to the master sculptor's dictates when required to do so, and the Special Inaugural Medal commissioned
<pb n="162"/>
from <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> by President <name type="pname">Theodore Roosevelt</name> in 1905 is a case in point (<ref target="#fig-108">fig. 2</ref>) (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 29, 31). At a White House dinner on January 12, 1905, <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> asked <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to create a special commemorative medal for his upcoming second inaugural. A week later, the sculptor wrote back to the President:
<figure xml:id="fig-108">
                  <graphic url="COAC13_162.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <pb n="163"/>
               <q>If the inauguration medal is to be ready for March the first, there is not a moment to lose. I cannot do it, but I have arranged with the man best fit to execute it in this country [<name type="pname">Weinman</name>]. He is a most artistic nature extremely diffident but he would do an admirable thing. He is also supple and takes suggestion intelligently. He has made one of the great Indian groups at St. Louis that would have interested you if brought to your attention. He is so interested that he begged me to fix any price. I named $250 (<name type="pname">Weinman</name> to <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name>, January 20, 1905; DCL).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Letters from <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> in <name type="pname">Vermont</name> to <name type="pname">Weinman</name> in <name type="place">New York</name> document the progress of the models for the <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> medal and illustrate the nature of the working relationship between the two sculptors. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> sketched out the composition and decided on the inscriptions in consultation with the President, who agreed that the text should be kept to a minimum, following Renaissance prototypes. Weinman attended to all of the technical details, from soliciting proposals for the medal's production to choosing the color of gold for the President's specimen. The Renaissance-inspired design of the obverse features a truncated bust of the President. A noble, Ptolemaic eagle appears on the reverse, accompanied by <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> monogram. <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> required that <name type="pname">Weinman</name> make numerous small revisions in the models before he was satisfied that the medal was ready for casting:
<q>Dear <name type="pname">Weinman</name>:</q>
               <q>I think the eagle without the shield is the right one. I return the model with three little corrections:</q>
               <q>No. 1, showing more of V and N in VNVM by cutting one of the feathers shorter, as I have indicated.</q>
               <q>No. 2, increasing the size of our monograms.</q>
               <q>No. 3, making the front of the rock in simpler planes, as I have also roughly indicated.</q>
               <q>As to the head, it is all right except that I think the letters might be a little thinner and longer in relief; after that is done, go ahead with the reduction</q>
               <q>(<name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> to <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, March 14, 1905; AAA).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In typical <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> fashion, the first trial casts were sent back to Tiffany &amp; Company because they had not been executed "in the best possible manner," and <name type="pname">Weinman</name> tried another foundry [Roman Bronze Works] to see if better casts could be obtained (<name type="pname">Weinman</name> to <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name>, May 3, 1905, and May 21, 1905; DCL). In the end, Tiffany did produce casts that met with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> and <name type="pname">Weinman's</name>
               <pb n="164"/>
approval, and the President finally received his medal in June 1905, more than three months after the inauguration.</p>
            <p>The success of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> designs for the <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase medals and his association with <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> brought him further important commissions, beginning with the <name type="place">United States</name> Medal for Life Saving on Railroads, enacted by Act of Congress in 1905. A unique study for the Lifesaving Medal, presented to the American Numismatic Society by <name type="pname">Robert A. Weinman</name> from his father's collection, shows the design in progress (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, cat. no. 172, illlustrated p. 47). <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name> originally sketched the piece as a two-figure composition, embodying the concept of rescue in a heroic, classical nude who lifts a limp victim in his strong arms. He later reduced the composition to a single, allegorical nude figure that better suits the small scale of the struck medal (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, cat. no. 173, illustrated p. 48). In the final design, the diagonal position of the figure, the tension of the musculature, and the movement of the drapery create a sense of drama appropriate to the subject.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">James Earle Fraser's Harriman</name> Memorial Medal for the American Museum of Safety, issued in 1914, makes an instructive comparison with <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> Lifesaving Medal (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 10, <ref target="#fig-115">fig. 9</ref>). <name type="pname">Fraser</name>, another of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> gifted students, gives the theme of railroad safety a more realistic treatment, using textured modeling to complement the robust image of a contemporary track walker. <name type="pname">Weinman</name> seems to have considered such a literal representation of the subject inappropriate to the format and commemorative purpose of the medal. For the duration of his career, he remained faithful to the classical, allegorical ideal, long after the Beaux-Arts tradition in sculpture and architecture had been eclipsed by what he derisively called the "stark functionalism" of modernist design (<name type="pname">Weinman</name>, April 13, 1948; AAA).</p>
            <p>For <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, the starting point for each medallic design was the search for a symbolic equivalent of the subject. A unique sketch for the 1909 <name type="pname">Edison</name> Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers shows a partially draped, seated figure holding a lightbulb, attended by a small winged genius (<ref target="#fig-109">fig. 3</ref>) (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 49, cat. no. 175). The image of a seated male nude with a lightbulb also appears in another study for this same medal by <name type="pname">James Earle Fraser</name>, suggesting that in this case the allegorical figure may have been a requirement of a design competition for the medal (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 61, cat. no. 232). <name type="pname">Fraser</name> was ultimately awarded the commission for the <name type="pname">Edison</name> medal (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 60, cat. no. 231).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Sketchbooks and drawings in the collection of papers donated by <name type="pname">Robert A. Weinman</name> to the Archives of American Art give further insight into the genesis of <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name>'s medallic designs. Two undated, loose sheets of pencil sketches for medals are illustrated in <ref target="#fig-110">figures 4</ref> and <ref target="#fig-111">5</ref>. The Classicism of these designs is immediately apparent, as is the sense of monumentality in the figural compositions.<name type="pname"> Weinman</name> was an accomplished sculptor of architectural reliefs, and these studies show the austere Classicism of his large-scale relief sculpture translated into the small format of the medal (Dorr 1913). Some of these sketches bear a strong resemblance to ancient coin types, and there are examples in one of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> sketchbooks of studies from Roman coins and Greek sculpture (HKW).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> studies for medallic designs are often accompanied by penciled captions explaining the allegorical subjects of the compositions. On one sheet of studies, for example, the jotted notations include "Joy of Freedom/The narrow path of Duty" (<ref target="#fig-110">fig. 4</ref>); on another, "Adventure, Romance of History," "Adventure, Defence," "Man and his Conscience," "Peace &amp; Security/Parting of the Way," "Reason deceives us often, Conscience never./Man &amp; his conscience/Conscience, oracle of god" (<ref target="#fig-111">fig. 5</ref>) (AAA). <name type="pname">Weinman</name> kept lists of quotations and allegorical subjects for reference. One lengthy, alphabetized list begins: "Ability/Arts, The/Adventure/Adversity/[ ]/<name type="place">America</name>/Civilization/Confidence/Conquest/ Conscience, ..." (AAA).</p>
            <pb n="166"/>

            </figure>
            <pb n="167"/>
            <p>On another page, the sculptor cites <name type="pname">Bartlett's</name> Quotations as the source of inspiration for a design, and in a memo to himself, he writes: "Inscribe message on Reverse of medal, instead of any devise, if found more to the point" (AAA).</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-112">

            <p>In comparison with the medals sculpted under <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> tutelage, two important commissions dating from the years just after <name type="pname">Weinman</name> established his own studio in 1906 show a new sense of maturity in their design and execution. <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> 1907 medal for the American Institute of Architects pays homage to the classical ideal, represented by the jugate busts of <name type="pname">Ictinus, Kallikrates, and Phidias</name>, the architects and chief sculptor of the <name type="place">Parthenon</name> (<ref target="#fig-112">fig. 6</ref>). On the reverse of the ALA medal, a magnificent eagle with partially extended wings appears on a rocky perch, ripping off a laurel branch in its beak. In comparison with the rather tame bird on the reverse of the <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> Special Inaugural Medal, this eagle has a great sense of power and life, enhanced by the way that the motif fills the entire field, extending right to the edge of the frame. <name type="pname">Weinman</name> achieves a remarkable amount of

               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> 1909 medal for the National Institute of Arts and Letters is another beautiful example of the balance and grace that typify his best work (<ref target="#fig-113">fig. 7</ref>). Once more the obverse features a classical theme, the head of Apollo, god of music and poetry. A Roman lamp, symbolic of learning, burns brightly on the reverse. The relief here is higher, the surface smoother, and the forms more sharply delineated than in the AIA Medal. The obvious reference to masterpieces of ancient coinage includes the beaded treatment of the rim. Weinman's placement of the head in a slightly off-center position, with the locks of hair that ripple down the neck transgressing the border, gives the image greater vitality. The reverse complements the obverse in its simplicity and off-set composition.</p>
            <p>Another piece dating from 1909 is quite different in character and unusual in <name type="pname">Weinman's ouevre</name> (<ref target="#fig-113">fig. 8</ref>). <name type="pname">Weinman</name> exhibited the rectangular, cast bronze plaquette entitled "The Charge" in 1910 at the
<pb n="169"/>
American Numismatic Society's International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals, but it is otherwise overlooked in the literature (IECM 4). An unpublished companion piece given by <name type="pname">Robert A. Weinman</name> to the American Numismatic Society represents a naval battle (<ref target="#fig-114">fig. 9</ref>). These small reliefs may be studies for a Civil War soldiers and sailors monument. Both depict scenes of action with historical accuracy. When the nature of the commission necessitated that Weinman forgo the heroic, allegorical nude, he did adopt a greater degree of realism in his figurative sculpture, although in the traditional format of the commemorative medal he chose not to do so.</p>

            <p>In modeling portrait plaquettes and medallions, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> was interested in creating an authentic likeness of the subject. He especially enjoyed portraying children, including his own, who are the subject of numerous reliefs. A medallic portrait of his son <name type="pname">Robert</name> (<name type="pname">Bobbie</name>) exists in two versions, both galvanosâone a plaquette with charming details, the other a circular medallion of the head alone (<ref target="#fig-115">fig. 10</ref>) (Noe, 40; Baxter 1987, cat. no. 171).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name> also played a key role in the Beaux-Arts redesign of the <name type="place">United States</name> coinage, initiated by <name type="pname">Roosevelt</name> and <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> with the ten- and twenty-dollar gold pieces of 1907. In a 1916 design competition for the fractional silver coins, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> was selected as the artist for the revamped dime and half-dollar pieces.</p>

            <p>The so-called "Mercury" dime, misnamed because of the wings applied to Liberty's cap, is the less successful of the two designs. An exquisite plaster sketch for the head of the Walking Liberty on the half dollar, based on ancient coin types, shows how the obverse of the dime might have looked without the problematic wings that <name type="pname">Weinman</name> deemed symbolic of "liberty of thought" (<ref target="#fig-117">fig. 11</ref>). <name type="pname">Cornelius Vermeule</name> has speculated that another reason for the wings is "because <name type="pname">Weinman</name>, in the true <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens</name> tradition, liked the effect of feathers in relief on his coins and medals" (<name type="pname">Vermeule</name>, 145).</p>

            <p>The "Walking Liberty" half dollar is a true masterpiece of design, the highpoint of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> medallic career, drawing together elements from his earlier work in a perfect balance of strongly modeled, sculptural form and elegant, linear pattern (<ref target="#fig-118">fig. 12</ref>). Although the powerful
<pb n="172"/>
eagle on the reverse of the coin resembles the one that <name type="pname">Weinman</name> had sculpted for the 1909 AIA medal, the uplifted head of the bird creates a much stronger diagonal axis in this composition, and it links the obverse and reverse of the coin thematically. Just as the sun rises in the image on the obverse, the eagle on the reverse raises its head as if readying for flight. In comparison with the modeling of the reverse of the AIA medal, the sharpness of contour and depth of relief achieved in the small format of the half dollar are extraordinary, surpassed only by the high relief version of <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> twenty-dollar gold piece.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> design for the obverse of the half dollar is reminiscent of the earlier <name type="place">Louisiana</name> Purchase Medal in its use of the flag drapery encircling the figure of Liberty and the rising sun motif. The rising sun also figured in <name type="pname">Saint-Gaudens's</name> design for the twenty-dollar gold piece. <name type="pname">Liberty's</name> striding pose echoes Roty's "Semeuse" or "Sower" on the French two-franc piece, and it has been noted before that the choice of a French-inspired design on the eve of <name type="place">America's</name> entry into World War I was not merely a personal artistic statement. <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> Walking <name type="pname">Liberty</name> is a beautiful figure. Her billowing swirls of drapery create a sense of flowing movement, echoing the circular outline of the frame, and she strides forward with strength and purpose. As in many of <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> medallic compositions, the figure overlaps the inscription, accentuating her stature, and the drapery spreads out to give her lower body breadth, revealing the form beneath. In this relief, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> achieves a breathtaking synthesis of sweeping line, precise detail, and sculptural volume.</p>
            <p>The American art medal reached its apogee in the years prior to World War I, and the War effectively marked the end of the renaissance of medallic sculpture in this country. World War I did occasion an outpouring of decorations and commemorative medals, but the Beaux-Arts tradition was ill-suited to expressing the horrors of a brutal, devastating war (<name type="pname">Jones</name>, 1979, 152). Although <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> 1920 War Service Medal for <name type="pname">Mt. Sinai</name> Hospital is one of the more successful American war medals from an artistic standpoint, it illustrates the difficulties of adapting the classical, allegorical vocabulary to commemorating the events of the war (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, 11, <ref target="#fig-118">fig. 12</ref>) .The grace of the central figure in <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> composition and the limp pathos of the warrior whom she protects from a menacing German soldier are faithful to their Greco-Roman sources, but the stereotypical treatment of the theme limits its effectiveness. A series of pencil sketches for the <name type="pname">Mt. Sinai</name> medal shows that <name type="pname">Weinman</name> considered several other compositions
<pb n="173"/>
before settling on the grouping of three figures (HKW). At an earlier stage of the design, he placed the wounded figure in the lower righthand corner, slumped in the posture of the famous Hellenistic sculpture of the <name type="pname">Dying Gaul</name>. The female figure towered above him, holding a caduceus in one hand and raising the other arm to ward off the advance of the threatening enemy behind her. The final design works more successfully in filling the circular format of the medal, and <name type="pname">Weinman</name> atypically adds the suggestion of a battlefield setting in the lower corner to balance the composition.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-119">
               <graphic url="COAC13_173.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Another group of more finished pencil sketches exists for a second medal commissioned by <name type="pname">Mt. Sinai</name> Hospital, the Trusteeship Medal, "presented in recognition of 25 Years of Distinguished Service" (<ref target="#fig-119">fig. 13</ref>) (Undated; AAA). Once again, in the search for a suitable obverse design, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> conceives of the composition in terms of monumental groupings of allegorical figures.<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref> This severe Classicism runs as a thread through much of his later work, which lacks the subtlety and grace of his earlier medals.</p>
            <p>In 1919, when the American Numismatic Society held a design composition for a new award medal to be presented annually to an outstanding medalist, <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name>'s proposal was selected as the best among fifteen entries. <name type="pname">Weinman's</name> classic design for the <name type="pname">J. Sanford Saltus</name> Medal set a high standard for the "signal achievement in the art of the
<pb n="174"/>
medal" that the award celebrates (<name type="pname">Baxter</name> 1987, cat. no. 182, illustrated p. 89). The restrained composition, elegant line, and delicate modeling of the obverse, a symbolic representation of Medallic Art, complement the more vigorous image of Pegasus on the reverse, which is effectively set off from the lengthy surrounding inscriptions by the use of a recessed field.</p>
            <p>Fittingly, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> himself was the second recipient of the Saltus Award in 1920, in recognition of his exceptional contributions to medallic art. In his finest medallic work, <name type="pname">A.A. Weinman</name> transcended the limitations of a mode of expression that would soon be regarded as irrelevant to the modern age. Recasting the classical vocabulary in his own terms, <name type="pname">Weinman</name> created coins and medals that are a lasting tribute to his technical skill and innate aesthetic sensibility.</p>

            <p>The abundant wealth of the <name type="pname">Edwardian era</name>, though concentrated in the hands of a few, provided the means for a flowering of the arts that has not been matched since. It was in this world of privilege that <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name> made his mark as an artist. Although overlooked today, a century ago <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> was on the verge of becoming a fashionable society artist. His body of work includes approximately 50 medals, produced in <name type="place">England</name> and the <name type="place">United States</name>.</p>
            <p>In the introductory text, I will discuss only a portion of <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> work. The accompanying catalogue is, however, as complete as I have been able to compile. I began to accumulate information on these medals about ten years ago, and have long put off publishing anything until now because there are so many questions for which I have not been able to find answers; not the least of which are the identities of many of the small portrait medals <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> produced. However, the occasion of a second COAC on medals has inspired me to publish what I have found in the hopes that someone might be able to provide additional information about the artist and his work.</p>

            <p>For someone who had access to the highest levels of society, surprisingly little is known about <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> life. He appears to have destroyed virtually all private papers prior to his death, and is rarely mentioned in biographies and histories. Therefore, most of the little we do know comes from his highly readable, but carefully guarded 1925 autobiography.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name> was born in <name type="place">Vienna</name> in 1866 (<ref target="#fig-120">fig. 1</ref>). His father, who was born in <name type="place">Hungary</name>, married the <name type="pname">boss's</name> daughter and after moving to <name type="place">Vienna</name> became a reasonably successful businessman. In addition to an older brother who died prior to <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> birth, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> had at least one sister, <name type="pname">Renee</name>; neither sibling ever married. Raised largely by his father, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> entered the family business after leaving college. Finding he had neither the inclination nor the ability for commerce, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> obtained his father's permission and enrolled in the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts where he studied sculpture and drawing. While at the Academy, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> also studied piano at the <name type="place">Vienna</name> Conservatory (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 3-12). Thus began what <name type="pname">Mark Jones</name> so aptly described as "a curious career as cosmopolitan, socialite and portraitist to the international rich" (<name type="pname">Jones</name> p.23).</p>
            <p>Shortly after the death of his parents in around 1888, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> went to <name type="place">Berlin</name> where he studied under Professor <name type="pname">Schaper</name>. The Professor's remark that <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> "...knew nothing about sculpture" apparently came as no surprise to the student (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p.13). However, after some serious study, <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> abilities seems to have improved, so that during his two years in <name type="place">Berlin</name> he was awarded a number of minor commissions from the court and a traveling scholarship to Rome (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp.16-19). While in Rome, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> embarked upon a five year project of a marble statue entitled "Mother Love," for which he eventually received a gold medal from the Art Association of <name type="place">Munich</name> (<ref target="#fig-121">fig. 2</ref>). Described by Fuchs as "a monument to the love and unflinching suffering of motherhood," it might also be described as Victorian sentimentality at its worst (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 25-30). Though poorly designed, it was well executed, and for our purposes, hints at the medallic work which would soon follow. Within the pedestal of the statue were four bronze panels (<ref target="#fig-122">fig. 3</ref>); two in high relief and two in relief that Fuchs described it as "a form of <hi rend="italic">relievo</hi> so low that it might almost be termed a painting in stone. This is the most difficult. To distinguish the modeling at all, it has to be illuminated by sharp light which will throw deep shadow. Its application is particularly well suited for medals and was practiced by Roty, DuprÃ© and BottÃ©e to best advantage" (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 30).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>While in Rome, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> received commissions for portraits and busts, including those from <name type="pname">Alexandra Ellis</name>, daughter of <name type="pname">Arthur Ellis</name>, Equerry to the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>, and Mrs. <name type="pname">Carl Meyer</name>, whose husband was the manager for the <name type="place">London</name> Rothschilds. As the bust of Mrs. <name type="pname">Meyer</name> could not be finished prior to her return to <name type="place">London</name>, <name type="pname">John Singer Sergeant</name> offered Fuchs the use of one of his <name type="place">London</name> studios (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 32).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> arrived in <name type="place">London</name> in the summer of 1897. Having soon set up his own studio in <name type="place">Kensington</name>, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> continued to work on his bust of Mrs. <name type="pname">Meyer</name>, as well as receive new commissions. He was also introduced to General <name type="pname">Arthur Ellis</name> and received a commission for a bust of his youngest daughter (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 35-37). Beginning in 1898 <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> executed a series of small portrait medals of <name type="place">London</name> society. Among the first was a commission by <name type="pname">Lady Randolph Churchill</name> shortly after the
<pb n="181"/>
return of her son <name type="pname">Winston</name> from <name type="place">South Africa</name> (Catalogue no. 3). According to <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>, she "commissioned me to make a small medal with the profiles of her two boys one on each side, which she always wore around her neck. It was considered a novel idea and led to a sort of fashion..." (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 50-51).</p>

               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> probably owed much of his popularity as a medalist to another patron, however, the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>. Shortly after the youngest <name type="pname">Miss Ellis's</name> engagement, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> prepared a small portrait medal of her father, which he attached to a small chain as a bracelet and presented as a wedding present (catalogue no. 1). Not surprisingly, the General was
<pb n="183"/>
pleased with his portrait and ordered more, which he had placed in ashtrays, cigarette cases and other small objects which were distributed as Christmas presents. Among the recipients was the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>, who ordered a similar medal in June 1899. At one of the sittings, the Prince prepared two autographs with his initials and the date September 9, 1899 and requested that the medals be ready by that time (catalogue no. 6). Unfortunately, the significance of that date has so far proven elusive. A second reverse was also paired with the same portrait, displaying the Prince's insignia of feathers and the date 1899 (catalogue no. 7). One hundred such medals were ordered and distributed at Christmas of the same year (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 64-67).</p>
            <p>Additional commissions from the royal family followed the medal for the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>. One of these was for a large silver medal depicting the Princess of Wales (catalogue no. 20). According to <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>, <name type="pname">Alexandra</name> was greatly interested in the production of this medal. In a note dated December 6, 1900, <name type="pname">Charlotte Knollys</name> (Lady in Waiting to the Princess of Wales) informed <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> that, "The Princess's favorite flower is the rose, but H.R.H. is very anxious that you should make the background of the medal as <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> and delicate as the one in the 'War and Peace'<ref target="#CH5-n1">1</ref> medal, which she admires particularly. I may tell you in confidence that the Princess does not wish to have her name placed in <hi rend="italic">relief</hi>, as in the case of the reverse of the Prince's medal, as she thinks it makes it look hard and cutting." In another note dated December 29, <name type="pname">Knollys</name> wrote, "The Princess says you were consulting together about the inscription to be put on the back of her medal, so I write one line to tell you privately that I am sure the one she would like best would be 'Princess of Pity,' as several of the newspapers have called her lately" (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> pp. 115-117).</p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> adopted these suggestions. The Princess's name, found beneath the bust is incuse, and the border design consisting of ribbons and roses is softly modelled. To complement the description of the "Princess of Pity" is the reverse design of Faith, Hope and Charity. These medals, which were struck in two sizes, were used as Christmas presents in 1901.</p>
            <p>At the request of Queen <name type="pname">Victoria</name>, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> produced two medals to mark the entry of her reign into the new century. The larger of the two, which was also produced in two sizes, depicts a crowned bust of the Queen on the obverse, and a figure standing on a globe and bearing a facsimile autograph on the reverse (catalogue no. 18). The second medal, a smaller, more informal medal meant for the Queen's family,
<pb n="184"/>
portrays <name type="pname">Victoria</name> in the cloth cap she normally wore, and her signature on the reverse (catalogue no. 17; Fuchs pp. 101-109). Shortly afterwards, in January 1901, Queen <name type="pname">Victoria</name> died and was succeeded by her son, the <name type="pname">Prince of Wales</name>, now <name type="pname">Edward VII</name>. Along with the new reign came additional commissions for <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>On April 23, 1901 the King asked <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> his views concerning a coronation medal and soon received a commission for one medal. Following a practice initiated with <name type="pname">Victoria's</name> Golden Jubilee in 1887, two official medals were issued, a table medal for sale to collectors and a military medal to be awarded to participants. Basing his design on the <name type="pname">St. Helena</name> medal, which was instituted under <name type="pname">Napoleon III</name> and awarded to veterans of <name type="pname">Napoleon's</name> campaigns (<ref target="#fig-124">fig. 5</ref>), <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> prepared two slightly different versions of the military medal (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> 161-162). The first, awarded to those who took part in the coronation ceremony, is slightly oval and depicts crowned busts of <name type="pname">Edward</name> and <name type="pname">Alexandra</name>, left, within a border composed of laurel wreaths surmounted by a crown; on the reverse is the royal cypher within a similar border (catalogue no. 32). A second version, on a round planchet with the portraits reversed was issued to <name type="pname">Lord Mayors</name> and other civic officials who took part in the ceremonies (catalogue no. 33). In comparison is the official commemorative medal by de Saulles (<ref target="#fig-125">fig. 6</ref>). Besides the enormous difference in style, the cross on top of the crown is noteworthy; most artists depict the cross on top of the crown sideways so that it is recognizable as a cross. In fact, when seen from the side, one would only see a vertical bar; <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>, despite his impressionistic style, often strove for accuracy in detail.</p>
            <pb n="185"/>

            </figure>
            <p>Considering his relative obscurity today, it is perhaps surprising to note that some of <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> medals were enormous commercial successes. <name type="pname">Elkington</name>, which struck the military style coronation medals received permission to use the reversed portraits on commercial medals. For this, Fuchs designed a reverse portraying a seated Britannia with Westminster Abbey in the background. On the shield is the date of the coronation, June 26, 1902 (catalogue no. 34). When the King suffered an attack of acute appendicitis, the date for both the coronation and the medal were changed to August 9. <name type="pname">Elkington</name> also paired the obverse design with many local reverse dies. Altogether, some 950,000 medals were sold, although orders for 40,000 were canceled when the King became ill (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 162).</p>
            <pb n="186"/>
            <p>While in <name type="place">England</name>, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> also designed a number of medals relating to the Boer War. Three relate to heroes of the war, General Sir <name type="pname">Robert Baden-Powell</name> (catalogue no. 26), <name type="pname">Field Marshall Lord Roberts</name> (catalogue nos. 22 and 23) and General Sir <name type="pname">George White</name> (catalogue no. 24). In 1900 <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> prepared a medal marking the end of the war and bearing the inscription TO THE/ MEMORY OF THOSE/WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR/QUEEN AND COUNTRY (catalogue no. 21). In 1902, when the war finally did end, the medal was reissued, but with the new date and the inscription changed to read KING AND COUNTRY (catalogue no. 36).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> came to the <name type="place">United States</name> for the first time in order to finish a portrait and began the custom of spending his winters in <name type="place">New York</name>, supplying art for the rich, though not necessarily discerning Americans (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p.188). In 1906 Fuchs received his first medallic commission in this country, a membership medal for the Hispanic Society of <name type="place">America</name> (catalogue no. 39). At the time, the Society consisted of up to 300 corresponding members; between 1906 and 1924 they were awarded bronze membership medals. From those 300, no more than 100 members were named and presented with silver medals (HSA p. 38).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> produced a second medal for the Hispanic Society when he was commissioned to design their Medal of Arts and Literature (catalogue no. 40). Approximately 4 inches in diameter, this impressive medal has been awarded since 1907 to "men and women distinguished in the field of Hispanic art, history, or literature" (HSA p. 38). The obverse depicts the seated figure of Inspiration surrounded by eight female figures representing the arts, while on the reverse is a Genius seated on a sarcophagus, kissing a standing female. This medal was first struck by <name type="pname">Tiffany</name> &amp; Co., and later by the Medallic Art Co..</p>
            <p>Between 1908 and 1913, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> designed three medals for the American Numismatic Society. The first was a double commemorative honoring both the 50th anniversary of the A.N.S. and its President, <name type="pname">Archer M. Huntington</name> (catalogue no. 41). During the Fiftieth Anniversary meeting<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref>
               <name type="pname">Huntington</name> cancelled the Society's $25,000. loan, leaving the Society free from debt (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> pp. 148-150). A resolution by <name type="pname">George F. Kunz</name> was unanimously adopted calling for a medal in <name type="pname">Huntington's</name> honor bearing a portrait of <name type="pname">Huntington</name> on the obverse and a picture of the new building on the reverse. Although <name type="pname">Victor D. Brenner</name> had previously submitted some sketches for just such a medal to <name type="pname">Bauman Belden</name> for circulation among the members of the committee on medals, the commission was eventually given to
<pb n="187"/>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name>. In keeping with <name type="pname">Huntington's</name> wishes, his portrait was not used. On the obverse, therefore, is a coining press with a male figure on either side while a third male is seated in front examining a coin; above is the inscription <name type="pname">ARCHER MILTON HUNTINGTON</name> MEDAL. On the reverse a standing female figure holds a scroll upon which is a representation of the Society's building and an appropriate inscription noting the organization's 50th anniversary. One gold medal was struck and presented to <name type="pname">Huntington</name>; of the eleven silver specimens struck, one was reserved for the Society's cabinet. Since 1918, silver specimens have been awarded to individuals in recognition of outstanding achievement in numismatic scholarship. In addition, bronze medals were both offered for sale to members and presented to contributors to the Exhibition of <name type="place">United States</name> Coins held from January 17 to February 18, 1914, and to the Exhibition of March 26 to May 15, 1914 (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> pp. 175-177).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> second medal on behalf of the American Numismatic Society was struck in 1909 to mark the <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> Celebration (catalogue no. 42). Issued in conjunction with the <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> Celebration Commission, it was struck in six sizes in a variety of medals, and might rank as the most common of all <name type="place">United States</name> commemorative medals, with a total of 124,698 struck. The obverse portrays <name type="pname">Hudson</name> and his men on the deck of his ship, the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Halve Maene</name>
               </hi>, while the reverse depicts allegorical representations of Steam Navigation, History and Commerce beneath a portrait of <name type="pname">Robert Fulton</name>; in the background are views of <name type="place">New York</name> in 1807 and 1909 (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> pp. 177-178).</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> went to great lengths to insure the accuracy of design of this medal including several trips to <name type="place">Holland</name> to obtain official sanction for his portrayal of the <hi rend="italic">Half Moon.</hi> Surprisingly, the greatest difficulty seems to have come from the name of the ship; after the determination that the proper spelling was 'Halve Maene,' dies were prepared, only to have papers received from <name type="place">Holland</name> illustrating the reproduction of <name type="pname">Hudson's</name> ship, the 'Halve Maen.' Frantic cables to Dutch authorities confirmed their original determination that the name of the ship should include the final 'e' (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> pp. 179-180). Similar problems arose with the depiction of the Claremont; after the plaster models were delivered to the die sinker, they were altered twice as changes were made in the construction of the replica of the ship (<name type="pname">Adelson</name> p. 180).</p>
            <p>In 1913 <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> was commissioned to design a medal in memory of <name type="pname">John Pierpont Morgan</name>, who had died earlier that year (catalogue no.
<pb n="188"/>
43). According to the Society's annual report for 1913, the medal was issued in recognition of <name type="pname">Morgan's</name> work in support of art <hi rend="italic">(ANS Proceedings</hi>, p.12). Struck in the exceedingly low relief which characterizes many of <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> medals, the obverse depicts the facade of a building with four columns; from a niche in the center descends Art; the allegorical groups on either side represent painting and sculpture. On the reverse, flanked by allegorical figures representing Fame and Industry, is a plaque with the simple inscription <name type="pname">JOHN/PIERPONT/MORGAN</name>. The single gold specimen was presented to Mr. <name type="pname">Morgan's</name> family and resides in the famed library today; additional specimens in bronze and silver were, as usual, available for purchase.</p>
            <p>For a number of years <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> divided his time between <name type="place">England</name> and the <name type="place">United States</name>. He had previously suffered verbal attacks as a foreigner when he was commissioned to design the new postage stamps for <name type="pname">Edward VII</name>. Now, even though a naturalized British subject, he suffered even more as a result of the anti-German feeling prevalent after the start of World War I. In this he was not alone; even <name type="pname">George V</name> was not exempt. <name type="pname">H. G. Wells</name>, who had urged the formation of Republican societies, referred to the Court as "alien and uninspiring." In his characteristic bluntness, the king remarked "I may be uninspiring but I'll be damned if I'm an alien!" (<name type="pname">Edwards</name> p. 300). <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> decided to wait out the war in the <name type="place">United States</name>. When, after the armistice he had written to a friend<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> to see if popular feelings had changed, he was advised to wait a year or so (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 175). By that time, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> had become engaged in another project and eventually gave up the idea of returning to <name type="place">England</name>,<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> and was naturalized as a <name type="place">United States</name> citizen in 1924 (Petition).</p>
            <p>The end of World War I was marked not only by <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> disappointment in not returning to <name type="place">England</name>, but also by a commemorative plaquette issued by <name type="pname">Cartier</name> (catalogue no. 44). World War I changed the popular notion of war from that of a gentlemanly pursuit to an act of horror. This change is reflected in <name type="pname">Fuchs's</name> work; whereas the Boer War medal depicts war and its resultant deaths in sentimental terms, the World War I medal depicts it as something more graphic and personal.</p>
            <p>Even though he was now living in a republic, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> had not given up on his attachment to the upper class, producing medals for the <name type="pname">Cartier</name> and <name type="pname">Heinz</name> families, as well as a number of corporate pieces. One of these, for the <name type="pname">H. J. Heinz</name> Company, was struck in gold for presentation to those employees who had served the company twelve years (catalogue no. 46). First issued in 1922, over 500 medals were issued
<pb n="189"/>
the first year (<hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi>, May 1922 p. 235).</p>
            <p>In 1926 Fuchs produced two medals for the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Times;</hi> one was for The National Oratorical Contest on the Constitution of the <name type="pname">United States</name>, open to all students in secondary schools (catalogue no. 55). The country was divided into seven regions, each under the sponsorship of a different newspaper. The region for the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Times</hi> consisted of the Metropolitan area and parts of <name type="place">New York State, New Jersey</name> and <name type="place">Connecticut</name>. Students in each of 64 districts submitted essays on any of ten subjects related to the Constitution, with each school picking its own winner. The winners would then compete at the district, regional, national and international level. Although cash prizes were awarded to all winners at the district level and higher, medals were presented to the winners at each school.</p>
            <p>According to the report on the oratorical contest, response to the contest was one of optimistic enthusiasm; of the 417 schools entered, only 275 produced actual candidates for competition. Nationally, an estimated 15,000 students participated. Although a number of suggestions were made that separate contests be held for boys and girls, the idea was rejected; to quote the report "But the holding of dual contests would be a tremendous, if not unworkable, proposition. Boys and girls nowadays are supposed to enjoy equality in all things - why not in competition?" (Report "Separating Boys and Girls").</p>
            <p>The second <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> medal, for the Intercollegiate Current Events Contest (catalogue no. 56), was instituted to "stimulate undergraduate interest in what is going on in the world outside college walls as such happenings are reflected in the printed news from day to day." The winners in each school were awarded a medal and $250, and the intercollegiate champion $500. Eleven schools participated in the first year of competition, increasing to 19 schools for the second year in 1927 <hi rend="italic">(<name type="place">New York</name> Times</hi>, Nov. 7, 1926 p. 4).</p>
            <p>Although he achieved a moderate success in the <name type="place">United States</name>, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> never attained here the social position or happiness he enjoyed in <name type="place">England</name>. In fact, although the idea of writing his memoirs emerged, at the earliest, in 1924, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> makes little mention of his work after 1914. There are, however, hints of his becoming less fashionable.<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> In addition, the times were changing, and Fuchs did not appreciate the new art, claiming that "In the present tendency in sculpture in <name type="place">America</name> I notice a leaning of a group of gifted young sculptors towards Byzantinism, if I may so call it. I believe it is as great a waste of their energies, their time and their talents as it was for <name type="pname">Thorvaldsen</name> and
<pb n="190"/>
               <name type="pname">Canova</name> with their imitations of classicism" (<name type="pname">Fuchs</name> p. 238).</p>
            <p>On January 13, 1929 <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name> shot and killed himself in his studio and apartment at the Hotel des Artistes in <name type="place">New York</name> City. He had been unsuccessfully operated on for stomach cancer the preceding June, and although the exact nature of his illness was kept from him, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> knew he was dying. He left a note to his sister which read:
<q>Dear <name type="pname">Renee</name>:</q>
               <q>You can see with your own eyes that I am going down every day. You would not like to see me wasting away much more. As it is now, I am already a burden to myself and a burden to my surroundings.</q>
               <q>There are moments in life when we have to accept in humble resignation what is decreed to us. To live longer would only mean prolonging my agony. Fondest love.</q>
               <q>Your brother, <name type="pname">EMIL</name>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon his death, <name type="pname">Fuchs</name> was described by his secretary as "modest, sensitive. He would never consent to have his picture taken. He would not even sit for a portrait for any of his best artist friends. I only know of one picture of himâalthough there are probably othersâand that is a snap shot I made of him myself" <hi rend="italic">(<name type="place">New York</name> Times Jan.</hi> 14, 1929 p. 1).</p>

                  <p>Although Brown attributes this and the following medal to 1901, in which year Roberts was created an Earl and Knight of the Garter, I have placed it under 1900; the date on the medal itself. A number of pieces, such as the 1902 coronation medal, indicate a design which predates issuance; in such cases I have placed the medals in the year of the event noted. However, in cases such as the Roberts medals, where there is no clear indication of a specific event, I have used, when indicated, the date placed with the artist's signature.</p>

                  <p>This medal was extremely popular, with 950,000 having been sold at the time the coronation was postponed due to the King having been stricken with an attack of appendicitis. As a result, orders for 40,000 were cancelled. The 64mm medal is also seen with the date of the actual coronation, 9 August 1902. The obverse was paired with many local reverse dies, and the large number of medals ordered presumably includes these.</p>

                  <p>The 76 mm medals were issued by the American Numismatic Society. Two gold medals were struck and presented to the presidents of the American Numismatic Society and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. An additional eight medals were struck in <name type="pname">virgin Alaskan</name> gold by Tiffany &amp; Co. for presentation to the heads of nations represented by warships at the <name type="pname">HudsonâFulton</name> celebration, the United States, Great Britain, the <name type="place">Netherlands</name>, <name type="place">Germany</name>, <name type="place">France</name>, <name type="place">Italy</name>, <name type="place">Mexico</name>, and the Argentine Republic; the edge of each was engraved "To the Government of (name of Government) from the <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> Celebration Commission, September 25 - October 9, 1909" (Hall 1112). The design was adopted by the <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> Celebration Committee for the official medal; a total of 124,698 medals were issued. Apart from the eight gold presentation medals, all were struck by <name type="pname">Whitehead &amp; Hoag</name>. The accompanying chart (<ref target="#fig-151">fig. 7</ref>: Hall p. 81) indicates the sizes, compositions and uses of each. The single 76mm gilt bronze specimen known to the writer is marked SAMPLE BRONZE on the edge.</p>
                  <p>Officially, there is no obverse or reverse. According to <name type="pname">Edward D. Adams</name> "By reason of the importance and distinctive character of each design, neither supplementing the other, and because the events commemorated occurred two hundred years apart, the faces of the medal do not properly come under the customary designation of obverse and reverse. There is no reverse to describe or illustrate the obverse; each side is complete by itself. Chronologically the Hudson side would be the obverse and the Fulton side the reverse. Practically this technical relation will change according to the artistic tastes or sympathies of the observer. In order to facilitate the exhibition and examination of each

side, from time to time, as may be desired, some of the cases prepared by the Commission for the presentation examples have been made to hang or stand, so that the medal may be reversed in position" (Hall p. 82).</p>

The Society eventually awarded the commission to Chester Beach. Although there is no documentation to support this theory, it is possible that this medal reflects that rejected design.</p>

            <p>The turn of the twentieth century in the United States saw an unprecedented rise of interest in medallic art. One of the most intriguing manifestations of this interest was the formation of a group called the Circle of Friends of the Medallion, organized by <name type="pname">Charles De Kay</name> and <name type="pname">Robert Hewitt</name> Jr. in 1909. The Circle was an organization with one goal in mind: to support the production and appreciation of medallic art. Or in the words of Charles De Kay, "It has been the aim of the founders of this little circle to call the attention of American sculptors and art amateurs to sculpture in the miniature, with the hope that in the course of time improvements will be made in our coinage and our monuments" (De Kay). The background of the Circle has been detailed before; I intend to concentrate on the role of Charles De Kay in its founding, and more importantly, its character as regards the dissemination of aesthetic taste in the United States during the early years of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>To briefly summarize the history of the Circle: <name type="pname">Robert Hewitt</name>, real estate speculator, long-time numismatist, and one of the founders of the American Numismatic Society, came up with the idea of issuing a series of medals which probably developed as a result of his travels to Europe and from the success of his private issuance of a Lincoln commemorative medal bound in a book. In Europe he was able to see the products of two societies, the SociÃ©tÃ© des Amis de la Medaille FranÃ©aise in <name type="place">Paris</name>, and the SociÃ©tÃ© Hollandaise Beige des Amis de la Medaille d'Art in Brussels, both of which issued medals in this fashion. At some point, and the details are sketchy, <name type="pname">Hewitt and De Kay</name> came together, and began working on a project that would culminate in the Circle. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was the perfect person to work with <name type="pname">Hewitt</name>. He was very well known in <name type="place">New York</name> literary and cultural circles. He was a graduate of Yale, wrote poetry, served as the literary and art critic for the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">New York</name> Times</hi> from 1877 to 1894, and had a second career as a frequenter and founder of clubs. Among those he was influential in founding were the Author's Club in 1881, the Fencers' Club in 1888, the National Sculpture Society in 1893, and the National Arts Club in 1898. While Hewitt provided the funds for the organization, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was responsible for publicity, and authored most of the texts that accompanied each issue. He provided the contacts and the organizational know-how to launch the fledgling Circle.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">De Kay</name> and <name type="pname">Hewitt</name> envisioned a charter membership of several hundred individuals interested in small sculpture and medallic art. It was intended that the membership would receive medals and perhaps
<pb n="237"/>
little bas-reliefs or statuettes. An early announcement of the Circle stated, "Such small portable works for the library and office do more than monuments to give people a feel for sculpture and form the habit of looking at art works with understanding and appreciation" (<hi rend="italic">Art News</hi> 1910). The name for the organization was chosen to reflect the hope that "from a modest beginning it may extend its influence in all directions, like the widening circle a stone makes when it plumps into still water" (De Kay 1913). De Kay wrote of the Circle at the time of the issuance of Isidor Konti's medal in honor of the Home,
<q>Little organizations of this kind, of which the public rarely hears, perform a serious work in the encouragement of art. Though it may be true that the great artists of the Renaissance flourished principally by reason of the support received from munificent patronsâaristocrats of Church and Stateâin our different times it is very appropriate that the individual patron should be partly relieved by an organization of patrons working for the best interests of art, with the wisdom which mutual council gives (De Kay).</q>

            <p>The first medal was issued in September 1909, to coincide with the Hudson-Fulton Celebration; the second appeared in May 1910. In total, 12 medals were issued, approximately two per year (see Appendix).<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref> The works were distributed to the membership of the Circle, who paid ten dollars a year in dues, and received their medals
<pb n="238"/>
bound in a book with accompanying text written, for the most part, by <name type="pname">De Kay</name>.<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> By April 1910, the charter membership had reached 448, and included individuals from a wide variety of cultural and social spheres. Among its distinguished members were Alexander Graham Bell, inventor; <name type="pname">Archer Milton Huntington</name>, philanthropist; <name type="pname">Louis Comfort Tiffany</name>, artist and designer; <name type="pname">Leonard Forrer</name>, numismatist; <name type="pname">R. Tait McKenzie</name>, sculptor; and four of the artists who created medals for the circle, to name just a few.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-163">
               <graphic url="COAC13_238.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The process of selecting a design for issuance in medallic form was left in the hands of the Circle's Art Committee. The Committee would choose a subject, and then ask a particular sculptor to work up a design. If that sculptor saw something in the subject, he would make a sketch; if not, he would come up with his own subject and design. As De Kay wrote, "The object is to get the best a man has in him" (De Kay 1913). The choice of sculptors was by commission, not by competition.</p>
            <p>De Kay's motives in co-founding the Circle were many and varied. He was concerned with the role of artists in contemporary American society, the role of art in the same, the aesthetic education of the public, and the furtherance of an appreciation of sculpture, specifically in the form of medallic art. In one of the many articles he authored, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> discussed the role of artists in contemporary society.
<q>The problem for our artists consists in making their products popular in the higher sense, not vulgarly popular, but adapted to the present needs of their fellow-countrymen. Portraits and mural paintings ordered by municipality or private citizen meet this problem so far as they go. But their scope is very limited....[T]he ordinary well-to-do citizen is far from feeling the need of sculpture and painting as an integral part of the surroundings of his home. One reason for this fact is the aloofness of painters and sculptors from the daily life of the communities in which they live....Our artists should realize the situation and meet it. For one thing they should react against their very unfortunate but very natural ten-
<pb n="239"/>
dency to segregate themselves into small circles, or retire entirely to themselves in their studios. They should remember that, no matter what particular phrase or school of art they admire and try to work in, there is a larger aspect of the problem in which these things sink to the second plane (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900a, 23).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In other words, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> believed artists must learn to embrace other disciplines/professions and their practitioners. Doing so would enable them to stay in touch with the tastes of their audience, thereby remaining viable. By creating works like medals to be distributed to a wide audience, sculptors would literally be making themselves more relevant to contemporary American society.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">De Kay</name> realized that there were two sides to this discussion. He also believed that lay people needed to become involved in aesthetic appreciation. Therefore, to explain his interest in the founding of an organization like the Circle, De Kay wrote,
<q>Although the issuing of medals has increased greatly in this country in recent years, sculptors feel the need of a wider education of the public in that branch of their art. Such organizations as the Circle of Friends of the Medallion and the Numismatic Society, while their medals appeal especially to the artist and the collector, also hope to foster a proper interest and appreciation among laymen. For a collection of medallions and other small bas-reliefs is apt to promote a taste for and an understanding of sculpture (<name type="pname">De Kay</name>).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In publication after publication De Kay tried to impress upon numismatists the aesthetic value of their treasured objects. In order to fully appreciate medals, their clubs and societies should look at them from the viewpoint of the artist. To illustrate the importance of an aesthetic appreciation of medals, he made pointed references to the societies in Paris, Brussels and Vienna as precursors to the Circle. What would make the Circle different however, was the mounting of the medals in a book, which not only made the works easier to forward to the membership, but was also done for the convenience of those without a wall-case or other piece of furniture designed for displaying medals.</p>
            <p>The role of medallic art in daily life was a topic that occupied much of <name type="pname">De Kay's</name> time. He wrote,
<q>It is indeed remarkable what a hold small sculptureâwhether in the round or in high relief or in plaque and medalâhas taken on modern life.... Perhaps the growth of great cities has something
<pb n="240"/>
to do with [the increase of interest in small works]. Certainly it has become more and more costly to own city homes which have sufficient wall space for large paintings....But even small easel pictures find scant wall accommodation in the homes of the cliff-dwellers' of <name type="place">New York</name>. There is still room, however, for a fine medallion or medal, a bit of animal bronze, or a figurine for the mantel or table (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1909, 25).</q>
            </p>
            <p>Obviously, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> saw medallic art, in which he had a vested interest, as a way of introducing art into the home. This is just another example from De Kay's writings that illustrate his many motives for co-founding the Circle.</p>
            <p>As part of his role within the Circle, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> authored many articles publicizing the medals. One of the more interesting was published in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatist</hi> in 1913. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> offered these words:
<q>[The] seven pieces [issued so far] are truly works of fine art wrought by our own sculptors, each working according to his own method. The result is no stereotyped series, but in every instance the expression of a separate individual....There is no other society like the Circle which devotes itself to the spreading of a love of sculpture in relief among amateurs and stimulates artists to work in this charming branch (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1913a, 136).</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the same spirit of publicity <name type="pname">De Kay</name> also published articles on <name type="pname">Isidor Konti</name> and <name type="pname">Sigurd Neandross</name>, two of the medalists commissioned by the Circle. Konti's medal, issued in 1910, was described by <name type="pname">De Kay</name> as striking the fancy of connoisseurs. "Konti's medal has made a very real appeal....[T]hough the subject lends itself easily to dramatic treatment, the sculptor...has been particularly fortunate in the simplicity and sincerity of his work" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name>). <name type="pname">Sigurd Neandross</name>, who designed the 8th issue in 1913, was a sculptor whom <name type="pname">De Kay</name> greatly admired. "He belongs to the rarer kind of sculptor who makes one think....He is a sculptor with temperament who goes his own way, endeavoring to express lovely and innocent and poetic feelings to the best of his ability through his chosen art" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1914, xxii.).</p>
            <p>He also discussed some of the other medals in articles devoted to such topics as "fine art in medals." Of the power of <name type="pname">John Mowbray-Clarke's Saint Brendan</name> to appeal to the public he wrote, "The sculptor...has imagined the doughty Saint as a man better suited to steer a ship and swing a spear than to expound the Christian faith to men and women of peace." Of <name type="pname">Victor David Brenner's</name> Motherhood medal he had this to say: "By bringing out the Motherhood medal the
<pb n="241"/>
Circle seems to wish to accentuate the policy of departing now and again from the custom of reserving medals and plaques as honors for individuals. It is well to remember that sculpture on a small scale has a wider scope than merely portraiture or the commemoration of events in history" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1911,21). The first medal issued by the Circle was obviously dear to De Kay's heart, and he wrote of it, <name type="pname">John Flanagan's</name>
               <name type="pname">Hudson-Fulton</name> medal, "Here we find, in the delicate modeling of Fulton's profile, the contrast between <name type="pname">Elizabethan ruff</name> and <name type="pname">Georgian jabot</name>, the dignity given to the lettering; how differently from a painter a sculptor will treat a theme" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1909, 25). This last comment was directed at the official medal of the Celebration, by <name type="pname">Emil Fuchs</name>. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> does not seem to have approved of Fuchs's medal; he wrote,
<q>the official is pictorial and popular, while the Circle's will appeal to those who have learned by study to appreciate the sculpturesque side of such small works of art. Viewed from the sculptor's camp, the modelling of the Fuchs medal is soft and evasive in form, while the <name type="pname">Flanagan</name> attacks the problem and carries it out to the best of the sculptor's ability. The painter tries skillfully to evade the difficulty of human figures and draperies, and enlists interest in the general picture; the sculptor, while he does not solve these problems at all points in the very best way, does not avoid the issue, but meets them as they rise (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1909, 25).</q>
               <q>De Kay's comments on the Circle's medals reveal a not unexpected bias in their favor; at the same time, however, they express a heartfelt belief in the relevance of the Circle and its mission.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of interest is how <name type="pname">De Kay</name> came to be so actively involved with the Circle. As mentioned, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was a strong force in the organization of a number of institutions in <name type="place">New York</name> in the late years of the nineteenth century. Two of these organizations, the National Sculpture Society and the National Arts Club, figure prominently in this investigation.</p>
            <p>The National Sculpture Society, of which almost all of the Circle's medalists were members, was conceived as a counterpart to the specialized artists' clubs and societies that set exhibitions as their priority, and as a professional society that could control quality and set standards. Because of its priorities, personalities, and relationships with other organizations, it relied on the involvement of non-sculptors. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was instrumental in convincing sculptor <name type="pname">Frederic Ruckstull</name> help him develop the idea for the Society after hearing of an "altercation" over the poor placement of Ruckstull's works at a Society of American Artists exhibition. <name type="pname">Ruckstull</name> had persuaded <name type="pname">De Kay</name> that sculpture shown with
<pb n="242"/>
painting would never receive the kind of installation it deserved. In turn, De Kay became convinced that a sculpture society that held its own exhibitions would solve these kinds of problems, and convinced <name type="pname">Ruckstull</name> to help him organize it. In order to recruit members they needed to overcome the sense of individualism felt by American sculptors. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> and <name type="pname">Ruckstull</name> were afraid that the idea of a society devoted exclusively to sculpture would sound too commercial and nonprofessional and it would be impossible to get sculptors to join. After securing the cooperation of <name type="pname">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</name>, <name type="pname">Olin Levi Warner</name> and <name type="pname">John Quincy Adams</name> Ward, De Kay became the primary force behind the organizational drive. He sent invitations to prospective members, inviting them to an organizational meeting at the home of his brother-in-law and <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> editor <name type="pname">Richard Watson Gilder</name>. As a result of his efforts, the Society became a reality on May 30, 1893.<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref> Of primary interest is the fact that De Kay was instrumental in pushing lay participation. As <name type="pname">Michelle Bogart</name> has pointed out, "An American sculpture society could not be like those of <name type="place">Europe</name>; it had to be in keeping with the distinctive social and political framework of a democratic republic to advance truly national forms of artistic expression" (Bogart 1989, 53). The American artists' organizations that were forming during these years were closing the gap between art and the larger public, both well-to-do and working class. This broad public was, in De Kay's view, the American audience for art. A society like the NSS, with lay members who were asked to share the burden of "keeping their society alive" better suited, in De Kay's view, the social and political ideas of Americans. These lay people would act as the backing for the artists, drumming up support, acting as spokesmen. In defending the NSS De Kay wrote, "What country other than ours has arrived at any period at such a pitch of the cultivation and subdivision in the cultivation of the fine arts as to establish a separate society for sculptors, and to give independent exhibitions of sculpture without the aid of painting or some other of the more popular arts?...We are better off as we are than <name type="place">France</name> or <name type="place">Germany</name>, and the proof is that the biennial exhibitions of the National Sculpture Society surpass anything the old countries have to show" (De Kay 1898, 140). The presence of laymen within the Society was of primary importance to <name type="pname">De Kay</name>. He wrote, "With a wider and deeper feeling for the arts, the world of amateurs will take more interest in bronzes for the decoration of houses within and without....To aid the spread of this taste is one of the objects of the National Sculpture Society, which seeks to encourage the making of figurines and small
<pb n="243"/>
groups that come within the means of people of moderate fortune...." (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1895, 112).</p>
            <p>The second, and more relevant, organization which De Kay was instrumental in founding was the National Arts Club. More relevant because, for its entire existence, the Circle was headquartered at the Club and, in fact, the Club was designed with artists and lay people equally in mind. The Club was conceived in a conversation between <name type="pname">De Kay</name> and <name type="pname">John DeWitt Warner</name>, President of the Reform Club of <name type="place">New York</name>, after a February 1898 meeting of the National Sculpture Society, of which they were both members. <name type="pname">De Kay</name>, while serving as the American Consul-General in Berlin from 1894 to 1897, had noted the eagerness of European governments to encourage, through exhibitions, the application of art to industry in order to enable them to keep in touch with movements in other countries. By June of 1898 the National Arts Club was incorporated.</p>
            <p>The United States was, in the late years of the nineteenth century, a recent entry into the arena of the application of art to industry. No American museums were devoted to it, there were no societies to look after the interests of those practicing it. The National Arts Club was founded specifically to remedy this situation. The mission of the Club was threefold: first, to champion applied and decorative arts; second, to create an organization that crossed existing arts organizational boundaries; and third, to encourage the participation of lay people in the arts community. One observer wrote,
<q>There are abundant purposes a truly National Arts Club might cherish, abundant aims it might set before it. There is the encouragement of industries on which art has been expended, leaving the fine arts to the established societies and clubs. There is the giving of exhibitions of special work, at which employers of skilled labor could see which designers and workers are inventive and talented, and artists and art students pick up suggestions for bread-winning. There is the binding together with the bonds of a common interest the art lovers of the whole country, enabling men and women from San Francisco and New Orleans when visiting <name type="place">New York</name> to find themselves in congenial atmosphere, if they are amateurs themselves, and giving manufacturers of the most varied sort ideas how to handle their products so as to surpass their rivals abroad (<hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> 1899, 350-351).</q>
            </p>
            <p>The National Arts Club was founded in an effort to bring the layman in touch with the connoisseur, and the artist and craftsman with
<pb n="244"/>
both. A 1909 article in the <hi rend="italic">Craftsman</hi> discussing the Club cited Victor David Brenner as an example of the ideal member. "Ever enthusiastic, sincere, and a loyal and hard worker, his influence is widely felt as something constructive and in accord with the Club's ideals. On the walls of the club rooms hangs a permanent exhibition of Brenner's work, which cannot but have an uplifting influence upon medallic art in this country" (Teall 1909, 613). We can extrapolate this praise of the influence of Brenner's work to those lay people who visited the Club and could not help but see the artist's work so prominently displayed. The singling out of <name type="pname">Brenner</name> also indicates the importance of medallic art within the Club. We can only credit De Kay with fostering this atmosphere.</p>
            <p>The role of the artist within the larger artistic community, and the Circle of Friends, was a problem that De Kay often wrote about. The lack of recognition of American artists, caused by their self-segregation, was the cause, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> believed, for our disadvantageous position when compared to <name type="place">Europe</name>. "The prestige of European art is against us;...the American artist and artisan must exert themselves more than their European brothers" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 85). And yet the fact that art was not so familiar in the United States gave Americans an advantage, a greater freedom of mind from prejudice and tradition. "In other words, the United States should be a very open field for experiments in the fine arts, and especially in the industrial, because the innovator here should find less of tradition, less of prejudice to encounter" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 85). <name type="pname">De Kay</name> saw the trend in <name type="place">Europe</name> toward centralization of the arts, specifically the role European governments played; the situation in this country, however, was different. There was just as much activity to be found in <name type="place">Chicago</name>, <name type="place">Boston</name>, <name type="pname">St. Louis</name>, etc. as in <name type="place">New York</name>. Annual exhibitions and exhibition organizations were, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> believed, a hindrance because they tended to substitute official and routine art for the natural expression of a nation. Also, one large exhibit, like those held by the Royal Academy in <name type="place">London</name>, or even the National Academy of Design in <name type="place">New York</name>, compelled the formation of huge exhibitions which defeated their own object by their very size. Traditional European shows catered to a specific audience, one very unlike that to be found in the United States. "What we are after in the United States is to close the gap between art and the great body of people, not merely the wealthy, or the well-to-do, but the anxious, hard-working public" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 89). But art would never be healthy here until the public recognized artists the way it did lawyers and merchants. "What
<pb n="245"/>
we should do is to look about for some kind of an organization that exactly fits our ideas, social and political, and appeals to the sentiments and habits of thought of our own people, and avoids any clash with the opinions of the public at large, in so far as no artistic principle is involved and the concession can be made with dignity" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 90). The success of the NSS could be found in its appeal, from the start, to the lay public. The National Arts Club was the next step. "It shows that Americans are realizing very keenly the honor which great artists confer upon the country, and their duty in assisting the development of the national arts on the broadest lines" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900, 95).</p>
            <p>By headquartering the Circle within the National Arts Club, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was declaring not only the validity of medallic art, but also the relationship between medallic art, as the representative of the "fine" arts, and applied art. <name type="pname">De Kay</name> was quoted by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> as saying, "It is for the art lovers of this great city to call attention to the neglect of these forms of art which, for reasons that I need not specify, are ranked by so many people lower than what are called sometimes, the pure arts, such as easel painting and sculpture, and I maintain that even those who strenuously deny that they are art lovers, or know anything about art, should feel it their duty to help art lovers to correct this neglect because it has become a matter of patriotism" (NYT 1899, 5).</p>
            <p>No understanding of the impact of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion can be gained without thoroughly examining De Kay's general aesthetic attitudes, available to us, fortunately, through the numerous articles published by <name type="pname">De Kay</name> on both non-medallic and medallic art.</p>
            <p>To appreciate what <name type="pname">De Kay</name> has to say about medallic art and the sculptors who practice it, we must look briefly at his comments on artists in general. He believed, and rightly so, that artists in the United States did not hold the position in society that they should. "So little weight do artists...carry in the general estimation that it is very common to see long accounts in the papers of monuments and wall paintings opened for the first time to public view without a mention of the men who designed them" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900a). The social status of artists was lower in the United States than in <name type="place">Europe</name> because they were neglected and overlooked. Only a small segment of the population had the aesthetic knowledge to appreciate and understand the output of Americas artists. "...Painting and sculpture, like music, must be enjoyed for their own sake, on their own merits, after considerable acquaintance with the best ancient and modern examples and with the distinct perception that they are things by themselves, have a language
<pb n="246"/>
of their own, and to be truly relished must have from their admirers just as true and faithful service as lovers of other arts give to their special affection...." (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1900a).</p>
            <p>The example of the Circle of Friends of the Medallion in regards to De Kay's ideas about organization among artists is instructive. The choice of sculptors who were almost primarily known as medalists, and the awarding of, with one exception, only one commission to each artist, was a way of creating variety, of introducing a large number of practitioners to a wide audience. By commissioning so many different sculptors, the Circle was attempting to elevate the role of the sculptor within American culture. The choice of subjects also serves the same purpose. The subjects of the Circle's medals ran the gamut from commemorations of historic events (<name type="pname">Mowbray-Clarke's</name> Centennial of American and British peace) to portraits of relatively obscure historical figures (<name type="pname">Louis Potter's Abdul Baha</name>) to difficult to classify subjects (<name type="pname">Brenner's</name> medal celebrating Motherhood.)</p>
            <p>The social set which <name type="pname">De Kay</name> frequented was hinged around his brother-in-law, <name type="pname">Richard Watson Gilder</name>. For this group, art served an indispensable purpose in a materialistic age. It had to be beautiful, in "good taste," and exist independent of any moral message. The style favored by Gilder, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> and their circle was a realism tempered by idealism, a not uncommon preference of the period. In an 1890 article on Albert Pinkham Ryder, an artist whose work fit their description perfectly, <name type="pname">De Kay</name> wrote, "But perhaps American art, like American mechanics, literature, politics, has a mission of its own. Perhaps it may teach the great lesson in the Fine Arts which the United States is teaching in many other fields â individuality, freedom, rejection of authority of any one school."<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref> We can easily apply this attitude toward art to the campaign <name type="pname">De Kay</name> successfully waged to incorporate art more fully into American life, of which the Circle was the ultimate expression.</p>
            <p>De Kay's attitude toward medals was gleaned from a number of sources; one of the more interesting was his interest in quality over quantity. In writing about the sculpture for the new Appellate Courthouse in <name type="place">New York</name> City <name type="pname">De Kay</name> stated, "Size alone does not give importance; on the contrary, by enlarging a figure its effect is sometimes lessened" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1901, 1797). The same sentiment about the disparity between size and quality appeared in an article on miniature painting published in 1901.
<q>How many of us stop to remember that 'miniature' the word has nothing to do with size in its original meaning?...[T]his matter
<pb n="247"/>
of size has always acted as a slur on the esteem in which miniatures have been held, very much as the material in which a work of art is fashioned has always affected men's estimate of the artistic quality belonging to a given object. It is hard for the average man to understand that a medal in bronze may have higher artistic quality than the same medal cast in gold, or a carving in wood surpass in beauty the same object in ivory (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1901a, 333).</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is interesting that De Kay would make pointed reference to medallic art in an article on painting; whenever he had the chance to act as a booster for medals, he seized the opportunity. And while he never comes right out and says so, his comment on size in the previous quote can also be construed as being directed at critics of medallic art. Later in the same article on miniature painting he writes that medalists must "pack much in little room and remain true and graceful, thoughtfill and artistic....The medalists of the old school are still shaking their heads over innovators who model medals large and reduce them to medal size and treat the old stiff rules of medaldom with scant respect in more than one regard" (<name type="pname">De Kay</name> 1901a, 336). The issue of size was one that intrigued De Kay. "It is not easy for a man engaged in monumental work to change off to modelling in very low relief and meet the other requirements that a medal forces upon him....[H]e must have the habit of seeing things on the medallic scale; he must have the practice of subtle planes" (De Kay 1907, 158). In yet another article he writes, "Bronze is apt to be associated too closely with monuments that stand in public places, because the enjoyment of small bronze-work is not general. The lover of bronzes, however, regards size no more than does the lover of paintings. He finds a zest in figurines or medallions or small objects...." (De Kay 1895, 111). It seems obvious that De Kay's priorities during the early years of the twentieth century, even before the founding of the Circle, were toward spreading art and culture to the general public through the use of small, intimate, and therefore easily digested works like medals, and medals created by sculptors who were ardent students of the craft of working in miniature, a scale appropriate to the medium.</p>
            <p>De Kay had a special, and obvious, fondness for medals. Two aspects of these small bronzes that especially pleased him were the commemorative nature of medals and the variety of colors that could be applied. Medals, along with coins and tokens, "...[have] kept the record of men and peoples utterly vanished from history" (De Kay 1895, 110). They were another way of recording history, an important part of De Kay's
<pb n="248"/>
aesthetic, and yet they functioned and appeared differently than coins and tokens as historical markers. Their commemorative function worked within, not separately from, an aesthetic one, unlike tokens and coins, and this made them unique. As for color, "A collection of bronzes satisfies the love inherent in mankind for form, and pleases not a little his love of color. From bright green to bright yellow, from brown to black to invisible green or blue, there is a great range of colors for the skilled collector" (De Kay 1895, 112). This emphasis on the range of colors possible with gold, silver and bronze was another attempt at convincing the public that medallic art was indeed a worthy branch of the arts, comparable to painting for variety and emotional expression.</p>
            <p>De Kay believed that medals also played a significant role in influencing popular taste. Medals had, in the past, suffered the reputation of "things of use" rather than things of beauty. He hoped the Circle would remedy this. One of the goals of the Circle, for De Kay, was to teach the public about the inherent beauty of these small sculptures. "It is still a small band of amateurs who encourage the passion, and not all of these can shake off the collector's tendency to value an object for its rarity or historical worth more than for its intrinsic beauty; but no one can indulge long in the passion without making comparisons between one medal and another...and gradually separating in his mind those which please the aesthetic side of him from those which merely excite his interest for other reasons" (De Kay 1907, 153). The Circle would awaken in its members the aesthetic "passion," the ultimate complement to the historical, long the sole province of medals.</p>
            <p>The relationship between the design of medals and coins was obvious, De Kay believed. Medals have long had an influence on coinage, and the best example of this was <name type="place">France</name>. "We may safely reason that neglect of medallic study in the United States is responsible for the flat and tasteless appearance of our own coinage...." (De Kay 1907, 154). Another reason for the founding of the Circle was to elevate medallic art to a level where the general public would realize that our coins needed the same kind of aesthetic attention as medals, or small sculptures. The only American, De Kay believed, who had made a thorough study of medals was <name type="pname">Victor David Brenner</name>, who was commissioned to design the fourth issue for the Circle. Coin designers, of which <name type="pname">Brenner</name> was one, had different problems to solve than medalists, and it was to <name type="pname">Brenner's</name> credit that he was able to switch roles so easily.</p>
            <p>Brenner's example was perfectly suited to illustrate the importance of medals in the education of the public about aesthetics. A sculptor
<pb n="249"/>
who could so easily and expertly switch genres, teach in both, and write eloquently about the processes, was the embodiment of the type of artist De Kay championed. "It is strange that a country in which education engages so much thought and ability as does ours should fail to perceive the value of medals as a means of instruction and lay so little stress on them. They do not teach history alone, but when designed by the proper hands they teach art" (De Kay 1907, 162). By studying medals, the public would naturally learn to appreciate larger works. "The value of such portable small sculpture is not easily overrated; it leads to the...thousand and one sculptured objects which add so much atmosphere to a room furnished in the common way with pictures only..." (De Kay 1907, 163). In De Kay's mind, medals formed a stepping-stone to some of the most refined pleasures in the world.</p>
            <p>The Circle of Friends of the Medallion folded just after the onset of the First World War. The reasons for its disappearance are not known, but can certainly be surmised. First, De Kay and Hewitt never reached their goal of 1000 subscribers, so it is possible that it was not financially feasible to keep the Circle going. Second, the nation's attention was beginning to focus on the war in <name type="place">Europe</name> and <name type="place">America's</name> looming role in it, leaving very little time and thought for personal consumption of art. Third, the slowly growing interest in modernism and its highly subjective styles may have begun to undermine the traditional, i.e., social, value De Kay and Hewitt attached to medals, and art in general. However, De Kay's contributions to American aesthetic thought were invaluable. During his tenure with the Circle he produced countless articles, in addition to those cited, for many nationally prominent magazines and newspapers on a wide spectrum of artistic matters. It is inarguable that De Kay was one of the most influential cultural figures in the United States in the years before the First World War, and almost singlehandedly responsible for elevating medallic art to a popular level.</p>

            <p>Since the invention of money, the gods and goddesses, heroes and beasts of mythology have been portrayed on coinage to commemorate a particular event or associate a ruler with his patron deity. Nowhere was this more prevalent than in the coinage of ancient <name type="place">Greece</name> resulting in some of the most beautiful designs ever produced in this medium. The primitive methods used to produce these coins dictated that the designs be engraved directly onto the dies at the actual size they were to be struck. When looking at these miniature works of art one is amazed by the fineness of detail and the ingenuity of the designers' use of iconography in so limited a space. Much later, during the Italian Renaissance, artists such as <name type="pname">Pisanello</name>, <name type="pname">L'Antico</name>, <name type="pname">Fiorentino</name> and <name type="pname">Cesati</name> used the creatures and characters of mythology on portrait medals to convey certain messages about their subjects. Meanings hidden to the ordinary person could easily be deciphered by their well educated aristocratic patrons. In twentieth century <name type="place">America</name>, the sculptor <name type="pname">Paul Manship</name> was greatly impressed by the work of the ancient <name type="place">Greeks</name> and the Renaissance medalists. Like them, he was an artist whose career was linked to wealthy patrons, those self-made tycoons who formed the apex of American society and manipulated the taste of the nation. Archeological discoveries in the nineteenth century infused these classic mythical themes with new vigor. Manship's mastery of archaic form, coupled with fresh originality and fluid handling of spatial relationships made him a favorite of Americas elite.</p>
            <p>"His feeling for the sculptural medium also inspired unique achievement in medallic art. Following the introduction of mechanical means for cutting dies from larger models, medallists had departed from the appropriateness of scale that had been imposed upon the ancient die cutters... Manship revived the clarity of design and treatment that had been the charm of the Greek gems and coins as well as of the early Renaissance medals" (Hancock 1966). Manship himself expressed his unhappiness with the effects achieved by modern technology: "The mechanical reduction, which is to perhaps to be wondered at for its fineness, produces a result which is false and inartistic, because it is obviously not the direct work of the human hand. The beautiful coins of the Greeks and the artistic medals of Pisanello and his contemporaries were of necessity made at their final size. I believe that this mechanics in art is one of the reasons why the art of the medalist has sunk today to such a low state" (<name type="pname">St. Paul Pioneer</name> 1915). This admiration and desire to achieve the "appropriateness of scale" influenced his methods in "the designing of modern medals, he carved the most intricate

designs and exquisite lettering directly in the plaster mould <hi rend="italic">(sic)</hi> ... Had Manship confined himself solely to making medals he would have achieved wide acclaim" (<name type="pname">Richards</name> 1966).</p>
            <p>Many collectors of medallic art are familiar with some of the works produced by this giant of American sculpture but very few realize how prolific a medalist Paul Manship really was. In his lifetime, Manship created well over a hundred medals, decorations and small bas-reliefs.</p>
            <p>Mythological themes are no stranger in Manship's sculpture and are evident in such works as Centaur and Dryad, Infant Hercules Fountain, <name type="pname">Diana and Acteon</name>, <name type="place">Europa</name> and the <name type="pname">Bull</name> and his most famous work, The Prometheus Fountain in New York's Rockefeller Center. Among his medallic efforts the best known is <name type="pname">Dionysus</name>, which was the second issue of the Society of Medalists. He also created two presidential inaugural medals: the first in 1931 for <name type="pname">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</name>, the second for <name type="pname">John Fitzgerald Kennedy</name> in 1960, and although neither contains a mythological theme, they are noteworthy nonetheless.</p>
            <p>For those not familiar with Manship and his work, we must take a brief look at the influences that moulded him as an artist. The most important was that he learned through the traditional apprenticeship, allowing him to acquire the techniques he needed to develop his own distinctive style and not be stamped in the mold of a particular school. Above all, he was a craftsman of the highest degree and tried to instill this quality in others throughout his career.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Paul Howard</name> Manship was born on <name type="pname">Christmas Eve</name>, 1885 in <name type="pname">St. Paul, Minnesota</name>, the seventh child of <name type="pname">Charles</name> Manship and <name type="pname">Mary Etta</name> Friend. He first studied art at the <name type="pname">St. Paul</name> Institute where he decided to try his hand at painting. Discovering he was color blind, he switched to modeling in clay, and by the age of 15 decided to become a sculptor. Leaving high school at 17, he opened his own design business in <name type="pname">St. Paul</name>. For a year he did sign painting and lettering, which remained of great interest to him and shows strongly in his medallic work.</p>
            <p>Manship went to <name type="place">New York</name> in 1905 where he entered the <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> Students League and after a few months of formal study, served as an assistant to <name type="pname">Solon Borglum</name> until 1907. In the autumn of that year he enrolled at the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> Academy of Fine Arts where he studied life modeling with sculptor <name type="pname">Charles Grafly</name>. From 1908 to 1909 Manship assisted <name type="pname">Isidore Konti</name>, who taught him the techniques of low relief modeling and persuaded <name type="pname">Paul</name> to compete for entry into the American Academy in Rome which he won. He was also greatly responsible for drawing Manship away from the influence of Rodin whose style was
<pb n="266"/>
emulated by most of the sculptors of the period, thus giving him the freedom to pursue his own style which would in time set him above all his peers. Manship later acknowledged his debt and fondness toward the elder sculptor with one of his first portrait medals.</p>
            <p>Manship's stay in <name type="place">Rome</name> was probably the single most influential period in his life as well as his work. It would bear a significant impact on the way he viewed sculpture in general and how he interpreted that view in his own art. Surrounded by antiquity he was able to study and then synthesize the ancient forms to achieve a fresh new look which would become known as Archaism. Within a year of his arrival at the Academy, his work shows a dramatic change from the <name type="pname">Neo-Baroque</name> style he had previously been working in. During his fellowship he also made trips around the Mediterranean studying Archaic Greek, Minoan, Assyrian and Egyptian forms.</p>
            <p>The lessons and inspiration derived from antiquity were not the only influences on the young sculptor. Also during his time in <name type="place">Italy</name>, Manship was able to study the Renaissance masters Michaelangelo and Donatello as well as the medals of Pisanello and his contemporaries.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-176">

            </figure>
            <p>It was in Italy, the birthplace of modern medallic sculpture, that Manship created the first of what was to be many works in this genre. Frederic Crowninshield (1845-1918), a painter, had been associated with American Academy in Rome since 1900, and its director from
<pb n="267"/>
1909-1911. He resigned as the director following a merger with the School of Classic Studies, which he opposed, and as a farewell, the fellows presented Crowninshield and his wife with a plaque modeled by Manship.</p>
            <p>The Crowninshield Medallion (<ref target="#fig-176">fig. 1</ref>) depicts the winged figure of Iris holding a trumpet-blowing putto in one hand and two doves in the other. Iris was the messenger of Zeus, along with Hermes, and was the faithful servant of Hera. She also helped the other gods, unharnessing their chariots and giving the steeds nectar and ambrosia. She is a fitting symbol for this tribute to Crowninshield who was a dedicated, faithful servant of the Academy and well liked among the fellows. Iris hangs her head in sorrow at the loss of one who embodied her role at the institution. The putto blows a fanfare in recognition of his accomplishments and loyalty while the doves symbolize an offering of peace and happiness for the couple. The medallion remained within the Crowninshield family until 1990 when it was sold at auction in <name type="place">New York</name>.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-177">
               <graphic url="COAC13_267.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>After his return to the states in 1913, Manship had several highly successful exhibitions and won national acclaim becoming one of the hottest properties in the art world. Commissions flocked to him, among which was one to design the first gold Civic Forum Medal Of Honor (<ref target="#fig-177">fig. 2</ref>) to be awarded to <name type="pname">George W. Goethals</name>, Engineer of the Panama Canal. The obverse depicts Athena with a winged victory in her right hand and the torch of enlightenment in her left. In Greek mythology Athena is credited for giving many valuable services to mankind including the art of taming horses, invention of the potters wheel, the weaving of cloth and embroidery. The medal was given "FOR DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE" and was awarded to such notables as <name type="pname">Thomas Edison</name> (1915); <name type="pname">Alexander Graham Bell</name>
               <pb n="268"/>
(1917); <name type="pname">Herbert Hoover</name> (1920) and <name type="pname">Richard E. Byrd</name> (1930).</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1914, the Manships vacationed in Italy with their friend <name type="pname">Barry Faulkner</name>, a mural painter, whom Paul had met at the American Academy. Ending their tour in Rome, Manship modeled the Infant Hercules Fountain and presented it to the Academy as his gift. Circling the base of the fountain are six low relief panels portraying the Labors of Hercules. They were not to be cast as individual plaquettes until 1955. All show Hercules wrestling with an opponent either animal or human in form. These are probably the most archaic in style of any of Manships medallic works and could be mistaken at first as works of antiquity.</p>
            <p>One of these (<ref target="#fig-178">fig. 3</ref>) depicts the wrestling match between Hercules and Nereus, The Old Man of the Sea. The hero had to defeat this shape changing deity to discover the route to the Garden of the Hesperides in his quest to steal the Golden Apples of Hera. An early 6th century BC, black figure vase in the <name type="pname">Louvre</name> (<ref target="#fig-179">fig. 4</ref>), shows Nereus with a fish tail that sprouts the head of a lion and a snake, attesting to his power of mutation (<name type="pname">Boardman</name> 1974, 223). By mid century, Nereus changed identity to Triton, which was probably more politically symbolic than a relation to any myth (<name type="pname">Boardman</name> 1974, 223, n.2). Nereus appears on later vases but in full human form and with none of the manifestations of the earlier examples.</p>

            <p>The Manships rented a house the next summer in Cornish, New Hampshire. Other artists had been attracted to the colony founded by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, among them were <name type="pname">Stephen</name> and <name type="pname">Maxfield Parrish</name>, <name type="pname">Charles Adams Platt</name>, <name type="pname">Kenyon Cox</name> and <name type="pname">Thomas W. Dewing</name>. There Manship started a series of portrait medals of his artist friends beginning with <name type="pname">Barry Faulkner</name> (<ref target="#fig-180">fig. 5</ref>). This is the first medal by the sculptor dedicated to an individual rather than an event or award.</p>
            <p>The reverse of this medal portrays Orpheus and Eurydice with the inscription: "TO THE ULTIMATE DO WE PURSUE THE IDEAL". Orpheus, a son of Apollo, was renowned for his remarkable singing voice and mastery of the lyre. His music was so beautiful that wild beasts and even trees would follow him. He fell in love with and married the nymph Eurydice who was bitten by a snake and died. Orpheus, heartbroken, went into the Underworld to bring back his bride. His beautiful singing charmed Hades and Persephone into letting her return on the condition that he not gaze back at her until they were out of the Underworld. Orpheus in his impatience and fearing treachery on the part of Hades turned back to look and so lost his love forever.</p>
            <p>Here Orpheus with his lyre represents artistic expression while Eurydice is the ideal to be pursued and attained. An artist will go through 'the gates of hell' to obtain the epitome of his art. But as in the myth, no matter what the effort, that goal can sometimes be lost in a moment of uncertainty. The pair are surrounded by a chain border, binding them together as an artist is bound to his art. This medal was closely followed by one honoring Maxfield Parrish (<ref target="#fig-181">fig. 6</ref>).</p>
            <p>The Parrish medal is of particular interest as it is the first depiction of Pegasus in Manship's sculpture. The winged steed became a favorite subject of the artist and appears again in five other medals as well as numerous sculptures. Here Pegasus appears to be in the throes of trying to break free from the world below, even the bronze in which he is cast. The wings of the fabled steed are strikingly archaic in appearance and the stylized rays behind lend an urgency to the scene. In Manship's iconography, Pegasus represents artistic inspiration or a means of transport to higher realms. The latter is particularly appropriate in this instance as the paintings of Maxfield Parrish depict fantasy worlds, utopias bathed in ethereal light, or the fancies of nursery rhymes and fairy tales. Pegasus becomes a means for the viewer to visit those realms so skillfully wrought by Parrish.</p>
            <p>Seeing the two of these medals together is enough to confirm Manship's status as an heir to Pisanello in the finest traditions of medallic

sculpture through his combination of fine portraiture and use of symbolism to reflect on the personality of the individual.</p>
            <p>It was also in 1915 that The National Sculpture Society commissioned Manship to create a small bronze ashtray to be presented to its lay members. Although this work is not a true medal, during the year 1914-1915 there were 145 lay members in the NSS making this one the most highly produced reliefs by Manship to be discussed here. The artist chose the goddess Diana as the subject and created a gem in bronze that became the first of a series of small relief dishes illustrating mythological scenes and astrological signs.</p>
            <p>Looking at the <name type="pname">Diana Ashtray</name> (<ref target="#fig-182">fig. 7</ref>), the viewer is first taken by the great illusion of motion and speed of the figures. Diana with her bow flies through the surrounding flora, her swiftness easily matching the speedy hound beside her. Her figure is freely modeled and extremely fluid in form, her long hair flowing in serpentine waves on both sides of her head and is reminiscent of early Minoan frescoes.</p>
            <p>While <name type="pname">Diana</name> shows lithe gracefulness, the hound, in comparison, exudes pure physical power and lightning speed as he adoringly follows at her side. Both are encircled but not completely contained in a raised beaded border giving the illusion that they might at any moment leap from the confines of the bowl. This border is then contained within a second zig-zag motif just inside the rim and adding to the dynamic energy of the piece.</p>
            <p>The figure of <name type="pname">Diana</name> appeared again in a later bronze (<ref target="#fig-183">fig. 8</ref>). Looking at both pieces together, the distinct similarities become very
<pb n="272"/>
apparent. This small dish can be considered the earliest study for one of Manship's most popular and beautiful sculptures.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-184">
               <graphic url="COAC13_272a.jpg"/>

            </figure>
            <p>Appropriately, Manship modelled the <name type="pname">St. Paul</name> Institute Medal (<ref target="#fig-184">fig. 9</ref>), as that was where he received his first formal art training. The obverse portrays a kneeling Muse with her <name type="pname">cithara</name>, her right hand holding a winged victory bearing two laurel wreaths. On the reverse Pegasus appears again, high above the earth with a pattern of vertical rays rising behind. The almost Egyptian style of the kneeling muse on the obverse was several years ahead of its time as the revival of interest in Egyptian art did not fully occur until after the discovery by <name type="pname">Howard Carter</name> of King Tutankamun's tomb in 1921. Manship himself considered this piece a radical departure from his previous work (<name type="pname">St. Paul Pioneer</name> 1915).
<q>I have thought to get away from the stereotyped models generally used in this connection to suggest the whole idea in an abstract manner, and so, instead of representing the figure of Art with a palette in one hand and a work of sculpture in the other, I have pictured, for the obverse of the medal, the Muse that inspires
<pb n="273"/>
and extols, kneeling before the figure of Victory, who bestows the recognition of artistic accomplishment. But for the reverse of the medal, the idea of the Pegasus arising from the globe itself, appealed to me, apart from its decorative effect, as being suggestive of the flight of Fancy, and its vehicle of transport to the higher realms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There was also a smaller study for the obverse of the <name type="pname">St. Paul</name> Institute medal of which only a few casts were made (<ref target="#fig-185">fig. 10</ref>). Although the modeling is more simplistic, the figure of the muse in this version seems more natural. You can sense the movement of the hand just having plucked the strings and you find yourself straining to hear the notes of the melody she sings towards the heavens, four stars twinkling above her head. The border of raised dots forms a halo, or glow, around the figures or could be interpreted as the vault of the heavens which, like artistic inspiration, knows no limits. It also creates the illusion of being reflected in a pool beneath the figures. The inscription forms a cradle which embraces the figures and solidifies the design.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-186">
               <graphic url="COAC13_273.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Welles Bosworth, the architect, was the subject of another portrait medal. He and Manship had been friends since the sculptor's return from Rome in 1913, and it was through him that several important early commissions were received. The reverse of the Welles Bosworth Portrait Medal (<ref target="#fig-186">fig. 11</ref>) depicts a winged female figure kneeling on a plinth and holding a column in both hands. To the left, in Greek characters reads "EUPHROSYNE," one of the three Graces, whose name means "she who rejoices the heart." This symbolism has a double meaning here, the first is a reference to Bosworth's architecture which in its beauty and grace were a thing of joy to look upon. The second being to the great friendship shared by the two men which lasted their lifetimes.</p>

            <p>Orpheus and Pegasus soar above the rising sun on the obverse of The Art Directors Club Medal of 1921 (<ref target="#fig-187">fig. 12</ref>). The Club, incorporated in 1920, was intent on bringing the art of commerce to the fore. In its first 20 years the ADC awarded 129 medals and the list reads like a Who's Who of artists and designers. Among the recipients were such notables as <name type="pname">J.C. Leyendecker</name>, <name type="pname">Walter D. Teague</name>, <name type="pname">Norman Rockwell</name>; <name type="pname">Rockwell Kent</name>, <name type="pname">Peter Arno</name>, <name type="pname">James Thurber</name>, <name type="pname">Edward Steichen and P. Horst</name>.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>As in the Maxfield Parrish medal, Pegasus flies over the sun; the pose and style are very similar, only this time the soaring steed faces left. His head is thrown back in joy as he listens to the wondrous song of Orpheus who rides bareback, playing his lyre. These two strong icons of artistic inspiration and expression are quite fitting for this award, bestowed for artistic merit.</p>
            <p>Manship originally met <name type="pname">John Singer</name> Sargent in 1916 and became fast friends with the elder painter who even put the sculptor up in his <name type="place">London</name> flat while on his way to serve with the <name type="pname">Red Cross</name> during WWI. It wasn't until 1923 that Manship created a portrait medal (<ref target="#fig-188">fig. 13</ref>), to honor his illustrious friend, the reverse of which portrays the slaying of Medusa by the hero Perseus.</p>
            <p>The composition is complex but full of smooth flowing interactive curves. Perseus stands above the fallen Gorgon, his helmeted head turned away so as not to look upon Medusa's countenance. The right arm juts back at a right angle and holds the downcurving blade which draws the eye to the severed head held in his left hand. The corpse follows the bottom curvature of the medal, from the severed stump springs Pegasus whose upswept wings draw our eye back to the figure of Perseus. Encircling the figures, but not containing them, is a zig-zag

border that adds to the energy of the scene. The inscription, "PEGASUS LIBERATED," pays tribute to this artist who was the embodiment of artistic inspiration as the greatest painter of his day. By the use of initials, "P.M. TO J.S.S. 1923," Manship reveals the casualness and the closeness of the friendship shared by the two men.</p>

            <p>On August 15, 1927, <name type="pname">Judge Elbert H. Gary</name>, CEO and Chairman of the United States Steel Corporation; president and founder of the American Iron and Steel Institute; namesake of <name type="pname">Gary</name>, <name type="place">Indiana</name>; philanthropist and the single most powerful and influential leader in American industry, succumbed to heart disease at age 80. His vision and commitment are responsible for many things we take for granted in business today including fair labor practices, health and safety incentives, quarterly and annual reports to the public and an 8-hour workday. It was only appropriate that his creation, the American Iron and Steel Institute, create an award to truly honor his memory.</p>
            <p>The obverse portrait (<ref target="#fig-189">fig. 14</ref>) was executed from a marble bust at the Gary residence in <name type="pname">Jericho</name>, <name type="place">Long Island</name>. Manship achieves a marvelously strong profile relief of Judge Gary in his prime that projects the power, conviction and dignity of this great man. There are no other decorative elements save the identifying legend. None are necessary, as the portrait conveys all that needs to be said. There is some flair in the letterforms, especially the "R's" that add to the impression of this man's uniqueness.</p>
            <p>The symbolism of the reverse is as strong as the portraiture of the obverse. Here Manship gives us a scene of Hephaestus resting at his forge. What more fitting tribute to a man who was this god's incarnation in modern industry, whose mills glowed like so many volcanoes
<pb n="276"/>
across the nation? Two winged figures hover above his head with the victor's laurel signifying the award. The forge and anvil are traditional symbols for Hephaestus but are also symbolic of the Iron and Steel industry from whose fiery forges a modern industrialized <name type="place">America</name> emerged. The rays around the god's head, aside from a reference to the genius of <name type="pname">Judge Gary</name>, himself connote the signal significance of the award and the distinction of the recipient. Finally, that the god is resting refers to the fact that this is a memorial to one who has passed on.</p>

            <p>The Society of Medalists (SOM) was founded in 1930 with the promise of making available to the average citizen small bas-relief works of art by America's greatest sculptors at an affordable price. The second issue of the SOM, modeled by Manship, caused quite a stir in its depiction of Dionysus (<ref target="#fig-190">fig. 15</ref>), the god of wine, frivolity and drunken debauchery. Considering that this was during the height of Prohibition the subject matter didn't sit well with many people. Manship himself, in the brief accompanying message, considered that: "The medal is not conventional. It is subtly humorous and is symbolic of a present-day attitude toward certain restraints of the times. Thus it is commemorative of an era" (SOM 2).</p>
            <p>Shortly after its release, an article appeared claiming that the medal
<pb n="277"/>
had become a "matter of contention" between "Wets" and "Drys" in the membership of the SOM, it went on further to say that it knew of at least one member who threatened to resign if "any more insults to the Constitution are perpetuated in the name of art" (Art Digest 1931).</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-190">

            </figure>
            <p>The SOM quickly released a statement to the effect that "the protests which had been received did not cite advocacy of Prohibition as the reason for disapproving the medal", and went on "that more letters of praise than censure had been received..." (New York Times 1931).</p>
            <p>With this singular piece Manship reaches the epitome of his art in the interpretation of modern issues through archaic forms. He did not see the issue in terms of "Wets" or "Drys" but rather as a statement on the social issue of Prohibition and a reflection of its times.</p>

bursts its way across the lower half of the medal, bolts of power fly from its wheels and a swift column of smoke streams from the stack. The tangibility of the power and speed that radiate from this image is astounding and to further emphasize these attributes the god Mercury flies above. Known for his swiftness as a messenger of the gods, Mercury was also the god of commerce. Upon his forward extended right arm is a miniature of "The Best Friend of Charleston," the locomotive whose historic (albeit short) run on Christmas day 1830 signaled the beginning of railroad transport in this country.<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> Adding to the atmosphere of the piece, the wavy rays behind symbolize the dawn of the new age that the steam locomotive brought to the economic growth of the nation. Two hundred of these much sought after medals were produced at a cost of approximately $900 (including dies) plus Manship's usual $2,500 fee (Manship, Letter).</p>

            <p>Pegasus makes his final appearance, this time with Bellerophon the Carnegie Corporation Medal (<ref target="#fig-192">fig. 17</ref>). This award, created in 1934, was presented by the Carnegie Corporation in recognition of an academic contribution to the advancement of knowledge. Bellerophon, a great lover of horses was visited in a dream by Athena one night in which she told him where to find the winged steed Pegasus. Upon
<pb n="279"/>
awakening he found a golden bridle left by the goddess and at a clearing, just as she had described, he found Pegasus, drinking from a pool of water. His stealthy approach went unnoticed until the last instant and Pegasus bolted, but Bellerophon just managed to slip the on the bridle which tamed the beast instantly. One day, according to Pindar, Bellerophon tried to reach Olympus on his fabulous beast, and Zeus in his anger at the mortal's impudence, flung him to earth, laming him for life.</p>
            <p>The symbolism here is as well thought out as the composition. In this instance, Pegasus represents knowledge and Bellerophon, man's gaining of that knowledge. Their struggle attests to the fact that though knowledge can be gained, it can be flighty and elusive and its attainment is not always easy. The waves become the symbolic carriers of knowledge and ideas to all corners of the globe. Lastly there is the warning, though not seen, to those familiar with the myth that knowledge used toward the wrong ends is a dangerous thing and the consequences can be costly.</p>

            <p>Manship's relationship with the Hercules Powder Company began in 1941 with a commission to create the <name type="pname">John Wesley Hyatt</name> Award to be given for distinguished achievement in the field of plastics. The company, a leading explosives and industrial chemicals manufacturer, was founded in 1912 by <name type="pname">Russel H. Dunham</name>. Dramatic growth and expansion during and after WWI allowed Hercules to become a major manufacturer of raw materials for the growing plastics industry. In 1945 Manship sculpted a statue for their corporate headquarters in

               <name type="pname">Wilmington, DE</name> and in 1951 was asked to create a medal commemorating Dunham's fifty years of leadership.</p>
            <p>This 3 inch uniface medal (<ref target="#fig-193">fig. 18</ref>) depicts a strident Hercules wearing the famed skin of the <name type="pname">Nemian Lion</name> and carrying a club on his shoulder. Struck in gold and bronze issues by Medallic Art Company,<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> it is a relief miniature of the sculpture done six years earlier. Compared to his earlier medals this one seems very static in composition and has lost all the decorative brilliance for which he was so well known. This lack of a more involved composition may have been due to a hasty deadline. At this point in his career, Manship's popularity had greatly declined because of his association with the "academic" art establishment and his strong opposition of the avant-garde who were now riding the crest of the wave of popularity.</p>

            <p>The last medal to be discussed here is the Century Association medal of 1955 (<ref target="#fig-194">fig. 19</ref>). Awarded annually to the Centurion by the Board of Management of the Club, the medal's obverse presents a standing Pallas Athena, patron goddess of literature, art and industry, helmeted and wearing the aegis over her chiton. In her left hand she holds the laurel of recognized achievement and with her right she touches the base of a lamp symbolizing knowledge and enlightenment. This lamp stands upon a pylon rising from the plinth upon which <name type="pname">Athena</name> stands. This representation, as Manship would have been aware, resembled the celebrated statue of the goddess by Phidas that was in the Parthenon. The reverse of this medal, as with so many of Manship's works of this period is a wonderful treatment of his seemingly endless array of a ribbons and panels. The dexterity and variety of these when viewed together is astounding. Originally conceived as an
<pb n="281"/>
annual award, this medal has been presented only 13 times to date since its creation</p>
            <p>The fifteen medals covered here merely scratch the surface of the sculptors success in this medium. But, they are indicative of the consistency of his creativity and his dedication to craftsmanship. They truly set Paul Manship among the great medallists of all time.</p>

                  <p>The locomotive "Best Friend of Charleston" was given that name by local businessmen who saw it as the means of getting goods from the port city to the newly developing inland areas. It made its famous December 25th six mile run on the partially completed track of the South Carolina Canal &amp; Railway Company. A contemporary account tells of the then dazzling speed of the train as it travelled "on the wings of the wind at the speed of 15 to 25 miles an hour, annihilating time and space and leaving the world behind...(the engine) darted forth like a live rocket, scattering sparks and flames on either side, passing over three saltwater creeks, hop, step and jump, and landed us all safe at the lines before any of us had the time to determine whether or not was prudent to be scared." Six months later the "Best Friend of Charleston" met its end when a fireman, annoyed at the hissing noise from the boiler, proceeded to hold down the safety valve. The resulting explosion blew him and the engine to kingdom come.</p>

               <name type="pname">Die-engraving</name> for the production of coins and medallions is an age-old and increasingly rare form of art. Once, all coins were struck from hand-engraved dies, and the engraver held an honored position in government and in society. Today there are several ways to create minting dies that do not necessarily require the skilled hands of an engraver, and thus die-engravers have become almost as rare as the art that they practice.</p>
            <p>It is part of the trade's mystery that very little written information exists to aid in the education of a would-be engraver. <name type="pname">Die-engraving</name> is passed from master to apprentice, a visual and manual training that can be acquired in no other way. They say that it takes seven years to become a competent die-engraver, but, as one who has struggled with this obdurate art form for at least ten years, I suggest that it takes much longerâ perhaps a lifetime. In addition, there are few schools that offer this very specific training. Die-engraving could easily disappear without some conscious effort to continue it, to pass on a fascinating and intricate decorative art form.</p>
            <p>The tools used by the engraver, ancient and unchanging, are relatively simple. Each engraver makes his own tools, as they are hand-held and so must fit each individual hand. Hardened steel chisels and a hammer are used to remove large amounts of steel from a steel die (<ref target="#fig-195">fig. 1</ref>). Small steel gravers or burins are used to remove small amounts of steel, and to add lines and details (<ref target="#fig-196">fig. 2</ref>). Hand-made steel punches have a design engraved on their faces, which is then hammered or "punched" into the face of the die. It is often true that one must make a tool to make a tool.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-195">
               <graphic url="COAC13_284.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>A die-block, or cylindrical piece of "soft" workable steel is placed in a vise called a graver's block. White paint is smeared over the surface of the die-block, and the design to be engraved is then transferred onto the face of the die, and traced again with a sharp metal scribe. This will serve as a map for the engraver. It is at this point that the work begins.</p>
            <pb n="285"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-196">
               <graphic url="COAC13_285a.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Each engraver has a slightly different way of approaching a job, and so I may only speak for myself. I begin with my chisels and a heavy hammer. Chisels and gravers both have different "faces," that are either round, flat, or v-shaped. Depending on the cut needed, I then hammer my chisel along within the design, removing the mass of the design. This may also be accomplished with a flexible shaft tool, or other similar mechanical grinding tool. The chisel can leave ragged marks in the steel, and these are then smoothed somewhat with a wide flat graver.</p>
            <p>Fine details and lettering may be added with a small graver. As demonstrated by master engraver Ron Landis, lettering may also be added with individual letter punches. Punches guarantee a uniformity of image, and are particularly useful when a design element is repeated within the image.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-197">

            </figure>
            <p>Modern dies are created with a different method, and with the skills of another artist. As demonstrated by Laura Gardin Fraser in a recently restored video, "The Medal Maker," a die may be made from an original "sculpt" which is actually much larger than the finished product. <ref target="#fig-197">Figure 3</ref> shows the passage of an idea through design to finished sculpture. The artist's design is translated into a three-dimensional sculpture through clay and plaster. Lettering is usually carved into the negative plaster model, from which a positive is poured in plaster. This model is then cast in bronze at a foundry, or cast in a hard epoxy resin. The original
<pb n="286"/>
must be made of some very hard material that will withstand a lot of machining.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-198">
               <graphic url="COAC13_286a.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The model is placed on a machine called a pantograph reduction machine (fig. 4). Two of the most common machines are the Janvier and the Augenstein, which vary slightly in design, but achieve the same result. A stylus traces the relief of the model in a series of concentric circles, moving slowly from the center out toward the edges of the model. At the other end of the machine's long arm, a steel cutter repeats the motion at a reduced ratio, thus creating a smaller version of the original model. This, when finished, will be the "hub" from which a negative die will be made. The hub is checked by the engraver for flaws, often left behind by the reduction machine, and then the steel hub is hardened. The hardened hub will be impressed into a "soft" piece of steel, thus creating the die from which a coin or medal will be struck. <ref target="#fig-199">Figure 5</ref> shows a hub, the "soft" steel that it will be impressed into, and the resulting die.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-199">
               <graphic url="COAC13_286b.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>Historically, the striking of coins and medals has involved ingenious and not always efficient machinery. It is this requirement that makes the art of the struck medal different from other forms of sculpture; limitations are imposed by the capacities of the machine upon design and relief of modeling. The trick is to combine art, inspiration, and mechanical restraints into a very small beautiful space, and in the most successful of coins and medallions this always occurs. <ref target="#fig-200">Figure 6</ref> shows one such medallion.</p>
            <p>At a workshop held in conjunction with the 1997 conference, a
<pb n="287"/>
combination of both old and modern techniques in die-engraving and striking was demonstrated. I prepared an obverse die from a sculpt, and <name type="pname">Ron Landis</name> prepared a reverse die, engraved by hand. Playing with the "Coinage of the Americas Conference" theme, we both designed an image that had to do with <name type="place">North and South America</name>. The obverse, reduced from a larger sculpt, shows a Liberty head mirrored by an aztec goddess head (<ref target="#fig-201">fig. 7</ref>). The reverse, hand-engraved directly into the steel die, juxtaposes an eagle with a phoenix-like bird. These two dies were struck together to produce small medals commemorating "the Medal in America," the theme of the conference (<ref target="#fig-202">fig. 8</ref>).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Through this demonstration we sought to answer some questions about the vanishing art of die-engraving. Only continued interest will help this art form survive as it always has, passed on from teacher to student, hand to hand.</p>

            <p>After several years of struggling to become a hand engraver, I found myself exploring many facets of this simple, yet challenging art form. In 1982, I acquired a small coining press and was inspired to create small medals which I peddled at <name type="pname">Renaissance</name> Fairs across the country, dragging several tons of minting equipment along to demonstrate with. Being a hand engraver of limited means, I created the dies the only way I knew howâthe same way I engraved wax seals and signets, by cutting the design in reverse directly with hand held chisels called gravers.</p>
            <p>Trying to stay true to the historic theme of the Renaissance period, I was compelled to try to make my coining demonstration as true to form as I could, and by 1991, had built a water wheel powered mint at the Texas Renaissance Festival. We demonstrated hammered coining methods as well as the "modern" milled coining techniques developed in the sixteenth century using screw presses, bellows blast furnace, drop hammer, hand cranked edge mill, and water wheel powered rolling mills to demonstrate roller milled coining.</p>
            <p>In my initial research, I was surprised that there was really nowhere that was set up to show these obscure methods. I always thought that an art form that played such an important role in our development as a civilization should have a place to exist at a living history museum, like Colonial Williamsburg. After teaming up with my machinist partner, Joe Rust, we vowed to make it our responsibility to create a museum that would be a place where this, and other related technical arts such as paper making, printing, and bookbinding, can exist and thrive.</p>
            <p>Hand engraving has been all but replaced with the advent of new technologies such as pantographs, reduction lathes, spark erosion technology, and computer guided lasers. In order for it to exist as a trade, it must be put in a historic context the same way Colonial Williamsburg provides an environment were silversmiths, broom makers, and other obsolete trades and folk arts can thrive.</p>
            <p>It is important to preserve rare and historic coins, medals, currency, postage stamps, and other historic documents. Likewise, it is important to preserve the art forms that created these artifacts as a living, breathing part of our culture.</p>
            <p>The art of hand engraving, although just a shadow of the thriving trade it once was, still has its place and still offers unique and rewarding opportunities for the artist determined to master these hard learned skills. There is still a demand for high quality stationary, wax seals, ornamental engraving on guns, knives, hollow ware, jewelry, musical instruments, and even motorcycles to name a few. The distinctive styles
<pb n="291"/>
and delicate sharpness and human qualities of the hand cut line can be mimicked, but never truly captured by mechanical means. Portraits on paper currency are still engraved by hand in most countries for this reason. To my knowledge, there hasn't been a machine invented yet that can cut a line with the same delicate finesse as a true master engraver.</p>
            <p>I'm straying from the subject of medals a bit, but there is a relationship between all these trades that I wanted to point out merely to entice medalists to ponder the depth of possibilities this traditional art form still has to offer. My personal interest is the historic coin making techniques developed from its earliest, and most primitive forms.</p>
            <p>To my knowledge, there are no books specifically devoted to early die engraving techniques, so I am learning by trial and error, reproducing early coins using, as close as I can determine, the same techniques used to create the originals. In the process, we hope to parallel the developments that occurred in the early mints through the same sort of natural order of "evolution" as early mints did. We will never figure out all the exact methods and tools used in a given mint for a specific coin, but we can learn the general methods of given time periods, and thus gain an overall basic knowledge of the development of minting processes through hands-on trial and error experience.</p>
            <p>My latest obsession has been to reproduce Early American coins. The techniques employed to produce dies for these coins were also used to produce tokens and medals of the period. The big difference between engraving a medal die and a coining die is that coining dies need to be reproduced quickly and with great consistency. Most mints developed a method of producing dies from hand-engraved punches so that the time consuming engraving process is only done once, and the dies could be executed from these punches by a die sinker. Therefore, individual punches are made so that Miss Liberty for example, looks exactly the same from die to die. The terms engraving and die sinking are often used synonymously, but in practice, they are really two separate operations most likely performed by two specialists in larger mints. In his "Treatises of Goldsmithing and Sculpture," sixteenth century goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini mentions the security feature of using punches as opposed to directly engraving dies;
<q>The tools used for this purpose have two names, in some instances they are called punzoni (punches), and in other cases madre (matrices), and of a truth they are the mothers that may be said to beget the figures and all the other things you fashion in the die of your coins. The men who did the best work in coining
<pb n="292"/>
always did the whole of the work upon either the punches or the matrices, and never once touched up the dies with either gravers or chisels, for that would be a great blunder, as all the various dies necessary for making many impressions of the same coins, would be a bit different, and thus cause slight differences in the coins themselves, and that would be making thing easy for forgers, whereas coins well wrought in the way described could be less easily copied.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am finding there are other advantages to making the main device punches from matrices. By engraving the reverse matrix, or master die, and then producing the positive punch from this master matrix, the steel can be worked back and forth in the same manner that modern coin sculptors work in plaster. Things like incised lettering and belly buttons, for example, can be added in the positive much easier and cleaner than trying to engrave all around the detail. Combined with several sets and sizes of letter punches, dies for simple medals and tokens can be quickly and easily executed with a sharpness of detail inherent to these methods.</p>
            <p>When the New World mints of Spain began operating, they received from the mother land a mint "kit" so to speak. This kit contained not only a start-up set of dies, but all the punches to create new coining dies as needed. If a punch broke or wore out, a new one could be produced from the matrix which was a plate with all the letters and design elements used for a particular coin. This made it possible for the early Spanish Colonial Mints to operate without the skills of a master engraver. An apprentice with little or no artistic background can be trained to sink dies of a set pattern in a relatively short time compared to learning to engrave.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate how quick die sinking really can be, I sunk a die at the Coinage of Americas Conference held at the American Numismatic Society in NY. I only worked on it about fifteen minutes, hastily composing a simple eagle design from feather punches, and adding the legend with letter punches. I then spent no more than a half hour finishing it up when I returned to Arkansas. So in less than one hour, I was able to create a die, designing it as I went. Had I spent more time, it would certainly have been better designed, but I only wanted to illustrate how efficient this method can be for producing simple token dies, for example.</p>
            <p>Many early tokens and medals have been made using these basic techniques of die sinking, and often combined with direct engraving of

the main device. Since medals and tokens are made on more limited runs than coins, in many cases, it is more economical to hand cut the main device directly into the working die, instead of spending extra time to create a master die, and device punch. When using these large punches, there is always extra time in the machine shop to turn the distorted die blank back to round after punching in a complete eagle, for example. In other words, engraving a large device does not mangle the shape of the die like applying 100 tons of pressure to stamp it in.</p>
            <p>In doing our reproductions, I am always trying to figure out things like if a design element is hand cut in the die, punched in the matrix, punched in the punch or a combination. I am discovering there really are no rules for this, and I think all die sinkers and engravers gravitate to what they think is best to achieve the result they are looking for.</p>
            <p>During my short apprenticeship under George Bickley, he was trying to get me to think beyond the basic rules that I learned in trade school. He explained that at some point you need to throw out the rule book and become the master of your own bench. The final result is what you are going after, and there can be different roads to the same destination. Engravers develop their own ways that work for them. This is why I don't like to think of myself as a master. As long as there is a new or better, or different way to do something, I remain a student, just scratching the surface (pun intended).</p>
            <p>I enjoy exploring various kinds of numismatic engraving. One of my greatest loves is <name type="pname">carving nickels</name>. Based on the folk art of "<name type="pname">Hobo Nickels</name>," this is a simple, spontaneous way of creating small medals from available pocket change. Many hoboes of the Great Depression used to recarve Buffalo nickels into various novel designs such as hobo heads, and then give these <name type="pname">Hobo Nickels</name> in exchange for favors received along the way. Although somewhat of a novelty, the original <name type="pname">Hobo Nickels</name> of yesterday are a uniquely American form of medal that has a charm all its own.</p>
            <p>Carving nickels is an excellent way to learn portrait engraving. If you goof it up, you have only lost a nickel. Also, it is a very free form of medallic expression that does not require extensive equipment and dozens of highly technical steps to complete. The coin is carved, and then it's done. It also makes for a quick, convenient way to sketch medal designs in 3-D. Taking this concept of carved coins a step beyond the more primitive folk art of the hoboes, coin carving can be done on larger coins, or used to create medals by directly engraving the original from a solid block of metal, then molding and casting to duplicate

the finished piece, thus returning us full circle to an earlier time when some medals were created this way. I love the way all this ties together.</p>
            <p>Certainly the most challenging and rewarding aspect of my work at Gallery Mint is the early U.S. coin reproductions. Although I am often criticized for this type of work, it has taught me much about coin design and portrait engraving. I find that by copying the work of earlier engravers, I am gaining a better eye for sculpting portraits, just as when apprentice painters copied the work of their masters to learn color and composition. This is a demanding discipline that I find most rewarding. And let's face it, like all artists, I'm always copying something, whether it's my sketch on paper, a photograph of a coin, a profile of a person, or just an idea in my head. To me, the execution of these designs is the act of creating which is the real art. But using these quaint, antiquated methods is part of the ritual, an exercise that carries on a traditional art form that is thousands of years old, and makes me feel connected with something very basic and ancient.</p>
