               <persName>Wayne Moore</persName> produced most of the photos of the ANS's gold and many of its small silver pieces; <persName>Michael Di Biase</persName>, most of Plates 18 and 19; and the ANS's <persName>Frank Deak</persName>, the bulk of the remaining
               illustrations on Plates <ref target="#fig-51">1</ref>–<ref target="#fig-75">25</ref>. Photos of the hoard coins on Plates <ref target="#fig-76">26</ref>–<ref target="#fig-81">31</ref> were supplied by various friends who are noted elsewhere. <persName>Marie H. Martin</persName>
               has done her usual magnificent job as editor, and I thank her too most heartily.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Charles A. Hersh</persName> has made available his remarkable collection of small-denomination <persName>Alexanders</persName>, many purchased in recent years in deliberate aid of this study and has made valuable comments on the manuscript. <persName>Sarah E. Cox</persName>, by her cheerful and patient checking of references in the text, has eliminated a host of errors. <persName>Georges Le Rider</persName> and the late <persName>Martin Price</persName> have helped throughout with information offered
               willingly, indeed enthusiastically, and with their sage comments. That <persName>Dr. Price</persName> in particular did not agree with all
               my conclusions did not lessen his continued kind help. I am especially grateful to each of these three friends.</p>

               <p>Unlike most studies, the present one has been based not on material gathered by the author, but almost entirely on the rich lode at the
                  American Numismatic Society. Its <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> collection, the world's best, has been
                  augmented by its library, its photograph file, and most significantly by its large and important cast collection, assembled chiefly by the
                  discerning <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Edward T. Newell</persName>. To these have been added the stater photographs gathered
                  by <persName>Georges Le Rider</persName>, the important small denomination <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins in the collection of <persName>Charles A. Hersh</persName>, and a mere handful of other examples.</p>
               <p>Although all the material on which the study is based is at the ANS in the form of coins, caste, or photographs, the present location of many
                  of the coins themselves is not known. Many collectors of decades ago cannot be identified, and many once known older collections are now no
                  doubt dispersed. In a few cases the particular institution in a stated city is not known. Such information as is on <persName>Newell's</persName> cast cards or in his records is given, but where there is no clear indication of the specific institution holding a coin
                  (e.g., on casts marked simply "<placeName corresp="#nomisma_berlin">Berlin</placeName>" or <placeName>"Istanbul"</placeName>) no
                  expansion of the citation in the text is given below. Most readers will be as well able as the author to assume which institution holds (or
                  held) a coin.</p>
               <p>It has not seemed necessary to trouble a great many curators with inquiries about whether or not they still possess particular coins.
                  Doubtless there will be criticism of this decision, but all the evidenee is, after all, at the American Numismatic Society and available
                  there.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">INTRODUCTION</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The rather amorphous, non-specific nature of this book's title is unfortunately unavoidable. The work deals with what are essentially five
               coinages, in two metals, struck over several different periods of time and very possibly at two or more different mints–whose locations we do not
               know.</p>
            <p>The project started more than ten years ago, as I worked on preparing sylloge volumes of the ANS's magnificent collections of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s gold and of the silver coins from his <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> mint, usually
               assumed to be <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>. <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                  II</persName>'s coinage had previously been catalogued, and the sylloge volume containing his coins, lifetime and posthumous, was published in
               1994. <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> numbers for <persName>Philip's</persName> coins are therefore given in this work. The <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> volumes, however, remain in manuscript and publication dates are uncertain, so that no
               sylloge numbers are given here for the coins in his name.</p>
            <p>The ANS's gold from the two or more <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> gold mints has been subjected to a die study together with examples from
               the Society's (largely <persName>E. T. Newell's</persName>) remarkable cast collection and its rich photo file and library. To these
               examples were added photographs of many other gold coins, which <persName>Georges Le Rider</persName> kindly put at my disposal. The results
               of the die study are briefly summarized here in chapter 10, which describes in detail only one sub-group which can now be identified as the
               earliest lifetime staters.</p>
            <p>The tetradrachms from the main silver mint, traditionally called <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, were also studied, through the issues
               which were found in the great <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard of 1905, buried ca. 318 B.C., and through the next group of issues as
               well, those with the primary marking <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> which were not present in <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>.<ref target="#FR-n1">1</ref> No attempt was made to assemble a corpus, but the ANS's rich coin and cast collections and other resources enabled
               some 2,949 examples to be studied. Approximately 879 obverse dies were identified, for a quite respectable coin to obverse die ratio of 3.3 to
               1.</p>
            <p>Together with the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms were studied three related series of coins:
               first, the small silver denominations of varying sizes and types which accompanied the tetradrachms; second, the reissues of tetradrachms with
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>'s types, name, and weight made after <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s death, through those whose markings repeat those of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms with <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>; and third, the small-denomination silver
               coins with <persName>Philip's</persName> types which accompanied these tetradrachms.</p>
            <p>Each of these three other silver series has helped to illuminate the main output of this chief <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> mint, the
               enormous strikings of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms. Die links and iconographical changes in
               these other series help in ordering and dating the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms and in
               understanding the overall activity of the mint.</p>
            <p>All these die studies were essentially completed some five years ago, with the one exception of the small denominations with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s types. Many of these quite rare little coins have appeared in sale catalogues in recent
               years, and some of these new arrivals have produced new connections between groups. They have been valuable late additions. No fewer than four
               hoards of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins which surfaced in 1993 and 1994 also provided important
               information and could not be omitted.<ref target="#FR-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>All the series studied exhibit random die axis relationships. The <persName>Alexanders</persName>, silver and gold, are on the Attic
               standard, with a tetradrachm of ca. 17.2 g; the <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms are on the <pb n="18"/> local standard of ca. 14.4
               g. In the interest of brevity, therefore, neither weights nor die axes are given except in the case of the small <persName>Philip</persName>
               coins of chapter 5 whose denominations are either uncertain or unusual.</p>
            <p>Deliberately left unread until the coins' study was complete is a manuscript left behind by <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Edward T. Newell</persName>, which internal evidence seems to place between the publication of <hi rend="italic">Reattribution</hi> in 1912 and
               that of <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>
               </hi> in 1923. It contains no discussion, only a very preliminary and incomplete catalogue of the two tetradrachm series in the present study,
               and a listing of many of their corresponding smaller coins. It does not include gold coins.</p>
            <p>This manuscript has thus served as a valuable check on my findings, and it has been gratifying to find that my conclusions were in the main the
               same as those of <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>. To mention a few concerning the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins: groups F and G might well be considered a single group–<persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> describes them as "group F, section 1" and "group F, section 2."<ref target="#FR-n3">3</ref> He
               placed the drachms with arrow symbol in group F's first section–i.e., in <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>
               </hi> group F.<ref target="#FR-n4">4</ref> All of the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>-aplustre coins were considered one issue, regardless of the

               placed the small denominations with the straight laurel branch with the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               tetradrachms with <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> and laurel branch.<ref target="#FR-n7">7</ref> He also apparently did not question the
               authenticity of the <persName>Philip</persName> Attic-weight drachm issue with crescent symbol (the only marking he knew here), but listed
               it together with the <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>-crescent <persName>Alexanders</persName> of group J.<ref target="#FR-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Only twice did <persName>Newell's</persName> placement differ in any significant way from mine. He put the rare <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> drachms with <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> in group F–perhaps because there they would have
               directly followed the only other known <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> drachms of our mint. I had followed
               both <persName>Thompson</persName> and <persName>Price</persName> in placing these <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> with the tetradrachms
               of group L, where the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> is the primary marking. I was wrong: one of the 1993 hoards just mentioned decisively proved
               them earlier, and my original placement had to be changed.<ref target="#FR-n9">9</ref> Finally, <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> placed the <persName>Philip</persName> fifths and tenths of the tetradrachm with the <persName>Philip</persName>
               tetradrachms of both groups 8 and 9, whereas it is here argued that they accompanied only group 8.<ref target="#FR-n10">10</ref> This last then
               is the only place where I differ from that great scholar.</p>
            <p>In general, then, this study of the silver coinage does not differ greatly from <persName>Newell's</persName> thinking, but it provides a
               more complete description than has hitherto been available of the four series of silver coins and of their interrelations and a slightly revised
               chronology. The study also sheds some light on the rather maddeningly uniform <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> gold issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, with their repeated unvarying symbols. It does not, however, propose any
               answers to–or indeed make much effort to address–two basic and persistent questions: the coins' mint or mints, and the reason for the reissue
               after <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                  II</persName>'s coins.<ref target="#FR-n11">11</ref> I happily leave to others the enjoyment of puzzling over these questions and wish all success
               to them.</p>

            <p>For <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s chief <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> silver mint I use here when
               necessary the traditional name of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>. This name is used with great reluctance,
               for I have no confidence that this city, rather than <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> or perhaps Aegae or <persName>Philippi</persName>, was the source of this enormous silver output. With no specific evidence supporting the claim of any other city,
               however, it seems preferable at least for the moment to retain the usual attribution to <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>–but with no
               assurance that the coinage was in truth struck there. A second <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> silver mint, usually referred to as Pella, is
               treated here only rarely and peripherally. This study concerns itself only with the chief mint.</p>

                  <p>The <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms' pattern, established long ago by <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Edward T. Newell</persName>,<ref target="#PARTI-CH1-n1">1</ref> is of a number of successive groups, each of
                     which includes from three to twelve different issues, i.e., coins with differing reverse markings. Within each group there is heavy obverse
                     linkage among issues. Not every die is known in multiple issues, but with almost no exceptions every issue is obverse linked with at least
                     one, and usually more than one, other issue in its group.<ref target="#PARTI-CH1-n2">2</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Table 1 lists the groups and their constituent issues. Groups A through K are listed by <persName>Newell's</persName> letters as he
                     published them in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard.<ref target="#PARTI-CH1-n3">3</ref> The next group, not present in that
                     deposit, I have termed L. Groups after L are not included in this study.</p>
                  <p>The groups are listed in <persName>Newell's</persName> order, with the single exception that the minute group K is placed before J.
                     Justification for this minor shift, as well as for its continued attribution to our mint, is given below.<ref target="#PARTI-CH1-n4">4</ref> Within each group the issues are listed in the order given in <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi>, <persName>Martin
                        Price's</persName> recently published monumental compendium of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                        issues,<ref target="#PARTI-CH1-n5">5</ref> although within each group any order is meaningless, as die linkage patterns show that the
                     issues within each group must all have been struck more or less simultaneously.</p>
                  <p>Table 1 is organized by inscriptions and groups with the number of coins studied given for each group. The first column in the table gives
                        <persName>Newell's</persName> group letters, joined by issue numbers (repeating for each group) assigned by the present author.
                     Hesitant as I have been to introduce a new set of numbers into this subject, I have been convinced to do so by the unsatisfactory choices
                     available for describing these issues, which so often form major components of hoards and provide the basis for dating those hoards. Müller
                     issue numbers are incomplete and their order virtually meaningless. <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s</hi> issue numbers and <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard
                     coin numbers give only a rough indication of <hi rend="italic">where</hi> in this vast <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> coinage the
                     individual issues fall. A system which indicates the group (more important than the issue in any case) in addition to the specific issue
                     should be far more descriptive than one which identifies only the issue and does not always accurately place that issue. Thus B8, E2, and
                     G3, for example, provide more readily useful information than <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>'</hi>s 247, 716, and 1,168, or <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s</hi> 32, 78, and 110.</p>
                  <p>The table's second column describes each issue's marking or markings (the primary marking preceding any secondary one, regardless of their
                     positions on the coins). A bold <hi rend="bold">P</hi> indicates that issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                        II</persName>'s types are known with the same markings. These <persName>Philips</persName> are probably posthumous in the case of those
                     similar to the <persName>Alexanders</persName> of group A. Those parallel to the later issues, from group I on, are decidedly so.<ref target="#PARTI-CH1-n6">6</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third column gives the plate numbers of examples of each issue. The fourth and fifth give the issue numbers in <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi>
                     <ref target="#PARTI-CH1-n7">7</ref> and the initial <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard coin numbers. Issues illustrated in <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> are marked with an asterisk, and those with whose descriptions I differ are placed where I believe they
                     belong but in parentheses. Finally, as an indication of their relative abundance or rarity, the numbers of examples studied from each issue
                     are given. The numbers of obverse dies located and the estimated totals used, better indications of the original size of the groups, are
                     given in Table 2.</p>

                  <p>As has been noted, within each group it is clear that all issues must have been struck more or less simultaneously, and the die linkage is
                     so complex that it is impossible to place the issues in any linear chronological order. Three typical clusters of coins are diagrammed in
                     Figures 1–3. They come from group H, but similar clusters and die linkage are found in almost every group (e.g., note in Table 1 the
                     obverse die used for six issues in group D). The clusters presented below are simplified. Another antler obverse, for instance, sharing a
                     reverse die with the first coin listed but not linked by its obverse to any other symbol, is omitted. Brackets to the left and horizontal
                     lines indicate obverse die identities, and brackets to the right, reverse die identies. All coins are illustrated on Plates <ref target="#fig-55">5</ref>–<ref target="#fig-56">6</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A further confirmation of the contemporaneity of issues within groups is provided by the obverse links between groups described in Chapter
                     3. Issues struck in linear sequence would tend to have one issue in a given group linked to one issue in another. Instead, especially among
                     groups after A and B, the obverse dies forming links between groups were often employed for a great number of issues.</p>

                        from the issue that the coin's "obverse resembles the obverses of previous coins [of group D], while the reverse is almost identical in
                        style and workmanship with the following [group E]." Once again, <persName>Newell's</persName> remarkable sense of style is clear,
                        as there is now known a second obverse die in the issue, which was used also in group D: see Chapter 3, link 17. E1 might thus belong to
                        either D or E, but is here left in its traditional place. In either case, groups D and E are joined by one known obverse die.</p>

                     <persName>Newell's</persName> coin numbers, as they are found on the ANS's coin boxes, cast cards, and photo file cards, are
                     provisional working numbers only, and they encompass many numbers for which there seem to be no examples. When I finally consulted <persName>Newell's</persName> notebook (described in the introduction), no examples for the missing numbers appeared there either.
                     Clearly he sometimes left runs of numbers unused available to be assigned to subsequently acquired specimens, and consequently his die
                     numbers cannot be taken as cumulative and do not show the total numbers of obverse dies in the various groups. For example, in group I, his
                     die numbers run from 660 through 723, for a total of 64 numbers. Three pairs of those numbers, however, were given to identical dies, for a
                     loss of 3. Similarly, there are 13 numbers with no examples known (not in the trays and not mentioned in his notebooks), and I have found 8
                     additional dies. Instead of <persName>Newell's</persName> apparent total of 64 dies for group I, there seem to be only 56. Similar
                     situations obtain in each group.</p>
                  <p>Table 2 shows the numbers of coins studied in the various groups and the numbers of obverse dies identified in each group. "Coins" include
                     ANS coins (approximately half of all located), casts, illustrations in the ANS's photo file, or examples pictured in readily available
                     publications. The number of obverse dies given for each group is reduced by 0.5 for each die shared with another group. The final column,
                     the number of estimated dies, is the number arrived at by the useful equations published by G. F. Carter.<ref target="#PARTI-CH1-n9">9</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Group E (605 coins, 193 dies known and 241 estimated) is clearly the largest group, but, if as seems probable, F and G should be combined
                     into one group, then that resulting group would be a close rival (511 coins, 162.5 dies known and 203 estimated). Group L was also very
                     large.</p>

                        <cell>The issue, described with laurel branch and <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>, cites Müller 561, whose symbol is pictured like the
                           single straight upright laurel branch of issues J3 and J6. Two references are cited, the <placeName>Aleppo</placeName> 1893 hoard

                           shows a forked branch as on issue L1. Citations in "Tetradrachms <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>" reveal only coins as J6 (<hi rend="italic">

                           safely discount Müller's description and consider that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issue 140
                           is equivalent to L1. Issue 126, described as with "oak(?)-branch" (perhaps a better description than "forked branch") also belongs in
                           issue 140.</cell>

                           86–87. This separation seems incorrect in the light of the four die links now known between posthumous <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> issues as group J and others as group K. See below, Chapter 6, links 14–17. Further,
                           at least one obverse die link is known between group L and the Λ-bucranium <persName>Alexanders</persName>. See Chapter 3, link

                           The reference given is "Tetradrachms <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>," issue 5, which no doubt is derived in turn from a coin of
                           this description at the ANS which was placed in its trays together with group K coins. Neither the coin's sole marking nor its style
                           suggests any association with group K. I strongly doubt that the issue belongs at our mint.</cell>

                  <p>These smaller coins have received but one very brief study, by Newell in 1912.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n1">1</ref> Table 3 presents the
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> silver issues smaller than the tetradrachm: didrachms, drachms,
                     triobols, diobols, and obols. All denominations have the obverse type of the tetradrachms, a beardless head of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> r., wearing lion's skin headdress. The various reverse types are noted after each
                     denomination's heading in the table, and shown again in schematic form in Table 6, pp. 34–35. All coins are inscribed simply <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΔΡΟΥ</hi>.</p>
                  <p>The first column in Table 3 gives the Newell tetradrachm group to which each issue belongs, and the specific tetradrachm issue number
                     assigned in Chapter 1, if there is an exact correspondence. Some small coins' markings do not parallel any on the tetradrachms, but obverse
                     links among the small coins securely place most of these non-parallel issues in group E, and the rest can be assigned with near certainty
                     on other grounds.</p>
                  <p>The second column gives the coins' markings, and the third the plate reference for representative coins of the different issues. Virtually
                     all known obverse dies are illustrated, the exceptions being the late issues with <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> or arrow markings. Issue
                     numbers in <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> form the fourth column, and asterisks indicate the issues
                     illustrated there. Where I differ on the reading of markings, the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     issue number is placed where I believe it belongs, but in parentheses. The fifth column gives the number of examples found in each issue.
                     Brackets to left and right of the plate references indicate, as usual, obverse and reverse die links. All known die links between issues
                     are shown. Issues of which I have seen no examples are shown in brackets, and are not counted among the examples located. The drachms, the
                     commonest denomination, are divided between standing eagle reverse and seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName>
                     reverse.</p>
                  <p>Table 4 summarizes the numbers of examples found of each denomination in each group. Table 5 shows the number of obverse dies located
                     (shared dies reduce the number by 0.5), again for each denomination in each group. It is remarkable how close to 2:1 the coin to die ratio
                     is for each denomination and for each group except group A.</p>

                  <head>DISCUSSION</head>
                  <p>It should hardly be necessary to state once again that these small coins, most with eagle as reverse type, are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                     subdivisions of the rare <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms with eagle reverse.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n2">2</ref> Those tetradrachms were struck to the old standard employed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>, whereas the small coins are all of full Attic weight and most of their markings are
                     clearly those of the Attic-weight tetradrachms of Chapter 1. The type of standing eagle with reverted head was simply an old <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> type continued by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. It was used by
                        <persName>Archelaus</persName> I, Amyntas III, and Perdiccas III,<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n3">3</ref> and the latter two, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s grandfather and uncle, coupled with it the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> head obverse used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
                  <p>Unaware of the numerous obverse links now known between the many small coins without reverse symbols and those with symbols of group E, <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     </hi> unfortunately has catalogued these no-symbol issues together with the eagle-reverse tetradrachms (while of course listing the
                     symbol-bearing small coins together with the tetradrachms bearing their markings).<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n4">4</ref> All the small coins
                     with eagle reverses can now, however, be associated with specific groups of the Attic weight tetradrachms. Together with the didrachms,
                     which bear the tetradrachms' seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> as reverse type, they are all simply
                     subdivisions of the tetradrachms. It seems unnecessary to consider them a separate series struck "for local circulation" only.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n5">5</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>In groups A through D, the small coins' markings are exactly those of the tetradrachms, except for one drachm with filleted caduceus and
                        <graphic url="NS21_sym21.jpg"/> which probably should be assigned to group <pb n="36"/> D (the filleted caduceus occurs in both C and D,
                     but only in D are monograms found). The drachms of groups A through D all have the standing eagle reverse type.</p>
                  <p>As just noted, the numerous obverse links within group E, diagrammed in both Table 3 and Table 6, allow the firm placement within that
                     group of a number of anomalous issues of drachms, triobols, and diobols whose attribution has heretofore been uncertain. These coins have
                     no regular issue markings and often show the eagle standing not on the standard fulmen, but on caduceus, club, thyrsus, or torch.</p>
                  <p>By any standard–number of issues, number of examples located, or number of obverse dies found–group E had the largest output of small
                     coins. This is not surprising, as E was also the largest group of tetradrachms. In this group, too, the drachms with the usual imperial
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> drachm reverse of seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> first appear, with issue markings identical to those of some eagle-reverse coins in the group,
                     and actually obverse linked to one other eagle-reverse issue.</p>
                  <p>A drachm issue with the simple marking <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> has heretofore usually, and understandably, been associated with the
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms of group L, which bear the same primary marking.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n6">6</ref> The presence now of several examples of the issue in the Near East 1993 hoard,<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n7">7</ref> however, buried perhaps ca. 322 (several years earlier than the great <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard interred before
                     the striking of the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> tetradrachms of group L), shows that these drachms must be considerably earlier than
                     tetradrachm group L, and the absence of the title requires a group prior to groups G–K/J.</p>
                  <p>Also in the Near East 1993 hoard were two drachms with laurel branch symbol, an issue previously unknown save for one example published in
                     1988 by <persName>Kamen Dimitrov</persName>. This was one of three <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> drachms forming a small hoard discovered in 1976 at Calim, in Bulgaria.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n8">8</ref>
                     <persName>Dr. Dimitrov</persName> has kindly sent me not only a direct photo of a cast of the coin (<hi rend="bold">175</hi>), but
                     also a translation of his relevant Bulgarian text: <q>... Calim, ca. 35 km. W. from Nicopolis ad Nestum. Three <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> drachms are kept in the Historical Museum of Blagoevgrad. ... According to the
                        control marking . . . [the coin in question] corresponds to the issue of <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> 1563, [J1, with laurel
                        branch but with the <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> omitted], <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> 320–319.
                        At the same time the coin is struck from the same obverse die used for a specimen of an issue not represented in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard. ... [<hi rend="italic">Sardes and Miletus</hi>, p. 87, 3 = <hi rend="bold">174].</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardes</placeName> and <placeName>Miletus</placeName>
                     </hi> issue cited, die linked with the Calim laurel branch coin, is the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> issue. The laurel branch issue's
                     presence in the Near East 1993 hoard now shows that it too antedates 322/1 at the latest, and the absence of the title again indicates a
                     group prior to groups G-K/J. No exact correspondences with any tetradrachms' markings exist for these two interesting issues, but the
                     reverse variation and experimentation introduced in group E may in part explain their lack of correspondence. The obverses of these
                        <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> and laurel branch drachms are extremely similar to many tetradrachms of groups E and F (e.g., <hi rend="bold">40–56</hi>). Their reverse exergue lines, too, with one dotted exception, are formed by a simple line, an innovation which
                     is known rarely among the group E tetradrachms, but which is common among those of group F.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n9">9</ref> One of these
                     groups then must be that to which these <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> and laurel branch issues belong.</p>
                  <p>Another Zeus-reverse drachm issue with arrow symbol has long been known. The arrow, which again does not occur on the tetradrachms, could
                     be considered as associated with group C's bow or with F's bow and quiver.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n10">10</ref> But, as other Zeus-reverse
                     drachms first appear in group E, these arrow-symbol drachms cannot be so early as group C. Again, the lack of the title rules out groups
                     G-K/J. The obverse style of many arrow drachms, like that of the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> and laurel <pb n="37"/> branch drachms just
                     discussed, is very similar to tetradrachms of both groups E and F–but in the case of these arrow drachms, one iconographical detail allows
                     a firm placement in group F. Just as on the group F tetradrachms, their exergue lines, instead of the normal dotted ones, are sometimes
                     found as simple straight lines (<hi rend="bold">177</hi>) or omitted altogether (<hi rend="bold">179</hi>). And on at least one arrow
                     drachm (<hi rend="bold">178</hi>) the footstool is indicated by the slanting "short straight line (not to be confounded with an exergual
                     line)" which is found only on the tetradrachms of group F.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n11">11</ref> The arrow drachms can only belong to group
                     F.</p>
                  <p>No small <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins are known after group F. As will be seen below in
                     Chapter 4, the revived tetradrachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>, many of whose markings parallel
                     those of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms, start possibly as early as group I, and
                     certainly by groups K and J, continuing through L and several subsequent groups. <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                        II</persName> fractions accompany these <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms through those parallel with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups K and J–and then, as I shall argue in Chapter 5, probably are discontinued
                     before the <persName>Philip</persName> group parallel to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s group
                     L.</p>
                  <p>Finally, following group L and the tetradrachms with bucranium and Λ, <persName>Thompson</persName> has deduced from the existence of
                     a plated ancient <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> imitation drachm with Λ and torch that there may have
                     been genuine <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> drachms with those markings also.<ref target="#PARTI-CH2-n12">12</ref> If so, however, none have yet been discovered.</p>
                  <p>Thus the small coins were as follows.</p>
                  <p>Groups A-D: <persName>Alexanders</persName>, several denominations, drachms with eagle reverse</p>
                  <p>Group E: <persName>Alexanders</persName>, several denominations, drachms with both eagle and <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> reverses</p>
                  <p>Group F: <persName>Alexanders</persName>, drachms, <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> reverse</p>
                  <p>Groups G-H: –</p>
                  <p>Groups K-J and perhaps I: <persName>Philips</persName>. See Chapter 5.</p>

                        <cell>Also listed after the group B issues, the issue belongs to group E. Of the four known examples, only three are in sufficiently
                           good condition to allow die identification, and all three share their single obverse die with coins of group E's issues 82 and

                        <cell>The issue is perfectly valid. Note only that Lanz 48, 22 May 1989, 193, from the dies of the coin illustrated here (<hi rend="bold">132</hi>), is erroneously described as bee on rose, and thus as a unique didrachm of Pella.</cell>

                        <cell>The issue is described with eagle head to right, but the sole known coin, at the ANS (<hi rend="bold">188</hi>), seems on close
                           examination to bear a crescent, with horns pointed downward–which is also the orientation of the same symbol in the exergue of a coin
                           of issue 90 (<hi rend="bold">189</hi>). Issue 53's flan and die sizes also accord far better with group E than with D, so that the
                           coin probably belongs in issue 90. Issue 53 seems, at least from present knowledge, to be a phantom.</cell>

                        <cell>The reverse type of the sole coin cited is an eagle standing left, head reverted, on an uncertain object. <persName>Dr.
                              Price</persName> kindly confirmed that the coin's poor condition made recognition of a symbol, if any; or reading of any inscription
                           impossible. All other known obols in this <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> coinage have a fulmen as reverse type, and nowhere
                           here in any denomination is there known an eagle with reverted head standing left. Small coins of Amyntas III, however, bear
                           precisely the types of issues 156, similarly oriented (e.g., <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 94–96), and thus the coin cited as the
                           only example of issue 156 is probably of that earlier king.</cell>

               <p>Obverse links provide by far the most important evidence for the order of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups. These links, together with group A's use of symbols found in <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>'s coinage (immediately prior or perhaps for a time contemporary), the presence of the title <hi rend="bold">BAΣIΛEΩΣ</hi>
                  on five of the groups, and certain repetitions of reverse markings put all the groups into a firm order, with the one exception of the minute
                  group K (whose placement will be discussed below). Some small confirmation of this order is provided by other types of evidence–hoards,
                  stylistic considerations, and the small denominations of Chapter 2.</p>

                  <p>The 22 die links which have been discovered between the various <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups
                     are detailed on the following pages and summarized in Figure 4. Tetradrachms provide all but five: links 6 (drachms), 7 (diobols), 8
                     (obols), and 15-16 (didrachms). All coins known from these obverse dies shared by more than one group are described as a possible aid to
                     future researchers. For the same reason, <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>'s provisional tetradrachm obverse
                     die numbers are also given, as the ANS's casts and photo file cards are marked with these numbers.</p>
                  <p>Further intra-group connections of the tetradrachms listed via reverse links are mentioned in the discussion following each die link in
                     order to demonstrate further the complexity of the die linkage between issues within the groups and to show that the issues directly
                     involved in the links between groups are often clearly contemporary with other issues in their groups. The reverses of the coins listed are
                     described by <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> group letter, my issue number, and symbol, e.g., "A2, stern,"
                     while "same die" indicates that the reverse die is that of the immediately preceding coin.</p>
                  <p>The evidence is extremely incomplete or there would doubtless be more instances of links such as link 3, where a die was used for group B,
                     then for A, and then for B again.</p>

                     brow are more pronounced, and the field behind the lion's mane is starting to deteriorate. Clearly at least some of A's double-head coins
                     and B's amphora coins were struck simultaneously. The last coin listed, with amphora, is linked by a net of reverse and obverse dies to all
                     seven of the other symbols of group B. All but one of these die links are found among coins in the ANS collection.</p>

                     rest of the coinage. The eagle-reverse coins of various denominations are found only in A through E, and only in E do the Zeus-reverse
                     drachms come in, which then are the only small coin struck in the following group F. No small coins of <persName>Alexander's</persName> types are known after group F.</p>

                     </hi>, without giving specific examples or illustrations beyond those few presented in <hi rend="italic">Reattribution</hi>, that the
                     tetradrachm groups were all bound in sequence by a series of obverse dies linking one group to the next: "... group 'A' will possess
                     certain dies that were used in its production and then were continued in use, in a slightly more worn condition, for group 'B.' Group 'B,'
                     in turn, will be found to possess certain obverse dies that had already been used for 'A,' and others that were later used for 'C,' and so
                        forth."<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n3">3</ref> This account of the groups' linkage is somewhat of a simplification. <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> knew most of the links presented above. He apparently did not know the B-D or D-E links, and
                     he evidently did not realize until after <hi rend="italic">Reattribution'</hi>s publication that at least some of group B was contemporary
                     with group A.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n4">4</ref> Further, no B-C links such as he suggests have been located.</p>
                  <p>At least since the publication of <hi rend="italic">Reattribution</hi>, group A has been recognized as the first, because three of its
                     symbols (prow, stern, and double heads) are the same as those found at the end of the lifetime or early posthumous coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s father, <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                        II</persName>.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n5">5</ref> And, although its shape is different in the two coinages, <persName>Le
                        Rider</persName> has suggested that the rudder, which occurs rarely in <persName>Philip's</persName> issues, is a possible fourth
                     symbol relating group A to <persName>Philip's</persName> coinage.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n6">6</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Group B, repeatedly linked to A, should be next. But the first modification of <persName>Newell's</persName> order is that here some
                     overlap between groups must be accepted, because of the links where an obverse die was used first for a coin or coins of group B before
                     being used for group A (links 2, 3, and 5 above), and because of the unique recutting of a symbol of group B to one of group A (see link
                     2).</p>
                  <p>Groups C and D, linked by no fewer than eight obverse dies, are clearly contiguous. Group D would at first seem to have followed C,
                     because, of the five shared obverse dies whose priority of use can be determined, all five were first used for group C. A complication is,
                     however, introduced by links 6-8, where drachm, diobol, and obol obverses were used both for B and for D, the two smaller denominations
                     having had their reverse symbols recut from one of group B to one of group D.</p>
                  <p>Because of the large number of obverse links between A and B and between C and D (a pattern which does not recur), and because of the newly
                     recognized B and D links, it now seems probable that A and B were struck concurrently at two adjoining locations, followed by C and D at
                     the same two respective locations (workshops? adjoining rooms? adjacent anvils?). If group C had chronologically separated B and D, all
                     three groups emanating from the same workshop, it is hard to see why new dies should have been cut for C, while B's dies were preserved
                     unused until returned to service, recut where necessary, for coins of group D. But certainty is not to be had, and no great violence can be
                     done by leaving Groups A through D in their traditional order.</p>
                  <pb n="49"/>
                  <p>Following group D, successive obverse links, the introduction and abandonment of the title BAΣIΛEΩΣ, and similarities in reverse markings
                     make the groups' order inescapable except for the position of the minute group K.</p>
                  <p>I have placed K in the tables before J, although a strict linear order is probably misleading. More interesting than the placement of K,
                     however, is the question of its very attribution to our mint. <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> in <hi rend="italic">Reattribution</hi> published only one issue of the group (K3, its largest) and assigned it to an uncertain mint of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, <placeName>Thrace</placeName>, or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>. By the time of <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>'s</hi> publication, however, he had placed it, although without comment, at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n7">7</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Price has now argued against this attribution, considering group K (the Λ group) as the immediate predecessor of the Λ- or <graphic url="NS21_sym17.jpg"/>-bucranium and Λ- or <graphic url="NS21_sym17.jpg"/>-torch series–which he considered struck at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>. He posited that groups A–I, J, and L belong together, but without successors, at another mint, presumably Pella.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n8">8</ref> I would not necessarily disagree with his suggestion that the mint for the huge output of groups A
                     through L and their successors may have changed at some point. His suggestion of an introduction at <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> with a subsequent move to <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> could possibly be true. But
                     this study attemps to deal with numismatic evidence only, and that evidence seems at the very least to contradict the division at the
                     particular point that Price suggests. Precisely because his monumental work will inevitably and deservedly become the standard reference
                     for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s coinage, I should like to respond here in some detail to Price's
                     arguments.</p>
                  <p>First, he assumes that the title of BAΣIΛEΩΣ, once dropped (as it was in group L) would stay dropped, that there would be no brief
                     recurrence. This is surely correct.</p>
                  <p>Second, he states that group J (the <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>-group) follows directly on the symbol-only issues of groups A-I. This
                     also seems correct, although not for the reasons he gives.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n9">9</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Third, he says that group L (the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>-group) should follow directly on J for two reasons. One is that <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> is an elaboration of <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>: this is of course quite possible but not necessarily so. The
                     second reason is the shared symbols between J and L, which is quite convincing.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n10">10</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, as group L first drops the title BAΣIΛEΩΣ,<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n11">11</ref> Price concludes that there would appear to be no room
                     in the sequence for group K (the Λ-group), which bears the title. It then, he says, will have been the direct predecessor, but at another
                     mint, of the Λ-bucranium and Λ-torch groups. His reasoning is tight and would be persuasive, but the separation of group K from our mint
                     seems almost certainly impossible in the light of the four die links now known between the posthumous <persName>Philips</persName>
                     analogous to group K and those analogous to group J. Moreover, any suggestion that dies might have been transferred from J at our mint to K
                     as the initial group at <pb n="50"/> another mint is ruled out by the observation that in the <persName>Philip</persName> link where
                     priority of use can be determined, the die was used for coins of group K before being employed for coins of group J.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n12">12</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet it remains quite true, as Price has pointed out, that K does not logically fit in the sequence either before or after J. The resolution
                     is again provided by the study of the contemporary <persName>Philip</persName> groups, some analogous to J and K, some not, but all so
                     tightly and intricately obverse linked that the only explanation seems to be that all were more or less contemporary.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n13">13</ref> The tiny <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group K, if also struck
                     concurrently with J, which would seem likely, then presents no problem. Price's sequence A through I to J to L is preserved, yet K being
                     contemporary with J means that our mint need not be divided into two, at least at the spot Price proposes.</p>
                  <p>And finally, link 22 above, between group L (with <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>) and the Λ-bucranium group, seems to rule out Price's
                     sequence at his proposed second mint of group K (with Λ), Λ-bucranium, Λ-torch.</p>

                        <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>
                     </hi> placed group K after J, presumably because of the single die link which his tickets show that he knew between I and J. More recently,
                     both <persName>Le Rider</persName> and <persName>Thompson</persName> have preferred to place K before J,<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n14">14</ref> but the disagreement is meaningless if K was contemporary with J. But because some order is inevitable
                     in a serial listing, I have opted, despite the two I-J links, for K before J because of the more numerous shared dies among the analogous
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> reissues. Another consideration is that after group I two markings
                     rather than one identify the various issues and a primary marking for each group is accompanied by a varying secondary marking. Only in K
                     is there inconsistency in the placement of the two markings, with the primary one either in the left field or below the throne and the
                     secondary one in the other spot.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n15">15</ref> In J and L, however, the placement is unvarying. Unfortunately then,
                     the unavoidable strict linear order presented in the tables does not, in the case of group K, accurately represent reality.</p>
                  <p>The last group in this study, L, despite its superficial similarity to group J (<graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> instead of <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>, and the two groups' shared secondary markings), is a totally different outpouring from group J. No obverse links
                     connect the two groups, and only one possible but quite doubtful link joins the analogous <persName>Philip</persName> groups 8 and
                        9.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n16">16</ref> Several hoards contain coins of all or most groups down to and including J, but not L. Group L
                     drops the title BAΣIΛEΩΣ present on the five preceding groups. And, while abundant small-denomination coins (of <persName>Philip's</persName> types) accompany groups K and J, none are known that are analogous to group L.<ref target="#PARTI-CH3-n17">17</ref>
                     <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> may resemble <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>–indeed may well be an elaboration of <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>–but the two groups of coins are completely different.</p>

                        laurel branch alone. These latter two, however, are merely examples of a few rare, perhaps early or perhaps only poorly executed coins
                        of group J. They are not part of a group of their own, nor are they connected to any earlier issues. See Chapter 1, issues J1 (grain ear
                        alone, 3 coins and 2 reverses known), J2 (crescent alone, 3 coins and 2 reverses known), and J3 (laurel branch alone, 2 coins and 1
                        reverse known). Nevertheless, a firm tie between group J and earlier groups is provided by the two obverse dies now known to be shared
                        by I and J. See links 20 and 21 above.</p>

                        and crescent) seem to be shared. See the commentary at the end of Chapter 1 on Price's issues 127 (<graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> and

               <p>No even reasonably satisfactory study of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> can omit a study also of the late reissues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip

These tetradrachms' obverses depict a handsome head of Zeus, and their reverses bear the simple legend <hi rend="bold">ΦIΛIΠΠΟΥ</hi> and a nude mounted horseman. A summary of the <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms whose markings
                  correspond to those of the <persName>Alexanders</persName> of groups K, J, and L, and perhaps I, follows.

                  <p>Table 7 summarizes the post-323 <persName>Philip</persName> issues through those analogous to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group L. These late issues form Le Rider's <hi rend="italic">

                     <persName>Le Rider</persName> gives only a brief overview of this group, not the thorough die study accorded <persName>Philip's</persName> earlier <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> silver. Essentially he presents a list of issues to which a few
                     corrections now seem justified. These are given at the end of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>The numbers assigned the <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachm groups here are not Le Rider's (who gives none), but the present
                     author's. Numbers were chosen rather than letters in order to differentiate the <persName>Philip</persName> groups from the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups. The order of the <persName>Philip</persName> groups here is
                     for the most part that adopted by Le Rider, who remarks that his order is in many cases arbitrary.<ref target="#PARTI-CH4-n3">3</ref> The
                     only changes made here are that group 7, listed as two separate contiguous sections in <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi>, is presented as a single group and placed after rather than before group 6 because 5 and 6's secondary markings are largely
                     identical. Also, the fractions of groups 2 through 6 (group 1 has none) normally bear both issue markings of their analogous tetradrachms,
                     while 7's fractions, like those of group 8, bear only the secondary issue markings.<ref target="#PARTI-CH4-n4">4</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conclusion reached below in Chapter 6 will be that most if not all of these <persName>Philip</persName> groups were issued more or
                     less simultaneously. The numbering of the groups has been adopted for convenience of reference, as we do not seem to be dealing here with a
                     linear sequence of groups (see Figure 5 for the complicated die linkage among groups 2–8).<ref target="#PARTI-CH4-n5">5</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unlike the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups', the <persName>Philip</persName> groups' issue
                     markings clearly show the internal coherence of each group. Many internal die links are known, some published in the summary in <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi>, and more in <hi rend="italic">SNGANS.</hi> At least one example of each tetradrachm issue is illustrated here, on Plates 12–14, and
                     a few internal die links are also shown which do not appear elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Table 7 gives the issue markings found in each group, the plate locations of representative examples, <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi> plate references, initial <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> numbers, and the number of examples located for each issue. Regardless of
                     their positions on the coins, the primary marking is given first, followed by the secondary one. When an issue has the same marking or
                     markings as an <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issue, the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issue's group letter and issue number are given in bold type, before the <persName>Philip</persName> issue's markings: e.g., <hi rend="bold">K2</hi>before the first issue in group 7 indicates that this <persName>Philip</persName> issue has precisely the markings of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     group K, issue 3. Markings given in parentheses are known only in the <persName>Philip</persName> fractions and are included merely to
                     fill out the issue list, as examples of such tetradrachms may well surface some day.</p>

                  <p>Group 1 may well be a phantom. One single tetradrachm is known, and the fractions which <persName>Le Rider</persName> places with it
                     in <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi> solely on the basis of style would seem instead to belong with others with the same issue markings, which clearly belong in other
                        groups.<ref target="#PARTI-CH4-n6">6</ref> The tetradrachm's monogram <graphic url="NS21_sym19.jpg"/> may well be a variant of group 2's
                        <graphic url="NS21_sym24.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NS21_sym25.jpg"/>, and perhaps the coin should be included <pb n="54"/> in that group.
                     Group 1's monogram <graphic url="NS21_sym19.jpg"/> also is identical to one variant in <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issue I1, and, as other <persName>Philip</persName> reissues repeat some markings of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups K, J, and L, it remains possible that the <persName>Philips</persName>
                     commenced as early as <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group I.<ref target="#PARTI-CH4-n7">7</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The composition of groups 2 through 7 is self-evident and the primary markings clearly show which coins and issues belong in each group.
                     Groups 8 and 9, however, present problems. These are the coins with the primary marking <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>. The groups with these markings, both <persName>Philips</persName> and <persName>Alexanders</persName>,
                     were for the most part poorly and often carelessly made, apparently in some haste. The two series in each king's strikings used many of the
                     same secondary symbols, but are subject to being confused because of the similarity of the primary markings <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>
                     and <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>, which differ only by a single dot. The correct attribution of an <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, even with a poorly or imperfectly executed letter or monogram, is simple because
                     group J, with <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>, included the title <hi rend="bold">BAΣIΛEΩΣ</hi> in the inscription, while group L, with
                        <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>, did not. Among the <persName>Philip</persName> coins, however, the attribution depends solely upon
                     whether the marking is <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> and, given the often poor workmanship involved, it
                     can be virtually impossible to decide whether the presence or absence of the critical dot is intentional or accidental. Further, there
                     exist numbers of barbaric imitations of the <persName>Philips</persName>, especially in these problematic groups 8 and 9 and in
                     following groups also. Obvious imitations have been excluded from this study, but some may well not have been recognized. Some group 8 and
                     9 coins are possibly wrongly attributed in Table 7, but the overall picture should be approximately correct.</p>
                  <p>More important is the possible, but highly uncertain, die link between <persName>Philip</persName> groups 8 and 9 which results from
                     taking a few coins at face value, that is, trusting that their markings are intentional and not the result of carelessness or accident. For
                     discussion of the coins involved in these links, see Chapter 6, link 18, and p. 53, note b.</p>

                     <p>Although the issue markings are those of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s L8, the <persName>Philip</persName> issue may well be a phantom. Four coins are known, from two die pairs. One die pair is illustrated here
                           (<hi rend="bold">333</hi>), but the reverse's general aspect is a bit odd (note in particular the unique orientation of the shield).
                        This may be an ancient imitation, a common occurrence in group 9. Indeed, <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>
                        marked an ANS cast from these dies as "Barbarian."<lb/> The other reverse die <hi rend="italic">(Hunter</hi>, p. 291, 61, and the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> coin, here <hi rend="bold">449</hi>) has a very fine, faint dot below the <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>, very likely not made by the same tool which engraved the <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>, and in the Hunter
                        catalogue itself the marking is described as a simple <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>. If the dot on this second reverse is a mere
                        accident, the die would belong to group 8–which is made more likely by the fact that this reverse's accompanying obverse is found also
                        in group 8's <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>-crescent issue, forming the only possible die link between groups 8 and 9, see Chapter 6,
                        link 18. It is worth noting that the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> cast at the ANS had been placed by <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> with his casts of group 8, not 9.</p>

                     </hi> ISSUES</head>
                  <p>These comments concern three tetradrachms listed in <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi>, p. 124, and illustrated there on pl. 46. They are coins of groups 8 and 9, with the primary markings <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>
                     or <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>.</p>
                  <p>Plate 46, 8, "aplustre and <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>." The issue may exist, but this particular coin does have a faint dot within the
                        <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>, and belongs to group 9's very large <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>-aplustre issue. I am most grateful to
                     Martin Price for a direct photograph of the coin (<hi rend="bold">324</hi>) and an enlargement of the reverse. It is from the dies of Münz.
                     u. Med. 13, 17 June 1954, 1096, and from the reverse of <hi rend="bold">325</hi>, both of which clearly show the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>. The obverse of <hi rend="bold">324</hi> is not known elsewhere and <hi rend="bold">325</hi>'s is known only in
                     group 9: Myers, 11 May 1972, 18, <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> aplustre; <hi rend="bold">329</hi>, <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> wreath;
                     and a cast at the ANS, <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> dolphin.</p>
                  <p>Plate 46, 9, "dolphin and <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>." The ANS has a cast of this coin, which does seem to have a dot present, joined
                     to the inner edge of the right perpendicular element of the <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>. As the coin in question would be the only known
                     example of the supposed <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>-dolphin issue, it almost certainly is merely a poorly executed specimen of the
                     extremely large <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>-dolphin issue of group 9, where its poor, flat relief would be typical.</p>
                  <p>Plate 46, 12, "laurel branch and <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>." The coin would be the only known example of this supposed issue (note,
                     however, the fractions with a horizontal, quite different branch).<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n9">9</ref> It seems more likely that the symbol
                     of pl. 46, 12, is a poorly engraved grain ear, an issue not listed in <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi>, but of which several examples are known, e.g. <hi rend="bold">326</hi>. Ineptly engraved grain ears are common also on <persName>Alexanders</persName> with <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>, e.g. <hi rend="bold">95–97</hi>.</p>

                  <head>FIFTHS</head>
                  <p>By far the chief subdivision of the post-323 <persName>Philip</persName> reissues is a small coin with the head of Apollo wearing
                     taenia on obverse<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n1">1</ref> and ΦIΛIΠΠΟΥ with a nude horseman on reverse. The denomination of these little pieces
                     is unclear. As <persName>Le Rider</persName> points out, they are certainly too heavy to be considered tetrobols on the standard of
                     the tetradrachm of the period (ca. 14.29–14.39 g), which would require a coin of, at most, 2.38–2.40 g. Nor are they heavy enough to be
                     truly fifths of a tetradrachm (ca. 2.86–2.88), such as the fifths with the same types were in the lifetime coinage of <persName>Philip</persName>. <persName>Le Rider</persName> suggests that these fractions could pass at their period as tetrobols on the Attic
                     standard, but on the whole prefers to regard them as fifths of the tetradrachm.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n2">2</ref> Their correct
                     denomination, however, being unclear, and <persName>Le Rider's</persName> persuasive "fifths of the tetradrachm" rather unwieldy,
                     these coins will simply be called "fifths."</p>
                  <p>There are known also a few extremely rare "tenths" and several examples of what must be drachms on the Attic weight standard which belong
                     with these abundant post-323 <persName>Philip</persName> fifths. These other denominations will be discussed briefly later in this
                        chapter.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n3">3</ref> A few corrections to <persName>Le Rider's</persName> small-coin listings are also given
                     at the end of the chapter.</p>
                  <p>Table 9 presents the issues found of the fifths. The first column gives the issue's markings (primary marking before the secondary one,
                     regardless of their position on the coins) and the second the plate location of a representative example or examples. Plate numbers in <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi> form the third column, and the fourth gives the issues' initial coin numbers in <hi rend="italic">SNGANS.</hi> The last column gives
                     the number of examples found of each issue. Brackets to the left of the plate references indicate obverse die links, those to the right,
                     reverse links.</p>
                  <p>Some small issues cannot be definitely assigned to a particular group, namely those with the single markings of globule or amphora (group 2
                     or 3), and star (group 2, 3, or 4). The last issue listed, with simple straight laurel branch, can only probably be placed in group 8.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n4">4</ref>

                  <p>The final marking listed, the straight laurel branch, is not found on any known tetradrachms. The symbol finds its nearest parallel in the
                     rather sketchily executed straight laurel branch found occasionally among the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms of group J, analogous to <persName>Philip</persName> group 8.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n5">5</ref>
                     Supporting this tentative association with group 8 is the fact that the only tenths issues known (see below) have the grain ear of group 8
                     and this horizontal laurel branch. The remaining problematic issues are listed in Table 11.</p>
                  <p>Table 10 gives the total number of examples found and studied for the various groups of tetradrachms and fifths. Because the fifths' dies
                     are so small and often so similar, and because the coins are often in such poor condition, no attempt to count their obverse dies has been
                     made. Hence the comparison with the tetradrachms is made not by actual or estimated obverse dies used, but simply by the numbers of coins
                     located.</p>
                  <p>In groups 2 through 6, virtually all of the securely placeable fifths bear the dual markings of their corresponding tetradrachms. However,
                     the single markings of group 7 are (except for the one coin with a rather crude Λ) only the secondary markings of their group, whose
                     primary marking is Λ; but there can be no doubt as to the placement of this group's fifths.</p>
                  <p>After group 7 the situation is more difficult, because subsequent fifths also bear only a secondary marking, and many of these markings
                     were used both in group 8 (with <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>), and in group 9 (with <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/>). Table 11 compares
                     the incidence of the symbols found on these problematic fifths with the incidence of the same secondary markings on the tetradrachms of
                     groups 8 and 9.</p>

                     strongly suggest that all the small coins belong with group 8. Several other observations, none convincing in itself, also lend weight to
                     this supposition.</p>
                  <p>First, there are the numbers of tetradrachms and fifths located in the various issues from group 2 on, listed in Table 12. The forms of the
                     monograms given are those which occur most commonly.</p>

                  <p>By and large, the sizes of the tetradrachm issues and the fifths' issues correlate ever so approximately, at least as measured by the
                     numbers of examples located. Although there are exceptions, the tendency is for larger tetradrachm issues to be accompanied by larger
                     fractional issues, and smaller by smaller. A comparison of the five fractional issues in question with the group 8 and group 9 tetradrachm

                  <p>The number of crescent fifths, 17, is compatible with either group 8's 25 or group 9's 15 tetradrachms, and the 9 profile shield fifths
                     might also belong to either group (if indeed group 9's profile shield issue even exists),<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n8">8</ref> but the number
                     of fractions with the other three symbols is far out of line with the numbers of tetradrachms known in group 9, while according well with
                     those of group 8. By itself this analysis of the sizes of the issues is far from definitive, but may help to strengthen the other evidence
                     suggesting that these problematic fractional reissues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> belong to group
                     8.</p>
                  <p>Finally there are the obverse links detailed in the following chapter. Nine links between groups are known among the fifths. Five of these
                     (links 2, 4, 6, 7, and 10) do not involve groups 8 or 9, but all parallel obverse links found among the tetradrachms. A sixth link among
                     the small coins (link 15) involves a coin with trident head symbol—which must be of group 8, not 9, as the trident head does not occur in
                     group 9. This link too parallels an obverse link among the tetradrachms. The remaining three obverse links among the fifths (links 9, 16,
                     and 17) involve small coins with symbols common to both group 8 and group 9—forked branch, grain ear, and crescent. Because all the six
                     other known links among the fifths parallel known tetradrachm links, it seems only reasonable to assume that these three links do also, and
                     thus at a minimum that the specific coins in question here—and very likely their whole issues as well—belong not to group 9 but to group
                     8.</p>
                  <p>The <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms of group 9 are succeeded by other <persName>Philip</persName> issues whose markings
                     repeat those of many <persName>Alexanders</persName> subsequent to group L, but no <persName>Philip</persName> fractions of any
                     size are known with these later emissions. The small denominations with <persName>Philip's</persName> types would seem to have ceased
                     with those of group 8.</p>

On p. 359 <persName>Le Rider</persName> suggests that the earlier <persName>Philip</persName> fractions with the same types as these were instituted in order to facilitate the exchange of <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms with Attic weight gold staters. How much more necessary would some aid to exchange have been
                        at this later period, when Attic-weight tetradrachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> were being
                        issued simultaneously with <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms. One <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachm and one
                        so-called fifth of a tetradrachm do not weigh quite as much as an Attic tetradrachm, but one must take into account the usual tendency
                        for small coins to weigh less than their theoretical weight and the fact that such exchanges would be for the most part local. Price
                        came to this same conclusion in <hi rend="italic">
                           <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                        </hi>, p. 38. In favor of such a function for the small coins is the observation later in this chapter that the fifths were issued in
                        roughly proportional numbers (if one can judge by surviving coins) with their corresponding tetradrachms.</p>
                     <p>Price has also convincingly shown that the small coins, fifths of the <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms, were in reality
                        drachms, and the traditional <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> large coins, more properly termed staters than tetradrachms, were
                        traditionally divided into five, not four parts, i.e., drachms (<hi rend="italic">

                        </hi>, pp. 38–39). But the term fifths will be used in this text to avoid confusion with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s Attic-weight drachms.</p>

                  <p>The <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> on the first coin, known since 1891 although first published in 1973, places that issue in group 8,
                     together with the die linked simple grain ear issue.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n10">10</ref> Neither the grain ear alone nor the crescent
                     alone is known on any <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms of either group 8 or group 9, but both are known on the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms of group J, analogous to <persName>Philip</persName>

                  </p>
                  <p>The crescent issue is Müller's 273 "tetrobol" (equivalent to octobol in present-day terminology), published in 1855.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n12">12</ref> The first crescent coin illustrated here (<hi rend="bold">390</hi>), acquired in 1841 by the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName>, presumably also gave rise to <hi rend="italic">Historia Numorum's</hi>

                  <pb n="63"/>
                  <p>The unusual orientation of the crescent, with horns down, also points to a placement in group 8. Such an orientation is unreported on any
                        <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms in either group 8 or group 9, or on the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>s of group L, contemporary with <persName>Philip</persName> group 9. This
                     orientation is, however, found on a number of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms in
                     group J, contemporary with <persName>Philip</persName> group 8.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n14">14</ref>

                  <p>The weights and axes of the six known specimens are 4.03 ← <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> grain ear; 4.11 ↑ and 4.18 ↑, grain ear; and 4.07
                     ↓, 4.06 ↓ (holed), and 4.13 ↓, crescent. Clearly drachms on the Attic standard, they are a considerable anomaly, the only silver with <persName>Philip's</persName> type struck to this standard at any time.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n15">15</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Private communications have revealed considerable doubt as to the coins' genuineness. First and most important, of course, is their weight,
                     but the treatment of Heracles' hair at the brow, the dotted circle on the reverse of the grain ear coins with the dots placed over a faint
                     linear circle, and the incuse aspect and small size of that reverse die have all raised suspicions. None of these latter objections seem
                     valid, however, as Heracles' hair is similar to that on many <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     tetradrachms of group J,<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n16">16</ref> the dots cut over a circular guideline are common at this time,<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n17">17</ref> the incuse effect is seen on both <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms and fifths,<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n18">18</ref> and the small size of the die may simply reflect the small size of the common fifths.</p>
                  <p>The present author—rather brashly, for she has not seen any of these drachms—is therefore inclined to accept them as genuine.<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n19">19</ref> Most telling are the markings of the simple grain ear and the simple crescent with its horns pointing
                     downward. A modern forger would presumably have modeled such coins on <persName>Philip's</persName> tetradrachms, but these markings
                     do not occur alone on those tetradrachms. It seems most improbable that any forger would realize, first, that both of these markings were
                     found alone only on a very few rare <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms, and, second, that
                     those <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms were contemporary with the <persName>Philips</persName> with the marking <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> (where the <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/>-grain ear issue obviously
                     belongs), and thus that the simple grain ear and crescent with horns pointing down would be reasonable markings for his little
                     creations.</p>
                  <p>Far more likely is the assumption that during the striking of <persName>Philip</persName> group 8 and the contemporary <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group <persName>J Amphipolis</persName> was called upon to produce a
                     few Attic drachms and, as all other small denominations at the time bore <persName>Philip's</persName> types, appropriate <persName>Philip</persName> types were used for these drachms also.</p>

                  <p>Plate 43, 2–8. <persName>Le Rider</persName> has placed these fifths of fine style, with grain ear, amphora, star, and globule
                     symbols, after his lone tetradrachm of group 1 with the single marking <graphic url="NS21_sym19.jpg"/>. He likens the small coins' obverses
                     to those of certain, most probably roughly contemporary, gold staters of Amphipolis,<ref target="#PARTI-CH5-n20">20</ref> which seems
                     persuasive but which does not necessarily suggest an association with any particular tetradrachm group.</p>
                  <pb n="64"/>
                  <p>As already discussed, group 1 may well be a phantom. In any case, none of the four symbols on the fractions in question occur on this
                     tetradrachm, but all occur in other tetradrachm groups. One fifth with star is die linked into group 3 (<hi rend="bold">343</hi> and <hi rend="bold">340</hi>), and the coin seems merely to lack group 3's primary marking of <graphic url="NS21_sym26.jpg"/>. Other coins with
                     star, amphora, and globule probably also simply lack their primary markings.</p>
                  <p>The grain ear is a heavily used symbol in group 8, and there seems little reason to separate out the few coins with the finest obverses.
                        <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>'</hi> s pl. 43, 2 (<hi rend="bold">373</hi>), is in fact reverse linked to a coin with a quite
                     unexceptional obverse (<hi rend="bold">374</hi>). Placement on stylistic grounds is at best weak placement, and it seems preferable to
                     place the particular coins illustrated on <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>'s</hi> pl. 43, 2–8, together with others bearing the same markings.</p>
                  <p>Plate 44, 12. The coin, <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 587, with only <graphic url="NS21_sym26.jpg"/> visible, may well have a symbol off
                     flan.</p>
                  <p>Plate 44, 27–28. These coins, with star only, are in <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi> placed with group 4. Here 28 (<hi rend="bold">343</hi>) has been moved to group 3, as it shares an obverse with another group 3 coin
                        (<hi rend="bold">340</hi>). Other star-only coins, including 27, may belong to any of groups 2, 3, or 4.</p>
                  <p>Plate 46, 32. The "dolphin" symbol on the coin, <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 735, is shown by a comparison with the better preserved <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 734 (<hi rend="bold">382</hi>), from the same dies, to be not a dolphin but a profile shield. No small coins
                     with dolphin symbol are known.</p>

               <p>The 17 (or possibly 18) obverse links which have been found between the various post-323 <persName>Philip</persName> groups are detailed
                  below, followed by a summary in Figure 5 and then by discussion. Tetradrachms provide eight, or possibly nine, of the links (links 1, 3, 5, 8,
                  11–14, and also 18 if this last is a valid link), and the fifths the remaining nine (links 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 15–17).</p>
               <p>As in Chapter 3, all coins known from the obverse dies involved are catalogued. <persName>Newell's</persName> provisional tetradrachm
                  obverse die numbers are also given as a possible help to future researchers, because the ANS's coin tickets, casts, and photo file cards bear

                  <head>DISCUSSION</head>
                  <p>Hoards provide minimal help in proposing a relative order for the <persName>Philip</persName> groups here. Several <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> hoards' contents end with <persName>Alexanders</persName> parallel to groups 7
                     and 8.<ref target="#PARTI-CH6-n2">2</ref> These will be discussed in Chapters 8 and 9. Two hoards of <persName>Philips</persName>
                     include coins of all or most groups through group 9.<ref target="#PARTI-CH6-n3">3</ref> None help with any arrangement of groups 1–6, nor
                     with their relationship to groups 7 and 8. Here we are totally dependent on the evidence of the coins, and this is not clear.</p>
                  <p>The <persName>Philip</persName> groups 1–8 are presented here in a linear order, because on a two–dimensional sheet of paper there is
                     no alternative. The evidence strongly suggests, however, that many if not all of <pb n="70"/> these groups were struck more or less
                     simultaneously–or at least that groups 1 (or 2) through 7 were struck concurrently with group 8.</p>
                  <p>Groups 4, 5, 6, and 7 all share obverse dies with group 8. Groups 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 form pairs of groups closely connected by
                     shared secondary markings. Links 5 and 10 show that groups 5 and 6 must have overlapped at least to some extent, and link 12 shows that 5
                     and 6 must also have overlapped group 8. Link 8 shows that group 8 must have at least in part preceded group 4, and yet 4 is closely bound
                     to 2 and 3–and it does not seem reasonable to place the small groups 1–3 after 6. And then there is group 7, tied by no fewer than four die
                     links to group 8. And, if the monograms <graphic url="NS21_sym18.jpg"/>, <graphic url="NS21_sym19.jpg"/> and <graphic url="NS21_sym25.jpg"/> of groups 1 and 2 are variations of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group I's <graphic url="NS21_sym9.jpg"/> or <graphic url="NS21_sym10.jpg"/> then group 7's monogram <graphic url="NS21_sym13.jpg"/> seems even more
                     probably a variation of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group I's unusual monogram <graphic url="NS21_sym12.jpg"/> suggesting that group 7 came rather early in the series. It does not seem possible, then, to place groups 1–8 in
                     any sort of linear order and the relatively small groups 1–7 must have been struck more or less at the same time as the larger group 8.</p>
                  <p>Le Rider stated that his order for these groups in <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi> was somewhat arbitrary. The order here, largely his, is not intended to be understood as a strict chronological sequence, but merely
                     as a convenient way of presenting the contemporary groups 1 through 8. Given the unexpectedly small size of some of the groups, as measured
                     by the obverse dies employed,<ref target="#PARTI-CH6-n4">4</ref> this is not surprising.</p>
                  <p>Group 9, however, is different. Aside from the highly questionable link 18 with group 8, it shares no dies with any other group. Further,
                     hoard evidence and other observations on the analogous <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups show
                     that, despite its superficial reverse resemblance to group 8, it must be considered a completely separate emission.<ref target="#PARTI-CH6-n5">5</ref>

               <p>Table 16 summarizes and correlates the chronology of the silver coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>–both <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s and <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>'s types, and all denominations. The table is based solely upon internal evidence, that of the
                  coins themselves. Its two chief subdivisions, Attic weight and <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> weight, parallel the coins' types with but
                  one exception, the rare Attic-weight drachms corresponding to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group J.
                  These anomalous Attic-weight drachms bear <persName>Philip's</persName> reverse type and name.</p>
               <p>The incidence of the various small denominations with their reverse types is indicated in Table 16 by the following abbreviations:</p>
               <p>Z = <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> seated, as on the tetradrachms</p>
               <p>E = eagle standing 1. or r., head sometimes reverted</p>
               <p>2E = two eagles facing each other</p>
               <p>F = fulmen</p>
               <p>P = <persName>Philip's</persName> type of mounted horseman (or horse forepart on tenths)</p>
               <p>
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachm groups G, H, I, K, and J include the title <hi rend="bold">BAΣIΛEΩΣ</hi> in their inscriptions. This study ends with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group L and
                  the contemporary <persName>Philip</persName> group 9, but the arrows at the bottom of the table indicate that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachms continued to be struck at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>.</p>

               <p>Table 17 gives in its second and fourth columns the estimated number of obverse dies employed in the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <persName>Philip</persName> tetradrachm groups, as discussed in Chapters 1 and
                  4. The figures in the final column for groups A through I are the numbers of estimated dies used for <pb n="72"/> those <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups. Group A's total may be higher, as it is unclear whether <persName>Philip's</persName> coins with the same markings were issued before or together with group A's <persName>Alexanders</persName>. Further,
                  groups A and B must have overlapped at least in part, and C and D may well have also.</p>
               <p>The Attic-weight fractions of all denominations, being so few, have not been taken into account. But the <persName>Philip</persName>
                  fifths corresponding to <persName>Philip</persName> groups 2–8 were, so far as is shown by surviving specimens, at least approximately
                  equal in number to their corresponding tetradrachms, and the small coins' weights were nearly equal to the difference between the weights of
                  the two kings' tetradrachms. Therefore, a simple addition of the estimated dies used for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups K and J and <persName>Philip</persName> groups 1–8 seems the most reasonable number to use in the final
                  column.</p>
               <p>In <persName>Philip</persName> group 9, however, there appear to have been no small coins struck. Therefore a conversion factor has been
                  applied to the number of <persName>Philip</persName> dies estimated here: 14.40/17.20, the approximate theoretical weights of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> and Attic tetradrachms. The resulting number 47 (56 <persName>Philip</persName> dies x 14.40/17.20) was
                  then added to the 232 Attic tetradrachm dies to give the final column's 279.</p>
               <p>The numbers in the final column, then, the results of several approximations, are the best estimates the present author can make of the
                  relative numbers of dies used, and thus the amount of silver produced, at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> during the period under
                  study.</p>

               <head>8. <hi rend="bold">THE SILVER HOARDS</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Listed in this chapter, following an alphabetical index, are the 46 hoards containing <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>
                  <persName>Alexanders</persName> (or their analogous post-323 <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> reissues,
                  or both) which were buried by ca. 300 B.C. and whose detailed contents are available to me. Noted are the total numbers of coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <persName>Philip II</persName>I, the numbers of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> coins, and the latest <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> group present. The <persName>Alexanders</persName> are tetradrachms unless described otherwise.</p>
               <p>The hoards are presented in approximate chronological order, in many cases based on their <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> contents. Where
                  this is not the case, the latest reasonably datable coins are identified. It is of course impossible to date each hoard accurately to a given
                  year, and the order is not to be taken too seriously as hoards several numbers apart may be contemporary, or hoards may well be listed after
                  others whose burials they actually preceded. A hoard summary appears on p. 83.</p>

                  <p>12 <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>: A, B, 4 D, 5 E, G. This fascinating hoard contained not only <persName>Alexanders</persName>
                     (chiefly of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, with Aradus providing the second most important component), but also numerous Athenian

                  <p>The specific <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> information given here derives from the casts and photos which <persName corresp="#viaf_4947477">Nancy Waggoner</persName> assembled at the ANS.

                     latest Babylonian issue in the hoard, but Martin Price believed that she had information stating that this issue was present, and he
                     included it in his description of the hoard in <hi rend="italic">

                     may well be later than 322, but their dates are not firmly enough established to justify dating the <placeName>Babylon</placeName>

                  <p>5 <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>: A, C, 2 E, G. Martin Price provided the details of this hoard, which also contained <persName>Alexanders</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName>, Side, Amathus, Salamis, Tarsus,
                     Aradus, Myriandrus, and <placeName>Babylon</placeName>. Most are probably from the years just before 323. The latest coins are one of

                     composition is extremely similar to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> 1964. Its <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> components ended where those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia
                        Minor</placeName> 1964 did, except that the latest series of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> and <placeName>Abydus</placeName> present there were lacking here, as was any Colophon material. The present hoard contained also a drachm of
                     Aradus with caduceus <hi rend="italic">(<persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     </hi> 3333). Its burial thus seems to antedate that of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> 1964 by a very
                     short time, perhaps less than one year.</p>
                  <p>The hoard is of no value to the absolute chronology of the <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> groups, but its burial date of ca. 322
                     rather surprisingly shows that the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> drachms, contrary to all previous assumption, cannot be associated with
                     the post–318 tetradrachms of group L with that monogram as primary marking.</p>

                     321/320. The burial date is thus too late to be of chronological value.</p>

                     </hi> places it in his group of hoards buried ca. 323–320: "The <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> issues in Central Greece go down to
                     the Γ group [group J] of c. 323 BC..., emphasizing that its deposit cannot have been long before that of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard." Perhaps Price was influenced by the absence of group K, considered in <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>
                     </hi> as the latest <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> group. But as K now seems quite contemporary with J, Central Greece's <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> issues go down as far as <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>'s, and its burial was probably at least as
                     late as that great deposit's, i.e., ca. 318 or 317. In any case, the hoard does not date our group J; it is dated by it. Note that the
                     hoard contained 3 coins of group J, not 1 as reported in <hi rend="italic">

                     the coin of group J dates the hoard which is thus of no chronological help. A "considerable number" of coins were said, however, to have
                     been dispersed before the remaining 118 were studied.</p>

                     year 30, or 318/7 B.C.–a year later than <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>'s latest coins. As <persName>Le Rider</persName> and Olçay
                     remark, no other <pb n="77"/> hoard coins can be dated later than <persName>Philip</persName> III's reign, so the hoard's burial can

                     the time of the assassination of <persName>Philip II</persName>I" (fall 317 B.C.) because the Sardes material contained two series
                     (one large, one small) not present in <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>. Additionally, Sinan Pascha contained a <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> drachm, which she believed contemporary with the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> tetradrachms of group L, "the
                     immediate successors of coins with <graphic url="NS21_sym2.jpg"/> alone," which were not present in <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>. As
                     the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> drachms were present in the Near East 1993 drachm hoard buried ca. 322, they are now seen to antedate
                     group L by some years, and are no longer a reason for <persName>Thompson</persName>'s burial date. Nevertheless, as Price notes, Sinan
                     Pascha contained the full record of drachms struck in the name of <persName>Philip II</persName>I and its burial can hardly be earlier
                     than the end of 317.</p>

                  <p>There are two components of the hoard. Lot A is the 110 coins in <persName>Newell's</persName> original publication (<hi rend="italic">Andritsaena</hi>), which included 73 <persName>Alexanders</persName> of which 22 were from <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>.
                        <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> dated the hoard's burial to ca. 315 B.C. because the latest coin known
                     was one of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, which he considered struck ca. 316 B.C. This coin was of the issue of <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     </hi> 3746, there dated to ca. 311-305 B.C. However, this issue was struck over a period of several years, and the dies of the Andritsaena
                     coin are Waggoner's 280a, which she assigns to ca. 316 B.C.–just the time <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>
                     thought.</p>
                  <p>A second group of 41 (not 40, as in <hi rend="italic">IGCH)</hi> coins forms <hi rend="italic">IGCH'</hi>s lot B. <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> learned of this group from the Greek collector Empedocles only after <hi rend="italic">Andritsaena</hi>'s publication.<ref target="#PARTI-CH8-n23">23</ref> Of its <persName>Alexanders</persName>, 11 are identifiable
                     issues of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> as shown above.</p>
                  <p>Several complications arise from this lot. As <persName>Thompson</persName> noted in <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>, it included a
                     post–323 coin of <persName>Philip II's</persName> types with markings of Λ, E, and bucranium (the group which follows <persName>Philip</persName> group 9 [analogous to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group L]): "If
                     this was part of the original hoard, it may require lowering <persName>Newell's</persName> burial date of 315 B.C. by a few
                     years."</p>
                  <p>But there are further complexities. Fortunately still preserved at the ANS is the scrap of paper on which <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> recorded, rather sketchily, the coins of lot B. From this he added the lot to the previous
                     lot A in one of the bound notebooks in which he kept careful and precise records of many hoards. Six of the tetradrachms of lot B were not
                     transferred from the scrap of paper <pb n="78"/> to the notebook. They included four coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>: two of <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>'s</hi>
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> group II, one of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> group II ("Jannated
                        <hi rend="italic">[sic]</hi> Vase", i.e., double heads)<ref target="#PARTI-CH8-n24">24</ref> and one of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> group IV (that mentioned above, with A-bucranium); and two coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> III, one with <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΔΡΟΥ, Λ</hi> in left field and <graphic url="NS21_sym35.jpg"/> below the throne, and one with <hi rend="bold">BAΣIΛEΩΣ AΛEΞANΔΡΟΥ</hi> and a star of seven rays below the
                     throne.</p>
                  <p>The first of the two <persName>Alexanders</persName> must be the twelfth <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> coin mentioned in <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>, but its identification is a problem. No issue is known with precisely these markings. Could a mention of a
                     bucranium or torch have been omitted from the original sketchy list?<ref target="#PARTI-CH8-n25">25</ref> The second <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, however, with the star's seven points carefully noted, can only be an uncertain
                     Peloponnesian issue of ca. 270-260 B.C.<ref target="#PARTI-CH8-n26">26</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two omitted <persName>Alexanders</persName> and the late <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> possibly
                     were not transferred to <persName>Newell's</persName> notebook because he considered them intrusions–but then why would he have
                     omitted the three unexceptional earlier <persName>Philips</persName>, completely similar to others recorded from both lots A and B? I
                     can only believe that the admirably precise and careful <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> did not put them in
                     his final record of the hoard because he had good reason. Perhaps he, or his colleague Sidney Noe who frequently traveled to Greece, saw
                     the coins and noted differences; or, perhaps more likely, a subsequent communication, not preserved, was received from Empedocles. This
                     writer concludes that the latest coin in lots A and B of the Andritsaena Hoard was indeed lot A's <placeName>Babylon</placeName>
                     tetradrachm of ca. 316-315/4, and that <persName>Newell's</persName> original burial date of ca. 315 is probably correct.</p>

                     by <persName>Le Rider</persName> and definitely by Price. Tripolitsa's inclusion would make no difference, however, as its composition
                     is very similar to Andritsaena's and no coins are later than that hoard's.</p>

                     secured the larger portion of the following in Egypt." This statement in <persName>Newell's</persName> notes (italics mine) was not
                     cited in Zervos's article.</p>
                  <p>The distinguishing feature of Kuft is its multiplicity of punchmarks and countermarks, often several on one coin, and many unknown
                     elsewhere. <persName>Newell's</persName> list includes <hi rend="italic">only such coins.</hi> Nash, however, would include many
                     non-countermarked coins in modern collections on the basis of their patina or merely because they are from the same issues as known Kuft
                     coins, but this seems unwarranted. It is clear that <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> believed, not just on
                     his own, but <hi rend="italic">on the basis of what Dr. Davidson had told him</hi>, that all the hoard coins were punchmarked or
                     countermarked, or both.</p>
                  <p>In general, for the hoard's dating and its considerable significance for the Ptolemaic coinage, the exact composition of the hoard makes
                     little if any difference. But for our purposes here, it is significant that the A-torch coin listed by Nash is not in <persName>Newell's</persName> list. It is the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName>
                     <pb n="80"/> coin 457 in <persName>
                        <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi>
                     </persName>—but it bears no punchmarks or countermarks. It therefore would seem correct to consider it, along with the other non-mutilated
                     coins listed by Nash, as <hi rend="italic">not</hi> part of Kuft.</p>
                  <p>As stated above, <persName>
                        <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi>
                     </persName> follows Nash in its assignation of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName> holdings to the Kuft
                        hoard.<ref target="#PARTI-CH8-n40">40</ref> Among these <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName> "Kuft"
                     coins, I count 48 identified as coming from the Davidson 1881 donation. Ten of these, including the Λ-torch coin, bear no countermarks or
                     punches, leaving 38. This is a fair approximation of the 35 "Davidson '81" coins listed in <persName>Newell's</persName> manuscript AS
                     belonging to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>The hoard's latest non-Egyptian coins are of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>, to 312/11, and Ake, to 311/10. The
                     Egyptian component seems a few years later, but for group L the date of 311/10 is the significant one. Worth noting is Nash's redating of
                     the hoard's discovery from <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>'s 1875–80 to "in or just before 1875" (presumably from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName> coin 3036a, a Kuft coin donated in 1875). I follow her in dating the hoard to
                     1874–75.</p>

                     than ca. 320–318, the latest perhaps being Tarsus with Nike and monograms, cf. <persName>

                  <head>DISCUSSION</head>
                  <p>In general, the chronological help given by the hoards is disappointing. Only the first two hoards were clearly buried during <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s lifetime, and they are of limited value. The third hoard may also have
                     been interred before 323, but it again is of no help. Nevertheless, a few hoards provide clues, if not totally satisfactory evidenee, about
                     the dates of the various coin groups in the decade after <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s death. This
                     evidence will be discussed in the following chapter.</p>
                  <p>The burial dates of many of the hoards listed above depend on non-Macedonian issues whose exact times of striking are not precisely known.
                     Indeed, it is remarkable how very littte firm evidence there is for the dates of any of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s lifetime and early posthumous silver. The annual dates on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>'s
                     coins, together with the contents of the massive <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard, give the one fixed point. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>'s hoard coins of year 15, almost assuredly the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> year of
                     October 319 to October 318 B.C., provide a secure point of reference for most of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> mints operating at that time.</p>
                  <p>Ake's coins, too, in <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> must have been struck in 319/8, but was this mint really Ake or was it Tyre? At
                     this mint's year 1 antedated the coming of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> by some 14 years, did its
                     year start in a different month than that of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>—perhaps the Babylonian year
                     commencing in June? Price has made a convincing argument that historical considerations mean that year 1 at Ake could not have been 347/6,
                     as Newell believed, but rather 346/5. But it has also been persuasively argued by Lemaire that the mint of these coins was not Ake but
                     Tyre, in which case there is no difficutty in accepting a start in 347/6.<ref target="#PARTI-CH8-n60">60</ref>At either of these cities the
                     year would probably have started in June. Thus in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> hoard <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>'s latest coins (year 15) would have ended in October 318. If the second mint was Ake, coins of year 29 would have ended in
                     June 317, eight months later. If the second mint was Tyre, coins of year 29 would have ended in June 318, four months earlier than <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>'s. In neither case do their dates correspond exactly to those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>i but the difference is only a matter of months.</p>
                  <p>More serious is the dating of the important series ascribed to Babylon, which provides the latest componett in so many hoards. Waggoner's
                     unpublished thesis closety follows <persName>Newell's</persName>
                     <placeName>Babylon</placeName> dating in <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>
                     </hi>, and a published article by her treats in detail the large group of issues which end with those with the first use of the title <hi rend="bold">BA∑IΛEΩ∑.<ref target="#PARTI-CH8-n61">61</ref>
                     </hi> Here again her dating is extremely close to <persName>Newell's</persName>, and she assigns these issues to six years, 329/8 to
                     323/2, with the title introduced in 324/3–323/2. She has done a careful die study of an unusually large number of coins, with the obveree
                     dies used divisible by reverse linkage into six consecutive groups each joined to the next by only a few common obverses. There is no doubt
                     that her arrangement of dies and their groups is correct, but the conclusion that six groups of dies are to be equaeed with six calendar
                     years is highly questionable. Obvesee dies are retired when no longer usable. They are not arbitrarily discarded just because a new
                     calendar year starts.</p>
                  <p>A large number of symbols was used for this series, and they are used throughout, at first without and then with the titles and all are
                     closety obverse linked in each group. Price wrote that the series "has every aspect of a large-scale production over a relatively short
                     period of time." Waggoner counted 77 obverse dies in the <placeName>Babylon</placeName> series for her hypothesis of six years of
                     striking. This is a respectable number of DIES , and it approximates the average number in the Amphipolis groups: 879 known dies ÷ 12
                     groups = 73. Price, however, woudd date this entire <placeName>Babylon</placeName> series to ca. 325–323 B.C.,<ref target="#PARTI-CH8-n62">62</ref>when returning soldiers from the east received their pay. I agree with Price's analysis.</p>
                  <pb n="85"/>
                  <p>Price also suggests that the <placeName>Babylon</placeName> issues with <hi rend="bold">M</hi> and <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi> bearing
                     either <persName>Alexander's</persName> OR <persName>Philip</persName> III's name, which Newell and Waggoner both place after the
                        <placeName>Babylon</placeName> series just described, may not even belong to the same mint. There are no die links, and there are
                     great dissimilarities of style. Price's suggestions as to specific mints are intriguing but not especially relevant here. The important
                     thing is that separating these <hi rend="bold">M-ΛY</hi> coins from the series in question could well bring that series, culminating in
                     coins with the title, down a year or two. Thus there rcmains considerable uncertainty about the attribution and precise dating of the
                     issues usually assigned to <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, but at the moment there seems no alternative to following, with some caution,
                     Waggoner's attributions and dating as modified by Price.</p>
                  <p>Then there is the extremely large issue of Aradus with the city monogram <graphic url="NS21_sym36.jpg"/> and caduceus (<persName>
                        <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi>
                     </persName> 3332), the last Aradus issue in <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>, and the last in Price's series of issues which he assigns to
                     ca. 328–320 B.C. One should not aigue from such small samples, but in the absence of other indications it is at least interesting to note
                     that no such coins were present in the Commerce 1993 hoard, buried ca. 323, but that a drachm with these markings was included in the ca.
                     322 Near East 1993 hoard. The huge issue, however, could well have continued for several years after 323/322. Price also notes an obverse
                     link with an issue in the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip III</persName> which is normally assigned
                     to Marathus. Questions of attribution and more precise dating thus arise, which one hopes some future thorough study of the Aradus mint
                     will resolve. For now, it is impossible to be confident of the dates of this issue, which again could be crucial in estimating the burial
                     date of several of the hoards.</p>

                  <p>In November 333 <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> fought and won the second of the three decisive
                     battles in his conquest of the Persian Empire. At Issus in southern Cilicia he routed the Great King, captured a major treasure, the king's
                     war chest, and effectively took control of the Persian Empire. Shortly before the battle, in the late fall of 333, he had acquired nearby
                     Tarsus, a major administrative center of the empire.</p>
                  <p>At Tarsus, before <persName>Alexander's</persName> arrival, Persian satraps had struck coinage in their names depicting several
                     variations of a seated figure of Baal or, specifically, the Baal of Tarsus, Baaltars. The two commonest varieties are shown here on Plate
                     18, <hi rend="bold">A–B</hi>. These have long been recognized as the immediate predecessors of the seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> shown on the earliest <persName>Alexanders</persName> struck at Tarsus (Plate 18, <hi rend="bold">C</hi>). The gods' postures are identical, stiff and archaizing, not the normal classical style of the late fourth century.
                     Their hair is rolled at the back (this can be seen on Baal only on Plate 18, <hi rend="bold">A</hi>, where his head is shown in profile).
                     Their scepters are shown with dotted shafts and with a floral ornament at the top, the "flowering scepter." A row of dots immediately under
                     the throne seat probably indicates some sort of decoration on the seat. The lowest protuberances on the throne legs show the so-called
                     "bell-covers," which seem to be circles of parallel hanging leaves over these two lowest and largest bell-shaped protuberances. Finally,
                     both gods' feet rest on footstools, which are depicted in an identical rather sketchy fashion as a <pb n="87"/> single slanting line
                     supported only at the right by a support resembling an inverted horseshoe, or the letter O. That <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                     <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> at Tarsus derived from the Baal of Tarsus was recognized by scholars before

                  <p>The crucial question is whether the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
                     <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> derived in turn from the Tarsiote Zeus. In the early groups at Amphipolis, the
                     general aspect of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> with his stiff posture is close to that of the Tarsiote
                     deities, but on the typical coins of, e.g., Plate <hi rend="bold">1</hi>, from <hi rend="bold">2</hi> onward, <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> has long, not rolled, hair; his scepter terminates in a ball, not a floral ornament; there are no
                     dots immediately below the throne seat; there are no bell-covers on the lower protuberances of the throne legs; and there is a dotted
                     exergue line, but no footstool.</p>
                  <p>Orestes Zervos has, however, recently revived an old thesis that the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
                     <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> did indeed derive from the Tarsiote Zeus. He has discussed a number of elements
                     at Macedon which he believes slow the influence and hence the priority of the Tarsiote <persName>Alexanders</persName>. These are five
                     : the frontal extended hand of Zeus, his twisted torso, his stiffly parallel legs, the stylized row of drapery at his waist, and the throne
                     with its bell-covers. None of these, except the probable presence of bell-covers on a few very early <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
                     coins, seem particularly convincing to the present author, and none at all convinced <persName>Martin Price</persName>, that leading
                     authority on the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage<hi rend="bold">.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n6">

                  </p>
                  <p>But the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> collection at the <placeName>American Numismatic
                        Society,</placeName> largely that of E. T. Newell, is extraordinary. Here there are indeed a number of Tarsiote iconographical details
                     present on what seem to be among the very earliest coins struck at <placeName>Amphipolis.</placeName> These details appear, although no
                     more than one or two on a given die, on coins often struck at the same time (i.e., from the same obverse die) and, after their first brief
                     and often awkwardly executed occurrences, they drop out, not to return until much later in the coinage.</p>
                  <p>Plate 18, <hi rend="bold">D</hi>, is a silver stater of Perdiccas III, brother and predecessor of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>, and Plate 18, <hi rend="bold">E</hi>, is a didrachm of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>. Note in particular the double row of locks at Heracles' brow, so unlike the single row of
                     thick, snail-like curls of virtually all early <persName>Alexanders</persName> from this mint. Such a double row of locks is found on
                     only three dies in this <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage, all in group A, and one might well
                     conclude that these <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> dies were early ones. The two coins <hi rend="bold">450–51</hi> are from one of these obverses. These two coins are also highly unusual in that their reverses are two of only
                     five known where the prow symbol faces right rather than left. On <persName>Philip's</persName> immediately prior (or contemporary ?)
                     coins the prow always faced right, the natural and graceful orientation because the reverse type of the horse and rider faced right, e.g.,
                     Plate 18, <hi rend="bold">F</hi>. On <persName>Alexander's</persName> coins, however, the orientation is awkward, with the prow rather
                     disconcertingly about to sail right into Zeus. Again, one might well conclude that these reverses with prow right were early ones. Thus,
                     both obverse and reverse indications are that the two coins <hi rend="bold">450–51</hi> were indeed among the very first struck at
                     Amphipolis —and both reverses show <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> holding a flowering scepter. Further, the
                     second coin appears to have bell-covers on the throne legs. The coin is worn, so that the divisions between the hanging leaves are lost,
                     but the scalloped lower edges of the extra-large bottom protuberances do show an attempt at depicting bell-covers.</p>
                  <p>The remaining three reverses with the prow symbol facing right all occur with a second obverse die (<hi rend="bold">452–54</hi>). This
                     obverse die again is one of those which have a double row of curls at Heracles' brow. On <hi rend="bold">452–53</hi> there appear to be
                     bell-covers, and on <hi rend="bold">453</hi> also a probable floral ornament atop the scepter (largely off flan). On <hi rend="bold">454</hi> there occurs another Tarsiote feature not discussed by Zervos in his publication, but one which he suggested I look for, the
                     row of dots immediately below the throne seat. This is a detail which one must admit is not striking, but it occurs on, at most, three or
                     four dies, all in group A.</p>
                  <pb n="88"/>
                  <p>Also from the obverse die of <hi rend="bold">452–54</hi> is a coin of another group A issue, A4, with fulmen (<hi rend="bold">455</hi>).
                     Its reverse shows Zeus's feet resting on a clear footstool on the Tarsiote model, a slanting line supported at one end only.</p>
                  <p>The four coins <hi rend="bold">456–59</hi> have the prow symbol facing in its usual direction, left. Coins <hi rend="bold">456</hi> and <hi rend="bold">457</hi> are from different obverse dies, but from the same reverse with a footstool (clearer on <hi rend="bold">456</hi>
                     than <hi rend="bold">457</hi>). Three, <hi rend="bold">457–59</hi>, are from the same obverse die, and <hi rend="bold">458</hi> has the row
                     of dots immediately under the throne seat, while <hi rend="bold">459</hi> has a flowering scepter.</p>
                  <p>Four more coins, <hi rend="bold">460–63</hi>, have a similar prow symbol. The first two are from the same reverse, with flowering scepter
                     (clearer on <hi rend="bold">460</hi> than <hi rend="bold">461</hi>), while <hi rend="bold">461–63</hi> are from the same obverse die. There
                     is a footstool on <hi rend="bold">462</hi>, while <hi rend="bold">463</hi> has bell-covers on the throne legs.</p>
                  <p>The double heads (A3), appear on <hi rend="bold">464</hi>, with flowering scepter, dots below the throne seat, and a footstool which is
                     awkwardly executed, being cut directly over the exergue line.</p>
                  <p>A further feature which suggests that these coins with eastern details are contemporary with each other is the incidence in group A of the
                     letter-form <graphic url="NS21_sym37.jpg"/> instead of <graphic url="NS21_sym38.jpg"/> Of the some 145–50 reverses known to me in A, only
                     11 have <graphic url="NS21_sym37.jpg"/> These are concentrated in the early reverses, five of which are illustrated here (<hi rend="bold">450, 451, 456, 459,</hi> and <hi rend="bold">465,</hi> the last also with flowering scepter). Although the form <graphic url="NS21_sym37.jpg"/> is standard on the Tarsiote coinage, it cannot be claimed as a uniquely eastern feature at Amphipolis, and is
                     mentioned merely as one more bit of evidence that these Amphipolis coins with eastern features were struck at the same time.</p>
                  <p>There are a few possible other examples of bell-covers in group A, and a handful of other flowering scepters, many poorly executed as in
                     the foregoing examples, but none of either in any of groups B through E. Nor are dots under the throne seat or bell-covers found in these
                     groups. Two dies with footstools are known in group B, which as discussed earlier may have at least in part overlapped group A. Perhaps
                     significantly one of these occurs on a coin of B7 with grapes (<hi rend="bold">16</hi>), one of whose reverse dies was recut to become a
                     reverse of group A.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n7">
                        <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                     </ref> The other is on a coin of B5, with Attic helmet.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n8">
                        <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                     </ref> It is a fair assumption that these two reverse dies also were cut rather early in the coinage.</p>
                  <p>In groups C and D there seem to be no instances whatever of any of the Tarsiote iconographical details just discussed. Newell did mention a
                     footstool on a coin of C's Pegasus forepart issue (C5), but a thorough search has not succeeded in locating such a coin.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n9">
                        <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                     </ref> Nor do there seem to be any Tarsiote details present in the huge group E, save for one die with footstool,<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n10">
                        <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                     </ref> and this is easily understood as a precursor of the frequent Tarsiote or eastern details which reappear from group F onward. A
                     possible explanation for this later recurrence will be found below.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n11">
                        <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                     </ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Tarsiote details occur <hi rend="italic">early</hi> at Amphipolis. They appear, even if only one or two on a given die, on coins
                     struck <hi rend="italic">at the same time</hi> because linked by common obverse dies. They are often <hi rend="italic">poorly
                     executed</hi>, as if imperfectly understood. Finally, very shortly after their early appearances they <hi rend="italic">drop out</hi>. Even
                     though many of them—e.g., the flowering scepter and the footstool—are well known to Greek art on the mainland before <persName>Alexander's</persName> time, the fact that these early, concurrent, awkwardly executed, fleeting details are precisely those of the
                     Tarsiote <pb n="89"/> coins can hardly be coincidence. There seems no possible way to explain these iconographic details on these few early
                     Amphipolis coins other than by their makers having already seen the Tarsiote tetradrachms (or perhaps other eastern ones, for the
                     contemporary or slightly later coinages of many mints in the east strongly resembled the Tarsiote strikings). The conclusion must be that
                     the Amphipolis silver coinage was initiated only after that of Tarsus, and that therefore <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                     <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> coinage can have started at the earliest only extremely late in 333 B.C., or more probably in 332.</p>
                  <p>Such a starting date is in many ways more satisfactory from a historical point of view than is 336 B.C., immediately upon <persName>Alexander's</persName> accession. Regardless of what numismatists may think today, one may question whether reform of the
                     coinage really was one of the first things <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> thought to do when suddenly
                     propelled to the throne. Rather, a coinage whose types would be understandable throughout a newly secured empire—and, perhaps more
                     important, whose standard would be universally acceptable there—would seem to have been needed only after the decisive battle of Issus in
                     November 333. Further, it was shortly after Issus that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> issued his
                     famous manifesto to Darius, who had written offering friendship and alliance.<persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> replied that he had defeated in battle first the king's generals and now the Great King himself, and that he was now
                     by God's help master of Darius's country and of everything Darius possessed: they were not equals and in future any communication from
                     Darius should be addressed to him as lord of all Asia.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n12">

                     </ref> For those who try to understand <persName>Alexander's</persName> coinage on the shaky and uncertain basis of "what <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have done," here is an occasion which surely must be as psychologically satisfactory as his accession for the
                     introduction of the young king's own coinage.</p>
                  <p>But the usual question here, given this later starting date, is what <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     did for money from the time of his invasion of Asia in mid–334 and the initiation of his silver coinage ca. 332. The continuance of his
                     father's coinage in both gold and silver could well have been sufficient so long as he was at home. But, although <persName>Philip's</persName> gold on the Attic standard was acceptable everywhere, his silver on the parochial <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
                     standard was not and its almost total absence from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> hoards is striking.
                     One must assume that some combination of prepayment to the troops before departure, promise of pay on return, <persName>Philip's</persName> gold taken along with the invading army, and, of course, requisitioning and looting during the campaign sufficed until
                        <persName>Alexander's</persName> own silver coinage was instituted. That even before Issus <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was sending cash to Macedonia rather than receiving it from home is shown by Curtius's
                     statements that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> sent money back to Antipater at least twice in early
                     333. <ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n13">
                        <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                     </ref> It thus does not seem at all clear that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> needed his own silver
                     coinage before 332.</p>
                  <p>But if <placeName>Macedonian Alexanders</placeName> appeared only after Issus, is it necessary to conclude that they did so promptly,
                     perhaps early in 332 ? The first question is how long into his reign <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                     continued striking his father's silver. <persName>Le Rider</persName> suggested bringing <persName>Philip's</persName> silver
                     down to ca. 328, by analogy with <persName>Philip's</persName> gold, to which he gave a terminus ante quem of ca. 329/8 because of the
                        <persName>Corinth</persName> hoard, then believed buried ca. 328.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n14">

                  <p>Second, we do not know the temporal relationship of the two kings' groups of strikings employing the same markings of prow, stern, and
                     double heads.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n16">

                  <p>The hoard evidence is a bit contradictory and does not help date the start of the coinage. There are but two useful lifetime hoards from
                     the Greek mainland, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyparissia">Kyparissia</placeName> and <placeName>Mageira</placeName> (the little
                        <placeName>Nemea</placeName> hoard is dated by its group D coin). <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyparissia">Kyparissia</placeName>,
                     containing groups A through D, was dated by Newell to ca. 327. Even if the hoard was buried promptly by 327, there is still ample time
                     before that date for four groups if the coinage started in 332, or even perhaps a bit later, the more especially if, as now seems probable,
                     groups A and B and perhaps also C and D overlapped somewhat.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n18">

                     Tarsus.</p>
                  <p>When would cash have been required in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> We know from the sources that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> made numerous recruiting efforts on the mainland, starting even before 332. The only known domestic occasion which
                     would have required coin was Antipater's suppression of the Spartan rebellion under Agis in 331. But the wide acceptability of <persName>Philip's</persName> money in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> and the north means that <persName>Alexander's</persName> own money was not necessarily required even then. Nevertheless, late 333–332, when the coinage started
                     in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>, is perhaps as good a guess as any for the introduction in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> of <persName>Alexander's</persName> Attic tetradrachms—but it is still only a

                  <p>Newell dated group E to ca. 328 and 327 B.C. Why should there have been such a tremendous outpouring in those years, when apparently
                     affairs in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>
                     were quiet, and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was as far from home as he would ever be ? What need

                  <p>Positing a revised starting date for the coinage of 332 instead of mid–336, and spreading the estimated dies out evenly (which is not in
                     any case good practice), one arrives at a date for group E from the end of 329 to the end of 325.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n23">

                  <p>I would propose here a second major shift in <persName>Newell's</persName> chronology, assigning group E to approximately the years

                     mercenaries, and others, who were sent home in large numbers starting in 325, and who would have been fully paid only upon arrival at
                        home.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n24">

                  <p>It is in group E that this change appears. Obverse linked to one of its eagle reverse drachm issues are drachms with the imperial seated

                     would be the carrying home of some of these <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>tic drachms by returning <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> veterans, and this would have been more likely to occur from 325 on than in 328 or 327.</p>
                  <p>An influx of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>tic drachms would also explain why, after a very few more drachms (all
                     also with <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> reverses) were struck in group F, all production of small silver
                     denominations ceased for some years. No small coins at all are known in groups G, H, and I. Small coins with <persName>Philip
                        II's</persName> types were struck during K and J, probably for the special purpose of facilitating exchange between <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms and the newly reissued Philip tetradrachms on the old <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> standard. Following these small Philips, no small coins are known at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n27">

                  </p>
                  <p>Long ago, Newell noted two changes in the reverses of groups E and F, changes which he quite rightly concluded served to connect these two
                     groups, but to which he apparently attached no other significance.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n28">
                        <hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                     </ref> First is the exergual line. In groups A through D, as he observed, the line was almost invariably present and dotted (<hi rend="bold">1-39</hi>). The same depiction continued in group E, but with a few rare exceptions. On a handful of coins with bucranium
                     and pentagram the exergue was set off simply by a straight line (e.g., <hi rend="bold">48</hi>).<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n29">
                        <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                     </ref> Further, the bucranium symbol is one of the <pb n="92"/> three found with the new Zeus-reverse drachms to which the pentagram issue
                     is obverse linked. These two issues thus apparently came at least in part rather late in group E. Then, in group F, the exergue line is
                     either dotted <hi rend="bold">(52),</hi> or plain <hi rend="bold">(53),</hi> or omitted altogether (e.g. <hi rend="bold">50, 55).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Second is the footstool. As discussed earlier, on four reverses of group A and two of group B, Zeus's feet rest on a footstool which is
                     depicted exactly as on the initial <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> strikings from Tarsus. I have found
                     no footstools at all in groups C or D,<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n30">
                        <hi rend="sup">30</hi>
                     </ref> and only one in the large group E, in the same seemingly rather late bucranium issue (<hi rend="bold">48</hi>). But in group F
                     footstools are common, either on the Tarsiote model of groups A and B with a slanting line supported only at the right by a sort of
                     inverted horseshoe (<hi rend="bold">54</hi>), or portrayed, as Newell again noted, by "a short straight line (not to be confounded with an
                     exergual line)" (<hi rend="bold">51, 56</hi>).<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n31">
                        <hi rend="sup">31</hi>
                     </ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there are other occasional innovations in group F of which Newell undoubtedly was aware but did not discuss because not relevant to the
                     association of group F with group E. These are bell-covers on the throne legs <hi rend="bold">(51),</hi> the folds of Zeus's robe between
                     his legs paired in groups of two as on Tarsiote coins <hi rend="bold">(55,</hi> cf. Plate 18, <hi rend="bold">A-C),</hi> and even Zeus's
                     hair sometimes shown rolled at the back as on Tarsiote and many other eastern <persName>Alexanders</persName>
                     <hi rend="bold">(51, 55,</hi> cf. Plate 18, <hi rend="bold">B-C).</hi> The bell-covers are known earlier at this mint only in group A and
                     the paired folds and rolled hair have not previously occurred in any <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> group. All the innovations
                     discussed tend to occur together, not all on any one die, but often two or three, or more, on a given die. Again, may this be a result of
                     another influx of eastern coins? Although recruiting of troops back in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> is
                     known to have occurred often enough during <persName>Alexander's</persName> absence in the east, and although <persName>Alexanders</persName> from the east struck from 332 to ca. 323 are found in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> proper, perhaps the most likely time for a major influx
                     which would have affected the iconography at the mint would be in the years following ca. 325, when so many soldiers returned home. If this
                     imported eastern money was responsible for the eastern details present on group F, it is another argument for the dating of groups E and F
                     to approximately 325–323 B.C.</p>
                  <p>Only after the above commentary on groups E-F was completed did the Commerce 1993 tetradrachm hoard appear (hoard 4 in the preceding
                     chapter, full publication in Appendix 1 below). There seems no need to date this hoard later than ca. 323 or 322. On <persName>Newell's</persName> chronology groups F and G and half of the large group H would all have been struck by 323 (and all of H by 322). The
                     hoard's latest <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> coins, however, were of group E, many die linked. Although we cannot be confident that
                     we know the complete hoard, the absence of F, G, and H in this deposit supports a lower chronology than <persName>Newell's</persName>.</p>

                     <persName>Alexanders</persName> end with group G, so their burial dates provide a terminus ante quem for G. The latest coins in <placeName>Babylon</placeName> 1973 and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> 1968 <hi rend="italic">(IGCH</hi> 1440), issues of the mint of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, were assigned by Waggoner to 322 B.C.. These two hoards,
                     then, present no problem for dating the beginning of group G to late 323 or even early 322.</p>
                  <p>Lebanon 1985, however, requires more examination. It, like <placeName>Babylon</placeName> 1973 and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> 1968, contained Aradus coins with caduceus which may well have been struck as late as or
                     later than 322, but this large issue has never been subjected to a thorough study. The hoard's latest fairly firmly dated issue, one of
                        <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, is the first of that mint to bear the title BA∑IΛEΩ∑ just as group G was the first at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> with the title. <persName>Newell's</persName> chronology for <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>,
                        <pb n="93"/> described earlier, put the introduction of the title there to the year 325. But he himself said that his dates could be off
                     by a year or two, and it seems that his attempt to assign the various groups to particular years (and each to either precisely one or two
                     years) was based on the premise that the coinage was produced fairly evenly over the years. One must wonder if this dating, with <persName>Newell's</persName> well-deserved prestige behind it, has not come to be the basis for our belief in when the title was
                     introduced at all, or at least many, mints.</p>
                  <p>Newell in <hi rend="italic">
                        <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>

                     </ref> Unfortunately we again have no insight into his thinking, but could it have been influenced by his dating for <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>? He dated the title's introduction at Tarsus partly on the basis of his belief that it came in at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> and at <placeName>Babylon</placeName> "about a year or so previous to the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, or between 325 and 324 B.C."<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n34">

                     </ref> Waggoner has followed his <placeName>Babylon</placeName> dating extremely closely, but dates these earliest coins with the title

                     above that K and J were struck concurrently, and in any case there would have seemed no need to devote a full year to the minute group K. J

                     contemporary K and J, and of the immediately preceding group I. Some 885 obverse dies are estimated to have been used in the production of
                     groups A through K/J. Groups K/J used an estimated 43 obverses, hence their estimated percentage of total production to that point was
                     43÷885, or 4.9%. The following table shows the hoards which contained ten or more identifiable coins of groups A through K/J, and their
                     percentages of groups I and K/J.</p>
                  <p>The proportions of group I vary widely, both more and less than its percentage (70÷885 = 7.9%) of the total production. But only two of the
                     ten hoards (<placeName>Aleppo</placeName> and <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>) contained less than the estimated percentage of groups
                     K/J, and only <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> contained considerably less—almost exactly half its proportional amount. Newell was well
                     aware of the low representation of I and K/J, "because of the apparently general law observable in coin hoards that, for perfectly natural
                     reasons, the issues contemporary with the burial are usually comparatively scantily represented. ... Also, certain material at the writer's
                     disposal would tend to show that groups J and K, and probably also I, were originally much larger than our find would seem to

                     <p>The Meydancikkale, Cilicia, 1980 hoard was published by A. <persName>Davesne</persName> and G. <persName>Le Rider</persName>,
                           <hi rend="italic">Le Trétsor de Meydancikkale</hi> (Paris, 1989). Found in excavations, this enormous hoard contained 5,215 coins.
                        There were 2,554 <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <persName>Philip II</persName>I, with 419

                        Λ-torch, 214 Λ-torch, and 48 later. The hoard, buried ca. 240–235, is far too late to be of any chronological value to us, but is listed
                        in Table 18 because its size provides a good example of the proportion of group K/J coins to others.</p>

                     i.e., between the date of <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>'s deposit and Cassander's firm assumption of power in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n38">
                        <hi rend="sup">38</hi>
                     </ref> The hoard evidence for the start of group L, although hardly conclusive, seems however to suggest a starting date for group L
                     somewhat later than 318.</p>
                  <p>First, the groups after L are the very small ones with primary markings of Λ-bucranium, <graphic url="NS21_sym17.jpg"/>-bucranium, and
                        <graphic url="NS21_sym17.jpg"/>-torch, and the enormous one with Λ-torch. There is no hoard evidence for the absolute date of the
                     introduction of the Λ-bucranium, <graphic url="NS21_sym17.jpg"/>-bucranium, or <graphic url="NS21_sym17.jpg"/>-torch groups,<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n39">
                        <hi rend="sup">39</hi>
                     </ref> but the earliest possible appearance of the Λ-torch group is in the Unknown Provenance ca. 1990 hoard, buried perhaps ca. 308 B.C.,
                     although the interpretation of this hoard is problematical. The Λ-torch group was certainly in circulation a few years later, however, for
                     five hoards of ca. 305–300 include such coins.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n40">
                        <hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                     </ref> These groups after L are mentioned because if Λ-torch began to <pb n="95"/> be used in ca. 308-305, there is ample time before that
                     for group L and the Λ-bucranium and Λ-torch groups even if group L started several years after 318.</p>
                  <p>Second, two hoards buried shortly after <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> also contain our mint's coins only through groups K/J, with no
                     examples of the very large group L, suggesting that L was not yet in circulation. They are Akçakale 1958, which was buried ca. 317–316, and
                     Andritsaena 1923, whose burial date, despite the doubts expressed in <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>, seems to have been ca. 316-315.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n41">
                        <hi rend="sup">41</hi>
                     </ref> These two hoards contained, respectively, 26 and 33 coins of groups A through K/J, so that the absence of the large group L supports
                     a proposed starting date for group L a few years after 318.</p>
                  <p>Until recently there seemed to be one contradictory bit of hoard evidence for the beginning of group L, the Sinan Pascha 1919 Hoard of
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <persName>Philip II</persName>I drachms, whose burial date
                     of 317-316 seems quite firm. The hoard contained one drachm with <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> as its sole marking, an issue which had
                     usually been considered as belonging with group L, where the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> is the constant primary marking. The issue's
                     appearance in the new Near East 1993 drachm hoard,<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n42">
                        <hi rend="sup">42</hi>
                     </ref> however, buried a few years earlier, ca. 322 or 321, together with iconographical evidence, places the <graphic url="NS21_sym1.jpg"/> drachms in group E or group F. Thus Sinan Pascha no longer can be understood to show that group L was introduced prior to its burial ca.
                     317-316.</p>
                  <p>All the hoard evidence, then, seems to suggest, even if it does not prove, that group L was introduced only a few years after the burial of
                     the great <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard, perhaps in ca. 316 or 315.</p>

                  <p>As discussed in Chapters 4-7, reissued tetradrachms and smaller coins with <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                     II</persName>'s types and name (Philip groups 1-8) were struck parallel with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups K and J, and some may possibly have been struck in parallel with the earlier <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group I. The tetradrachms (Philip group 9) then continued parallel to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group L. Succeeding Philip groups paralleled succeeding <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups, until perhaps 294-290 B.C. when Demetrius Poliorcetes assumed
                     power in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>. Because these Philip reissues lasted so long, much later than
                        <persName>Philip II</persName>I's death, it is most unlikely that their issue had anything to do with that unfortunate monarch. Had
                     any coinage at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> been intended to support him, it surely would have been struck in his own name—but no
                     such coinage is known.</p>
                  <p>By <persName>Newell's</persName> chronology, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> group I was struck
                     ca. 322-321 B.C., by my chronology, perhaps 320-319. Groups K and J on <persName>Newell's</persName> chronology would have been issued
                     ca. 320-318, by mine, perhaps 318-317. My best estimate of when these Philip reissues started is, then, ca. 320 or 319 B.C. Newell
                     suggested that they were reissued because of the popularity of <persName>Philip's</persName> coinage in the Balkans to the north,
                     where the hoards show that they circulated widely. Georges <persName>Le Rider</persName> has recently put forth another explanation:
                     the fiscal advantage of a double coinage to the ruling parties in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n43">

                  <p>The Troxell dates are extremely approximate and rough, e.g., groups A-D may not have occupied the full span of 332 to 326, and the output
                     of G-K/J was probably heavier at the outset than at the end of these groups' striking. Nevertheless, the output at various periods seems to
                     make far more sense historically than does the rate of striking under <persName>Newell's</persName> chronology.</p>
                  <p>The heaviest striking, as mentioned above, would have come not in 328 and 327 when <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was at his greatest distance ever from home and when there was no apparent need for a great deal of coinage there, but
                     from 325 onward when back payment for many years of service was due to returning troops.</p>
                  <p>This lowered chronology also produces one rather satisfactory result. The reason for the introduction of the title <hi rend="bold">BA∑IΛEΩ∑</hi> has never been adequately explained. Newell in <placeName>
                        <hi rend="italic">Tarsos</hi>
                     </placeName>, only after he had already decided upon 324 as its date of introduction there, ventured the suggestion that it was due to <persName>Alexander's</persName> conquest of India and the finalization of his conquest of all the Great King's domains.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n45">
                        <hi rend="sup">45</hi>
                     </ref> But if there has ever been any attempt to explain why the title was dropped ca. 318-315, at least at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, I have missed it.</p>
                  <p>An obvious explanation is that the inscription <hi rend="bold">BA∑IΛEΩ∑ A9BE≡AN∆POY</hi> was intended to refer not to the great <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> but to his young son <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV. After <persName>Alexander's</persName> death his generals arrived at an uneasy truce leaving the succession
                     to his mentally defective brother <pb n="97"/> Arrhidaeus, renamed <persName>Philip II</persName>I, and to <persName>Alexander's</persName> unborn child by Roxane, should the child turn out to be a male. It did, and he became <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV. These two unfortunate individuals became the wards of one after the other of the
                     powerful successors, but nominally they were the joint Kings of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, referred
                     to in the sources as of βασ ιλεĩς. <persName>Philip II</persName>I's coinage, struck at a number of mints but, remarkably, never at
                        <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, often uses the title <hi rend="bold">BA∑IΛEΩ∑,</hi> and so the title would be perfectly
                     appropriate should the reference be to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV. Antipater, an old companion
                     of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>, had been left as regent in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> III, and, although
                        <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> may have been disaffected with him shortly before he (<persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>) died, still Antipater would have had every reason to emphasize the
                     continuance of the royal house.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, one eminent numismatist has explained why the title at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>
                     <hi rend="italic">must</hi> refer to the young boy because <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> would never
                     have used the title on the mainland:</p>
                  <q>It is evident that throughout his lifetime <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> contented himself with the
                     modest legend A9BE≡AN∆POY. On the coins especially intended for use in the West it would have been far from politic for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to display a title so abhorrent to the Greek mind. By force of arms and circumstances
                     his undoubtedly was the hegemony over Hellas and the Greeks, but he understood their character too well to advertise the fact boldly on
                     what he intended should be a national coinage....After his death, however.... the legends BA∑IΛEΩ∑ (Ф ıΛππОγ and <hi rend="bold">BA∑IΛEΩ∑</hi>
                     <hi rend="bold">A9BE≡AN∆POY</hi> were intended to indicate that these kings were the rightful successors....</q>
                  <p>This strong statement was made by Newell himself in <hi rend="italic">Reattribution</hi>
                     <ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n46">
                        <hi rend="sup">46</hi>
                     </ref> when the coinage's dates were believed to be later than he subsequently demonstrated. It is a pleasure, although perhaps a rather
                     perverse one, to quote that great numismatist in support of my own thesis.</p>
                  <p>As for the explanation of why the title was subsequently dropped at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, it seems understandable in the
                     light of events in 317-316. Olympias, in brief control of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> in the fall of
                     317, assassinated <persName>Philip II</persName>I and his young wife Eurydice and put to death many of Cassander's supporters.
                     Cassander, returning from the Peloponnese, besieged her and her forces in Pydna, finally defeating her in 316 and arranging her death. He
                     then, according to Diodorus Siculus, married into the royal family, espousing Thessalonice, <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>'s daughter and <persName>Alexander's</persName> half-sister, and founded Cassandreia, named after himself.
                     Cassander also, according to Diodorus Siculus,</p>
                  <q>... had determined to do away with <persName>Alexander's</persName> son ... so that there might be no successor to the kingdom; but
                     for the present, since he wished to observe what the common people would say about the slaying of Olympias ... he placed Roxane and the
                     child in custody, transferring them to the citadel of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, in command of which he placed Glaucias, one of
                     his most trusted henchmen. Also he took away the pages who, according to custom, were being brought up as companions of the boy, and he
                     ordered that he should no longer have royal treatment but only such as was proper for any ordinary person of private station. After this,
                     already conducting himself as a king in administering the affairs of the realm, he buried Eurydice and Philip. ...<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n47">
                        <hi rend="sup">47</hi>
                     </ref>
                  </q>
                  <p>This may be the explanation for the removal of the title: Cassander wished it no longer to be understood as legitimizing the young <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV, for he was now allied by marriage to the great <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and the royal house, and felt secure to pursue his own ambitions.</p>
                  <p>A modern view, most recently argued by Hammond and Walbank, holds that Diodorus's source Hieronymus was repeating propaganda favorable to
                     Cassander's enemy Antigonus,<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n48">
                        <hi rend="sup">48</hi>
                     </ref> and <pb n="98"/> that Cassander was not acting in an inimical fashion towards <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV. One must agree, certainly, that Cassander, who had been appointed administrator by <persName>Philip
                        II</persName>I and Eurydice, acted appropriately in burying them: after all, who else was there to do so ? At the same time, though, they
                     also discredit Diodorus's statement about the removal of the pages: "In fact the Royal Pages, being recruited at the age of fourteen, were
                     too old to be associated with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV, who was only six or seven." But
                     Diodorus's actual words are that Cassander (άπέσπασε δ έκί тоύς πα ĩδαζ σᴜᴠτρ φεσθαı<hi rend="bold">.</hi> This could as easily simply
                     refer to some suitable agemates as schoolmates or companions such as the heir to the throne would surely be provided with, rather than the
                     "Royal Pages," well-born teenage attendants on the reigning king. Confinement to the citadel is explained as simply safeguarding the young
                     boy's person, but such insulation from affairs would not be the normal thing for an heir truly expected to inherit the throne.</p>
                  <p>Hammond and Walbank also discredit Diodorus's statement that Cassander had already made up his mind to do away with the young <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and his mother, saying "that happened six years later!" It strains
                     belief, however, to think that Cassander intended to stand aside quietly and relinquish power when his young charge should come of age.
                     Certainly Cassander later did indeed do away with both the boy and his mother.</p>
                  <p>In any case, whatever his behavior towards the young <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV, Cassander was
                     now firmly in control of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and would have had every reason to discontinue a
                     practice which could be seen as promoting the interests of his ward. This, I believe, is the explanation for the dropping of the title ca.
                     316 B.C.: the coinage was no longer to be understood as that of the young <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV, but as continuing that of the great <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, whose
                     successor Cassander planned—and was—to be.</p>
                  <p>In 1991 I rashly suggested that the title on <persName>Alexander's</persName> coins, no matter where struck, might have appeared only
                     after his death,<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n49">
                        <hi rend="sup">49</hi>
                     </ref> but hoard evidence seems to show that the title was adopted at a number of mints to the east probably shortly before 323, and almost
                     certainly before it appeared at <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>.<ref target="#PARTI-CH9-n50">
                        <hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                     </ref> In addition, the title was not discontinued at every mint at the same time: at <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, for instance, it
                     apparently persisted until the end of its <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage, ca. 305 B.C. And,
                     of course, many mints never used the title at all. The arguments above, therefore, refer only to the mint identified as <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>.</p>

            <p>This study describes in detail only an early subgroup of the common <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> staters
               with symbols of cantharus, trident head, or fulmen. At the <placeName>American Numismatic Society,</placeName> gold with these markings has
               been traditionally assigned to <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, while elsewhere it has sometimes been given to Pella. No decisive evidence
               exists for either attribution, and even whether all the gold so marked emanated from a single mint seems quite uncertain. All gold coins with
               cantharus, trident, or fulmen as well as those with Boeotian (?) shield are therefore here assigned, as in <hi rend="italic">

                  this and succeeding chapters be called simply trident; and the shield simply shield. The results, while perhaps interesting statistically,
                  have not as yet led to any conclusions about either chronology or attribution to specific mints, with the exception of what turned out to be a
                  distinct group of staters with the first three symbols (cantharus, trident, and fulmen), the group that is published here.</p>
               <p>This distinct group consists of two series. Series 1 has only two reverse symbols, cantharus or trident. It appears to be the immediate
                  predecessor of series 2, which is a large, heavily die linked series starting with cantharus and trident and adding the fulmen later. Nothing
                  at all approaching this group's coherence is found anywhere else among the more numerous other staters bearing these symbols, and both the
                  details of its iconography and its hoard appearances set it off from the mass of those other such staters.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n2">

               <p>Table 19 gives the numbers of coins and obverse dies found for the various denominations and symbols and the obverse links discovered between
                  different reverse symbols.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> As might be expected, the survival rate is better for the rarer denominations (distaters, 6.41 coins per obverse die, and quarter
                  staters, 5.50 per obverse, as against 3.63 and 3.05, or 3.21 overall, for the staters). What is striking in Table 19, however, is the
                  difference in the number of die links between symbols that the two stater groups contain. The staters published here have 14 such links for 30
                  obverse dies, a ratio of 0.47; the remaining staters have but 5 such links for 78 obverse dies, a ratio of only 0.06. Other differences
                  between the two stater groups are also evident and will be discussed following the catalogue.</p>
               <p>An unexpected result of this study has been that many of the staters Newell in 1918 assigned to Tarsus in his series I, ca. 333-227 B.C.,<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                        die linked section of series 2, from 07 through 022, is surely possible, but the overall arrangement seems justified.</p>

                  <head>THE COINS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTION</head>
                  <p>The bulk of series 2, the coins struck from obverses 07–022 (Plates 20–22), consists of one tightly die linked group which includes the
                     three common <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> symbols of cantharus, trident, and fulmen.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n5">5</ref> Eight
                     other obverse dies, 023–030 (Plate 23), although not yet actually die linked to this main section of series 2, seem on stylistic grounds
                     firmly bound to it. Die 023, so similar to 09, is coupled with reverses (T18–T19) with the stylis's cross-bar shown awkwardly in front of
                     Nike's wing, a feature known to me on no other <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> staters except those from the reverses C3, T10 and T12,
                     which occur early in series 2's die linked group.</p>
                  <p>And obverses 023–030, like 07–022, exhibit most or all of the iconographic details which, taken together, distinguish series 2 from all the
                     numerous other <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> staters bearing the same symbols: small heads with finely drawn profiles; elongated
                     helmet crests of which the nearer extends almost horizontally below several of Athena's thin parallel ringlets; two complete ringlets to
                     the immediate right of the helmet flap; two or more tightly curled ringlets (as opposed to the loose locks in this position on the bulk of
                        <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> staters) to the right of her neck; and often, unrealistically and rather disconcertingly, ringlet
                     tips depicted also under the goddess's neck truncation. Series 1 and 2 reverses also show a fairly broad cross-piece on the stylis. Many
                     other staters with the same symbols have much narrower cross-pieces, some so short as to give the stylis the appearance of a trident.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n6">6</ref>

                  <p>At the outset of series 2 a certain amount of variation and experimentation is evident. Die 07, although the hair is in ringlets, has the
                     thin, lank helmet crests of 01–05 in series 1, while 08 has a coiffure of rather loosely twisted ringlets which are arranged not in
                     parallel but in a gracefully irregular fashion. Die 09 was used with T9 without the ringlet tips to the right of Athena's neck, but the
                     tips were added by the time T10 and T11 were employed, and 010 has a unique curve in the nearer helmet crest. And as just mentioned, C3,
                     T10, and T12 (as well as T18–T19) have a peculiar feature found nowhere else on the hundreds of <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> gold
                     staters studied, the stylis's cross-bar in front of rather than above Nike's wing.</p>
                  <p>The cantharus of C3, and to a lesser degree that of C7, have no apparent bases depicted and they terminate below in a point. The handles of
                     these canthari are almost semicircular and their top attachments reach outward, not upward, from the cup's brim. The canthari on subsequent
                     dies of series 2 have distinct bases and elongated handles which reach vertically upward from the cup. This more elegant shape is found on
                     all the other such <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> gold studied, i.e., on all cantharus distaters, quarter staters, and staters other
                     than those published here.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n7">7</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although series 1 is not die linked to series 2, and although its coiffures differ from those of that series, it seems on close inspection
                     firmly associated. Its two obverse-linked symbols, cantharus and trident, are those which, again obverse linked, are the first symbols
                     employed in series 2. Athena's profiles in scale and in their general fine and delicate aspect are almost identical in both series. The
                     homogeneity of series l's previously known coiffures on 01–05 is now broken by the newly emerged reverse-linked 06, with its loose flowing
                     locks replacing the earlier dies' short curly hair, and with its helmet crest extending horizontally below Athena's ringlets, anticipating
                     the crests' arrangement from series 2's 08 onward. Die 08, which strangely was not illustrated by Newell, also repeats the loose locks of
                     06. The thin, lank helmet crests of 01–05 appear also on the new 07, at the outset of series 2. And Cl and C2, the only cantharus reverses
                     known in series 1, have the unusual cantharus of series 2's C3, with no base, and with <pb n="108"/> semicircular handles.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n8">8</ref> Finally, of course, there is the feature which was key in <persName>Newell's</persName>
                     association of coins of the two series in <placeName>
                        <hi rend="italic">Tarsos</hi>
                     </placeName>, the unusual down-turned ends of the stylis's cross-bar, seen most clearly on series l's T4 and T5, and series 2's C4. The two
                     series, too, contain most of the known cantharus staters as measured by obverse dies employed (see Table 19, p. 100) but only a minute
                     fraction of all the abundant known fulmen staters.</p>
                  <p>Enough similarities thus exist between series 1 and the early coins of series 2 to warrant considering them the output of a single mint—as
                     did Newell. The variations in details of iconography in series 1 and early series 2 can be explained simply enough by experimentation at
                     the outset of the new coinage—compare the initial obverses of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>'s gold, with
                     their long hair and one head facing left.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n9">9</ref>

                  <p>Newell in 1918, early in his career, attributed most of series 1 and some of the early coins of series 2, with cantharus and trident
                     symbols, to Tarsus, although he placed series 2's coins <hi rend="italic">(<placeName>Tarsos</placeName>

                  <p>Newell did not realize that the coins of his first group (part of series 2 here) were firmly linked to coins of more nearly "standard"
                     ringlet style, nor, more important, to coins with fulmen symbol. Had he known of these links it is inconceivable that he would have given
                     his first group, now bound to all of the present series 2 with its three quintessential <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> symbols, to
                     any place other than <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>. Series 2 certainly was produced in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>.</p>
                  <p>In the absence of actual die links, however, <persName>Newell's</persName> attribution of his second group (here part of series 1) to
                     Tarsus cannot be decisively disproved. One might think that the early icon- ographic details of series 2 which repeat those of series 1
                     were due to one mint's (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>'s) copying of another's (Tarsus's) coins. But the
                     new 06, firmly die linked into series 1 yet anticipating <pb n="109"/> the ringlets and long helmet crests of series 2, argues against this
                     interpretation. An origin in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> for both series seems almost certain.</p>
                  <p>The frequent presence of series 1 staters along with those of series 2 in hoards from the Greek mainland is not necessarily an argument for
                     a <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> origin, for all those hoards also contained staters from elsewhere.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n10">10</ref> Series l's attribution here to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> rests solely on an analysis of
                     the coins themselves, with the many similarities between series 1 and series 2—the coiffures and helmet crests of 06 and 07 and the shapes
                     of the canthari of C1–C3.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n11">11</ref> In addition, series 2 at its outset uses only the two symbols of series 1,
                     cantharus and trident, adding the third common <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> symbol of the fulmen only later.</p>
                  <p>Most of <persName>Newell's</persName> dies in question from <placeName>
                        <hi rend="italic">Tarsos</hi>
                     </placeName> are reproduced here on Plate 25, the coins identified by <persName>Newell's</persName> issue numbers N12–N19, and with his die
                     letters and my die numbers both also given. N18–N19, known from but one shared obverse die, have the prominent vertically placed plow to
                     left that is the unvarying primary symbol on the large output of analogous silver (N20–N40) at Tarsus, which Newell dated after 327 B.C.
                     N18–N19 are surely from Tarsus.</p>
                  <p>But then Newell took N16–N17 as the link between N18–N19 and the issues now reattributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> (N12–N15). N16–N17's obverses do indeed have the tightly curled hair of N14–N15, but there all resemblance ceases. In
                     the arrangement of the helmet crests, the absence of locks to the right of Athena's neck, and their large scale and general coarseness,
                     N16–N17's obverses are most unlike those of both N14–N15 and N18–N19. Similarly with the reverses. N16 and N17 do have cantharus and
                     trident symbols, but those symbols are placed differently from those of N12–N15 and from the primary symbol of N18–N19, and N16–N17's
                     cantharus has a different shape, and the trident a different orientation, from those of N12–N15. Finally, the elaborate stylis of N16–N17,
                     topped with small Nikes, makes these issues a most unlikely bridge between N14–N15 and N18–N19. Where or when N16–N17 were struck I should
                     not like to hazard a guess, but even after the removal of N12–N15 from Tarsus they seem improbable on stylistic grounds as predecessors of
                     N18–N19, the earliest certain Tarsiote gold.</p>
                  <p>There remains, however, the possibility or even probability that N18–N19 were modeled on N14–N15. Despite the appearance of the griffin on
                     N18–N19's helmet and those issues' thick helmet crests, there is an overall similarity between the two pairs. It would be only natural if
                     Tarsus, for its small first gold issue ca. 327 B.C., took as a model a stater from the main <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> mint,
                     i.e., from this series 1 which includes N14–N15. The gold of Tarsus then would not have commenced until after the main <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> mint had started to strike <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold.<ref target="#PARTII-CH10-n12">12</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be granted, then, that all of series 1 and 2 were struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, a
                     specific association may be suggested. The word "association" is used deliberately, for this study would prefer to avoid definite mint
                     attributions. But in <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>'s gold coinage, only two groups employ all three

                  <p>The three groups' survival rates are very close, and so the frequency of die linkage between symbols in each case is comparable. Both
                     common symbols and similar die linkage associate our staters with Pella's Philips. Further, the earliest canthari of series 1 and 2 are
                     very similar to those of <hi rend="italic">

                           Tarsus. In <persName>

                           </persName>, p. 48, discussing the similarities between the <placeName>Corinth</placeName>, Samovodéné and Balkans hoards, Price
                           identifies the trident staters of series 2 in <persName>Corinth</persName> and Samovodéné (not in Balkans) as this issue 3006,
                           saying that its presence "in all three...hoards may suggest that despite its very different obverse style, this variety ought to be
                           placed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>." But the sole example of 3006 shown is obviously from an
                           entirely different output than the coins in these hoards.</cell>

               </head>
               <p>Very little has been written on the subject of <persName>Alexander's</persName> distaters. With two of the earliest known hoards
                  containing his <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> distaters published here for the first time, this seems an appropriate place to make a few
                  observations about these handsome coins. The present author distinguishes three groups, A, B, and C, so indicated in Chapter 12 in the
                  commentaries on the five relevant hoards (Mende, Saida, Commerce 1993, Paeonia, and Varna) and in the hoard chart, Table 23. These groups bear
                  no relation to the similarly designated silver groups of Chapters 1–3 above.</p>
               <p>Group A (<hi rend="bold">531–36</hi>)</p>
               <p>The first group, A, comprises most of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> distaters with the usual symbols of cantharus, trident, and
                  fulmen, summarized above in Table 19.<ref target="#PARTII-CH11-n1">1</ref> Little need be said about these. They are by far the most common
                  such coins (I have located 22 obverse dies), stylistically quite homogeneous, and exhibiting but three known obverse links between symbols—two
                  cantharus-trident, and one cantharus-fulmen. Two links and other representative examples are shown on Plate 24.</p>
               <p>Group B (<hi rend="bold">537–39</hi>)</p>
               <p>The second group, B, is the fulmen–<graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/> distaters, <hi rend="italic">Sicyon</hi> 6–7, for which I have located six
                  obverse dies. They and the rest of <hi rend="italic">Sicyon</hi>'s group I (other distaters, rare staters, and silver tetradrachms) were
                  reattributed by me in 1971 to an uncertain mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, and more <table rows="4" cols="6">

                  <pb n="113"/> recently have been given by <persName>Martin Price</persName> to "Aegae(?)."<ref target="#PARTII-CH11-n2">2</ref> Since my
                  1971 work, two northern Greek provenances, the Mende and Paeonia hoards,<ref target="#PARTII-CH11-n3">3</ref> have been identified. A <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> origin now looks even more probable, at least for the coins with fulmen and <graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/>,
                  which may be strikings of a mint other than that which produced the remainder of <hi rend="italic">Sicyon</hi>'s group I. This group I is
                  broken down in Table 22 into its three component sub-groups of issues, which between them include distaters, staters, and tetradrachms.</p>
               <p>No die links connect any of these three sub-groups to another. The fulmen-<graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/> coins (Sicyon 6–8) differ from the
                  other two groups in their relative abundance, in their lack of a second symbol, and, most important, just as with other <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> gold, in not being accompanied by any silver with the same markings. The only common element is the marking <graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/>, shared with the third group. This hardly seems sufficient: this marking, or its possible variant <graphic url="NS21_sym16.jpg"/>, is found on <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>'s <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms of group K, and on their contemporary <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>
                  reissues of tetradrachms and smaller coins.<ref target="#PARTII-CH11-n4">4</ref> And perhaps more significantly, it is also found on staters
                  with the other two typical <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> symbols, cantharus and trident.<ref target="#PARTII-CH11-n5">5</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The rare fulmen–<graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/> staters' divergent styles are revealing. Whether they truly accompany the similarly marked
                  distaters is a question, as the obverse styles of the two denominations are quite different. If the two denominations are not associated, the
                  resulting lack of staters further differentiates the fulmen-<graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/> distaters from the other <hi rend="italic">Sicyon</hi> gold. If they are associated, however, the staters' connections with simple fulmen staters are significant. The obverse shown
                  in <hi rend="italic">Sicyon</hi> (Plate 25, <hi rend="bold">J)</hi> is very similar indeed to one known with simple fulmen reverses (Plate 25,
                     <hi rend="bold">I</hi>; see also Plate 31, <hi rend="bold">21, 22).</hi> And the newly emerged second fulmen-<graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/> obverse (Plate 25, <hi rend="bold">L)</hi>
                  <ref target="#PARTII-CH11-n6">6</ref> is actually known used with a fulmen reverse (Plate 25, <hi rend="bold">K).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains possible that the gold with the youthful figures and its accompanying silver was also struck somewhere in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>. But the new shared stater obverse just mentioned strengthens the suggestion that the
                     fulmen-<graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/> gold coins, lacking matching silver issues, were struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and may also indicate that they formed part of the output of the chief <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> gold mint.</p>
               <p>Group C (<hi rend="bold">540–48</hi>)</p>
               <p>But even the three simple markings of cantharus, trident, and fulmen, unaccompanied by any secondary marking, seem to have been revived on
                  distaters, again obverse linked, at some period after the issuance of groups A and B. There exists a third separate, small sub-group of
                  distaters, with obverses of different style with two crests rather than three shown on Athena's helmet, and with the Nike on the reverse often
                  quite obviously walking. Only 17 coins are known, from three obverses.</p>
               <p>In the catalogue below, dies are prefaced by "D" for distater. Thus, e.g., DO1 = distater obverse 1, DC2 = distater cantharus reverse 2, DTI =
                  distater trident reverse 1, etc. Brackets to the left indicate obverse die links, brackets to the right, reverse links, and horizontal lines
                  to the left lead to other symbols found with the obverse dies.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The following hoards are those known to me which contained gold coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                  from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>; which were buried by the time of <persName>Philip II</persName>I's
                  death in 317 B.C. or perhaps a very few years later; and of which I have seen casts or photographs of the actual coins—for a mere listing of,
                  e.g., a trident-symbol stater does not allow it to be identified as a part of series 1, or of series 2, or of the larger group of staters with
                  this symbol not included in these series.</p>
               <p>The coins listed for each hoard under "series 1," "series 2," and "other" refer only to the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> gold staters
                  of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> present. <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> distaters of three
                  distinct groups (A, B, and C) are also listed (for discussion of these groups see the preceding chapter). Publications given in <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> are generally cited only when their contents are discussed. Table 23 at the end of the chapter summarizes the
                  hoards which are discussed in chapter 13.</p>

               <p>The <persName>Corinth</persName> hoard, found during excavations, is the only hoard listed here whose full contents are known with
                  certainty. It is also possibly the earliest buried, and thus its interment date, unfortunately uncertain, should be of high importance for the
                  terminal date of the striking of series 1 and series 2.</p>
               <p>With the realization that <persName>Alexander's</persName> Attic-weight tetradrachms were introduced in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> at the earliest only ca. 332 B.C., and with the present reattribution of the early "Tarsus"
                  gold to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>,<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n2">2</ref>
                  <persName>Thompson</persName>'s reasons for dating the <persName>Corinth</persName> deposit to ca. 327-325 B.C. must be reexamined.
                  Her arguments, perfectly valid at the time, were that <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>'s coins were all in
                  excellent condition, and that none of the <persName>Alexanders</persName> (her coins 42–51) could be dated to after 329/8. Some issues
                  which seemed to be early are now more doubtful and a review of the current evidence for the hoard's burial is indicated, with remarks by <persName>Thompson</persName> in quotation marks.</p>
               <pb n="116"/>
               <p>42–45: four "<placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>" staters, series 2's 014, 015, and 018, "from dies which Newell placed early in the sequence
                  from that mint [<placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>]." As <persName>Newell's</persName> chronology for <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>'s silver started in 336,<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n3">3</ref> presumably he and <persName>Thompson</persName>
                  considered that the gold too commenced then, but the current evidence indicates that the silver seems to have been introduced no earlier than
                  ca. 332 B.C. Further, the dies, to 018, no longer seem particularly early in their sequence.</p>
               <p>46–48: three "Tarsus" staters, 46 from series 2's 010, 47–48 from series 1's 02 and 03. The <placeName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Tarsos</hi>
                  </placeName> date of 333–329 B.C. is eliminated by the present reattribution to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>.</p>
               <p>49: a Salamis stater with harpa symbol. <persName>Thompson</persName> notes this issue as fourth in a series of five issues which Newell
                  had dated to the rather wide range 332–320 B.C.,<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n4">4</ref> "which might seem to indicate a date toward the end of
                     <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime or possibly after his death." But <persName>Thompson</persName> next adduced <persName>Newell's</persName> comparison in <placeName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Tarsos</hi>
                  </placeName> of two coins coincidentally from the very dies of <persName>Corinth</persName> 46 and 49,<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n5">5</ref>
                  where he described the Cypriot piece as a contemporary imitation of the "Tarsiote" (now <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>) one. This led
                  her to consider the Salamis piece as struck in the early 320s. It has recently become clear that the Salamis issue as 49, with harpa, is not
                  the fourth issue in its series, but among the first if not the very first of a few extremely small issues.<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n6">6</ref> If it can only be dated by comparison to 46, however, it is of no independent value in dating the hoard.</p>
               <p>50: a "<placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>" stater with caduceus symbol, which Newell considered struck ca. late 333–ca.
                  330 B.C.<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n7">7</ref> Price has recently voiced important doubts about the attribution of <persName>Newell's</persName> undated <placeName>
                     <hi rend="italic">Sidon</hi>
                  </placeName> 1–7, both on the basis of the coins' internal evidence and on <persName>Newell's</persName> later thought that perhaps they
                  emanated from Damascus.<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n8">8</ref> If so, they may well be contem-porary with the dated <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> gold which will have commenced only in the early 320s.</p>
               <p>51: an uncertain stater, with grain ear symbol, "of the same general period as nos. 42–50." This coin is clearly of no help.</p>
               <p>We are then left without any coins which can be assigned to a date before the early 320s. <persName>Thompson</persName> also observed
                  that the absence of the gold of "Sicyon," thought to have commenced 330–325,<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n9">9</ref> tended to confirm her early
                  dating of the hoard. Price has noted, however, that a recent reattribution of the early "Sicyon" staters and distaters to some mint outside of
                  the Peloponnesus, perhaps in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, makes their absence in the <persName>Corinth</persName> hoard less dramatic and thus less of a confirmation of a burial date so early as first thought.<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n10">10</ref> More important, <placeName>"Sicyon"</placeName> distaters are known from only three of the hoards
                  listed here, all buried ca. 323 or later, and the "Sicyon" staters, known from but four obverse dies, appear only in the very large hoards 6
                  and 8 below. Those staters' absence from the <persName>Corinth</persName> hoard means nothing.</p>

                     <persName>Le Rider</persName>, citing the close resemblance of the coins known to him to those of the <persName>Corinth</persName> hoard, suggested a burial ca. 327–325 B.C. Dimitrov, subsequently able to obtain a record of all the hoard coins, including
                  these Philips issued after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death, has now shown that the hoard must have been buried after 323.<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n12">12</ref>

               <p>One might consider that <hi rend="italic">

                  </hi> group III of both <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> and <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> should
                  perhaps now be dated to after 320. It is argued above in Chapter 9 that the reissues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                     II</persName>'s silver after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death started together with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> groups K/J, or perhaps I, perhaps only in 321 or 320 B.C. If the gold reissues were
                  introduced at the same time, then they also might have started only ca. 321–320 B.C. The reissues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> gold staters from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>,
                  however, are dated to ca. 323 and later<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n13">13</ref> and, as the gold and silver strikings of both <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> seem to
                  be quite separate phenomena,<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n14">14</ref> it seems more reasonable to assume that the <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> gold reissues from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> (i.e.,

               <p>
                  <persName>Le Rider</persName> terms this hoard "Commerce 1967," although noting it as "découvert probablement dans la région des
                  Balkans." I have adopted Dimitrov's "Balkans" as more descriptive. The latest coin in the hoard is a stater of Salamis, with rudder symbol,
                  issue 11 in <persName>Newell's</persName> "Cypriote <persName>Alexanders</persName>." Newell dated the Salaminian coins with this
                  symbol in both gold and silver to after 320 B.C. on two grounds: that the first use of the rudder on silver was on coins inscribed <pb n="118"/> with the name of <persName>Philip II</persName>I, and that <persName>Philip II</persName>I's name seems to have been used at
                  neighboring mints not immediately upon <persName>Alexander's</persName> death but only from ca. 320 B.C. Also, Cyprus came under
                  Ptolemaic control in 320, and the rudder seemed an appropriate symbol for a long series of issues struck while the Egyptians maintained a
                  naval base there.</p>
               <p>In his commentary, however, Newell wondered if the rudder staters might possibly have started before 320, "as their style is at first a close
                  development of the latest of the previous staters."<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n16">16</ref> On this basis, <persName>Le Rider</persName>
                  dated the Balkans hoard to 323 or a bit later, and Dimitrov agreed.<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n17">17</ref>
                  <persName>Newell's</persName> study of Salamis, however, must be revised and amplified. Several obverse linked stater issues are now
                  known to follow his issues 1–5, and they employ at least two different obverse styles.<ref target="#PARTII-CH12-n18">18</ref> Issue 11, with
                  rudder, may well at its outset imitate the early issues 1–5, but it does not seem to follow directly on them. One may conclude only that the
                  Balkans hoard was buried probably no earlier than 323 B.C., and very likely as late as late as 320, or even possibly a bit later.</p>

               <p>Waddington stated clearly that no coins of <persName>Philip II</persName>I were included in the hoard (but note that only two of the five
                  final hoards of Table 23, buried after <persName>Philip II</persName>I's death, contained his coins). Further, Saida included a Salamis
                  stater with rudder symbol, a marking used also by <persName>Philip II</persName>I (<persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachm issue P129). The <hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> dated Saida's burial to ca. 324/3 and <persName>Le

                  probably was taking account of the fact that, while <persName>Philip II</persName>I acceded late in 323, most of his datable coins seem
                  to postdate 320, and no doubt also considered that the issue with trident and <graphic url="NS21_sym39.jpg"/> was posthumous. Westermark

                     issue as well, all from the same obverse die. The Berry coin alone lacks several small obverse die breaks present on all other examples,
                     and its harpa issue is thus probably the first—if indeed issues 1–4 were even struck in sequence. The activity at this mint is also more

                  <p>So far, the die linkage and hoard evidence for the gold staters is fairly satisfactory. A portion (series 1 and 2, catalogued in Chapter
                     10) of the many staters known with the quintessential <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> symbols of cantharus, trident, and fulmen has
                     been separated out. This distinct group differs from the other staters with these symbols in its iconography and in its unique tightly die
                     linked structure so different from that of other similarly marked such coins, which are almost never die linked with each other. It differs
                     also in containing with virtually no exceptions<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n1">1</ref> the only coins with these symbols to appear in hoards
                     buried around the time of <persName>Alexander's</persName> death—i.e., hoards 1–6 or 1–7 in the previous chapter, ca. 323 or perhaps
                     one or two years later.</p>
                  <p>That series 1 and 2 must have been struck during <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime comes as no surprise. What is surprising is
                     that, at least according to the hoard evidence, virtually no other staters with cantharus, trident, and fulmen symbols seem to have been
                     lifetime strikings. These other staters' appearances in the slightly later hoards suggest that many of them at least were very early
                     posthumous issues.</p>
                  <p>But just when during <persName>Alexander's</persName> life were the staters of series 1 and 2 minted? In examining the meager and
                     suggestive but far from conclusive evidence, I shall confine myself to the gold coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>, for the silver
                     output of the two kings seems to be a quite separate phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>Modern numismatists tend to think in terms of the following pairs of emissions: <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                        II</persName>'s silver and gold, and <persName>Alexander's</persName> silver and gold. But, quite unusually in ancient numismatics, in
                     the case of each of these monarchs' <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> outputs, the gold and silver struck by each do not bear similar
                     markings. <persName>Philip's</persName> gold cannot be related by its issue markings to his silver, nor can <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold to his silver. Indeed, the gold's markings under both kings, chiefly these three symbols of cantharus, trident,
                     and fulmen, were repeated again and again, at different times and places,<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n2">2</ref> while the two kings' silver
                     strikings followed a more typical pattern with different markings, or groups of markings, succeeding each other in fairly orderly
                     fashion.</p>
                  <p>The relevant pairs to consider are not <persName>Philip's</persName> gold and silver, and <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold
                     and silver, but <persName>Philip's</persName> silver and <persName>Alexander's</persName> silver, and <persName>Philip's</persName> gold and <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold. Common markings join each of these pairs: <persName>Alexander's</persName> tetradrachm group A repeats the symbols found on certain silver issues of Philip,<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n3">3</ref> and <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold repeats those of <persName>Philip's</persName> gold.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n4">4</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The silver of the two kings was of course struck to different standards. Silver of both monarchs seems to have circulated together in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> proper. But
                        <persName>Philip's</persName> silver, on its parochial local standard, was not struck and is not found overseas, while to the north
                     of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> it is found in much greater numbers than <persName>Alexander's</persName> Attic-weight coins.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n5">5</ref> The silver of Philip and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> must be considered together, but the two series of strikings were not everywhere
                     interchangeable.</p>
                  <p>The two kings' gold, on the other hand, struck to the same standard, assuredly was.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n6">6</ref> Today we ask of a
                     given coin, where was it struck and by whom? The ancients would ask, what is this <pb n="123"/> coin worth to me in the marketplace? The
                     names and images on the coins must have been irrelevant to their users—Philip II's and <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold were
                     clearly interchangeable. This is why <persName>Philip's</persName> gold can be found everywhere together with <persName>Alexander's</persName>. Indeed, in the second century B.C. all <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> staters, no matter by whom issued, were
                     known by the general term <hi rend="italic">nummi aurei <persName>philippe</persName>i</hi> (or στατήρες χρυσοῐ φιλίππειοι) and the
                     same term may well have been in use also in the early hellenistic period, although recent apparent proof of this no longer seems valid.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n7">7</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several types of evidence, none conclusive, provide the only help in dating the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> staters of series 1 and 2. they are A) the <persName>Corinth</persName> hoard, B) the known dates of other <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> gold strikings, C) what is known of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> gold, and D.

                  <head>A. <hi rend="smallcaps">The <persName>Corinth</persName> Hoard</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>This hoard until recently seemed to provide a firm terminus ante quem for the staters of series 1 and 2. It is the only hoard known
                     containing <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold which could have been buried during his lifetime, and its first proposed burial date
                     of ca. 327 or perhaps a year or two later appeared to indicate that these staters were all struck by ca. 328, in the early years of <persName>Alexander's</persName> reign. But the reasons for dating its interment so early now seem to be not so convincing,<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n8">8</ref> and there are new reasons for questioning a lifetime burial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <persName>Thomas Martin</persName> has very reasonably argued that the circumstances of Corinth's burial—together with a gold
                     necklace, and in the basement of a stoa perhaps occupied by <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> troops—point not to a circulation but to a
                     savings deposit, and thus that the hoard is useless in any case for the chronology of its contents.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n9">9</ref> If
                     he is right, of course, there is no point at all in discussing the <persName>Corinth</persName> hoard. But whether or not he is
                     correct here, his cautions about savings deposits are especially relevant to all gold hoards—often coins in that precious metal received
                     relatively little circulation and wear and gold deposits in general often contain coins in excellent condition struck over considerable
                     periods of time.</p>
                  <p>More important, perhaps, the more recently discovered hoards 2–5 in the previous chapter (Samovodéné, <persName>Balkans</persName>,
                        <persName>Mende</persName>, and <persName>Ruse</persName>) now provide illuminating comparisons to Corinth. At first, only a
                     portion of Samovodéné was known, which did not include its two post-323 staters with <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip
                        II</persName>'s types. Understandably, Samovodéné was, because of its remarkable resemblance to Corinth, believed to have been buried at
                     approximately the same time (i.e., in the early or mid–320s). Dimitrov's full listing of Salovodéné's contents now shows that it must be
                     brought down to after 323 B.C., because of the two late Philips. A glance at Table 23 will show that Samovodéné's inclusion of only two
                     late coins is analogous to the compositions of <persName>Balkans</persName>, <persName>Ruse</persName>, and <persName>Mende</persName>, all interred ca. 323 or a bit later. Only two of Samovod6ne's 67 coins can be dated later than ca. 330 B.C. (or perhaps
                     ca. 327);<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n10">10</ref> only one of Balkans' 29 and one of Ruse's four to later than that date; and only one to
                     three of Mende's 80 to later than 327, but in each of these four hoards those one to three late coins were struck after 323. One may well
                     suspect that only chance may have kept <persName>Corinth</persName> too from including one or two post–323 coins, and that it also
                     might be considered as interred only after 323.</p>
                  <p>"La date des premiers statères d'or de <persName>Philippe</persName>," in <hi rend="italic">Xαϱαχτήϱ</hi> (above, p. 113, n. 6), p.
                     268. As these 85 "large staters" are shown by inscription X.A to be equivalent to 170 regular σταήϱοι φιλιππείοι, and as Philip issued no
                     distaters, it had seemed that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> distaters must have been involved, and
                     called "large Philips." But the alternate restoration suggested by Le Rider, with which he reports Hatzopoulos concurs, destroys the
                     seeming proof that these particular <persName>Alexanders</persName> were actually called "Philips." Nevertheless, such a name remains
                     possible, and perhaps even probable, in the light of known second-century practice.</p>
                  <pb n="124"/>
                  <p>Le Rider also notes the heavy die linkage among the Philips in Corinth, especially among the coins from Amphipolis, which suggested that
                     their striking preceded the hoard's burial by a rather short time.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n11">11</ref> Similar heavy die linkage is
                     found also, however, in other hoards. There are 19 die links, obverse and reverse, among the 41 <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
                     Philips in Corinth, but also 19 among the 51 similar coins of Samovodéné. Even the considerably later Varna deposit (hoard 11) has 11 among
                     30 such coins.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n12">12</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>The only significant difference between <persName>Corinth</persName> and other hoards with large numbers of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> coins seems to be the varying proportions in each from different portions of Le Rider's
                     groups II at <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> and Amphipolis (both cities' groups I are early and very
                     small, and their groups III of course fall after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death). <persName>Le Rider</persName> divides
                     his <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> group II into II.1 and II.2. II.1, with 124 obverse dies employed for
                     coins bearing cantharus, trident, and fulmen symbols, is the largest stater group in his entire study. II.2, which shares one obverse die
                     with II.1, employed but 18 obverse dies for its four other symbols.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n13">13</ref>
                     <persName>Le Rider</persName> considers II.2 a subsidiary group of <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName>
                     issues whose chronology in relation to II.1 is uncertain.</p>
                  <p>Amphipolis's group II is not formally subdivided by <persName>Le Rider</persName>, but he notes that the last two of its ten issues
                     were, unlike the first eight, struck in parallel rather than sequentially.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n14">14</ref> For the sake of
                     discussion, these first eight issues, which employed 48 obverse dies, are here called "II.A," and the last two, which used 30 obverses,
                     "II.B."</p>

                  <p>In <persName>Corinth</persName> the numbers of coins from <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> II.2 and
                     Amphipolis II.B are higher than the numbers from the larger <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> II. 1 and
                     Amphipolis II. 1. This situation is the reverse of that in each of the other four hoards, where the number of coins in each sub-group bears
                     some vague if varying relation to the original number of dies used for each sub-group. Further, 17 of the 19 die links in the <persName>Corinth</persName> hoard are from Amphipolis's II.B, which followed II.A. Although this may be simply a consequence of the high
                     relative representation of this subgroup (21 coins from a group employing only 30 obverse dies), still the concentration here sets <persName>Corinth</persName> apart from Samovodéné, Balkans, and Mende. Why? It may simply be that the reason is purely geographical as
                        <persName>Corinth</persName> is the only mainland Greek hoard location, while the other hoards were all from the north.</p>
                  <p>As an aside, one may also wonder if perhaps <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe's</persName>
                     </hi>
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> II.2, or perhaps Amphipolis II.B, each joined by only one obverse to its
                     preceding group of issues, could have actually been struck <pb n="125"/> at Corinth, where <persName>Antipater</persName> and His
                     successors maintained a garrioon. A mint at <persName>Corinth</persName> itself would nicely explain <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> II.2's or Amphipolis II.B's High representation in the <persName>Corinth</persName>
                     hoard, whenever it was buried. But this is mere conjecture. We are unfortunately left with no real confidence that its burial Had to be
                     earlier than ca. 323 B.C., and thus that it can be taken as proof that stater series 1 and 2 must necessarily antedate <persName>Alexander's</persName> death by a number of years. However, the tentative conclusion reached later in this chapter is that the early 320s
                     are indeed the most probable time for their emission.</p>

                        <placeName>Sidonian</placeName> attribution and early dating are both quite questionable.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n15">15</ref> The
                     earliest dated Sidonian gold is of year 7, 327/6 B.C., although this was probably preceded by the small undated issues <hi rend="italic">Sidon</hi> 11–14 and 19. No gold is known, however, corresponding to the silver dated years 1 and 2, 333/2 and 332/1 B.C., so that it
                     is a fair assumption that <hi rend="italic">Sidon's</hi> gold started only after its silver, perhaps 330–328. The situation is similar at
                     Ake where no gold corresponds to the earliest silver, again of 333/2 and 332/1. These two cities, of course, furnish the only dated series
                     struck during <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime.</p>
                  <p>At <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, the first two of the three groups of staters which <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> assigned to his series I, ca. 333–327, are composed of his issues <hi rend="italic">

                     </hi> 12–15—in the present study reattributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>. Hence no Tarsiote gold
                     can be reasonably assigned to earlier than ca. 330. At <persName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</persName>, <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> himself was firm that the earliest strikings imitated our series 2.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n16">16</ref> If so, the <persName corresp="#nomisma_salamis_cyprus">Salamis</persName> coins cannot be placed
                     earlier than our staters and do not help in dating them, and one would suspect that other Cypriot mints initiated their gold at the same
                     time as Salamis. <persName>Thompson</persName> dates the opening of the mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardes</placeName> to ca. 330, the earliest of any <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> mint. But so early a
                     date depended in part on assigning three years to the issuance of <hi rend="italic">Sardes</hi> series IV–VI and perhaps III and, as she

                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> staters, struck either late in his lifetime or early in that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, and those of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> series 1 and 2 are obviously related.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n19">19</ref> But even aside from absolute dates the
                     question is, <hi rend="italic">how</hi> are the staters of the two kings related? With the same symbols, used in similarly die linked
                     fashion, and with exactly the same standard so that in the marketplace they were equivalent, did one necessarily replace the other? Or
                     could they not have been struck simultaneously, or alternately? Note that both series continued, or resumed, after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death. And, again, note that in early hellenistic <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>,
                     as in later centuries, <persName>Alexander's</persName> staters may have been known as στατῆρεζ χρυσοῖ φιλίππειοι.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n20">20</ref>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="126"/>
                  <p>It is thus not at all clear that the introduction of gold with <persName>Alexander's</persName> types and name must have produced even
                     a temporary cessation of the coins with <persName>Philip's</persName> types and name. Certainly in the first four hoards of Table 23,
                     buried probably shortly after 323, <persName>Philip's</persName> gold was overwhelmingly predominant over <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                     <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> strikings, with a total of 174 staters of <hi rend="italic">
                        <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     </hi> groups I and II compared to only 19 <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> staters. The heavy die linkage in <persName>Alexander's</persName> series 1 and 2 suggests that this coinage must have been produced over a quite short period of time. It seems
                     entirely possible, even probable, that staters of <persName>Philip's</persName> types continued to be struck at least sporadically
                     until the end of <persName>Alexander's</persName> reign.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>Among the eight earliest gold hoards of Table 23, those most probably burled by shortly after 323, three (<placeName>Corinth</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</placeName>, and Ruse) show no helpful disparity in wear between the
                     coins of series 1 and 2 and the hoard' latest coins, and the contents of Saida are not known in detail. But the wear in the four other
                     hoards may be instructive.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n21">21</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Six of Samovodéné's seven series 1 and 2 coins are illustrated here (series <hi rend="bold">1: 469, 475</hi> ; series <hi rend="bold">2:
                        477, 494, 503</hi>, and Plate 25, <hi rend="bold">P</hi>). All show a good amount of wear, particularly when compared to the two
                     post–323 <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> staters which date the hoard (Samovodéné 28 and 29, Plate 25, <hi rend="bold">Q–R</hi>), both in superb condition.</p>
                  <p>By far the most worn coin in the Mende hoard is its 73, from series 2 (<hi rend="bold">519</hi> ; Plate 29, <hi rend="bold">73</hi>),
                     particularly when compared to the hoard's latest coins, a post–323 <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> stater
                     (Plate 29, <hi rend="bold">61</hi>) and contemporary <persName>Alexanders</persName> (Plate 29, <hi rend="bold">74–75</hi>), all in
                     excellent condition.</p>
                  <p>Commerce 1993 seems to have been interred a few years later than Samovodéné and Mende, perhaps 320 B.C., so its evidence is not as strong
                     as that of those two deposits. But its coin 20 (Plate 30, <hi rend="bold">20</hi>), from series 2, was considered in only EF condition by
                     the dealer offering it, while the bulk of the hoard coins were termed MS (mint state) or near-MS. Comparison of coin 20 with the other two
                        <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> staters in the hoard (Plate 30, <hi rend="bold">21–22</hi>) shows it
                     is far more worn. Coin 20 was also offered at the lowest price of any of the hoard coins, save only the rather wretched coin 42, struck
                     from flawed dies.</p>
                  <p>In Commerce 1994, buried perhaps as late as 318, and thus also of lesser importance, the only two of the 26 staters with fulmen, cantharus,
                     or trident symbols considered to be a grade lower than VF or Good VF/VF+ were one each of series 1 and series 2.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n22">22</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wear cannot be quantified, of course, but a reasonable deduction is that series 1 and 2 were not struck during the great outpouring of
                     silver coin which occurred throughout <persName>Alexander's</persName> empire from 325 on, but that they antedated <persName>Alexander's</persName> death by quite a few years. As already noted, their tight die linkage suggests a fairly short period of
                     emission.</p>
                  <p>The only conclusion the present writer can draw about the dates of series 1 and 2 is thus unfortunately the rather imprecise one that they
                     were minted at some time or times between ca. 336 and ca. 323 B.C., and perhaps nearer to 332 than to 323. <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold and silver strikings, like those of this father, bore no obvious relationship to each other, as has been
                     emphasized several times in this study. Even if <persName>Alexander's</persName> silver started no earlier than ca. 332, there seems
                     no decisive reason why his earliest gold cannot even have preceded his initial silver. But perhaps the most likely date for the
                     introduction of series 1 and 2 falls after 332, when the silver coinage commenced. By 327, at any rate, overseas gold was certainly being
                     struck.</p>

                  <head>OTHER CANTHARUS, TRIDENT, AND FULMEN STATERS</head>
                  <p>Not yet fully discussed is another striking feature of Table 23. Leaving aside Saida, whose <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> component
                     is effectively unknown, in the first five hoards of Table 23 there are 19 <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> staters of series 1 and
                        2,<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n23">23</ref> and only one single <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> stater of the more numerous others
                     bearing the same symbols: the slightly worn fulmen stater in Samovodéné.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n24">24</ref> This coin is exceptional in
                     that it belongs to a small group of fulmen staters of unusually homogeneous style, two of whose obverses are used also for coins with the
                     unusual shield symbol.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n25">25</ref> Dimitrov has plausibly suggested that this Samovodéné fulmen stater was
                     struck at a mint other than that which produced the series 1 and 2 staters in Samovodéné.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n26">26</ref> These
                     obverse-linked fulmen and shield staters, with their accompanying similarly obverse-linked fractions,<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n27">27</ref> may then be from a second <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> mint. They may have commenced shortly before 323, but must have
                     been struck for the most part in following years. The shield staters certainly appear in abundance in the Commerce 1994 hoard (Plate 31,
                        <hi rend="bold">27–31</hi>).</p>
                  <p>More significant, however, than this Samovodéné fulmen stater is the remarkable fact just mentioned that, except for this stater, of the
                     nineteen staters of series 1 and 2 and the distaters of the Mende hoard, not one single <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> gold coin with the common symbols of cantharus, trident, or fulmen appears in any of the first five hoards of Table
                     23, those buried by 323 B.C. or a very few years later. Staters with these markings not included in series 1 and 2 are far more numerous
                     than those in these two series;<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n28">28</ref> had they been struck much before 323 they would surely have appeared
                     in these early hoards.</p>
                  <p>They first occur, and in quantity, accompanied by relatively few examples of series 1 and 2, in hoards 7–13, those buried perhaps 320–315.
                     One must conclude that these "other" <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> staters with cantharus, trident,
                     and fulmen symbols, absent from the earliest hoards, were in large part posthumous strikings.</p>
                  <p>Another interesting observation is the very few obverse links between symbols among these other, later, gold staters. There are also, as
                     the present author's examination has shown, very few reverse links between obverse dies as well as many minor variations in, particular,
                     obverse style.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n29">29</ref> These "other" coins' absence in the early hoards of Table 23 together with their
                     presence in six of the seven latest hoards there suggests a rather short period of striking. The variety of obverse styles in Commerce 1994
                     (see Plate <hi rend="bold">31</hi>) suggests that their output may have been largely completed by that hoard's burial date of perhaps 318,
                     or very shortly after. They thus would have spanned the aproximate time, ca. 324–319, when the present author believes the heaviest silver
                     production of Amphipolis occurred. Unlike the silver, however, the lack of die links and the varying styles suggest that the large output
                     of these "other" staters may have been produced in a number of workshops, even perhaps in different mints.</p>

                  <head>DISTATERS</head>
                  <p>In Chapter 11 three groups of <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> distaters were distinguished: A, the bulk of the coins with the usual
                     cantharus, trident, and fulmen symbols (22 known obverse dies and little linkage between symbols); B, coins with marking of fulmen and
                        <graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/>, previously attributed to Sicyon (6 known obverse dies); and C, with the markings of A (3 known dies and
                     tight linkage).</p>
                  <p>The Mende hoard appears to show, at a minimum, that groups A and B had been struck by 323 or very shortly after. The heavy linkage among
                     only the group B coins there suggests that they were produced later than group A, and very shortly before the hoard's burial.</p>
                  <p>Group C, however, with the same markings as group A, is first known to appear (again with die linkage) in Commerce 1993, buried after 321
                     at the very earliest, and Gîldau, interred after 316. It almost surely is the latest of the three groups.</p>
                  <p>Whether any or all of these distater groups emanated from the mint of the early stater series 1 and 2 is unclear, but the proportional use
                     of the three symbols by group A, the largest and probably the earliest, is extremely similar to that of series 1 and 2, at least as
                     measured by the numbers of obverse dies used with each symbol.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n30">30</ref> On the other hand, A's obverses
                     resemble those of certain "other" fulmen and shield staters more than they do those of series 1 and 2.<ref target="#PARTII-CH13-n31">31</ref>

                  <head>SUMMARY</head>
                  <p>Some staters formerly attributed to <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>
                     <hi rend="italic">(Tarsos</hi> 12–5) were struck in Macedonia, perhaps at Pella. They are part of a tightly die linked sub-group of staters
                     with cantharus, trident, and fulmen symbols. The hoards show that this sub-group was struck during <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                     lifetime, perhaps in the years following 332 B.C. The more numerous staters with the same symbols, and those with shield symbol, were
                     probably largely early posthumous. Their many stylistic differences and lack of die links raise the possibility that they were struck at a
                     number of mints. The small amount of hoard evidence available seems to show that the bulk of the distaters with the common symbols of
                     cantharus, trident, and fulmen was also struck during <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime, although a small emission with the
                     same markings was produced after his death.</p>
                  <p>Distaters and staters with fulmen and <graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/>
                     <hi rend="italic">(Sicyon</hi> 6–8) need not be associated with other <hi rend="italic">Sicyon</hi> issues. They appear from the hoards to
                     have been lifetime issues, probably of some mint in Macedonia, but their exact place of issue, like that or those of the staters with
                     cantharus, trident, and fulmen markings, remains unclear.</p>
                  <p>The present study has produced some limited results, but, failing important new evidence, the mint attributions and exact chronology of
                     most of <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                     <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> gold remain unclear. One thing abundantly clear, however, is that it is unwarranted to consider <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold staters or distaters with cantharus, trident, or fulmen symbols as an "issue": a variety, yes, but
                     not an "issue" if by such we mean a discrete output produced at one given time and place.</p>

               <p>In the spring of 1993 two lots of early <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms appeared on the
                  United States market. The obvious similarities and numerous die links between the two lots (A, 50 coins, and B, 23 and a probable intrusion)
                  prove their common origin.</p>
               <p>At first there seemed a possibility that the tetradrachms derived from the same deposit as the Near East 1993 hoard of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> drachms, also very early strikings, which surfaced at about the same time.<ref target="#AP1-n1">1</ref> One very knowledgeable and reliable dealer, however, saw all the coins in their original condition before they
                  left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> and reported that the surface appearance of the tetradrachms was quite
                  different from that of the drachms. Therefore the two denominations probably derive from two separate deposits. Their burial dates, however,
                  are so similar that their evidence for the Amphipolis mint is the same.</p>
               <p>No information as to the hoard's provenance could be obtained. Its contents are extremely varied, and its large Amphipolis component is no
                  different from that found in most <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> hoards wherever buried. Even the many
                  coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName>, given that port's importance as a place of embarkation for
                  returning soldiery at the time of the hoard's burial (ca. 323–322 B.C.), is not decisive. "Commerce 1993" seems the only possible description.
                  In the catalogue, A or B indicates the lot to which each coin belonged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Celator</hi> references are to non-numbered illustrations on the back cover of <hi rend="italic">The Celator</hi>, July
                  1993. Group letters and issue numbers given for the Amphipolis coins are to the present work. Brackets to left or right indicate obverse or
                  reverse die identities. All coins (except 62, from the dies of 61) are illustrated on Plates 26–28, where they are identified by hoard coin
                  numbers. A more detailed catalogue, with most weights and die axes, is on file at the ANS.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Georges Le Rider</persName> has obtained photographs of this hoard of 80 gold coins, 62 staters of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> and 18 coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> III (10
                  distaters and 8 staters). No weights or die axis positions were secured. Professor <persName>Le Rider</persName> has generously provided
                  the photographs and allowed me to publish this account of the hoard, whose evidence as to the date of <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                  earliest gold is important even if not conclusive.<ref target="#AP2-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The coins are listed below. The quality of the photographs (some roughly life-size, some at various magnifications) of the Philip coins is
                  often insufficient to allow exact die identification, either in comparisons with other hoard coins or with the die numbers given in <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Philippe</persName>
                     <hi rend="bold">.</hi>
                  </hi> Professor <persName>Le Rider</persName> and I are in accord, however, that no <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> Philips are
                  later than <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Philippe</persName>'s</hi> groups II.</p>
               <p>The photographs of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins are somewhat clearer, but unfortunately all
                  are also enlarged. As noted, some of the distater reverses lack photos, but the coins' mints and issues are not in doubt.</p>
               <p>Illustrations on Plate 29 are thus in many cases only approximations of the coins' true sizes. Because of the generally low clarity of the
                  photographs only a selection is shown. A few of the more significant coins are also illustrated at 2x magnification. All photographs are on
                  file at the ANS.</p>
               <p>All the coins are staters except 63–72 (distaters). See Chapter 11 for discussion of their groups A–B. The groups and dies given for the <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> coins are those in <hi rend="italic">

               <p>The Mende hoard's latest coins are the Miletus staters of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> (61) and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> (74–75). All are in <hi rend="italic">Miletus</hi> series I, dated by <persName>Thompson</persName> to ca. 325–323 B.C. <persName>Thompson</persName> considered the <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> issue as struck "in the beginning of the reign of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_iii_arrhidaeus">Philip III</persName>," i.e., at the earliest in late 323 B.C, so that coin 61 furnishes the hoard's

               <p>The hoard has two especially interesting features. One is Macedon's series 2 <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> stater (73), whose extremely worn condition—it is by far the most worn coin in the hoard—provides valuable evidence for
                  the start of <persName>Alexander's</persName> gold. One may question the evidence of a single coin, but it is still highly suggestive of
                  a date fairly early in <persName>Alexander's</persName> reign.</p>
               <p>The second remarkable feature is the presence of the ten distaters from an uncertain <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> mint or mints, four
                  of group A (63–66), and six of group B (67–72) with markings of fulmen and <graphic url="NS21_sym15.jpg"/>. Mende is the earliest known hoard
                  in which <persName>Alexander's</persName> distaters occur, and there can be little doubt that at least those of group A were lifetime
                  emissions. The close die linkage among those of group B seems to show that they were somewhat later emissions than those of group A.</p>

                     however, and thus also the dating of series I, is subject to some question. As Price notes (<hi rend="italic">

                     reservations, but in any case hoard evidence places Miletus series I to approximately 323 B.C.</p>

               <p>Photographs, weights, and professional assessments of most coins' states of preservation were provided by <persName>Harlan
                     Berk</persName>, to whom I am greatly indebted for enabling this hoard to be put on record. No information about the hoard's origin was
                  available, however, so it is termed merely "Commerce 1993."</p>
               <p>All the coins are staters except 17–19 (distaters). See Chapter 11 for the division of <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> distaters into
                  three groups. As their mints remain uncertain, they are attributed simply to Macedonia.</p>
               <p>Philip II groups, die combinations, and dies are those of <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Philippe</persName>. Celator</hi> references are to non-numbered illustrations on the back covers of <hi rend="italic">The

                  <p>Perhaps the latest dated coin in the hoard is 15 of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName>, whose markings are
                     known with <persName>Philip II</persName>I's name and whose issue is dated by <persName>Thompson</persName> to 323/2–322/1 B.C.
                     The drachm issue corresponding to 15 was not in the large Near East 1993 hoard buried ca. 322 and thus 15 probably was struck ca. 321. Nos.
                     16 and 26 of <placeName>Magnesia</placeName>, whose markings are also known with <pb n="140"/> Philip III's name, again can be no
                     earlier than the very end of 323 or more probably 322; nos. 27–28 of Miletus were also dated to 323/2 by <persName>Thompson</persName>. The number of post–323 <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> coins <hi rend="italic">(Philippe</hi> groups III) in the hoard is also large. It is hard to suggest a burial date for the hoard earlier than ca. 320.</p>
                  <p>For present purposes, the importance of the hoard lies in its inclusion of the distaters of group C, but even more in the two staters 20
                     and 21, both with the same fulmen symbol. Coin 20, from our early series 2, is somewhat worn and was described in only EF condition. Coin
                     21, one of the "other" staters struck later than groups 1 and 2, is far better preserved and was described as in near mint state.</p>
                  <p>Further, <persName>Mr. Berk</persName> also supplied his asking prices for the coins. One comparison is highly relevant here. The
                     price asked for stater 20, from series 2, was the third lowest of all the hoard coins' prices, higher only than those asked for 1 ("F/VF"),
                     from <persName>Philip's</persName> early <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> group II.1, and 42, from
                     deteriorated or damaged dies. The stater 21, however, with the same fulmen marking as 20, had a very high asking price. Again, although we
                     are discussing only two coins, their conditions support the conclusions reached in Chapter 13: series 1 and 2, lifetime issues, were struck
                     considerably earlier than most of the staters with the common symbols of cantharus, trident, and fulmen, and those later staters were in
                     large part early posthumous.</p>

                     Lampinen</persName> assisted me materially in photographing and grading the 30+ <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> coins and a few others.
                  The coins were clearly understood to be the last section of a larger hoard which had passed through the hands of <persName>Giessener
                     Münzhandlung</persName> of Münich.</p>
               <p>Lot B. In May of 1994 at <persName>Giessener Münzhandlung</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_1171458580723230223965">Charles
                     Hersh</persName> recorded a lot of 80 staters of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> III and 5 of <persName>Philip II</persName>I. Of these, <persName>Giessener Münzhandlung</persName> sold in its Auction 69, November 18, 1994, 24 of
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> III and 3 of <persName>Philip II</persName>I, accompanied by 9 of
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>. Because of the probable association of lot C with lot A and thus with lot
                  B, I am assuming that these 9 coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> were also part of the original group.
                  Their presence or absence, however, does not affect the dating of the chief and largest group, lot A.</p>
               <p>Lot C. In March of 1994 Classical Numismatic Group issued a flyer offering for sale 20 "exceptional" staters of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>. These coins had also passed through <persName>Giessener Münzhandlung</persName>, and
                  the staff at CNG, although they could not be certain, suspected that the coins might have come from the same deposit as lot A.</p>
               <p>The association of the three lots is not assured, but they are extremely compatible, and may well have originated from the same hoard. See the
                  summaries on Table 23, at the end of Chapter 12. Almost certainly there were other coins present, but there is now no way of tracing them.</p>
               <p>A further question is whether the Commerce 1993 hoard of staters, with the same approximate burial date, also originated from the same
                  deposit. It is notable that an <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> stater of uncertain attribution in
                  Commerce 1993 was from the dies of a coin in lot A, and that another uncertain coin in Commerce 1993 may have been from the obverse of a
                  second coin in lot A.<ref target="#AP4-n1">1</ref> Commerce 1993 surfaced in the spring of that year, however, nearly a year before any of
                  Commerce 1994, and no other specific circumstances or provenance connects the 1993 hoard with that of 1994. They are therefore separately
                  described here, but the import of each hoard remains the same, whether or not they truly are one hoard or two.</p>
               <p>Commerce 1993 is described in full in Appendix 3, as it has no other publication. Commerce 1994's lot A appeared in the sale catalogue noted
                  above, but illustration was incomplete, and inevitably some attributions were erroneous. Lot B was only partially published, and lot C was
                  fully described and illustrated, although only in a flyer. Summaries of all three lots' contents appear in Table 23. Full descriptions of each
                  lot, too lengthy to include in this work, together with direct photos of lot C kindly supplied by Classical Numismatic Group, are at the
                  ANS.</p>
               <p>As can be seen from Table 23, lot A's latest coins were 2 of Sidon dated 322/1, 1 <persName>Philip II</persName>I of <placeName>Babylon</placeName> dated by Waggoner to 322–321, 2 of Miletus of 320/19, and 1 <persName>Philip II</persName>I of Sardes of 319/8. Lot B
                  contained 1 <persName>Philip II</persName>I of Sardes of 322/1, 4 of the <persName>Philip II</persName>I Babylonian issue of
                  322–321, and no fewer than 18 of the same Miletus issue of 320/19. The latest coins (Philip II) in lot C were of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> of 323/2–322/1. The closing dates of all three lots are thus highly compatible. Taking the
                  Sardes coin of 319/8 as perhaps issued in 319, we may postulate a burial date for the hoard as a whole (if indeed it is a whole, of course) of
                  perhaps 318 or 317 B.C.</p>
               <p>The hoard contained two <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName> coins (one in lot B, one in C) of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName> of group IIIB, which followed IIIA. They may provide an indication of the end of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> groups IIIA. But <pb n="142"/> the significant aspect of the hoard for present purposes is the 31 coins
                  present from our <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> mint (or mints) in lot A. A catalogue follows of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> coins in CNG's 7 Dec. 1994 sale. Those of series 1 and 2 are listed in order of obverse dies, with 4 and 7 from the
                  non-linked portion of series 2 inserted in appropriate spots into the linked obverses.</p>

               <p>These numbers are hardly dramatic, but it must be remembered that the lot represents the remnants of a far larger hoard, and that that hoard
                  was buried no earlier than 318. The results are completely compatible, however, with the suggestion that series 1 and 2 preceded the "other"
                  staters.</p>

               publication or a hoard provenance is known. <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> numbers identify the ANS's coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip II</persName>'s types (and one of Perdiccas III, Plate 18, <hi rend="bold">D</hi>). <hi rend="italic">SNGBerry</hi> numbers are given for all ANS coins included in that publication.</p>
            <p>Most non-ANS coins are known through casts in the ANS cabinet or from its photograph file and library. Hoards are discussed in Chapters 8
               (silver) and 12 (gold). <hi rend="italic">

               <p>Tetradrachms (Chapter 1) are shown by group letter and issue number. Smaller coins (Chapter 2) with the same markings are indicated by
                  denomination only, the rare Zeus-reverse drachms being shown by "Zeus-dr." Where the smaller coins have no exactly corresponding tetradrachm
                  issue, their group letters are given in parentheses. BAΣ indicates the presence of the title <hi rend="bold">BAΣIΛEΩΣ</hi> on the
                  tetradrachms, while "etc." is used for series not treated in detail in this study which have varying subsidiary markings. Brackets enclose
                  issues whose reliably reported examples I have been unable to locate.</p>
