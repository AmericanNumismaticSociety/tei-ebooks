                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Adolph Alexander Weinman</hi>
               </persName> was born on December 11, 1870. This date fixes his present age. Aside from that however, it has less significance than the one a score of years later, on which he decided to make sculpture his profession The way of the sculptor was hard in those days and there were few inducements toward such a choice. A glance at these by-gone conditions may aid us in realizing the progress which has taken place in three decades.</p>
            <p>By 1890 the tide of our National taste had turned. Only since the Centennial Exposition of 1876 had there been any marked indications of the change. There, the visitors had their eyes opened to what
<pb n="2"/>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</persName> had to offer in the way of Art, notwithstanding that some of the paintings and objects exhibited could come within this category only by courtesy. Travel, too, was rapidly becoming less costly and not so difficult, and the people who had gone abroad were coming back with higher standards and broadened tastes. The voices of Hunt, <persName corresp="#viaf_54944558">Saint-Gaudens</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_29638591">John La Farge</persName> were beginning to be heard in the land. Photography was aiding by substituting inexpensive and accurate prints for the poor and costly engravings which had preceded them. Several groups of architects were just coming into prominence, and with their rise, sculpture, always in close alliance with its sister art, began to find a steadier demand for its output and a better understanding of its decorative possibilities and limitations. In consequence, the succeeding decade saw a tremendous growth in the plastic art‚Äîsaw it develop into a medium of expression excelled only by painting.</p>
            <p>When sixteen years of age, <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Wein-
<pb n="3"/>
               man</persName> was apprenticed as a carver of wood and ivory under <placeName>Kaldenberg</placeName>.<!-- I wasn't able to find this place in any database provided --> He attended the classes at <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q130981">Cooper Union</placeName>, and by the time he had reached his twentieth year, he was enabled to enter the studio of <persName corresp="#viaf_1573083">Philip Martiny</persName>. Here he worked until 1895.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_1573083">Mr. Martiny</persName> is one of the best teachers to whom a young sculptor could have gone for his first instruction. His work is characterized by a technical excellence far above the average. Born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3038033">Alsace</placeName>, his heritage of good taste gave him an advantage over his competitors. Part of his training had been received in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, and in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> he had come under the influence of <persName corresp="#viaf_54944558">Saint-Gaudens</persName> early in his career. Although most of <persName corresp="#viaf_1573083">Martiny's</persName> work was in the round, it was in these early years that the first stimulus towards medallic expression came to <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman</persName>. At the World's Columbian Exposition in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>, in 1893, a room was devoted to the work of European medallists, and this proved a revelation to the young student. Enquiry into methods and pro-
<pb n="4"/>
cesses followed, and the development has continued ever since.</p>
            <p>In 1895 <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman</persName> was promoted to the post of assistant in the studio of <persName corresp="#viaf_7264701">Olin L. Warner</persName>. A brief word will make clear the reasons for this listing of his instructors. Too often the sketch of an artist's career becomes little more than a roll of the masters under whom he worked. Such a mere list, however, has significance. Those familiar with the history of painting know that the number of pictures attributed to <persName>Rubens</persName>
               <!-- I wasn't able to find this person in any database provided --> is far greater than could have been produced by a single man in a long lifetime. More than most of the other masters of painting, he used his pupils for the preparation of his canvases and the drudgery of his many huge pictures. Just such a procedure maintains in the studios of sculptors, and especially where the work is being executed in marble. The master supplies the design or model and the pupils carry out his instructions. The block is hewn down from the proportions in which it was received until it begins to assume the form demanded by
<pb n="5"/>
the subject. The wax or clay model selected as nearest to the ultimate intention of the master is then copied roughly; but not until his figure is to be seen as through a veil does the master begin his work. Previously, of course, he will have been watching his pupils with jealous eyes lest a careless blow endanger his creation. Then, like Galatea under the touch of Pygmalion, the figure begins to take life at his hands. The niceties of the finished work begin to appear.</p>
            <p>Naturally, master and pupil must be in close sympathy else they could not work together. A comradeship of thought and deed which has continued for several years makes the pupil the spiritual son of his master. Consequently, the roll of those who have inspired and led the thought of the beginner is of more than casual significance, because to anyone familiar with the work of these masters it shows what influences have been guiding the hand and spirit. His education begins as an assistant, and is supplemented by such courses at schools as the
<pb n="6"/>
               evening classes permit. Gradually he develops until he assumes the role of a collaborator‚Äîa co-laborer, with his master. Sometimes, though not frequently, this assistance is acknowledged‚Äî<persName>Mr. French's</persName> figures of "The Continents" which adorn the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York</placeName> Customs House, bear his signature "Assisted by <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">A. A. Weinman.</persName>" When the master feels that he has given of his best to his pupil, the youngster is pushed out to make his own way and become a master in his turn and in his own right.</p>
            <p>The interest in medals which the exhibition at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> had awakened was further stimulated in <persName>Warner's</persName> studio when <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman</persName> assisted on the bronze doors of the Congressional Library. <persName>Warner</persName> had produced a series of portrayals of the American Indians which are among the best of the early medals produced in this country. <persName>Mr. Warner</persName>, however, died very suddenly, within nine months after the time <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman</persName> had begun to work with him. This catastrophe brought to <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Weinman</persName> an invitation to
<pb n="7"/>
               enter the studio of <persName corresp="#viaf_54944558">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> as his assistant.</p>
            <p>It is to <persName corresp="#viaf_54944558">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</persName> more than to any other single artist that we owe so much for his effort to awaken this country to the importance and value of fine sculpture. He achieved an enviable position of respect and admiration. A natural leader, he stimulated his pupils and assistants with inspiration to which they all testify. In consequence, there was the greatest benefit in coming under his direction. Because <persName corresp="#viaf_54944558">Saint-Gaudens</persName> was a master of bas-relief, <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Weinman's</persName> interest in medals received added encouragement.</p>
            <p>In 1998 <persName corresp="#viaf_54944558">Saint-Gaudens</persName> left for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, and <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman</persName> then entered the studio of <persName corresp="#viaf_31270824">Charles H. Niehaus</persName>. Here, for little more than five years he worked under the influence of another of our prominent American sculptors. Then followed two years of collaboration with <persName>Daniel C. French</persName>, and feeling that his preparation was now adequate, he set up a studio for himself in 1906.</p>
            <p>During this time his interest in medals had been growing steadily, and occasional
<pb n="8"/>
               plaques had been produced in spare moments. One of the earliest of these is the portrait of his mother modelled as early as 1896. Portraits of children followed in 1898 and 1900. An official commission for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</placeName> Purchase Exposition in 1904 gave opportunity for a different type of medal. There came an opportunity to collaborate with <persName corresp="#viaf_54944558">Saint-Gaudens</persName> in the Roosevelt Medals (1905). In 1906, the Life-Saving Medal was designed, and followed in the next year by the Award Medal of the American Institute of Architects. Portrait plaques were finished in 1910, and during 1911 designs for the new dime and half-dollar were carried to completion. Two charmingly decorative medallions of his little daughter were completed in 1915, and in 1918 he finished the <persName corresp="#numismatics_saltus">J. Sanford Saltus</persName> Award Medal given by the American Numismatic Society for artistic achievement in the art of the medal. <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman</persName> has since been awarded this medal. A War Service medal for <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1476505">Mount Sinai Hospital</placeName>, finished early in 1920, is the latest of <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman's</persName> productions in this field.</p>
            <pb n="9"/>
            <p>A study of these medals will show a development which has been consistent in reaching toward better things. Portraiture, which is the chief objective in the earlier medals, is achieved with a growing sense of ease and power in each succeeding design. The composition steadily grows more skilful and the problems faced become more complicated without the result being the less happy.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman's</persName> skill in modelling children is shown in the "Rocking-horse Baby", and the plaquette of "Bobbie" with his lifelike attendant. In the Saltus Award Medal <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman</persName> has over-come a series of difficulties with a happiness that brooks comparison with the work of some of the Renaissance medallists.</p>
            <p>In the following list of <persName corresp="#viaf_4850856">Mr. Weinman's</persName> medallic work, the metal of which the piece is struck is indicated for the Award Medals. Many of the portraits are galvanos. Most of these medals may be seen at the Museum of the American Numismatic Society.</p>
