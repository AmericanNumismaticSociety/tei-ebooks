            <p>The issue last year of a medal<ref target="#CH1-n1">*</ref> commemorating the arrival of the first shipload of Norse immigrants to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> serves, by its design, to remind us of that earlier Norse colonization of the New World of nearly a thousand years ago. The rediscovery of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_17231583">Columbus</name> in 1492 A. D. has, indeed, greatly obscured this earlier discovery by the Norsemen in the 10th century, generally considered to be about the year 986. This date is, however, associated only with the cruise of <name type="pname">Biarne Heriulfson</name>, who, however, although sighting the new country

               through being blown out of his course, did not land on it. The first to do this was Leif the Lucky, the son of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Eric</name> the Red of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3425505">Greenland</name>, about the year 1000. The earliest written record of this epoch-making but little-known event is in the Icelandic Codex Flateyensis, which was written between the years 1387 and 1395. That the later mediaeval navigators of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_9408658">South of Europe</name> were aware of the maritime discoveries of the Norsemen seems certain from the visit made by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_17231583">Columbus</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2629691">Iceland</name>, in 1477, to glean such knowledge as he thought might be useful for his purpose of finding a passage to the <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q213137">East Indies</name> by way of the Western seas. The written record above referred to was simply the commitment to writing of the oral tradition. Even if <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_17231583">Columbus</name> did not read, or have translated to him, the record of the event in question, there were still, no doubt, many people in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2629691">Iceland</name>, at the time of his visit there, who would know the details, and recite the adventures of the Norsemen in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>, or, as it was 
<pb n="3"/>
               called by them, among other names, Vinland, from the grapes they found in profusion there. From this name of Vinland it may be assumed that the Norse navigators reached quite a southerly latitude, and antiquarians are generally agreed that they landed in the modern <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States</name>.</p>
            <p>There is thus a connection between the Commonwealth of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States</name> and the <name type="place">Kingdom of Norway</name> which is of great antiquity and interest. Although geographers and historians are mainly concerned with that inquiry, the above remarks form a fitting introduction to the subject of this treatise, for the time of the early Norse colonization of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name> is the very period of the introduction of an inscribed currency in the parent country of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, and the connection of the latter with the dominant Anglo-Saxon race in the States, rests in the fact that the earliest Norwegian inscribed currencies were modelled solely on Anglo-Saxon types of coins. It is of these initial currencies of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> that the present article treats.</p>
            <pb n="4"/>
            <p>The question of the first of the Rulers to issue an inscribed currency for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> has long been the subject of difference. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_66792944">Mr. C. A. Holmboe</name>, writing in 1846, attributed coins to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Jarl Hakon</name> the Bad, who was slain in 995 A. D. (see <hi rend="italic">Das älteste Munswesen Norwegens bis gegen Ende des 14 Jahrhunderts</hi>), but <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_272892085">Mr. C. I. Schive</name> in <hi rend="italic">Norges Mynter i Middelalderen,</hi> 1865, transferred the coins to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon Ericson</name>, <name type="pname">Jarl</name> in 1015. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_272892085">Schive</name> therefore commenced his series with King <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name>, 995 to 1000, but <name type="pname">Mr. H. E. Hildebrand</name> in an article entitled <hi rend="italic">Nordens äldsta mynt</hi> 1887, was inclined to consider that the coins hitherto attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> belonged to <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name>, afterwards called the Saint, 1016 to 1028 A. D. For the settlement of this question of the earliest Norwegian coinage, regard must be given to the approximate time of issue of the prototype Anglo-Saxon issue, and the historical probabilities of the case.</p>
            <p>No one is in doubt as to the type of the first inscribed coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. It is

            <p>Obv: ✠ ÆÐELRED REX ΛNGLOX</p>
            <p>Rev: ✠ STIGNBIT M¯O LINCO (Lincoln).</p>
            <p>In my monograph on the "Coin Types of Æthelred II", published in the Numismatic Chronicle of 1910, I have shown that this type was probably issued in 990 A.D. Communication between <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> and the <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q1788657">North of England</name> was constant
<pb n="6"/>
               at this time, for extensive colonies of Norsemen had been founded in the <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q1788657">North of England</name>, as well as in the <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q2564353">West of Scotland</name> and in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, and the Crux type of Æthelred II would have been well known in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> for some years before the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad. On the other hand, it was displaced by several types of Anglo-Saxon coins, which were copied in <name type="pname" corresp="#geonames_2614165">Scandinavia</name>, by the time <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Jarl Hakon Ericson</name> held a nominal authority over <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, in the absence of his father, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Eric Hakonson</name>, for a very brief period in 1015, and any coins of his would have followed, in design, these later Anglo-Saxon types. Chronologically, and on type, there are, therefore, far stronger reasons for considering that Crux type coins bearing the name of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> were struck by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad, as suggested by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_66792944">Holmboe</name>, than by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon Ericson</name>.</p>
            <p>The historical incidents of the time are still more in favor of such an attribution. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad, with the aid of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q311011">Harold II</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> (925-986), had won full sovereignty over the Throndelaw and regions
<pb n="7"/>
               to the North, whilst the Southern shores of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, from the Naze eastwards, were created into an earldom and granted to him as a vassal of the King of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>. Called upon by the latter to fulfil his engagements, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> came to the assistance of his overlord in the war with the Saxons of the <name type="place">German</name> Empire. But the terms of the peace made soon after apparently included a promise by <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q311011">Harold</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, to introduce the Christian faith among the Norwegians, and <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Earl Hakon</name> was accordingly forced by King <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q311011">Harold</name> to receive baptism. No sooner, however, had the former left <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> than he repudiated both the new faith and his overlord, and ruled as an entirely independent sovereign in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. His position as such was assured by the decisive battle of Hjorunga Bay, fought about 986 A. D., and <name type="pname">Sweyn Forkbeard</name>, who had succeeded his father <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q311011">Harold</name>, was induced to turn Danish energies westward toward <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> for a time, resulting in the great raids on that country in 991 and 994.</p>
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p>Holding, therefore, sovereign power over the whole of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> as <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> did in the last nine or ten years of his rule, it would be anomalous if he had not instituted a metallic system of exchange in his country when the other rulers of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2614165">Scandinavian North</name>, including that of the Norse <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q436994">Kingdom of Dublin</name>, took that step. A critical examination of these early coins of the North of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> shows that the sovereigns of the various countries introduced, in the last decade of the tenth century, monetary systems all based on the Crux type of Æthelred II of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. This was the type of coins in which the first great tribute payment of 991 A. D. was given to the invading vikings, and it would seem that, on the plunder being taken to the home countries, the idea of introducing native coinages was engendered. Thus it came about that <name type="pname">Sweyn Forkbeard</name>, King of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, 986-1014, and <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q2535985">Sihtric Silkbeard</name>, King of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q436994">Dublin</name>, 989-1029, both started coinages based on this type, and the more distant <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49198178">Olaf Skotkonung</name>, King of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</name>, 995-1022,

               followed after. There is reason to believe that other smaller chiefs did the same, e. g., the King of Man. That <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> would not have done likewise is improbable, for as previously pointed out, the Norwegians were more closely associated with the <name type="place">British Islands</name> than either <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> or <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</name>, and a century before they gave Kings, who struck coins, to Northumbria in <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q4798430">Northern Britain</name>. It might, indeed, very well be that <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> was the first of the <name type="place">Scandinavian</name> chiefs to issue an inscribed coinage, or at least to share that distinction with the Norse King of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q436994">Dublin</name>. Trading visits of the Norwegians to the ports of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2963597">Ireland</name>, via the Orkneys and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2647204">Hebrides</name>, were constant at this time.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the case for the attribution of the coins under discussion to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon Ericson</name>, as suggested by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_272892085">Schive</name> and supported by <name type="pname">Hildebrand</name>, is as weak on historical grounds as it is on the grounds of type and chronology. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon Ericson</name> was too young at the time of his father's departure to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> in 1015
<pb n="10"/>
               to be made a sovereign earl of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. With his uncle, <name type="pname">Sweyn</name>, he was left as a sort of co-ruler; and, in any case, it is unlikely that he would have struck coins in his father's lifetime. As a matter of fact, his rule was shortlived, for, in the same year, <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name> invaded <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> and had conquered the country by the following year, 1016. In the meantime, the young <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon Ericson</name> had been captured, made to relinquish his claim to the sovereignty, and exiled. At a subsequent period, in 1028, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> was invested with the earldom of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> by Canute, after the latter's conquest of the country, but he was then purely a vassal of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> with no independent rights. His second period of rule in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> was again a very short one, for, soon after, he was recalled to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. The third decade of the eleventh century was also much too late for imitations of Æthelred's Crux type coins to be struck in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. It will, therefore, be seen that there is practically nothing in the history of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon Ericson</name> which would

justify the allocation of an independent coinage in his name of any type.</p>
            <p>The coinage now reattributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad is illustrated by figure 2 hereunder. It is from a specimen in the collection of the University of Oslo, by kind permission of the Director there.</p>

<pb n="12"/>
               of the runic π = u indicates early issue. The name of the moneyer is a corruption or variation of the well known northern name of <name type="pname">RÓ•fen</name>; and that the die-sinker was new to his work is evident, not merely from the slight departures from the proper legend on the reverse of the coins, but also from the somewhat doubtful words, I.GNVNDEI, at the end of the obverse inscription. These have been variously interpreted to mean <hi rend="italic">"in Nomini Dei"</hi> and <hi rend="italic">"Igimundi filius".</hi> The former is unlikely on the coinage of a pagan King. The Swedish numismatist, who adhered to the latter interpretation, considered that the coins belonged to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name>, or <name type="pname">Haquin</name>, the Red, King of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</name>, 1067-1079. But, apart from the improbability of the reading, this attribution is altogether too late for the early Anglo-Saxon type copied, which was, it must be remembered, issued in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> nearly 100 years before Haquin's time. And it is very doubtful whether the Swedish kings who immediately succeeded <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_130935164">Anund Jacob</name>, 1022-1050, struck inscribed coins at all.
<pb n="13"/>
               Modern numismatists more than doubt this. Had Anglo-Saxon models been followed by the Swedish <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> they would have been those of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_261559366">Edward</name> the Confessor, 1042-1065.</p>
            <p>In my view, the letter I, which at this time stood for either I or J, is more likely to indicate the title Jarl, the northern equivalent to Earl, thus following the almost universal rule of all coins of sovereign States which give the title or titles after the sovereign's name.</p>
            <p>The word GNVNDEI, I would tentatively suggest is a corrupted form of DRVNDEL. (last letter unfinished) for DRVNDELAW, the modern Throndheim. The letter D is, of course, the runic Th. The full reading of the inscription would, therefore, be extended to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name>, Jarl (in) Throndelaw. The weight of the coins is of the high standard also adopted later by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49198178">Olaf Skötkonung</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</name>, i. e., about 32 or 33 grains troy; and this is to be expected if issued in a district contiguous to what was then the Swedish Kingdom.</p>
            <pb n="14"/>
            <p>As noticed above, the important district of the Throndelaw was the part of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> left under the sovereign authority of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad, even before he made good his claim to the whole of the Kingdom, and it was in this district that Norway's former capitol, <name type="pname" corresp="#geonames_3133880">Nidaros</name>, was founded.</p>
            <p>In 995 A. D. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> was dispossessed of his Kingdom by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> and, as before mentioned, the early writers on Norwegian coins attributed a currency to this King, although <name type="pname">Mr. H. E. Hildebrand</name>, writing in 1887, in the work above mentioned, was inclined to transfer the coins so attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name>, 1016-1028. I think, however, that the original attribution is the more sound, again on the grounds of the type of the coins in question and of the historical facts of the case.</p>
            <p>As regards the type of the coins, my remarks on the same point in relation to the issue of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad, apply also in this case. This type, which is the same Crux design as that of the coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name>, is much too early for Olaf
<pb n="15"/>
the Stout, whose undoubted coins are imitations of later Anglo-Saxon issues. (See figures 5, 6 and 7.)</p>
            <p>The historical probabilities of an issue of money by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> based on the Crux type of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> are very great. Olaf first appeared on the pages of Anglo-Saxon history in 991 A. D. when, in continuation of a long viking cruise commenced in the previous year, he sailed to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> from Flanders and became one of the leaders of the viking host which, in that year, attacked Ipswich and defeated and slew Brihtnoth, the ealdorman of Essex, at Maldon. Their further progress was stopped by the first great tribute payment in 991 A. D. In 992, the vikings met with a reverse in the <name type="place">South of England</name>, and, in the sources, we then read of them storming Bamborough and ravaging Northumbria. At this point, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> appears to have separated from the main body of the host and to have continued his course round <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q4798430">Britain</name>, for, in the Saga of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> (one of the historical Sagas),
<pb n="16"/>
               it is stated that, after the plunder of Northumberland, Olaf went round <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2638360">Scotland</name> by the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2647204">Hebrides</name>, where he fought several battles, then southwards to Man, "where he also fought", then to Ulster, continuing round "Bretland", i. e., the land of the Britons, or Wales, which was laid waste. From thence the cruise was continued southwards to "Valland", i. e., the west coast of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name>, and, finally, as recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, under annal 994, Olaf and <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn</name> (of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>) came to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> with 94 ships. The city was besieged by them, but resisted the attack, whereupon the vikings ravaged the country far and wide until again bought off with a money payment. Olaf's cruise came to an end in 994 A. D.; and in the following year he sailed to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> and made himself King there by his conquest of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad. He was, of course, not without legitimate claim to the Kingship of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, for he was the great grandson of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_58985444">Harold Fairhair</name>, the first King of all <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>.</p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>In the last year of his presence in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> Olaf had become a Christian, and at Andover, in Hampshire, where his admission to the Church was celebrated, he promised never to come again to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> "with unpeace", and he kept his word.</p>
            <p>There is no question that Olaf, as an important leader of the Viking host, had a large share of the money tributes paid to the Northmen in the years 991 and 994. During these years the Crux type of Æthelred II was in circulation, and, on his return to <name type="pname" corresp="#geonames_2614165">Scandinavia</name>, Olaf must have had considerable quantities of these coins in his treasure chest. In addition, the type was already known in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>.</p>
            <p>So far as I am aware, no coin of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> is now extant—the one illustrated as No. 5, Plate 1, in <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_272892085">Schive</name>, in the work before cited, having been lost. The inscriptions on it are shown in that work as follows:</p>
            <p>Obv: ✠ ONLΛAF REX NOR:</p>
            <p>Rev: ✠ GODPINE M¯O NO:</p>
            <pb n="18"/>
            <p>It cannot be doubted that the abbreviated word, NO, on the reverse, after the usual M¯O, for monetarius, as well as the word NOR on the obverse, after the title REX, is intended for Normanorum = <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. The Norwegians of that period had not gathered, to any extent, into townships in the civic sense and, indeed, it was <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> who founded Norway's former capital, <name type="pname" corresp="#geonames_3133880">Nidaros</name>, now Throndheim. Even if the coins of Olaf were struck at <name type="pname" corresp="#geonames_3133880">Nidaros</name> after its foundation, the omission of the town name on the coins simply follows a usual practice, as exemplified on the earlier pennies of <name type="place">Anglo-Saxon Britain</name>. When those really concerned knew where the coins were struck, or if there was only one minting centre, there was no necessity to place the name of the mint town on the coins.</p>
            <p>The moneyer's name, Godwine, on the reverse, is decidedly Anglo-Saxon, and it thus affords striking corroboration of the records, which state that Olaf, when he landed in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, was
<pb n="19"/>
               accompanied by priests and all other necessaries of Christian worship. As it was from the trained ranks of the priesthood that the best die-sinkers were recruited, there is little doubt that the Godwine of the coins was one of the clerical followers in Olaf's service, and that he did all the work of designing and striking the coins. Judged by extant illustrations of the one formerly in evidence, the coins were superior in workmanship to those of the issues of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad, and unlike them, also, the legends are strictly accurate indicating the work of a trained craftsman.</p>
            <p>The inscribing, on both sides of the coins, of the name of the country of origin was not, at the time, peculiar to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. In the neighbouring Kingdom of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> the same practice was adopted by the contemporary King <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn Forkbeard</name>. The custom of the two countries was, therefore, as might be expected, the same.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> met his death, in the year 1000, in the great sea-fight at Swald,
<pb n="20"/>
               a river mouth on the Pomeranian coast, to the west of the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2843325">island of Rügen</name>, where he was ambushed by a confederation of <name type="pname">Danes</name>, under <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn Forkbeard</name>, and Swedes, under <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49198178">Olaf Skötkonung</name>. The former, of course, continued is country's ancient feud, whilst the latter entered the struggle because of an insult offered to his mother, Sigrid the Haughty, by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name>.</p>
            <p>The victors had agreed to divide <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> between them. The southern shores of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, from the Naze eastwards, fell to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn</name>, that is to say, the part of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> which the Danish Kings always claimed. The Swedish King obtained seven shires in the Throndelaw, whilst the coastlands from the Naze northwards were given to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Eric Hakonson</name>, with the title of Jarl or Earl. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Eric</name> had, on the conquest of his father by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name> in 995 A. D., fled to the court of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn Forkbeard</name>, and had been given the latter's protection and his daughter <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q2995934">Gytha</name> in marriage. As <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">weyn's</name> son-in-law, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Eric</name> had assisted in the fight at Swald 
<pb n="21"/>
               against his hereditary enemy, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14745917">Olaf Trygveson</name>. The circumstances of this partial restoration to the domains of his father <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name>, point, however, to his complete dependence on the Danish King, and there is nothing in his later history to show that he obtained sovereign power in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. In fact, the incidents of his life indicate that he was throughout purely a vassal of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>. It is unlikely, therefore, that a separate coinage for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> was struck whilst he was earl, although a coinage was formerly attributed to him, a specimen of which, from the collection formed by the writer, is illustrated as figure 3.</p>

               <name type="pname">Hildebrand</name>, however, in the work before cited, considered that this attribution was inaccurate, and his opinion is certainly supported not only by the history of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Eric Hakonson</name> but also by the style of the coins, by the Earl's name on the obverse, and the form of the lettering generally. In fact, it is fairly clearly demonstrated by Dannenberg in <hi rend="italic">Die Dcutschen Münzen dcr Sächsischen and Fränkischcn Kaiserzeit</hi> that these coins belong to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_54940082">Henry</name> the Good, Count of Stade, 976-1016, a town near the estuary of the Elbe.</p>
            <p>As before mentioned, when <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> was partitioned in 1000, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn Forkbeard</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> obtained the coastlands of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> immediately to the North of his own lands of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">East</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">West Denmark</name>, but there is no evidence that he struck

               coins for his Norwegian provinces. On the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn</name>, in 1014, there ensued a time, however, when a Danish coinage for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> was not only possible, but probable. From the obscurities of the records it seems that Canute, who had been nominated as the successor to Sweyn's pretensions in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, secured also some sovereignty in <name type="place">Southern Norway</name>, i. e., the Danish share of that country. When Canute was forced to fly from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> in 1014, he retired to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> and there preferred a request to <name type="pname">Harold</name>, his brother, to share with him the Danish throne, carrying with it the sovereignty of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q648851">South Norway</name>. But although <name type="pname">Harold</name> strenuously opposed the proposition to share his Kingdom so far as <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> was concerned, he appears to have made no objection to Canute ruling in <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q648851">South Norway</name>. That Canute had authority there at this time is supported by a few coins, inscribed with his name, and, on the reverse, his territory of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. Although these are attributed by <name type="pname">Hildebrand</name> in his catalogue of Anglo-Saxon

the known specimens are from <name type="place">Scandinavian</name> hoards. Secondly, the work and inscriptions are so like the undoubted Norwegian coin represented by figure 5 that no numismatist will hesitate to ascribe the two emissions to the same hand. Finally, Asthrith is a name known only on these two issues of coins, the one of Canute and the other of Olaf. It is an old Norse name made up of the well known masculine prototheme As—, and the equally common feminine deuterotheme—thrith. The two, in conjunction, like many analogous cases, e. g., Ead— and —mund, equals Eadmund, were given to men.</p>
            <p>Following the custom of the previous coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> (figure 2), and the earliest coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, and having regard to the identical reverse of the penny of <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name> (figure 5), the abbreviation, NOR, on the reverse of these pennies of Canute, figure 4, stands, not for Norwich in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>, as <name type="pname">Hildebrand</name> thought, but for Normanorum; and Asthrith was, therefore, a moneyer of 
<pb n="26"/>
               <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. Further, it was a frequent practice for Canute when he became King of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, to place on his Danish coins the name of the most important part of his dominions, viz., <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> (Anglorum), and his pretensions to that title at the time of issue of the Norwegian coins under notice would cause him to be all the more likely to have authorized its use on any money he may have struck for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. An analogous illustration is to be noticed in Canute's use of his Anglian title on his Danish coins,-issued when he succeeded his brother to that Kingdom. An example is given as No. 24. Plate II, in Hauberg's <hi rend="italic">Myntforhold og Udmyntninger i Danmark indtil 1146.</hi> The inscriptions are there shown as follows:</p>
            <p>Obv: CNVT REX ΛNG = Canute, King of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>.</p>
            <p>Rev: OSGVT MN ON DAN = Osgut, the moneyer of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>.</p>
            <p>The evidence of this Danish money with the Anglian title on the obverse, thus supports the present attribution of the
<pb n="27"/>
               Norwegian coins of Canute with similar characteristics, now under notice. Concerning this point, it should be mentioned that some coins of Magnus the Good, struck for use in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, have on the reverse the Norwegian title. (See Number 28, Plate I, in <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_272892085">Schive</name>, and Number 38, Plate III in <name type="pname">Hauberg</name>, in the work previously quoted.)</p>
            <p>With the additional evidence now brought forward, there is no good reason for sharing Schive's doubt of the place where the coins of <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name> (figure 5), were struck, viz., their natural place, in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, and not the unlikely town of Norwich in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. Although I can trace no elaboration of his views, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_5007987">Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt</name>, in his "Coinage of the European Continent", also gives coins of Canute reading <hi rend="italic">Cnut Rex Anglor</hi> to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>.</p>
            <p>The probable explanation is that, at the time of Canute's succession to the English throne, on the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn</name>, a small issue of coins of similar type to the Norwegian pieces under notice was made, and
<pb n="28"/>
               when Canute was forced to fly from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> the die-sinker responsible for the issue fled with his master and engraved similar coins in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> both for Canute and, later, for <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name>.</p>
            <p>But Canute's coinage for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> was undoubtedly shortlived. As previously mentioned, <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name> succeeded in his attempt on the Norwegian patrimony of his forefathers and became King of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> in 1016, and he not only conquered the North but also the South of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. The decisive battle of the Nesses, March 25th, 1016, in which Olaf defeated the last of the forces adhering to the cause of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Eric Hakonson</name>, was fought off the coast of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q648851">South Norway</name> which had formerly been the Danish share of Norwegian territory. In this important district Canute's die-sinker and moneyer, Asthrith, probably worked; and after the battle referred to above he must have entered the service of Olaf, to whom the advantages of a coinage, not only for commerce but as an expression of sovereign authority, were well known.
<pb n="29"/>
               This change of service is not surprising, for skilled workmen of this sort were scarce in the North. The resultant coinage is illustrated by figure 5, from a cast kindly provided by the Keeper of Coins in the Swedish Royal Cabinet, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2673722">Stockholm</name>.</p>

            <p>The coins are, as previously mentioned, of the same design and reverse inscription as the Norwegian coins of Canute, figure 4, and no doubt their issue followed the latter as quickly as it was possible to make new dies. Had a long interval elapsed, the two emissions would not have had such strikingly similar features.</p>
            <pb n="30"/>
            <p>The title given on the obverse of the coins of Olaf is peculiar. As the engraver, judged by the coins of Canute of similar type, was quite capable of making a die correct as to the title of the king, it is remarkable to find what, at first sight, appears to be a corruption in this particular on the coins struck for <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name>, and I venture to suggest that the variation was, after all, intentional and not the result of carelessness. The two native princes of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> prior to Olaf, viz., <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Eric Hakonson</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon Ericson</name>, held only to title of Jarl. The die-sinker of Olaf's coins might, therefore, reasonably have been a little in doubt as to the correct title of Olaf, especially in the early years. He, therefore, punched in the dies letters combining the two, I standing for Jarl as in the case of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad, figure 2, and EX for REX. That it was the intention to separate the two is evident, from the + between I and EX. A similar instance of the dual title of Earl and King is in evidence on the <name type="place">Scandinavian</name> coinage of Sihtric
<pb n="31"/>
of Northumbria, issued over a century before. The combination of A and NOR in the territorial title is suggestive also of a doubt as to the extent of Olaf's dominions.</p>
            <p>Olaf is worthy of particular mention, not only in connection with these coins of similar character to those of Canute, but also for his close connection with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> prior to his conquest of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. He appears to have entered the English service in 1012, and, with another famous viking, Thurkil the Tall, was largely instrumental in repelling the Danish attack on <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name> under <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn Forkbeard</name> in 1013. When the Anglo-Saxons finally submitted to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn</name> later in the same year, Olaf entered the service of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_292106040">Richard</name>, Duke of Normandy, to whom he was of material assistance. Whilst in Normandy he met the fugitive King Æthelred II of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> and accompanied him to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> on his return there in 1014, following the sudden death of the Danish King <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_223321118">Sweyn</name>. There is no doubt that he contributed largely to the recon-
<pb n="32"/>
               quest by Æthelred of his kingdom, followed by the withdrawal to Denmark of Canute, Sweyn's son and successor. In the following year, 1015, Olaf made his descent on <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, doubtless long projected, at the time when <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Jarl Eric Hakonson</name>, as the vassal of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, left his earldom to aid Canute in the reconquest of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. As previously mentioned Olaf was successful in his enterprise and became King of the whole of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> in 1016.</p>
            <p>The weight of Olaf's coins of the issue shown in figure 5 is about 18 or 19 grains troy, as in the case of the similar pieces of Canute, and they were probably struck in <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q648851">South Norway</name> for trading purposes in the adjoining territory of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>. <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q648851">South Norway</name> was, of course, the land formerly governed by the <name type="pname">Danes</name>, whose early money for their own country appears to have been much lighter than the coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49198178">Olaf Skötkonung</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_8816201">Hakon</name> the Bad of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. The pennies of these two latter princes are nearly double the weight of those of the Southern

               Kingdom of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, generally scaling to 32 or 33 grains troy.</p>
            <p>A coin of <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name> of this weight, and therefore probably minted in <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q214041">North Norway</name> for trade with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2661886">Sweden</name>, is described hereunder for the first time. It is illustrated as figure 6 and is in the possession of the writer.</p>

period in Searle's <hi rend="italic">Onomasticon Anglo-Saxonicum.</hi> The use of the D for Ð (the runic th) was common in the Anglo-Saxon coins of the same era.</p>
            <p>The necessity for placing, on the coin, the name of the local district and of the mint name, is evident from our previous consideration of the coinage of Olaf for <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q648851">South Norway</name>, and, as the two issues of coins are of the same type, they were probably struck at approximately the same time, the one for <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q648851">South Norway</name> and the other for <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q214041">North Norway</name>. I consider that both were issued early in the reign of Olaf. This is evident not only from the almost exact similarity of figure 5 with figure 4, but because figure 6 is of the heavy weight of the early Swedish money. This was reduced by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_130935164">Anund Jacob</name>, who succeeded his father <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_49198178">Olaf Skötkonung</name>, on the Swedish throne, in 1022; and it is probable that money for <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q214041">North Norway</name> would, for economic reasons, have followed suit.</p>
            <p>Five other coins are attributed by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_272892085">Schive</name> to <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name>, but of two only
<pb n="35"/>
is there sufficient evidence of a clear attribution to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, and of one of these there is grave doubt whether it was issued as a coin at all. As regards the three others, their confused and uncertain inscriptions, and the character of their workmanship as a whole, render their attribution to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> more than doubtful. Until coins with the same art feeling, but with intelligible legends are discovered for comparison, I consider they should not be attributed specially to Norway.</p>

            <p>An illustration of the first of the two pieces of which there is little doubt of the attribution to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, is given as figure 7, from a cast kindly furnished 
<pb n="36"/>
               by the Keeper of the Royal Cabinet of Coins in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2673722">Stockholm</name>.</p>
            <p>The legends read as follows:</p>
            <p rend="hang">Obv: ✠ ONLΛF R✠ NORMANORV<hi rend="sup">•</hi> = Olaf King of Norway</p>
            <p rend="hang">Rev: ✠ DOMINADS....CF.... = Dominadus me fecit.</p>
            <p>While the inscription on the obverse reads with absolute clarity, the lettering on the end of the reverse legend is unfortunately obscure; but having regard to the undoubted use of the expression <hi rend="italic">me fecit</hi> on the coins of Olaf's son, not to mention its probable use on the coins of Olaf previously considered (figure 6), I think that the obscure part of the lettering on the coin under notice (figure 7), indicates the same words. The object in front of the King's bust is undoubtedly intended to represent a sceptre.</p>
            <p>The weight of the coin is about 47 grains troy, but it will be observed that the piece was circulated from the mint in an untrimmed condition. Allowing for the large margins which should have
<pb n="37"/>
been sheared off, the weight of this piece would probably have been worked down to the standard of that of the penny of <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name> previously considered, viz., about 32 grains troy. (See figure 6.)</p>
            <p>The designs, although having many points in common with the preceding issue, differ from it in some details. On the reverse, the three crescents at the points of the double cross are omitted, and on the obverse the King's headdress is reminiscent of the Anglo-Saxon pointedhelmet type of Canute the Great on which appeared a sceptre also.</p>
            <p>The last piece which comes under the present review is illustrated by figure 8, from a cast of the coin also in the Royal Cabinet at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2673722">Stockholm</name>.</p>

            <p rend="hang">Rev: ✠ BEORN ON (retrograde).</p>
            <p>The peculiar designs of the Lamb of God on the obverse and of the Dove of Peace on the reverse (the nimbus shows that it is not the pagan Danish raven), and the unusual inscriptions of this piece stamp it as altogether peculiar, and, in my view, it was not struck primarily as money but as a commemorative issue. Its period would be fairly early in the reign of Olaf the Saint, for the prototype is to be found in a commemorative issue of similar design made by Æthelred II in <name type="place">Anglo-Saxon Britain</name>, about 1014. That it was not ordinary currency is certain from the absence of the King's bust on the obverse, a universal feature on the coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> of the time, as of those of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q4798430">Britain</name>. And on this Norwegian issue is the further and remarkable feature of the omission of the King's name.</p>
            <p>From the account before given of his activities in <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q4798430">Britain</name>, it will be seen that 
<pb n="39"/>
Olaf was, prior to becoming King of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, one of the staunchest allies of Æthelred II against the <name type="pname">Danes</name>, and he contributed largely towards Æthelred's restoration to his throne. He would undoubtedly be aware of the Agnus Dei pieces of <name type="place">Anglo-Saxon Britain</name>, commemorative of God's Providence in restoring Æthelred II again to the English throne, in which Olaf took a leading part, and the probabilities are strong that some of the pieces which, no doubt, also partly served as currency, were in Olaf's treasure chest when he crossed to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name> in 1015. Prior to this enterprise he had become a Christian, having been baptized by <name type="pname">Archbishop Robert</name> in Rouen Cathedral in 1013-1014, whilst in the service of the Duke of Normandy, and I suggest that, as in the case of the somewhat similar pieces of Æthelred II, a feasible explanation of these interesting memorials, of which figure 8 is an example, is that they were commemorative of Olaf's restoration to the throne of his forefathers, and the defeat, by God's
<pb n="40"/>
Providence, of his enemies. Alternatively, they might have been struck to commemorate the proselytizing of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>, for which work Olaf is today mainly celebrated. An explanation such as one of these is necessary to account for the unusual characteristics of the pieces under notice.</p>
            <p>The work was, there is little doubt, carried out by one of the clerical assistants in the service of Olaf, amongst whom, according to Adam of Bremen, were men who were famous for learning and virtue.</p>
            <p>It is a matter of common historical knowledge that <name type="pname" corresp="wikidata_Q11776149">Olaf the Stout</name> was forced to flee from his country in 1028, through the pressure of Danish intrigue, and his return in 1030 culminated in his death at the battle of Sticklestead, fought in the same year. It was after this event that Olaf was designated as the Saint, the appellation by which he is now chiefly known.</p>
            <p>For some years subsequent to the death of Olaf the Saint, Norway came entirely
<pb n="41"/>
               under the dominance of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032"></name>; and when Magnus the Good, Olaf's son, at last came into his own, in 1035, he appears to have had no leisure for seeing to the special issue of coins for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>. In fact, he was continually at war with <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_66001922">Harthacnut</name> of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>. It was only on his accession to the Danish throne, on the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_66001922">Harthacnut</name>, in 1042, that a coinage was issued in his name and then only for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name>, although on a few rare specimens of these Danish coins there appears the Norwegian title instead of the usual Danish one, in the same way as the Anglian title sometimes appears on Canute's coins for <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2623032">Denmark</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3144096">Norway</name>.</p>
            <p>The next coinage for Norway was that struck by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_288239425">Harold Sigurdson</name>, but it follows native instead of Anglo-Saxon models, and it thus commences a fresh period of Norwegian monetary history which is beyond the scope of the present treatise.</p>
