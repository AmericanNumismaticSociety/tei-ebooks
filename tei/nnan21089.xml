            <p>From a numismatic standpoint, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> is one of the most interesting countries of Europe. There have been few great movements affecting the map of that continent or the welfare of its people without the participation of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. Because of this share in matters of historical importance, French Orders and Decorations, and French awards of honour and bravery have a variety of form and design which would hardly be found in a nation of fewer political upheavals.</p>
            <p>The present material is submitted in the hope that it may stimulate interest in this branch of Numismatics. Many of the problems which have arisen in its study are complicated; no adequate treatment of them has been found in English. As much of the

material is in foreign languages, scattered through many volumes, it is to be hoped that this paper will prove useful and of interest to collectors.</p>
            <p>From 496 to 1783 there were thirty-four Orders created in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. Few, if any, have remained in continuous existence since the beginning of the 19th Century. (See table, pp. 102‚Äì105.)</p>
            <p>ORDRE DE LA SAINTE-AMPOULE. The earliest of these French Orders was created in the year 496 by <persName>Hlodiwig</persName>, called the Great, but better known as <persName corresp="#viaf_262645254">Clovis I</persName>, fifth king of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, 481 to 511. The <hi rend="italic">Ordre de la Sainte-Ampoule</hi> (Order of the Holy Vial) was probably established in 493, soon after he married <persName>Hlotechild</persName>, or <persName>Clothilde</persName>. She was a Christian maiden; and coming under her influence and that of Remigues, Bishop of Rheims, Clovis embraced Christianity. He was baptized by <persName>St. Remi</persName> in 496, thus sealing an alliance with the Church. Little if anything can be learned as to the period this Order was in existence or concerning its discontinuance. It is said that an

effort was made to revive it during the Restoration but this fact has not been confirmed. The insignia illustrated appears to be of the 18th or 19th Centuries which would indicate an attempted revival of the Order. It is a white enamelled gold cross, with a white and gold dove symbolic of the Holy Spirit. Below it is a jar or vial, also of gold. Gold fleurs-de-lis are in each of the angles of the cross. The enamelled reverse bears the effigy of a bishop in white and red robes. With a staff in his left hand, he stands with his right hand raised invoking a blessing. The ribbon is black moir√©.</p>
            <p>HOSPITALIERS DE SAINT-JEAN DE JERUSALEM. This Order was founded in 1048 by pilgrims to the Holy City. There they had established a hospital for the care of their sick and needy brethren. They were not too pious to fight and when harassed by the Mohammedans in 1118, it was found necessary to change their organization into a religious Order of Chivalry. At one time they were located in the island of <placeName corresp="#geonames_146669">Cyprus</placeName>, and from 1310 to 1522 the island of <placeName corresp="#geonames_400665">Rhodes</placeName>.

In 1530 the home of the Order was transferred to the island of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2562770">Malta</placeName>. They were driven from there by <persName corresp="#viaf_106964661">Napoleon I</persName> in 1798. They sought refuge in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3169070">Rome</placeName>, where their headquarters is maintained to this day.</p>
            <p>Some writers class this Order as Papal; by others it is spoken of as the Knights of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2562770">Malta</placeName>. It really belongs to several countries, for early in its history langues or branches were established in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, Provence, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3035876">Auvergne</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>. The last of these was later divided to create the langue of Castile. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, the langues of Aragon and Castile united under one authority in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. Some of these langues are independent of the Roman Headquarters.</p>
            <p>The Order of the Hospitalers of St. John of <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> is influenced and almost entirely managed by members of the Church of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>; and the hospitalers confine themselves entirely to charitable and hospital work.</p>
            <p>The French branch of this Order is not only the oldest but it is the only one in continuous existence since the day of the
<pb n="7"/>
Crusader. All the branches use the white enamelled Maltese Cross for their insignia of the Order, but with slight variations. <placeName corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</placeName> has the gold double-headed, triple-crowned eagle in the angles of the cross. For <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, the lion and the unicorn appear in the alternate angles. Black eagles with gold crowns are used by <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>; while <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> use the golden fleurs-de-lis in the angles and suspend the cross from a crown, with a ring for the ribbon which in all cases is black moir√©. The Papal cross is unadorned in the angles though surmounted by a crown.</p>
            <p>The banner of the Order is the plain white cross used by the Crusaders. When <persName>Amadeus V,</persName> Count of Savoy, rendered such heroic assistance to the Knights of <persName>St. John</persName> during the attack on <placeName corresp="#geonames_400665">Rhodes</placeName> by the Turks under <persName>Mahomet II</persName> in 1315, he was granted for his personal use the Arms of the Order and given a collar with the letters F. E. R. T., standing for <hi rend="italic">Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit</hi> (By his bravery, <placeName corresp="#geonames_400665">Rhodes</placeName> was held). This cross became the Cross of Savoy, and the letters F. E. R. T. appear on several of the

Orders of that country. The Cross is still in use there and appears on the Italian flag, medals and coinage, the present Dynasty being of the House of Savoy.<ref target="CH1-n1">

            <p>ORDRE DU SAINT-S√âPULCRE. It is difficult to assign the founder or ascertain the date of the origin of this Order. A variety of opinions is recorded by the authorities. Some attribute it to <persName>Saint James</persName>, the Bishop of <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName>, in the year 69 and others to <persName>St. Helena</persName>, the mother of <persName corresp="#viaf_97746098">Constantine</persName>, in 326. Pope <persName corresp="#viaf_2501524">Alexander VI</persName> wished to be considered as the founder of the Order, in 1496. As the majority of writers give much credit to "Godefroy de Bouillon, duc de Basse-Lorraine," the first King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName>, and fix the year as 1099 when the Crusaders again entered <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName>, we are not without warrant for classing it among the French Orders.</p>
            <p>During the 12th Century this Order was established at <persName>Saint-Samson d'Orl√©ans</persName>, and later spread throughout <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>.

            <p>ORDRE DU SAINT-ESPRIT. This Order was established on December 30, 1578, by <persName>Henry III</persName> (1551‚Äì1589). The object of this Order was to offset the power of the Holy League and to maintain the Catholic Religion, as well as to uphold the dignity of the nobility.

The Order was suspended in 1791, revived in 1814 by <persName>Louis XVIII</persName>, and discontinued in 1830 when <persName>Louis Philippe</persName>, Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2989317">Orleans</placeName>, ascended the throne of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. At that time many of the Peerages and Orders revived

            <p>During the reign of <persName>Louis XVIII</persName> the Order of the Holy Spirit ranked in importance with the Order of the Garter of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and the Order of the Golden Fleece of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. In 1817 the Danish Ambassador presented the Order of the Elephant of <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q976544">Denmark</ref> to the French King.

               <p>ORDRE NATIONAL DE FRANCE. This Order was projected by a Committee of the Constituent Assembly in 1789. It is cited by <persName corresp="#viaf_12609172">A.-M.

               <p>The decoration is a white enamelled gold cross, with double points which are ball-tipped. Fleurs-de-lis are in each angle. In a blue medallion on the obverse are the letters <hi rend="italic">R.N.</hi> (signifying <hi rend="italic">R√©compense Nationale).</hi> This is surrounded by a white circle inscribed <hi rend="italic">INSTITUE EN 1789.</hi> On the reverse are two clasped hands in white on a blue field, surrounded by a white circle containing the legend <hi rend="italic">PRIX DE VERTU.</hi> The ribbon is the tri-colour of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>.</p>

               <p>There were four grades of membership in the Order‚ÄîL√©gionnaires (later called Chevaliers), Officers, Commandants (later called Commanders) and Grand Officers. <persName corresp="#viaf_106964661">Napoleon</persName> created a fifth grade in 1805, called Grand Eagles or Grand Crosses. There were in addition educational and charitable organizations, such as schools where children of the L√©gionnaires were educated and orphan boys received military training. The Decoration of the Order was originally called the Eagle, though in the form of a five armed cross.

                  <p>ORDRE DES TROIS TOISONS D'OR.

                  <p>D√âCORATION DU LIS. During the early days of the first Restoration, upon his arrival in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2968815">Paris</placeName> on April 12, 1814, the Count d'Artois (later <persName>Charles X</persName>. 1824‚Äì1830) caused to be distributed to the National Guard of that City, white ribbons, which were to be worn as a badge of fidelity. To perpetuate the remembrance of this distribution, they were later granted the right to suspend from the ribbon a silver fleur-de-lis. For his attendants this device was surmounted by a Royal crown. Such was the origin of the <hi rend="italic">D√©coration du Lis</hi>, sometimes called the Order of the Lily. The form of the lily, as well as the design of the ribbon, varies with each Department of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>.

arm. Some are all green, others white with green borders. On this band is embroidered a heart and the inscription <hi rend="italic">BORDEAUX 12 MARS 1814</hi>. Later, another form was adopted.

To reward the citizens who had distinguished themselves during those three famous days, the <hi rend="italic">Croix de Juillet</hi> was authorized by the decree of December 13, 1830. Although called a cross, it has but three double pointed arms which are ball-tipped. It is on a wreath of oak leaves and surmounted by a mural crown. At the centre of the obverse, are red, white and blue enamelled bands encircling the Gallic cock, with the words <hi rend="italic">PATRIE ET LIBERTE</hi> on the red band. The reverse is similarly banded with <hi rend="italic">27, 28, 29 JUILLET,</hi> in three lines on the blue centre, <hi rend="italic">1830</hi> on the white band and <hi rend="italic">DONNE PAR LE ROI DES FRAN√áAIS</hi> on the outer band of red.

There is also a slight variation in the way the hair of Ceres is tied. The ribbon has always been the same‚Äîorange, edged with green.</p>

some manufacturers of medals in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2968815">Paris</placeName> have issued one, but this is not official.</p>

                  <p>M√âDAILLE DE LA RECONNAISSANCE FRAN√áAISE. One of the most highly prized of the recent Decorations of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> was adopted in July, 1917.

                  <p>This decoration has been conferred on several American and British citizens for their charitable work during the late war, and is considered by some a higher distinction than the <hi rend="italic">L√©gion d'Honneur.</hi>

                  <p>In addition to the foregoing Orders, Decorations and War-medals, there have been many other awards. These have been issued for Education, Life-saving, Service in the Police and Fire Departments, Merchant Marine, and other Government Departments, and conferred chiefly on civilians. They are of gold, silver or bronze, according to the importance of the award. The numismatist, therefore, will have no inconsiderable task in securing specimens of all the French medallic awards.<ref target="CH1-n7">
