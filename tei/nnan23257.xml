            </head>
            <p>The study of <persName>Alexander's</persName> coinage has been pursued for a long time and has interested a number of eminent numismatists.
               It is, of course, merely a part of the study of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and a part which omits or
               only slightly illumines the most famous aspects of that famous man. Yet the coins have some things to show which the texts pass over in silence
               and their evidence is as yet far from exhausted. The prodigious number of coins still in existence which bear his name and types has made it
               natural that a large part of the interest of those who have dealt with them should be devoted to trying to determine where they were struck and
               when. Much has been accomplished in this primary task of arrangement but much is still to be done. And beyond this question is the more
               fundamental one of what part the coinage played in the total functioning of <persName>Alexander's</persName> empire. We need to know not
               only where the coins were struck and when but by whose agency, in what quantity, with what purpose and to what effect. These pages raise and
               discuss some facets of the problem. They are essays only and far from a definitive treatment. In some cases they are premature, propounding
               questions which further evidence will presently resolve, and sometimes new evidence has accumulated during the time the book was being composed.
               I must beg the reader's indulgence on the plea that what I am trying to do is not to settle questions so much as to raise them in the hope that
               they may ultimately be settled by the combined efforts of many with new material at their command and with different points of view which may
               supplement or invalidate my own. I have set down the phenomena that seemed to me most important from the beginning of <persName>Alexander's</persName> coinage to the end of its imitations. If the essays should attract new students to the Alexandrine coinage and somewhat
               advance the understanding of the experts they will, I believe, have justified their existence.</p>
            <p>The book has been a pleasure to write. It was begun and finished at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, for me certainly the ideal
               place for such a composition. The thought of my colleagues there and in the American Numismatic Society will always color these essays with the
               happiest memories. As in other cases, I have submitted my ideas to my most valuable mentors: <persName corresp="#viaf_51769105">E. S. G.
                  Robinson</persName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_381705">Henri Seyrig</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_109772791">Margaret
                  Thompson</persName>, not always convincing them but always profiting by their counsel.</p>

            <p>
               <persName>Alexander's</persName> coins are inscribed <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY</hi> or <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY BAΣIΛEΩΣ.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref>
               </hi> They are the king's money. Not in the way that the laws are the king's laws: abstractions of which he is the responsible source with the
               same relations to all men. Nor in the way that his sword and horse are the king's: by personal, absolute right, capable of being modified only by
               himself through gift or loan. Without the king's act, entirely without his knowledge, a man may acquire title to coins exactly as he can to any
               other piece of property. Doubtless the king could take them away from him, as he could take away his cattle or his house or his wife. Legally a
               man's money is no more vulnerable than any of his other possessions. There may have been a time when coins were the property of the king in an
               immediate and personal sense. Recently the interesting suggestion has been made that they were not originally intended for currency, but for
               payment of the Lydian king's mercenaries and that circulation was an incidental and unforeseen consequence.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> It is
               interesting to guess at the process by which the secondary function absorbed the primary one.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> It must have been
               early, for the silver of the Greek cities was surely intended as currency from the beginning. In any case, by <persName>Alexander's</persName> time all thought of personal connection between the king and his money had long since been forgotten. To one of his
               subjects the genitive on gold and silver must have meant that the coins were struck by authority of the king, from his metal and that they were
               the medium by which his government paid his obligations and received his dues. They would be legal tender wherever his power extended, for both
               types and weights were uniform.</p>
            <p>Their bullion value was supposed to equal their nominal value: a silver tetradrachm was taken to be four drachmae of silver. Yet, if that had
               been <pb n="2"/> strictly true, the whole expense of manufacture would have been borne by the king. Originally that may have been so. A man who
               was accustomed to receive his pay in electrum by weight (and by metal content if that was determined) would hardly be satisfied with a less
               amount simply because it bore a device when there were still unmarked dumps in circulation of full weight. There must have been some critical
               point at which the cost of manufacture was transferred from the minting authority to the user and there is no way of telling when that came, but
               it was before <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. His tetradrachms were in competition with those of Athens
               whose minting, as we know, was an important economic asset of the state. She certainly would not consciously lose by the process, and the
               simplest way to break even was to reduce the weight of each coin a little so that the part subtracted should be metal equal to the cost of
               manufacture. That is presumably what Athens did and what <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> did also.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> How much the deduction was we do not know. The tetradrachm was supposed to weigh 17.62 grams.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> Four drachmae of silver must have weighed somewhat more, but while the coins themselves conform to standard very well, such other
               weights as are preserved are not nearly so uniform, so that the attempt to find the weight of the official non-monetary drachm is not likely to
               be successful. No doubt it was all governed by law and the difference a matter of record. We know, from a much later period, what precautions the
               Athenians took to keep their weights and standards true; we know also that they were perfectly acquainted with a coin weight which was different
               from the commercial <pb n="3"/> weight.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> If the Macedonian citizens were aware that the government was issuing coins
               of less than full weight they probably cared very little. The conveniences of a money economy were worth much more than the amount involved.</p>
            <p>The king's money was struck in three metals and in a variety of denominations of which the following are the most important:</p>

            <p>The types of the gold have occasioned much comment. They are new to the Macedonian coinage and are usually, though not universally, regarded as
               having an Athenian origin. To be sure, their general propriety to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> is
               sometimes held to be sufficient explanation without closer investigation into details. <persName corresp="#viaf_14897764">Percy
                  Gardner</persName> represented this point of view:<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> the types of <persName>Philip's</persName> gold <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi>
               </hi> I, 1) "were by no means suited to the ambitious and soaring mind of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>,"
               who therefore selected Pallas "the patroness of the besiegers of Ilium" and a warlike Nike with a "trophy-stand." The curiosity of other
               scholars, however, has not been so easily satisfied, and a considerable literature has grown up about the identification of Pallas and Nike. In
               1847 <pb n="4"/>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_7485941">Charles Lenormant</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> deduced from comparison of the staters with the heads of Athena on vases and the later bronze coins of Athens that
               the goddess was Athena Promachus, Pheidias' heroic bronze statue which stood on the Acropolis between the Erechtheium and the Propylaea, a
               dedication, according to <persName>Pausanias</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> from the spoils of the Persians defeated at Marathon.
               In 1890 Ernest <placeName>Babelon</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> was quite willing to accept this and <persName corresp="#viaf_2598262">Charles Seltman</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> regarded the head as probably a free adaptation of Athena Promachus, perhaps convinced by the hearty support of
               this solution by Philip Lederer.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> Considering the uncertainties in regard to this celebrated statue, a positive
               identification is hardly safe,<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> but the other suggestions that have been made are not persuasive.</p>
            <p>1) Prokesch-Osten,<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> followed by <persName>E. J. Seltman</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> put forward
               as a possible original the ancient Palladium of Pella. This is met by Lederer<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> with the objection that <persName>Alexander's</persName> coins had and were intended to have an ecumenical importance and an obscure local deity would not suit his
               purpose at all.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> It may be added that when Pallas appears on the obverse of Pella's own coins<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> it is in the form of Athena Parthenus in obvious imitation of the New Style silver of Athens.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>2) <placeName>Babelon</placeName>, recanting his previous acceptance of Athena Promachus believed <pb n="5"/> that the type was Pallas "des
               monnaies de Corinthe"<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> in which he was followed by <placeName>Svoronos</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> who thought that the adoption of "Pallas Corinthienne" may have resulted from a decision of the Council of
               Corinth and who could not believe that relations between Athens and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> were
               such as to make his borrowing a device from her possible. This is a good example of an attempt to exalt likelihood into evidence. If there were
               no documents this might be regarded as an interesting possibility which, from frequent repetition, would come to be accepted as a fact. But here
               there is evidence, and one only has to compare the heads of Athena on the coins of Corinth (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, <hi rend="bold">I</hi>) and of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to see instantly that it is
               impossible that the latter should be derived from the former. If <persName>Alexander's</persName> goddess had been supposed to be the same
               person as that on the Corinthian silver she would have been made to look the same. What other way would there have been for men to recognize
               her?</p>
            <p>3) In a recent study of the whole problem of <persName>Alexander's</persName> imperial currency <persName>Gerhard Kleiner</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> urges, on grounds of historical probability, that the goddess is Athena of Ilium and that it was not until after
               his visit to Ilium that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> began to strike his own types on gold.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref>
               <persName>Kleiner's</persName> work is a connected whole and cannot fairly be disposed of piecemeal; it will be treated more thoroughly
               presently. But it may be said here that, on purely numismatic grounds, his suggestion is a weak one. Athena Ilias, as she is known to us from
               many coins (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 2,3), was a deity of very special appearance: she wore a polos, over her shoulder she held a filleted spear, and in her other hand was
               a distaff; that is, she was an Anatolian deity with more oriental than Greek features. If <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had had her in mind he could have produced a head with a polos. Now it is true, as <persName>Kleiner</persName> says,
               that on later coins of Ilium the head of Athena has other forms, one of which is like that on the staters. But the first coins have on the

               later under Seleucus I, again with Athena Ilias as a reverse type. To assume that there was an image at Ilium of the appearance of Athena
               Promachus is purely gratuitous; there were two forms of Athena known earlier on the coins and one of them is clearly named Athena Ilias on the
               2nd century silver<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>A user who knew both Athena Promachus and Athena Ilias must conclude that <persName>Alexander's</persName> type referred to the former and
               not to the latter.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> An Athenian model for the obverse of the gold is therefore still the most likely.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The reverse is quite as worthy of remark. Nike has a long and interesting career on ancient coins, but none of her previous appearances has any
               connection with Macedonia. This in itself raises no difficulty, and when the object in Nike's left hand was thought to be the frame for the
               erection of a trophy, it seemed a most appropriate augury of the future to which <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was entitled if any man ever was. But it was early noticed that the object assumed a great variety of forms and <placeName>Babelon</placeName> presently showed that it was, in fact, a stylis,<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> which he took to be an instrument
               for propping up the aphlaston on the stern of a Greek ship. The naval significance was accepted by <persName corresp="#viaf_115419736">Ernst Assmann</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> who asserted however that what was represented was actually a <placeName>Phoenician</placeName> standard,
               borne on the admiral's ship. Some part of his argument was met by <persName>G. F. Hill</persName> in the same number of the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Numismatik<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref>
               </hi>
               <pb n="7"/> and <placeName>Babelon</placeName> also answered him in a discussion much extended from his first essay<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> which proved that the object was not purely <placeName>Phoenician</placeName>. Its function, however, was hardly adequately
               treated until 1914 when <persName>Jean</persName>
               <placeName>Svoronos</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> argued with a wealth of illustration that the stylis was an image of the protecting deity set up on the stern of
               a ship. Whatever interpretations may be advanced in the future, one thing is clear: what Nike holds in her left hand has a naval significance.
               That does raise a difficulty, for it is well known that, at his accession, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               had no fleet and therefore no reason to select a type that meant victory at sea.</p>
            <p>There are three ways in which this dilemma is met: 1) by assuming that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               looked confidently ahead to victory at sea; 2) by assuming that he did not strike this gold at the beginning of his career but at a later time
               when it would have been appropriate; 3) by assuming that the stylis was part of the original on which <persName>Alexander's</persName> type
               was based and that he copied it as it was without concerning himself about its propriety in detail.</p>
            <p>1) Is by its nature incapable of proof, but certainly not very likely unless at the beginning of his career he expected to have the help of some
               other naval power. We do not know of any plans of his looking to control of the sea.</p>
            <p>2) Has been argued more than once. Its acceptance means either that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> struck
               no gold in the first years of his reign or that he continued to issue the types of his father (<ref target="#fig-7">PLATE I, 1</ref>–<ref target="#fig-9">3</ref>). There is, I think, no defender of the first alternative now, for it is clear that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> cannot have conquered <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>
               without money, and the mines of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> were still providing gold. We may assume that
               the second alternative is the only one which needs to be argued. It is generally assumed that the capture of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName> is the point at which such an announcement of naval supremacy would become appropriate. That is <persName>Assmann's</persName> theory in the article referred to: in 332 <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               found himself in the position of the <placeName>Phoenician</placeName> admiral and could adopt his insignia. In replying to <persName>Assmann</persName>, <placeName>Babelon</placeName> makes the interesting observation that by 332 there had been no sea battles (for the
               capture of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName> can hardly be considered such) whereas the army of the Great King had been
               defeated at Issus and one would be inclined to expect that the real victory would be commemorated on any device adopted then rather than a
               strategic situation which was not, in fact, of capital importance to his great conquests.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Assman</persName> is not the first to have put forward the theory that <persName>Alexander's</persName> coinage does not
               begin at the beginning of his reign. It appears as early as <persName>E. M. Cousinéry</persName> in whose <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Voyage dans la Macédoine</persName>
               </hi> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, 1831) there is a section, "<persName>Monnaies d'Alexandre</persName>" (pp.
               229–270). It is naive and careless in <pb n="8"/> detail (particularly in regard to the correspondence of text and illustrations) but it advances
               the doctrine which has had fuller and abler treatment since: that the first coins struck by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> were not those with his own types but a posthumous continuation of those of his father. "<persName>Nous ne
                  pouvons—nous</persName> refuser À croire qu'en entrant dans l'Asie, il ne soit borné À mettre en émission la monnaie de son père dans les trois
               metaux" (pp. 230f.). This is rejected by <persName>Müller</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> but has been revived in an impressive presentation: <persName>Kleiner's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>Alexanders Reichmünzen</persName>
               </hi>. It will be well, however, to deal first with Cousinéry's earlier and less important treatment, though this will make it necessary to
               anticipate our discussion of the silver.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Cousinéry's</persName> theory is founded on two convictions: first, that the head on the obverse of the silver is invariably a
               portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. "<persName>Cette tête ne présente rien d'idéal</persName>"
               he says (p. 236); he finds complete uniformity not only on the coins struck during <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime but also with
               the head in elephant-skin headdress issued by <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 4) and that with the horns of <persName>Ammon</persName> issued by <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 5), which he rightly recognizes as likenesses not of the kings who minted them but of their deified leader. Of these he gives
               engravings, but none of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> types to let the reader judge whether they are
               of invariable style. He does, indeed, remark that the flans of the coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>
               after its division by the <placeName>Romans</placeName> are thinner and broader, but there is no indication that he used this or any other
               criterion to distinguish the epochs to which <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins belong. Apparently he
               found the same face on the earliest <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>n silver and on the spread-flan tetradrachms
               which succeeded the collapse of the Seleucid power. His second conviction is the surprising one that it was the Greek cities, grateful for their
               deliverance from the Persians, which selected the types and manufactured the coins. A modern numismatist would hardly feel called on to refute
               this but, of course, if it were true it would mean that the silver types could not have begun until the cities had been freed. The gold, as
               already remarked, he thinks was subsequent to <persName>Alexander's</persName> visit to Ilium. The appearance of <placeName>Athena</placeName> on the obverse would be a natural consequence of the devotion there paid to her by the conqueror; the Nike of the reverse
               appears to be no problem to the author.</p>
            <p>After the Granicus <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> could use Persian gold and silver, but he continued to
               issue his father's types "soit par respect pour sa mémoire, soit À cause du crédit que ces monnaies avaient acquis partout où le nom de Philippe
               était parvenu. Ce que nous le prouve c'est la grande quantité de ces pièces qu'on ne cesse de découvrir dans toute l'Asie" (p. 231). This last
               remark is the only appearance of what can fairly be called evidence in a fabric of conjecture, and it is evidence which we can test to some
               extent. It is essential to distinguish <pb n="9"/> between the gold and silver. The gold of Philip achieved a great success as an international
               medium and its popularity was such that it certainly was issued posthumously.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> The wide currency of the staters is
               shown by the hoards in which they occur. There are 19 such hoards listed by Noe:<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> they come from <placeName>Bulgaria</placeName>, <placeName>Romania</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref>
               <persName>Philip's</persName> silver, on the other hand, had a more restricted territory. Among the barbarians of the north it was well
               received, so that from the mint of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> these types also were issued posthumously.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref>
               The great number of Celtic imitations, much commoner than those copied from <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>,
               is testimony to the success of the originals in that direction. But if the crossing to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>
               and the early campaigns there were financed with <persName>Philip's</persName> silver as well as his gold, which is essential to Cousinéry's
               theory, the hoards containing his silver should be conspicuous in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>. There are
               24 such hoards, and they come from <placeName>Bulgaria</placeName>, <placeName>Romania</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> It
               cannot be said that there is any lack of evidence from the territory with which we are concerned. From <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, the adjacent islands, and north <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>
               Noe's list has 140 hoards, and of these there are no less than 17 which contain silver of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref> And not one silver coin of <persName>Philip</persName> ! This is surely enough to
               justify us in asking "If <persName>Philip's</persName> silver was used in the first campaigns, where is it?"</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Kleiner</persName> deals with <persName>Alexander's</persName> coinage as a whole, which nobody had done since <persName>Müller</persName>. He has a familiarity with the literary sources which numismatists in general would do very well to match. He has
               supported his thesis with great learning and ingenuity, assembling much material on iconography with which also numismatists should be better
               acquainted than they are. It is quite impossible to do justice to the work in any résumé since it is a large body of related details but, though
               I feel called upon to disagree with him, I should like to do him as little injustice as possible.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Kleiner's</persName> thesis is that the imperial coinage—silver as well as gold—was inaugurated at the festival at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName> in the spring of 331 after <persName>Alexander's</persName> return <pb n="10"/> from
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> It was at that time that Harpalus, induced by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to return from his flight to Megara, was reinstated as treasurer. It is, of
               course, an attractive idea that so large and important a system should have been planned in advance and put into operation all at once, and the
               second visit to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName> would certainly be an appropriate moment for such an innovation. But <persName>Kleiner</persName> does not rely on this appropriateness alone. Like others, he maintains the improbability of <persName>Alexander's</persName> using Nike as a device before the capture of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName> (pp. 12, 20, 21); he
               denies that Pallas is a probable deity for him to have honored in the earliest years of his reign, before his visit to Troy (pp. 18, 19); and he
               adds a more complicated psychological argument. In 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>
               </hi>., to celebrate the freeing of the Greeks, gold pieces were struck with the portrait of Flamininus on the obverse, and on the reverse, with
               the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">T. QVINCTI,</hi>
               </hi> an imitation of <persName>Alexander's</persName> Nike with a palm substituted for the stylis (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 6).<ref target="#CH1-n40">40</ref>
               <persName>Kleiner</persName> regards this to be a presentation of Flamininus the Liberator as an equivalent for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Liberator. But he believes that if this type had been employed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> at the beginning of his reign it would have been remembered as the money of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Destroyer of Thebes and so altogether unsuitable for the model of a type in
               honor of emancipation, whereas if it had been introduced after his freeing of the Greek cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> there would have been no such objection (pp. 5, 6).<ref target="#CH1-n41">41</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These arguments, to my mind, are based on probability only and are therefore bound to fail if confronted with <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> to
               the contrary. And we have contrary evidence in three places. The first is the absence of <persName>Philip's</persName> silver in hoards from
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, already discussed in connection with Cou-sinéry. The other two are alike.
               In discussing the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref> and Myriandrus<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref> Newell shows how directly it was based on the coinage of the
               Persian satrap Mazaeus which preceded it. Now <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> entered <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> September 3, 333 and won the battle of Issus November 12 of the same year.<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref> If coins were issued
               from those mints as soon after falling into <persName>Alexander's</persName> hands as dies could be cut, obviously the theory that the first
               appearance of his <pb n="11"/> types was in the spring of 331 must be abandoned. <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>
               does not undertake to prove that the Greek coins follow the Persian ones immediately, though he certainly believed it.<ref target="#CH1-n45">45</ref> But there are only two other possibilities: either the mints were idle from 333 to 331 or, conformable to <persName>Kleiner's</persName> general theory, there were intervening issues bearing <persName>Philip's</persName> types. In the first case, some
               reason ought to be alleged; in the second, the issues ought to be identified. Unless or until these conditions are met, <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>'s hypothesis holds the field.<ref target="#CH1-n46">46</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Account should also be taken of the arrangement of the issues of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> in <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>'s study of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard.<ref target="#CH1-n47">47</ref> They
               extend from "circa 336 <hi rend="bold">B.C.</hi> to circa 318 <hi rend="bold">B</hi>.c.," the latter being the date of the hoard's burial (p.
               135); they are put in groups A to K. This arrangement the author justifies on pp. 68f.: "The dates here assigned the various groups of the <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> coinage are, perhaps, to a certain extent approximate. But even so, they cannot be in error by much more than a
               year either way." He points out that important confirmation for the dating of the earlier groups comes from a hoard buried at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyparissia">Kyparissia</placeName> in 328 or 327.<ref target="#CH1-n48">48</ref>
               <persName>Kleiner's</persName> theory, which does not affect the date of burial of the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard, would force
               us to compress this material by five years, reducing the groups from eleven to six. How is it to be done? It may be urged that <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> himself had revised an earlier arrangement, and so he had, and in important respects.<ref target="#CH1-n49">49</ref> There has been much new information made <pb n="12"/> available since his second study and that needs to be worked
               through; a particular need is the systematic treatment of the issues of <persName>Philip</persName> II. But it is not enough to say that
               this arrangement is fallible. It is founded on careful study and unless or until a better arrangement is proposed, we are not justified in
               lowering the beginning of the coinage by five years.<ref target="#CH1-n50">50</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I cannot see that <persName>Kleiner</persName> has done justice to the evidence of style. The difference between the earliest <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> heads from the different mints is made much of in the article by Gebaur to be
               discussed below.</p>
            <p>3) Such being the weaknesses of our second possibility, we are left with our third: namely, that <persName>Alexander's</persName> Nike is
               copied from one with which the stylis belongs. An <placeName>Athenian</placeName> origin was an obvious possibility to those who believed that
               Pallas on the obverse was <placeName>Athena</placeName> Promachus, but <placeName>Babelon</placeName> made the suggestion very specific by
               pointing out<ref target="#CH1-n51">51</ref> that Nike with a stylis upon a column beside <placeName>Athena</placeName> Promachus was painted
               on a Panathenaic vase of 336/5, the archonship of Pythodelos. This seemed to him more than a coincidence and he concluded that the two Nikai were
               related documents of a time of cordiality between the monarch and the city. Hill defended him against Assmann on matters of fact, but was not
               convinced by the suggestion that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had borrowed from Athens.<ref target="#CH1-n52">52</ref> Neither was <placeName>Svoronos</placeName> who, as already remarked, could not believe that at this time <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> would have had any reason to flatter the <placeName>Athenian</placeName>s as
                  <placeName>Babelon</placeName> thought. Instead, he suggested that it was the other way around and that the Nike on the Panathenaic vase
               was copied from "les types désormais historiques des statères qu' <persName>Alexandre</persName> venait de frapper dès son retour en
                  Macédoine."<ref target="#CH1-n53">53</ref> This was dismissed by Lederer as impossible because there was not enough time for the coins to have
               been struck and become so well known as to invite imitation in the year 336/5 after <persName>Alexander's</persName> return from the
               Congress of Corinth.<ref target="#CH1-n64">64</ref> On the other hand, he produced as evidence of the connection with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> a newly discovered gold stater on which the type of Nike was accompanied by Nike also as a symbol
               bearing an aphlaston and an obscure object which he thought might be a stylis. This unprecedented use of the same figures as both major and minor
               device he regarded as certainly calculated. Stylistically the coin belongs to <persName>Alexander's</persName> earliest <pb n="13"/> issues;
               Lederer believed that it was the very first die cut for the new king's gold (and possibly cut in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> itself). Moreover, he made more specific an idea that had already been advanced by <placeName>Babelon</placeName>. Golden
               Nikai had been dedicated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> in the latter half of the 5th century, but in the critical
               days of 407/6 they had, with one exception, been melted down into money. One was restored in 374/3 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>.,<ref target="#CH1-n55">55</ref> others by <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q211326">Lycurgus</persName> in the late 4th century. In this case we
               have a literary tradition and inscriptional evidence as well. The pseudo-Plutarchian <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Ten Orators</hi> (841 D and
               852 B) and <persName>Pausanias I</persName>, 29 both record the fact that <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q211326">Lycurgus</persName>,
               who was notable for the extent to which he restored her ancient riches to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, had
               presented to the goddess on the <placeName>Acropolis</placeName>, among other things, golden Nikai. Two inscriptions, IG<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               II, 333 and 1493 testify to that fact. Now when the gift was dated in 336, as understood by <placeName>Babelon</placeName>, a connection
               between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>' and <persName>Alexander's</persName> Nike is an obvious possibility, and
                  <persName>Lederer</persName> (p. 202) definitely holds the coin to be inspired by those restored statues. One item that makes this
               attractive is the fact that the figure is not at all what we should expect from the 4th century, whereas it is perfectly appropriate to a
               restoration of a 5th century original.<ref target="#CH1-n56">56</ref> Unfortunately for the theory in this form, the two inscriptions are now
               dated 334/3.<ref target="#CH1-n57">57</ref> It has been rescued, however, by a daring conjecture of Homer A. Thompson:<ref target="#CH1-n58">58</ref> to wit, that the restoration of 336/5 was an act of munificence of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> himself, whose selection of the type would then commemorate an act of generosity toward a city for which he had recurring
               moods of affection. We have only to read the speeches of the later Attic orators to find that not all <placeName>Athenian</placeName>s were
               his enemies; doubtless he had more friends than we know, and perhaps he thought he had more friends than he did. It is obvious that the only real
               objection to this solution is skepticism as to such cordial relations between <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> in 336.<ref target="#CH1-n59">59</ref> If that can be
               accepted, all difficulties are met. But we should have the candor to admit that the choice would not have been expected and is foreign to general
               historical probability.</p>
            <p>As to the obverse type of the silver, we are met with a different kind of question. The head of young <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> with a lion's skin covering had ample <pb n="14"/> precedent on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>n coins, having appeared under Archelaus I, 413-399, <persName>Amyntas</persName> III,
               389-383, 381-369, Perdiccas III, 364-359 and <persName>Philip</persName> II, 359-336.<ref target="#CH1-n60">60</ref> The legend of the
               descent of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>n kings from <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>, whenever it was invented, had been very useful to their claim to admission among the first families of the Hellenic world
               and no reason beyond tradition was needed for the adoption of the hero's portrait as a device. <persName>Kleiner</persName>, whose theory
               requires that the silver as well as the gold should have been inaugurated in 331, argues that <persName>Alexander's</persName> interest in
                  <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> was not conspicuous until the episode of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName>, after which his heroic ancestor assumes great importance in his life,<ref target="#CH1-n61">61</ref> but
               the conclusion is open to the same objections that have already been discussed in regard to the gold. The simplest explanation is that the new
               king adopted an old type but for a new denomination.</p>
            <p>It is natural that the question should have been repeatedly asked: "is the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> head a
               portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> himself?" There are really two independent questions, not always
               distinguished by investigators. Was it the intention of the die-engravers to produce a likeness (which might be true without any effect on the
               general public, most of whom would not have seen the king at close enough range to judge)? Was it the general persuasion that the head was a
               likeness of the king (which might be true without any such intent on the part of the die-engravers)? We have sundry bits of evidence that the
               second was true in later tradition.</p>
            <p>1) A very interesting tetradrachm was issued in the 2nd century B.C. by <persName>Agathocles</persName>, king of Bactria, one of a number
               honoring his predecessors. The obverse has the familiar head in lion's skin with the inscription AΛEΞANΞPOY TOY ΦIΛIΠΠOY (<ref target="#fig-43">Plate II, 7</ref>).<ref target="#CH1-n62">62</ref> Here <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> is altogether ignored
               and the portrait is meant to be not that of the deified conqueror but of Agathocles' royal but human precursor.</p>
            <p>2) At Alexandria-ad-Issum bronze coins were struck in the 1st century <hi rend="bold">A.D.</hi> (to judge by their style and fabric) on the
               obverse of which there is a <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>
               <pb n="15"/> head in lion's skin which, considering the town, must be understood as a picture of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n63">63</ref>
            </p>
            <p>3) A great many bronze coins were issued in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> in the 3rd century <hi rend="bold">A.D.</hi> with the head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on the obverse identified by the inscription
                  <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY (P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">late</hi> II, 8).<ref target="#CH1-n64">64</ref> The most favored portrait seems to be one with diadem and flowing hair,
               obviously modelled on the coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>, but there also appears the head in
               lion's skin headdress,<ref target="#CH1-n65">65</ref> which shows that at that period there was no doubt as to who was represented.</p>
            <p>4) Apollonia Mordiaeum struck a bronze coin in the time of Caracalla on which the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>
               portrait is identified by inscription as <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Founder of Apollonia.<ref target="#CH1-n66">66</ref>
            </p>
            <p>5) There is also an interesting mediaeval item in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>De Thematibus</persName>
               </hi> of the emperor <persName>Constantine Porphyrogenetus</persName> (945-959 <hi rend="bold">A.D</hi>.).<ref target="#CH1-n67">67</ref>
               Speaking of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>n kings who considered themselves descendants of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> who slew the Nemean lion, he reports that instead of taenia or crown or royal purple,
               they crowned themselves with the skin of a lion's head which they prized more than jewels. "Trustworthy proof of this is the coin of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> of Macedon adorned with that kind of portrait." So there were <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachms to be seen in the 10th century and at so late a date the answer to
               the second question is still that the head was commonly supposed to be that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, and surely it is not very daring to guess that the same answer would be right for a much earlier period, even the period of
                  <persName>Alexander's</persName> own lifetime. But for lack of a statement it cannot be proven.</p>
            <p>The first question may be debated and has been. It is unnecessary to refer to all the writers who have had their say, since some have nothing new
               to offer. A few believed that the head is always intended to be <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. We have
               seen that this is the position taken, for different reasons by <persName>Cousinéry</persName> and by <persName>Kleiner</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n68">68</ref> It was supported also by some of the older numismatists writing in <pb n="16"/> a day before the resource of
               abundant illustration, so that their conclusions could not be presented so as to convince the eye; nor, indeed, were their own convictions based
               on wide and intimate visual acquaintance with the material.</p>
            <p>Others have held that the head was never intended as a portrait. Such is <persName>Eckhel's</persName> belief,<ref target="#CH1-n69">69</ref> supported by a bookish argument characteristic of his time. He appeals to the words of Horace <hi rend="italic">(Epistles</hi> II.
               I. 239–41):</p>
            <p>"<persName>Edicto vetuit</persName>, ne quis se praeter Apellem</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Pingeret</persName>, aut alius Lysippo duceret aera</p>
            <p>Fortis <persName>Alexandri</persName> vultum simulantia."</p>
            <p>He might have added the passage from Pliny the Elder <hi rend="italic">(H. N.</hi> VII. 37. 125): Idem hic imperator edixit ne quis ipsum alius
               quam Apelles pingeret, quam Pyrgoteles scalperet, quam Lysippus ex aere duceret; and the later passage (XXXVII. 4.1) where the authorization of
               Pyrgoteles seems to apply only to carving in emerald.<ref target="#CH1-n70">70</ref> Even so fortified the argument does not amount to much. The
               meaning of the edict (whatever form it took) must have been that the king was not going to sit for his portrait to any artists except those
               three. He cannot have hoped, or desired, to prevent the making of copies and copies of copies by any who felt so inclined. Indeed we have ancient
               references to other portraits besides those of the official appointees.<ref target="#CH1-n71">71</ref> Die-sinkers could certainly make portraits
               of the king without breaking the law.</p>
            <p>Most of the discussions have been, of course, parts of more general inquiries into the portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in all media, but whether other kinds are included or not, the scholars have taken one of
               two positions, either denying that there were any numismatic portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               during his lifetime, or admitting that certain coins might be so considered. The former view has the weighty authority of <persName corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n72">72</ref> which is heartily supported by <persName>Theodor
                  Schreiber</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n73">73</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>According to them portraiture was an invention of the Hellenistic age, and the difference between one <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> tetradrachm and the next is to be explained by differences in time and place of striking and
               difference of die-sinkers. Both authors look to the issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi> II, 5) and <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName>
               <hi rend="bold">(<ref target="#fig-40">Plate II, 4</ref>)</hi> for real evidence as to the appearance of the king their master.</p>
            <p>But other scholars are not able to dismiss the differences so lightly and maintain, with greater or less conviction, that here and there <persName>Alexander's</persName> own face does appear under the lion's skin. It is noticeable that the numismatists are mostly very cautions
               and show no disposition to cite specific examples. <persName>Müller</persName> who, in his time, had studied a much larger body of material
               than anyone else, lays down the general principle that the earliest <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> heads of the
               reign are like their predecessors on the coins of previous kings, but that sometimes later, and commonly after 323 a likeness appears, not as a
               result of any command of the king but at the choice of the several magistrates or of the artists themselves.<ref target="#CH1-n74">74</ref> But
               there is no indication of where to look for these appearances. <persName corresp="#viaf_100184717">George MacDonald</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n75">75</ref> is very reticent: "Tradition, indeed, has it that <persName>Alexander's</persName> features are to be
               discerned in the head of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>—even if we grant that this is so, the very circumstance
               that portraiture was introduced in covert fashion, lurking under the shelter of religion, is highly significant." And <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> in a book where positive identification would certainly be appropriate,<ref target="#CH1-n76">76</ref> says only, "The silver coins invariably bear the head of the youthful <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>
               covered with a lion's skin—the features frequently resembling those of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               himself."</p>
            <p>There are those, however, who are willing to be more specific. <persName>E. Q. Visconti</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n77">77</ref> finds indication of the king's features on tetradrachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rhodes">Rhodes</placeName> and of <placeName>Ake</placeName>. <persName>G. F. Hill</persName>, more daring than his fellow numismatists, publishes
               "a head of young <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> r., with features resembling <persName>Alexander's</persName>."<ref target="#CH1-n78">78</ref> The coin is from Amathus in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Using <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>'s plates as a basis, <persName>Kurt Gebauer</persName> has a full and
               careful stylistic analysis of the coinage as the first part of his "<persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>bildnis
               und <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>typus."<ref target="#CH1-n79">79</ref>
               <pb n="18"/> He argues that the first pieces from the mint of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi> I, <hi rend="bold">II</hi>) and, to a lesser extent, the first from other mints, show a head which is perfectly
               characteristic of the mid-fourth century. Within the next half decade there is a breaking with tradition and a greater freedom and individuality,
               usually followed by a hardening into schematization. From this the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> mints never recover but those of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName>, farther from the artistic dominance of the homeland, and inheriting the traditions of
               local schools of art, produce essentially new portraits. From <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> in 327 comes a die which
               he recognizes as the first true likeness of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on a coin (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi> II, 9), the effect of the exciting news of his invasion of India upon the imagination of a gifted engraver. Thereafter
               there is no return to the impersonal and universal <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>, though the individual portrait
               too loses something of its original freshness. Another essay in portraiture comes from <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> in 316 <ref target="#fig-46">
                  <hi rend="bold">(PLATE</hi> II, 10</ref>), this time showing Lysippan influence. Gebauer regards the development of the head in the years
               after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death as a combination of the conception of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> as a god with that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> as an historic ruler, the various
               local streams finally merging in the full tide of Hellenistic art. The portraits which appear on the first silver of <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> and on both silver and gold of <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> are unmistakably identifiable as the deified <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
            <p>The article has excellent, clear and well-chosen illustrations. Its tone is logical and temperate and the case it makes is certainly a
               respectable one. Of course, the language of aesthetic criticism is hard. There is so much that the eye perceives that cannot be put into adequate
               words. And there are so many times when two beholders will perceive different things as to matters of expression and emotion. The difficulties
               are increased when the argument is not about single substantative works of art but, as here, about items selected as examples from a large group
               which has its inner differences as well as its common characteristics. Perhaps another scholar, working with the same material, might modify the
               course of this study and its conclusions. But it does seem to me that the argument is probable as a whole and supported by its details. It will
               be seen that it altogether rejects the idea that the broadcasting of his portrait was part of <persName>Alexander's</persName> original
               plan, or, indeed, that he had anything to do with it at any time. <hi rend="italic">A priori</hi> it would be attractive to think that it <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been part of the plan for the imperial coinage—that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had anticipated <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> and <persName>Seleucus</persName> and
                  <persName>Demetrius Poliorcetes</persName> in making use of his money to spread his fame. It has been suggested that he himself had been
               anticipated by his father and that the bearded head on <persName>Philip's</persName> silver was <pb n="19"/> intended at once for <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> and for the king.<ref target="#CH1-n80">80</ref> But in this case we have no reliable
               portraits of <persName>Philip</persName> preserved for comparison and the unproven possibility cannot be used to strengthen the case for
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
            <p>The different approach of Miss <persName>Bieber's</persName> "The <persName>Portraits</persName> of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great" leads to a similar result. As none of her predecessors had done, she
               "distinguishes between the different periods in which the bewildering varieties of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> portraits preserved for us have been created." Her only addition to the numismatic material in Gebauer's article is the
               enlargement, as fig. 32, of another coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> of about 320 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">II,</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">II</hi>).<ref target="#CH1-n81">81</ref> She would apparently not object to his theory that the first coin portrait came in 327,
               though she does not mention it. But none of her pictures which may derive from originals earlier than that time has any relation to the head on
               the first coins from <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, <placeName>Tarsos</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>, and of these the series from <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> is surely the first of all on the evidence of style.</p>
            <p>Both of these studies assume, as do <persName>Müller</persName> and Hill, that the appearance of a real portrait is the achievement of an
               individual engraver or perhaps an individual magistrate or satrap. On the other hand, <placeName>Erik <placeName>Sjöqvist</placeName>
               </placeName>, publishing a head in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Museum<ref target="#CH1-n82">82</ref> illustrates,

            <p>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> during his own lifetime. "It marks," he says, "the first decisive step in
               the evolution of an iconography that was totally new to Greek art: that of rendering an image of a deified ruler." He enumerates convincingly the
               specific traits which make this seem to be an actual individual and not a mere traditional convention, and he believes that the original is the
               official portrait of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in 332, probably by <persName corresp="#viaf_297421082">Lysippus</persName>. If we are dealing with an official program the result ought to be that from this time on the coins
               show with increasing frequency and success heads that are recognizably those of an actual person, somewhat idealized to be sure, but not those of
               a conventional hero. But do they? Comparison of the different specimens selected as likenesses by the various scholars raises a certain
               uneasiness in the mind of the beholder and a feeling that we need much more material than even Gebauer has provided.</p>
            <p>There is a certain deceptive pattern in the situation. On the one hand there are the coins earlier than <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> with a beardless head of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>.
               These cannot be portraits of him. They vary considerably in style but it is impossible that they should be portraits of the various rulers who
               struck them.<ref target="#CH1-n84">84</ref> They must be <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> alone. On the other hand
               there are the heads generally agreed to be posthumous portraits of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, issued
               by <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>.
               Between are the issues of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> himself which should be related to one extreme or
               the other. But it is not quite as easy as this, for no one has yet demonstrated the uniformity of the testimony of <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>. Indeed, a glance at
               Pl. IX of Hill's <hi rend="italic">Select Greek Coins</hi> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, 1927) which shows
               enlargements of coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and his two successors tempts us to wonder whether
               we may not recognize the later heads because they bear the accessories of divinization—the elephant's head and the ram's horns—and not because
               they resemble each other. We must never forget that we are dealing with the craftsmanship of many die-sinkers who varied greatly in skill and
               also—as Professor <placeName>Sjöqvist</placeName> reminds me—in sympathy with the idea of divinization. <persName>Alexander's</persName>
               mints never achieved, and probably never attempted the degree of uniformity shown in the <placeName>Athena</placeName> heads of 5th century
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. But what is the proportion between the specimens which show conformity with an
               official program and those aberrations of intent or execution which would seem to deny its existence? An enormous task awaits some heroic
               scholar: analysis which shall be not selective but inclusive of the dozens of dies of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>' head <pb n="21"/> to see what generalizations can be safely made. It must be done without preconceptions—and it might well
               end in failure. Perhaps some guidance can be provided by Cahn's synopsis of the elements which form style<ref target="#CH1-n85">85</ref> but it
               is a work not to be undertaken by the impatient or the faint of heart.</p>
            <p>For the present let us content ourselves with concluding that a traditional type was selected by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> as suitable for an imperial currency, which proved its acceptability in an empire wider than
               he could have imagined and that, at some times and in some places, true likenesses of the king and his commanding personality inspired the hands
               of his artisans so that men came eventually to believe that he and <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> were one.</p>
            <p>The reverse type is invariable in its main features. <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> is always seated to the left, he
               has an himation over his legs but is undraped from the waist up, on his outstretched right hand he holds an eagle, with his left he leans upon a
               long scepter behind him. There are details, with which we shall deal presently, that vary. He is sometimes called <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> Olympios.<ref target="#CH1-n86">86</ref> Yet there are important differences from the statue of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> that was at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName> in <persName>Alexander's</persName> time: the great chryselephantine statue by Pheidias. They have deterred most scholars from giving a title to
                  <persName>Alexander's</persName> deity. One other identification was put forward, but it cannot be seriously considered. Eckhel<ref target="#CH1-n87">87</ref> says "Jupiter hic Nicephorus (a mere slip for Aetophorus) haud dubie est Bottiaeus ille seu cultus in Bottiaea
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>e regione in qua sita Pella." Impressed by "haud dubie" from so great an
               authority, <persName>Müller</persName> accepted the name,<ref target="#CH1-n88">88</ref> and, in his early work<ref target="#CH1-n89">89</ref>
               <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> contributed a rhetorical flourish which his maturer judgment allowed to be
               forgotten: "on the reverse we see <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> of Bottiaea, who had a famous temple at Pella and was
               honored throughout <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>." But Bottiaean <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> is a very elusive figure indeed. The single ancient mention of him is by Libanius in connection with a dedication of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> at Antioch-on-the-Orontes (or rather where Antioch was later to be founded)<ref target="#CH1-n90">90</ref>. Any connection with the district of Bottiaea around Pella is conjecture and nothing more.</p>
            <p>The divergence from Olympian <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> is excellently stated by Cook in a passage worth quoting
               in full.<ref target="#CH1-n91">91</ref> "When <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great placed upon his <pb n="22"/> silver coinage the design of a seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName>, it might have been expected that he
               would choose for the purpose the great cult-statue at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>—and the more so as Mount
               Olympos was a prominent feature of his own domain. In point of fact, he did nothing of the sort. He set aside all the improvements introduced by
               Pheidias and deliberately reverted to the old pre-Pheidiac type. A comparison of his tetradrachms on the one hand with the federal coins of <placeName>Arkadia</placeName> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

            <p>The inference is clear. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, ignoring the idealized ruler at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</placeName>, harked back to the more ancient and popular type of <persName>Zeus Lykaios</persName>. After
               all, <placeName>Mount Lykaion</placeName> too was called Olympos. Yet so immense was the fame of the Pheidiac figure that tetradrachms issued
               later in the name and with the types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> are increasingly influenced by it.
               The left leg is advanced instead of the right, and the throne is manifestly assimilated to that of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> Olympios—so even <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> failed to arrest the moral evolution of
                  <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName>." To the resultant questions, "What motive led him to make the attempt? Why did he
               select for his world-wide coinage the old eagle-bearer of <placeName>Arkadia</placeName> rather than the newer and nobler creation of
               Pheidias?"—he has no answer to offer.<ref target="#CH1-n92">92</ref>
            </p>
            <p>But the particular form of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> was less important than the fact that, like <persName>Alexander's</persName> other devices, he was easy for inhabitants of the various districts <pb n="23"/> of the empire to accept as
               their own. <persName>Seltman</persName> has put the case clearly:<ref target="#CH1-n93">93</ref> "Though introduced in 336 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. these types were destined to appeal equally to <placeName>Greeks</placeName> and to Oriental subjects of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> as yet unconquered; for the <placeName>Phoenician</placeName> was to see in the obverse
               type his own god Melqart, the Cilician was to regard the seated deity as the god Ba'al of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, and the Babylonian,
               though he might not be able to read the Greek name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, was to look on
               pictures that might recall his own <placeName>Gilgamesh</placeName>, the lion-slayer, and the figure of Bel-Marduk, god of <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>. When it is realized that, next to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>,
               the greatest mints of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> were to be established precisely in <persName>Phoenicia</persName>, <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, and <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>, the uncanny foresight
               that the king showed in the selection of these types becomes apparent."</p>
            <p>Cook recorded the fact that the earliest pose, with the legs stiffly parallel, the right in front of the left, gives place to an easier position,
               more like that of Pheidias' figure, with the right leg drawn back and the right foot appearing in back of the left one <hi rend="bold">(PLATE</hi> II, 10, 11). This change does not take place everywhere at the same time, but it is general and is an indication of date rather
               than of place. But there are small differences which are useful for a more exact placing of the issues in their respective mints. Not only does
               the throne sometimes have a back (as mentioned by Cook) but the back may be decorated with little Nikai on the top, and the shape of the legs and
               the placing of the crossbars differ. The god is sometimes laureate; sometimes there are long locks on the nape of his neck, sometimes short ones,
               sometimes none. There may be a dotted exergual line beneath his feet, or a straight one, or a footstool, or nothing. Together with these items
               also goes a constant modification of style which is in itself sometimes sufficient to prove the relation between reverse dies without more
               objective variants.</p>
            <p>But far more important than other minutiae for the reverses of both silver and gold are the little ancillary figures—the symbols—or the letters
               or monograms which, with very few exceptions, occur in the field of the reverse type. They are not conceived as parts of the main design, as is
               evident from the fact that the scales of the type figure and the symbol are quite unrelated. Scholars were early convinced that symbols,
               monograms and letters alike were indications of the place of striking, and great ingenuity was displayed in recognizing civic devices and
               deciphering cities' names. Some of the suggestions were good and have been confirmed by later work with greater resources, though the original
               discoverer is sometimes forgotten. Some were quite fantastic and displayed an astonishing ignorance of ancient history and geography. It would be
               amusing to list the impossible guesses that have been made, but no serious <pb n="24"/> value would result. Any who are disposed to investigate
               this chapter in the history of human error might start with Eckhel's list of his predecessors,<ref target="#CH1-n94">94</ref> noting his own
               selective and conservative suggestions as to mints, based largely upon Pellerin "post infelices aliorum conatus."<ref target="#CH1-n95">95</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These early attempts have one common weakness: they do not distinguish between the first coins and the later ones, some of them very much later.
               Such differentiation is among the great merits of what is still the basic work in the field: <persName>L. Müller's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Numismatique d'Alexandre le Grand.</hi> To a volume which discussed all aspects of the coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, with that of <persName>Philip</persName> II and <persName>Philip</persName> III
               as well, was added an Atlas wherein is displayed in clear tabular form all the varieties known to him (1735 for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, 313 for the elder <persName>Philip</persName>, 142 for the younger) with drawings of
               the symbols and monograms, indication of their placing on the coin and of its fabric.<ref target="#CH1-n96">96</ref> The fabric was arranged in
               seven classes, the increasing breadth and flatness of whose flans was the sign of a chronological development, and they are illustrated by
               engravings on the first two plates. His discussion of them, on pp. 5-9, 97-104, allows for border-line cases, and would not now be accepted in
               all its details, but it added an important new instrument for the analysis of the huge number of coins with which we have to deal.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Müller</persName> treats of symbols and monograms more than once (pp. 35-49, 90—93, 116-122). He began with the conviction that
               they represented towns or districts and in his Atlas the main headings are place names, with lists of Incerti for the various districts, the
               length of which might have given him some cause for doubt. Thus, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> he lists 15
               towns followed by 61 varieties from Incertae Urbes which, on the least reckoning, would amount to 11 more. He does at one point admit that
               symbols might be those of magistrates,<ref target="#CH1-n97">97</ref> but he is sure that the marks are generally those of towns.<ref target="#CH1-n98">98</ref> Of course, additions to his lists were made, but I think there was no published questioning of his principle until
               a quarter of a century later.</p>
            <pb n="25"/>
            <p>In 1869 <persName>Edward H. Bunbury</persName> published<ref target="#CH1-n99">99</ref> two tetradrachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>, one (<persName>Müller</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n100">100</ref> no. 112, Aenos) with caduceus and bee, the other (<persName>Müller</persName> no. 445 a, <placeName>Chrysaoris</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_caria">Caria</placeName>) with torch and bee; they were both struck with
               the same obverse die. "It appears to me, therefore," he said, "as certain as any conclusion can be, in a subject where we are necessarily left to
               inference, that the two coins in question belong to the same part of the country, and can only be referred to neighboring cities." This is as far
               as his disagreement with <persName>Müller</persName> went. But a much more serious doubt as to the validity of <persName>Müller's</persName> method was raised by von Sallet.<ref target="#CH1-n101">101</ref> He found three staters of <persName>Philip</persName>
               II with the same obverse die. Two of them were <persName>Müller</persName> no. 88 (<persName>Philip</persName>pi) with K and tripod;
               the third, the gold counterpart of <persName>Müller</persName> no. 237 (Incerti) with K and a broad hat but without the tripod. He concluded
               that these must all have come from the same mint, and that the mint was not <persName>Philip</persName>pi. The symbols, then, may be those
               of magistrates or emissions and not of places. In reviewing this essay with approval<ref target="#CH1-n102">102</ref> Head remarked, "It is
               becoming every year more and more apparent that the whole edifice rests on a foundation of sand. The symbols, however much they may resemble
               municipal devices or coin-types, are, as <persName>Dr. von</persName> Sallet clearly shows, merely the signets of the monetary magistrates,
               and only very exceptionally to be accepted as mint-marks." This was so much more drastic than <placeName>Bunbury's</placeName> essays in
               revision that it drew a cry of distress from him.<ref target="#CH1-n103">103</ref> Head, he protested, was destroying the whole foundation for a
               reasonable arrangement of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage and leaving mere chaos. To this Head
               replied in a brief note.<ref target="#CH1-n104">104</ref> He granted that <persName>Müller's</persName> Classes V, VI, and VII, which were
               issued by free cities after the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, bore symbols, sometimes
               accompanied by initial letters, the devices of the cities which struck them. But, for the earlier coins, he expressed his conviction that three
               fourths of the signs were those of magistrates and not of cities. Head's doctrine convinced <persName corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</persName>, who appealed to it in support of his identification of the mint of <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n105">105</ref> Finally, in 1912, <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>, in his <hi rend="italic">Reattribution of Certain</hi>
               <pb n="26"/>
               <hi rend="italic">Teiradrachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great,</hi> produced such a wealth of
               evidence on identical dies from the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard that the hypothesis of a large number of little mints had to be
               abandoned permanently.</p>
            <p>There are, to be sure, cases in which true mint marks do appear, and they are not all confined to the posthumous issues (for example, ĸ or
                  <graphic url="NS11_sym1.jpg"/> for <placeName>Kition</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>, <graphic url="NS11_sym2.jpg"/> for Paphos, <graphic url="NS11_sym3.jpg"/> for Arados, Σl for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>)
               but the great majority, as Head saw, stand not for places but for persons. Who these persons were we do not know; they had supervision over
               particular issues, holding office for a term, which would usually be a year after the regular Greek custom, seeing that the official standards
               were maintained and being allowed to put their private marks on the coins struck under their charge as a subordinate guarantee to the great
               guarantee of the king's name.</p>
            <p>The bronze was less common and is much less well known. The types refer to <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName>, both
               obverse and reverse, though no one has raised any question about the portrait. The positions of the bow and club vary, and there are letters or
               symbols which will ultimately help in achieving an arrangement, but correspondences with the symbols on gold and silver are spasmodic and it is
               likely that the bronze issues were the care of separate officials. They were certainly not struck with the frequency and regularity of the gold
               and silver. The serious study of them has hardly begun.</p>
            <p>Such are the essential aspects of the major coins which formed the international currency of <persName>Alexander's</persName> empire.</p>
            <p>These denominations were supplemented at one time or another by the following multiples and fractions:</p>

            <p>There are a considerable number of these which were evidently an important element in the currency.</p>

            <p>Of the whole list the only denominations of real imperial importance are: distater, stater, tetradrachm and drachm.</p>
            <p>To translate these pieces of money with any thoroughness into terms of human existence would need far more information than we possess, but we
               are not without some useful indications of value. The first point to be remembered is that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, abandoning his father's choice of standard for silver, coined on that of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> according to which the drachm weighed 4.3 grams and was divided into 6 obols. There has been a good deal of discussion as to
               why he made the change, and talk of bimetallism which is, <hi rend="bold">I</hi> think, sufficiently dealt with by <placeName>Théodore
                  Reinach</placeName> who points out that the necessary conditions for real bimetallism never existed in antiquity.<ref target="#CH1-n118">118</ref>
               What <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> did was to follow the example of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and strike a silver drachma of the <pb n="30"/> same weight as the gold drachma of which two made the
               stater. Of the relation of silver and gold we shall speak presently; the issuance of silver money on the standard used by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was certainly not surprising considering the assured reputation and universal acceptability of the
                  <placeName>Athenian</placeName> owls. Schlumberger, indeed, believes that his choice was influenced not only by their importance in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> but also by their imitations which had become so notable an element in the currency of
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>. What <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> wanted
               to do, he says, was to give a generally recognized coinage to an empire which did not have one and to extend the use of coinage to the whole
                  territory.<ref target="#CH1-n119">119</ref> This largeness of view, however, would only have been possible at a time when he could foresee the
               eastern extension of his empire. It therefore fits Schlumberger's idea that the imperial currency does not begin with the beginning of the reign.
               But with the difficulties caused by this theory we have already dealt. In any case, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had silver drachms 20 of which were equal to one gold stater in value.</p>
            <p>And what were they worth to their possessors? Any attempt to answer this question ought to be prefaced by a reminder that we have no evidence
               from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> itself. In the works of the orators and the comedians there is a
               considerable amount of economic information about 4th century <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, and this has been
               carefully gathered by August Böckh in his book <hi rend="italic">Die Staatshaushaltung der Athener.<ref target="#CH1-n120">120</ref>
               </hi> There a great deal can be found out about the range of revenues and expenses—rents, dowries, wages, fines, loans, and such matters. But
               these figures, while interesting and illuminating in themselves, must be used with caution for the economy of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>. Nevertheless, there is one figure
               so basic that it seems safe to use it. In the latter part of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">Constitution of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>,</hi> which deals with the constitution of his own time, section
               49 records the fact that the Council considered the case of paupers, and any who were found to have less than 3 minae capital and to be
               physically incapacitated received 2 obols a day for food at the public expense. In 4th century <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, then, 2 obols a day is the level of bare subsistence. This is borne out by <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</persName>' proposal for an expedition against Macedon<ref target="#CH1-n121">121</ref> in which the foot soldiers were to get 2
               obols a day which would keep them alive even if they were not supplemented by plunder. We know nothing of the cost of living in the country, and
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> may well have been more expensive than any town in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, but, if we keep that in mind, it is safe to calculate that a silver diobol was about the
               minimum that a man could get along on for a day. Then a drachma would support him for three days, a tetradrachm for 12.</p>
            <pb n="31"/>
            <p>This being the scale of values for silver, we need to convert it into gold and bronze. Since the gold stater (of two gold drachmae) weighed just
               twice the silver drachma, the ratio between gold drachma and silver drachma will be exactly the ratio between the bullion values of the metals.
               Now the value of gold and silver will vary according to supply and demand and will vary differently except in those instances in modern times
               where government control has produced a true bimetallism. Since in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> the standard was
               silver the result was an apparent fluctuation in the value of gold only, though sometimes ancient writers recognized the interaction of the
                  metals.<ref target="#CH1-n122">122</ref> There is evidence that in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>n empire
               there was a fixed official ratio of 13⅓: 1;<ref target="#CH1-n123">123</ref> an <placeName>Athenian</placeName> inscription of 434/3 (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. 352) gives a ratio of about 14: 1; two literary sources of the 4th century show that by then
               the proportion had sunk to 11 or 12: 1.<ref target="#CH1-n124">124</ref> In the middle of the 4th century the opening of the mines of Pangaeus
               suddenly increased the available gold supply which appears to have dropped the ratio to 10: 1,<ref target="#CH1-n125">125</ref> and this seems to
               have been maintained for a long time.<ref target="#CH1-n126">126</ref> It would be dangerous to suppose that it never varied during the period of

               we have encourages us to assume that 10: I was the usual ratio.One gold stater, then, equalling 20 silver drachmae or 5 tetradrachms, would be
               subsistence for one man for 60 days, and a distater for twice as long.</p>
            <pb n="32"/>
            <p>When we come to speculate about the bronze we are in greater difficulties. It is generally agreed that bronze money was essentially fiduciary:
               that its value was not measured by the weight of the metal. This is confirmed, though it cannot be said to be proved, by what little information
               we have about the price of bronze.<ref target="#CH1-n128">128</ref> More conclusive is the variation in weight of individual pieces of the same
               denomination. In the Drama Hoard there are 94 bronze coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> all well
               preserved and in about the same condition; 13 of them weigh over 7 grams, 25 weigh less than 6. It is obvious that there has been no such attempt
               at exactness as even the fractional silver shows.<ref target="#CH1-n129">129</ref> To be sure, the loss or gain in value would be very small, but
               if a coin of 4.78 grams was supposed to be worth the same as one of 8.09 that must be because the bullion value did not matter. But too much can
               be made of the indifference. I may quote the conclusions to which I came in regard to Selucid issues where there are sometimes denominations not
               distinguished by difference in type.<ref target="#CH1-n130">130</ref> "Everyone will agree that the weighing of the original flans for bronze
               coins was less careful than in the case of silver because the bullion value was so much less. On the other hand, it is too drastic to assume that
               the bullion value was of no account whatever. The conception of token money with a value entirely independent of its material, like our paper, is
               a modern one which cannot fairly be attributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>tics of the third century <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. Doubtless the ultimate worth of the bronze coins was their theoretical ability to be exchanged for precious metals, and
               this allowed them to circulate freely in spite of variation in weight and at a value higher than that of their material. Yet the analogy of
               silver and gold must have affected the peasant or soldier user of bronze coins. The persistence of a system of denominations distinguishable only
               by weight must rest on the instinctive conviction that the more metal there is in your coin the more it is worth."</p>
            <p>Weight, then, may be helpful in separating denominations but is no guide to their relation with the silver issues, and we must look for other
               methods of analysis. <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> tentatively proposed alternate schemes for identifying
               Seleucid bronze, based on the hypothesis of equality between the largest bronze and the smallest silver.<ref target="#CH1-n131">131</ref> As I
               have had occasion to remark,<ref target="#CH1-n132">132</ref> it is doubtful whether a single system can be substantiated for all the kings from
                  <persName>Seleucus</persName> I to Antiochus <pb n="33"/> III, and for all their mints, which by no means issue all the same
               denominations in silver and bronze. But aside from this his values are unsatisfactory for the period of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. According to his calculations the piece which he calls the unit would be either ⅛ obol or
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">16</hi> obol, and therefore <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sup">48</hi>ro<hi rend="sub">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">96</hi> drachma. On the evidence of a possible reduction in weight by Antiochus IV, he prefers the second ratio for the early
               Seleucid period. On the basis of convenience, however, the former or a lower one would be preferable. There is no denomination between the bronze
               unit and the silver drachma issued frequently enough to have been in common use, and 48: 1 seems a wide gap, let alone 96: 1. The relation of
               gold stater to silver drachm was 20: 1 and, as the tetradrachm was even commoner than the drachma, there was a ratio of 5: 1 between the most
               available large denominations. Why should the minor ones be separated by 48: I? Yet, as I have pointed out, in the case of Ilium the first local
               issues of that mint provided not multiples of <persName>Alexander's</persName> denomination but fractions: half and quarter, <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">96</hi> and <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">192</hi> drachma according to <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>'s lower reckoning, <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">192</hi> and <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">384</hi> according to his higher ! This surely must be rejected from its inherent improbability.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>Reinach</placeName>, who has done us the service of confuting some of the unsuccessful speculations of his predecessors, has made a
               cautious suggestion as to the values of Ptolemaic bronze.<ref target="#CH1-n133">133</ref> Since from 305 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>ian standard was Rhodian and not Attic, his definitions will not apply to <persName>Alexander's</persName> coins, but he gives voice to an interesting principle which ought not to be overlooked. "S'il me fallait" he says "À toute
               force hasarder À mon tour un système de dénomination, je verrais volontiers dans la classe de bronze B de <placeName>Svoronos</placeName>, qui
               est de beaucoup la plus fréquente, l'obole, la pièce divisionnaire par excellence." The obol is, in truth, so prominent in the writers that it
               seems reasonable that it should be conspicuous as an actual coin. There is a silver obol but it does not seem to have been common enough to
               satisfy the requirement, and it is tempting to call our bronze piece an obol and so establish a ratio of 6: 1 between the minor denominations.
               The purely factual name chalkous "the bronze piece" we may safely assume was used of our unit as it had been used of the much-despised first
                  <placeName>Athenian</placeName> attempt to use token money;<ref target="#CH1-n134">134</ref> as it would presumably always be used of a
               bronze piece which was the only denomination or the dominant one. In more developed systems it may have been confined to a particular step in a
               series of denominations, having its multiples and divisions, as illustrated by <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>"s
               tables, but for this early period it is almost certain that the commonest bronze piece would be called chalkous. That, however, <pb n="34"/>
               takes us no farther into the question of its value in terms of silver. There we have nothing to go on except reasonable conjecture. We are
               neither helped nor hindered by evidence from other places or other times,<ref target="#CH1-n135">135</ref> for it is clear that a coin without
               mark of value or necessary relation to its metal content would be very sensitive to circumstance, capable of being easily manipulated by
               authority or changed by conditions so that the work done by the unit of one situation might require a multiple in another. Let us assume, then,
               until we encounter evidence to the contrary, that the bronze unit was an obol and that two of them made a pauper's dole in the countries where
                  <persName>Alexander's</persName> authority ran.</p>

               <p>The term "seigniorage" is an anachronism, but we are driven to employ it because we do not know what word the Greeks used. The amount of
                  seigniorage in mediaeval and modern times might be enough not only to cover costs but to provide a revenue for the sovereign (the Bureau of
                  the Mint of the <placeName>United States</placeName> is reported to have made a profit of over $45,000,000 in 1957). But that is under
                  conditions where the coinage does not have to compete with others whose bullion content is higher. Leaving out of consideration all other
                  Greek coinages, Athens and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> were alike in the intention that their coins
                  should be accepted widely and if they were to invade territory accustomed to an economy of barter it must be because their bullion value was
                  only slightly lower than their face value. Athens presents the conditions where it would be easiest to calculate the expense of striking, and
                  where that expense would be least: invariable types and the use of each die until it was worn out. The <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage was almost as simple: the types were invariable but the varying symbols on the
                  reverse meant that occasionally, at the end of an official's term, there may have been reverse dies which were not worn out but which must be
                  abandoned or recut for the use of his successor.</p>

               <p>Indeed, <persName>Kleiner</persName> in a later passage (pp. 31f.) seems to me to compromise his position strangely: Harpalus the
                  treasurer must have been influential in the choice of types; Harpalus may have become acquainted with Athens on his first mysterious flight to
                  Megara in 333 and he was inclined to benevolence toward Athens by the celebrated Athenian hetairai Pythionike and Glykera; he was therefore
                  probably responsible for the Athenian character of the gold types. "Durch Harpalos wird es auch am ehesten möglich, die Goldstatere mit Athen
                  in Zusammenhang zu bringen." But then why introduce the Trojan episode at all?</p>

               <p>There is an interesting detail of the obverse type. The bowl of the helmet of Athena, when it is decorated, may carry one of four different
                  kinds of ornament which have been discussed by <persName>G. F. Hill</persName> ("<persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great and the Persian Lion-Gryphon," <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 1923, pp. 156-161). The first, and much the
                  commonest, is a serpent in which Lederer saw a symbol of Athena <hi rend="italic">(ZfN</hi> 1922, p. 195). The second is a remarkable animal
                  with straight wings, the body of a lion and the head of a bird. This type of gryphon belongs to the period after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death and to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, <persName>Phoenicia</persName>
                  and <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>. A rarer variant has the head of a lion, which is sometimes horned, with
                  curved wings. "The lion-gryphon'' says <persName>Hill</persName>, "was conceived by the Greek as the enemy <hi rend="italic">par
                     excellence</hi> of the Persian." It appears at <placeName>Ace-Ptolemais</placeName> and <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> (or perhaps Damascus) and possibly in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>, and its dates suggest that it may have been used for a short time as a symbol of the destruction of the Persian power. The
                  rarest ornament is a Greek sphinx, used at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> and perhaps elsewhere in the East. If
                  it is symbolic its significance is now lost.</p>
               <p>Professor <persName>Machteld Mellink</persName> of <persName>Bryn Mawr</persName> whose attention I called to this material points
                  out that the horned lion-headed griffin occurs by itself in contexts where it is surely apotropaic and so can hardly be called "the enemy par
                  excellence of the Persians." At the same time it appears to be unknown outside Persian art so that on <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                  coins it shows familiarity with a Persian art form. Of the other animals, all traditional as decorations on Athena's helmet, the most striking
                  thing is the galloping pose of the bird-headed griffin. But there is no sure explanation of the significance of any of them.</p>

               <p>It might be asked, if relations later deteriorated, why was not the type changed? But this admits of an easy answer. It is obvious that what
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> wanted for his new currency was stability. No event and no sentiment
                  was allowed to affect his types once they had been chosen. It is possible that there was, in his lifetime, variety in the appearance of the
                  minor denominations, but there was none in the coins that did the main fiscal work of the empire.</p>

                  <persName>Seltman</persName> had suggested to him that the model might be the Baal of <placeName>Tarsos</placeName> and its selection
                  an instance of <persName>Alexander's</persName> internationalism. But, as Cook recognizes (p. 762, n. 2) this conflicts with the dating
                  of the first <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>n issues, a question that has already been discussed. It might
                  also be pointed out that while stylistically Baal on coins of Mazaeus at <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> just before <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> is very much like <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                  <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> from the same mint <hi rend="italic">(<placeName>Tarsos</placeName>,
                     passim),</hi> the designs have important differences: on the Mazaeus silver the scepter is in front surmounted by an eagle, on the <persName>Alexanders</persName> the scepter is behind and the eagle held on the open hand. Gardner had recognized the differences which Cook
                  lists. <hi rend="italic">The Types of Greek Coins,</hi> p. 186, "The <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> of <persName>Alexander's</persName> coins is certainly not an imitation in any close sense of the great Olympian statue of Pheidias, but the
                  type is probably introduced in honor of the god represented by that statue."</p>

            </head>
            <p>From the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               <hi rend="bold">1,</hi> 498-454 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. the kings of Macedon had struck their own coins<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref> and it was
               a matter of course that <persName>Philip</persName> II and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> III should
               strike theirs. But the size of <persName>Philip's</persName> output was altogether beyond that of any of his predecessors, and <persName>Alexander's</persName> dwarfed that of his father. Of course, the thing that made this possible was that <persName>Philip</persName> came into control of the gold and silver of the Pangaean district. When he took over the Thasian colony of Crenides in 357<ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> he developed the neighboring gold mines until they produced an income of more than 1,000 talents.<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> That undoubtedly took the form of coined money.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>
               <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
               </hi> puts abundance of money at the beginning of the kinds of wealth, followed by real estate, movables, cattle and slaves. There is no mention
               of bullion, and while we read of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>n bullion captured by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and of gold objects included in the plunder, there is no record of royal transactions in
               bullion any more than there is of transactions on credit. This fact, that the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>n
               kings, like the Greek cities, used not merely a money economy but a specie economy is of importance to keep in mind. If the thousand talents of
               income were all gold they would be 300,000 gold staters, since a silver talent, to translate it into its commonest forms, equalled 1,500
               tetradrachms or 300 gold pieces at a ratio of 10: I.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Now though <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</persName>, and doubtless his contemporaries, generally believed that a supply of money was wealth, <persName>Philip</persName>
               does not seem to have accumulated much. None <pb n="36"/> of the kings who preceded him had been able to coin gold<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref>
               and there was a time when <persName>Philip</persName> had little enough.<ref target="#CH2-n8">8</ref> It might be thought that, with such a
               large increase of income, he would find himself with a surplus. But <persName>Philip's</persName> ideas were larger than those of his
               predecessors and his plans more costly. Not content with the old <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> army which, so far as it was a citizen
               body, he might have employed with no expense beyond their maintenance,<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> he hired mercenaries and devised a military
               force not only larger but also far more resourceful than any previously known.<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref> With this force he won his
               victories in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> and from it he sent an advance contingent of 10,000 to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName> under <persName>Parmenio</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_priscus_attalus">Attalus</persName> in 337.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Obviously his military expenses must have been considerable. Moreover, <persName>Philip</persName> is reported to have said that he had enlarged his kingdom more by gold than by arms<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>
               and, if we had no other evidence than the charges and counter-charges of the orators, we could judge how freely the king's money was spent in
                  bribery;<ref target="#CH2-n18">13</ref> it may well have amounted to a larger outlay than pay for the troops. And the tradition, whatever its
               accuracy, represents <persName>Philip</persName> as having no talent for economy. A passage from the <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> of
                  Theopompus<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> describing his dissipation is certainly sensational and probably libellous, but it contains an
               interesting observation which does not seem to be an expression of prejudice, "He was a soldier and could not calculate income and expenditure at
               leisure." This must be considered in connection with the reports that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was,
               at the beginning of his reign, short of funds. In the <hi rend="italic">Life of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               </hi> (15.1) Plutarch quotes Aristobulus to the effect that on his crossing to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had only 70 talents in the war chest; <persName>Duris</persName> says
               it was only provision for 30 days<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> while Onesicritus adds that he had a debt of 200 talents besides.</p>
            <pb n="37"/>
            <p>Still more lurid accounts of his financial distress are attributed to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               himself when he was haranguing the mutineers at Opis. According to Curtius (X. II) he said that he had inherited from his father 60 talents and a
               debt of 500, while the sober Arrian gives the most extreme account of all (VII. 9.6): his assets from his father were a few gold and silver cups
               and less than 60 talents, while <persName>Philip's</persName> debt of 500 talents he had increased by borrowing 800 more.<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> The words attributed to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> himself refer to the
               exchequer at the time of his accession, not at the time of his crossing. We should not count too much on the evidential value of such a speech,
               but there is nothing to contradict the common testimony that <persName>Philip</persName> had used up his money.</p>
            <p>Plutarch takes the circumstances to show the high adventurous spirit of the young king and he adds the famous tale of his distributing all the
               royal property to his friends, keeping for himself only his hopes, in which <placeName>Perdiccas</placeName> gallantly said he would share,
               refusing all other benefits. But this romantic story is <pb n="38"/> quite impossible to believe in the form in which it is given. It would mean
               that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> embarked on an expensive and perilous enterprise without making any
               provision at all for the campaign after its very beginning. One serious check would have left him with an army that he could not support,
               separated from a kingdom whose resources were exhausted with no means of being reestablished. There may well have been a distribution of gifts,
               perhaps so spectacular as to make it seem that he had left nothing for himself, but the record does not support the legend that he would have
               given away his soldier's pay and their safety to make an impression on his friends. Much that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> did was adventurous to the point of recklessness. Like other great generals of antiquity he conceived it his obvious duty to
               lead his troops in the field and he never seems to have provided against the risk by arranging for a second in command, as in the end he died
               without providing for the succession. If the battle-axe of Spithridates had cut him down at the Granicus it is hard to see how the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> army could have escaped annihilation. Whether there was a quality in the man that made him take risks beyond
               reason is a question outside the scope of this study. What concerns us is a class of evidence which lies altogether within reason. <persName>Alexander's</persName> strategy may have been bold but it was not hap-hazard. His plans may have been fallible at times, but there
                  <hi rend="italic">were</hi> plans, and among them fiscal plans to provide the money without which the expedition would have been
               impossible.</p>
            <p>The records tell us a great deal about the accomplishments of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> but little or
               nothing of what lay behind them. There is tactical information about his arrangement of the order of battle, and such an episode as the siege of
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</placeName> is treated with a detail which includes experiment and failure as well as ultimate
               success, but operations on a larger scale are treated as though they were an automatic sequence. And yet, of course, a prodigious amount of
               planning must have been required for the success of the all but incredible progress of his arms and of this <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> must have been the master mind. We get a glimpse of him in his youth questioning the
               ambassadors of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>n king not only about what was that monarch's position in the line
               of battle, which might have been prompted by youthful valor and his adventurous spirit, but also about the size of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>n forces and the shortest roads for those going inland from the sea, which was essentially strategic
                  material.<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref> The ambassadors recognized these as subjects in which a king should properly be interested, and
               called him a <persName>Great King</persName> in contrast to their own who was only rich. Slight as the incident is, it suggests that even as
               a boy he had an idea of the value of military intelligence, which is one element of a long-range military program. It would be <pb n="39"/>
               interesting if we could have even this much light on the preparations for later stages of his campaign. But it was not the kind of thing that
               antiquity found worthy of recording, and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> is not the only great ruler whose
               plans are entirely unreported. Once in a while we get an intimation of the day to day work which a king must do. <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> remarks that kingship, which is the most perfect and greatest of offices, has the most cares and burdens and
               occupations, and he quotes <persName>Seleucus</persName> as saying, "If people knew what a labor it is to write and read so many letters,
               they would not even pick up a crown that had been thrown away." We must imagine, then, what the record fails to show: an <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> busy with many things less than heroic, but essential for all that. One of those things was
                  finance.<hi rend="sup">18a</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was recognized in the 4th century that finance was a special study. <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</persName> in the <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi> (I. 4. 8) lays it down that it is well for statesmen to understand money, since states often need money like
               households, but in greater quantity. Some statesmen, he says, have devoted themselves to that alone, doubtless having in mind the <placeName>Athenian</placeName> statesman Eubulus whom <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> cites as having been commended because although he held unparalleled influence he did not deal at all with
               foreign affairs or the military but concerned himself only with finance and increasing the revenue. There was even some specialized literature:
               Aeneas whose <hi rend="italic">Tactica</hi> appears to have been written shortly after 360 <hi rend="bold">B.C.</hi> also wrote a treatise on
               military finance.<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> An interesting, though too brief ancient view of imperial finance is presented in Book 2 of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> attributed to <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</persName>, edited by <placeName>Van
                  Groningen</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref> In the theoretical introduction which comprises Chapter I we read 'There are four kinds of
               economy: that of a king; that of a satrap; that of a city state; that of an individual." It is plain that in the opinion of the author, which can
               hardly have been contradicted by the practice of his day, the coining of money is altogether in the <pb n="40"/> hands of the sovereign; the
               powers of a satrap may be great but they do not include coining. This is a continuation of 5th century doctrine according to which the issue of
               money was a declaration of sovereignty. Qualification is necessary for the Persian practice of the 4th century, however. The striking of gold was
               generally regarded as a royal monopoly. When Orontas, Satrap of Mysia presumed to do that it was because he was in revolt against the king and
               intended to declare himself independent.<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> But with silver the matter is different. The <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>n silver bearing the names of the satraps Tiribazus, Pharna-bazus, Datames and Mazaeus is well known.<ref target="#CH2-n23">23</ref> It is so large and important a constituent of the Persian currency—so much more important than the royal shekels—that it seems mere
               legalism to insist that these powerful subordinates could strike only by grace of the <persName>Great King</persName>. <placeName>Babelon</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> maintains that no satrap was permitted to strike <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> satrap, the power being always
               temporary and always in connection with the command of troops. But since on the previous page he has admitted that the client kings coined with
               considerable freedom and by no means always in connection with the business of their overlord, and since there is no way of relating each
               satrapal issue to a military event, and no explanation of the fact that this military money was issued in the name of the satrap and not of the
               king, we may believe that the restriction was perhaps a theoretical but not a practical one, and that the problem of silver coinage was generally
               left to the satrap's judgment. That is not the case with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, however. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> the coining of silver was a government monopoly, and when the name of a subordinate
               appears on a coin struck for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> there is an exceptional reason for it.<ref target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> Initials were sometimes permitted to a governor as to a mint official, but in general the empire of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and the realms of his successors observe the rule of the <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our author does not discuss the relations of royal currency with that of a city state lying within the royal dominion, yet that situation was a
               common one in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> under Persian kings and <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
               kings as well. <persName corresp="#viaf_51784706">Daniel Schlumberger</persName> has recently shown<ref target="#CH2-n26">26</ref> that,
               while the Persian king's gold was a monopoly, his silver was only one of several kinds that circulated in his own land. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> came into no vacuum of currency when he brought his money <pb n="41"/> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName>. Schlumberger's statement of his purpose is very good.<ref target="#CH2-n27">27</ref> "What <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> intended to do is clear. He intended to give to an empire that did not have it
               a silver coinage universally acceptable as money and, in so doing, to extend the use of silver money as such (and not as bullion) to the entire
               territory of that empire." The intention was never entirely carried out, partly, of course, because of the shortness of his life, but, aside from
               that, it is not likely that the plan itself was ever so complete as to contemplate the retirement of the great variety of silver that was already
               in use. Whatever the theory, the fact was that there was a supplementary coinage from the cities<ref target="#CH2-n28">28</ref> which somewhat
               complicated the <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica's</hi> simple conception of the king as the only supplier of money.</p>
            <p>But the king had to decide, as the text says, what kind of money should be made and when, and whether the coins should be of greater or less
               value. The author realized that the king would not be fulfilling his proper duty if he merely directed that all bullion should forthwith be
               converted into coin, leaving the details to the master of the mint. What was the nature of his decision and by what considerations was it
               affected? <placeName>Van Groningen</placeName> argues that it was the king's business to see that the official ratio of gold to silver was
                  maintained.<ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref> He must therefore issue sufficient quantity of each to keep the values from fluctuating. The editor
               surprisingly argues on the assumption that it is the Persian king who is under consideration, who struck only darics of 8.336 grams or sigloi of
               5.56 grams. If his date for the work be accepted (between 325 and 305) there was no Persian king at the time it was written. Moreover his
               hypothesis, which in any case credits the monarch with an unlikely degree of economic sagacity, is less plausible for the Persian king than for a
               Hellenistic one. The Persian king could doubtless dictate how much gold should be minted, but he could neither dictate nor foresee how much
               silver was to go into circulation, for the major part of the silver was provided by the cities.<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> was in far better position to control the money market than any king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>. Nevertheless, <pb n="42"/> whether he was much or little concerned with preserving the
               ratio between metals, the king must decide how much gold must be coined and how much silver, and in what denominations.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Philip</persName> had used the mints of Pella and <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> for gold and silver; perhaps also that of
                  <placeName>Philippi</placeName> for bronze.<ref target="#CH2-n31">31</ref>
               <persName>Müller</persName> believed that his coins came from a large number of other towns as well. Some of his identifications have been
               proved wrong; other have to do with the posthumous tetradrachms and staters; it may be that other mints of <persName>Philip</persName> will
               eventually be confirmed, but certainly none to compare with the two great <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> cities and, on the basis of our
               present information, we can only safely assume that at <persName>Alexander's</persName> accession he found Pella and <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> in operation for the precious metals. His decision in regard to them will have been very simple. With the exchequer low he
               undoubtedly required new coin as fast as he could get it. What proportions of the various denominations he needed we cannot say.</p>
            <p>His sources of supply were well placed for his first needs: in the spring of 335 he embarked on the northern expedition, which is described in
               detail in Arrian I. I. 4-6. 11, which occupied him until the Theban revolt brought him back to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> in the fall of that year. His purpose was to discipline the barbarians on the periphery of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> who showed signs of restlessness at the news of <persName>Philip's</persName> death. He
               marched from <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> to the Ister, crossed it and beat the Getae in battle, then turned westward against the Agriani
               and Paeones and thence south to Pelium in Illyria where he broke up a serious rebellion. It was there that he heard of the situation at Thebes in
               consequence of which he returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> with all speed. His work in the north seems to
               have been thoroughly done, in spite of the interruption, for the barbarians gave him no further trouble, even after he had crossed to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName>. There is no mention of the acquisition of territory, the founding of cities or the
               establishment of garrisons. It is very unlikely that the expedition resulted in the opening of new mints, immediately or later. To be sure, <persName>Müller</persName> assigns certain issues to a mint of Pelagonia (nos. 205-215) but some of these have been identified as coming from
                  <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, others from <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, and it is now clear that this territory was supplied with
               silver by the mint of Damastion which operated until 325 B.C., to be continued by the latest coins of Pelagia and the kings of Paeonia down to
               the Gallic invasions of 280.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref>
            </p>
            <p>How was the campaign financed? Partly by plunder. On two occasions Arrian speaks of booty;<ref target="#CH2-n33">33</ref> the first after <persName>Alexander's</persName> victory over the Thracians when he sent it to the cities on the coast in charge of Lysanias and Philotas; <pb n="43"/> the second when that from the conquered Getae was taken back (presumably again to the coast cities) by <persName>Meleager
                  and Philip</persName>. The only way we have of forming any idea of what it would amount to is to realize that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> would not in each case have detached two officers for escort duty unless the prize were of
               considerable value.<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref> Cohen indeed ingeniously calculates the amount by supposing that it is the difference between
               his indebtedness of 200 talents according to Onesicritus and his debt of 1300 talents according to Arrian's <figure xml:id="fig-4">

               likely that two barbarian tribes could be the source of 1100 talents, when the sack of Thebes produced only 440.<ref target="#CH2-n36">36</ref>
               The expedition may have paid for itself. It is probable that if he did borrow an extra 800 talents that would have been in preparation for the
               crossing to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>.</p>
            <p>At the outset of his great enterprise his source of money, like his father's, was the two <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> cities (Map 1).
               But now there was a difference. Under <persName>Philip</persName> Pella had been the premier mint; under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> it was <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n37">37</ref> The result was a
               distinction in the functions fulfilled by the two cities, which <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> notices in an
               interesting comment.<ref target="#CH2-n38">38</ref> "Probably because of the contrast in their respective situations the Pella mint now came to
               be used more for supplying local demand, the <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> mint for foreign commerce. It is a fact that while the writer
               has records of the latter's issues being strongly represented in hoards from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>an <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, <persName>Babylon</persName>ia, and
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, the Pella coins seldom turn up in finds made outside of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName> and then only in small numbers. In the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>an
               hoards, however, they are not uncommon. It is furthermore to be noted that such specimens of the Pella mint as did occur at <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> are all beautifully preserved, the majority hardly circulated at all. It is evident that they had not travelled much from
               hand to hand after leaving their dies. In contrast to this, considerable numbers of the <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> pieces, particularly
               of the early issues, must by their appearance have circulated a good deal before they were finally consigned to the ground." Here, then, is an
               example of mints filling—and perhaps already of being intended to fill—particular places in the imperial currency. The tetradrachms of Pella went
               west and south, those of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> went to the soldiers in Anatolia and had seen long use before they got to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="45"/>
            <p>In the spring of 334 the cavalry and most of the infantry went with Par-menio across the straits from Sestus to Abydus.<ref target="#CH2-n39">39</ref> The latter city had probably been in <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> hands since <persName>Philip's</persName>
               expeditionary force three years before.<ref target="#CH2-n40">40</ref> Through it <persName>Philip</persName> must have introduced his gold,
               though apparently not his silver.<ref target="#CH2-n41">41</ref> Whether or nor he intended it, the effect was to supplant the Asiatic issue of
               gold from Lampsacus and electrum from Cyzicus, Phocaea and My-tilene.<ref target="#CH2-n42">42</ref>
               <placeName>Babelon</placeName> is of the opinion that the use of electrum was encouraged by the hegemony of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> which also made her owls the standard large silver on the coast of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> in the 5th and 4th centuries.<ref target="#CH2-n43">43</ref> If that is true, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> made no attempt to change the character of the silver in use; the large money
               will have been <placeName>Athenian</placeName> tetradrachms, the small silver being produced by the individual cities. A notable instance is
               Abydus itself which issued coins weighing 2.55-3.30 grams as well as a few of larger and smaller denomination. Since the names of 28 magistrates
               are known it must have been a considerable coinage.<ref target="#CH2-n44">44</ref> The common denomination is generally called "Persic
               tetrobol."</p>
            <pb n="46"/>
            <p>I am not sure that the valiant effort of numismatists to give a name to every standard that they find has contributed as much light as they have
               evidently intended. The theoretical weight of the Persic tetrobol is given by <persName>Hill</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref> as 3.73-3.74 grams. The difference from the Abydus type is considerable, and the title does not help to explain
               why the lighter coins were used at Abydus. It certainly cannot have been because the Persian is of the same weight as the "Persic drachm." For
               one thing, the sigloi were by no means of outstanding importance in the currency of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia
                  Minor</placeName>; for another, if she had wanted to connect her currency to the sigloi Abydus would have struck "Persic drachms" which she did
               not. She struck <hi rend="sup">2</hi>/<hi rend="sub">3</hi> drachmas which was surely inventing unnecessary trouble if there was anything
               "Persic" in her intent. The conspicuous thing about the coins of Abydus is that they are not easily related to any adjacent currency of
               importance unless that of Mytilene can be considered adjacent. Mytilene also struck "Persic" weights, though with a larger proportion of
               didrachms and fewer tetrobols. Otherwise Abydus was isolated.<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref> The neighboring town of Lampsacus struck still
               smaller silver (obols, diobols and tetrobols) on what is generally supposed to be the Rhodian standard, with a theoretical drachma of 3.72-3.88
               grams.</p>
            <p>The Rhodian standard had more adherents than the Persic in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, according to the
               received opinion, but the fact is that we need a great deal more data before any safe conclusion can be reached. And even after the weighing and
               counting has been carefully done it is not likely that any pattern <pb n="47"/> will emerge which would be tolerable to modern ideas.<ref target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> The towns issued their own small change for local use with little or no regard to the practice of their neighbors.
               When different currencies were dealt with it must have been by calculation or by convention.<ref target="#CH2-n48">48</ref> It would seem that
               here was an excellent occasion for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to confer the benefit of a standard
               currency on a district so broken into little monetary districts. If the opportunity occurred to him he was too busy with more immediate duties to
               act upon it. Between the spring of 334 and the spring of 333 he occupied, either peaceably or by force, a great many small towns and a number of
               cities of importance: <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardes</placeName>, <placeName>Ephesus</placeName>, <placeName>Magnesia</placeName>, Colophon, <placeName>Miletus</placeName>, <placeName>Phaselis</placeName>, <placeName>Aspendus</placeName> and
               Side. In no case is there any sign of his using their mints to strike his own types (Map 1) <ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> Doubtless he made <pb n="48"/> use of what local currency was available; contributions from the cities would have come to him in their own coin or from such stores
               of gold and electrum as they had accumulated. It is generally assumed that he collected the taxes that had been paid to the Persians from the
               satrapies; this is specially attested for <placeName>Hellespont</placeName>ine Phrygia and the Aeolian and Ionian cities and there is nothing
               to suggest that the practice was not regularly followed.<ref target="#CH2-n50">50</ref> In the case of Priene which surrendered voluntarily there
               is explicit evidence of remission of taxes<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> and in the case of Ephesus, where there had been rioting and danger of
               civil war, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> directed that they should contribute such taxes as they had paid
               to the Persians to rebuilding the temple of Artemis, which had burned down.<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> Both exceptions show that he was not
               in desperate need of money. I do not know the basis of Tarn's dictum "till after Issus he was in financial straits and the taxes from the king's
               land were his only source of revenue."<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> The case of Ephesus is particularly interesting because that was the one
               mint city which fell into his hands north of the Taurus which seems to have had at the time an output of large silver (in this instance Rhodian
               tetradrachms) sufficiently great to suggest it as a possible producer of tetradrachms of his own. The other cities which he controlled were
               striking small denominations or in small amounts.</p>
            <p>But when he reached <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> in the spring of 333 he found a place which was altogether suitable for the establishment of
               a royal mint and this was the first to be added to those which his father had used. The early Alexandrian coinage of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> has been so thoroughly studied by <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n54">54</ref> that there is no necessity <pb n="49"/> of doing more than recapitulate the essentials. <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> under the Persians had become the capital of the district of <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> and North <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>. It had been the residence of satraps, the latest of whom was Mazaeus, who ruled for their master but
               issued large quantities of silver coins which were not the royal sigloi but double shekels with a theoretical weight of 11.2 grams, bearing <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>n types and, more remarkable still, the satraps' names (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 1). There was evidently a convenient near-by supply of silver sufficient to take care of the military and administrative expenses. The
               obverse type was a seated Baal which needed but little modification to become the seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> of <persName>Alexander's</persName> reverse, and the extreme similarity of the two figures produced at <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> shows that <persName>Alexander's</persName> coins followed those of his predecessor immediately and employed the same
               die-sinker (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 2). Of course the size of the flan was increased since the tetradrachms were 6 grams heavier, but <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> was not noticeably larger than Baal had been. The head of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> now replaced the lion and bull and city walls of Mazaeus' reverse and thereby eliminated anything
               to identify the mint, for, like the products of Pella and <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, these were to be imperial coins showing no
               special mark of their origin. Indeed the first issues bore not even the sign of a responsible official, or only an inconspicuous pellet between
               the seat and the cross-bars of the throne. At the same time, or shortly thereafter, a series of gold was initiated. Since the satraps had not
               struck gold and there seems to have been no easily accessible supply of the metal it may be that the staters appeared only after Issus with the
               capture of Darius' money which he had left at Damascus. Doubtless much of it was gold which could be melted down and restruck; Curtius says that
               the coined money amounted to 2600 talents.<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of course it would not be necessary to restrike the Persian money and we cannot prove that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> did. <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> at one time was inclined to think that <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName>tic currency was the core of what <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had to use. <hi rend="sup">"</hi> At the time of <persName>Alexander's</persName> invasion of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName>," he says,<ref target="#CH2-n56">56</ref> "the currency of the East consisted, in the main, of Persian
               gold darics and silver sigloi and <placeName>Athenian</placeName> tetradrachms. Two of these—the gold darics and the <placeName>Athenian</placeName> tetradrachms—had for the last hundred and fifty years enjoyed a world-wide circulation and were well known to <persName>Alexander's</persName> soldiers. It is probable, therefore, that during his campaigns, from the battle of the Granicus to the
               invasion of India, for the pay of his troops he relied principally upon the fabulous hoards of wealth which had been stored away by the Persian
               monarchs and which now fell into his hands." He assumes without discussion and, I think, mistakenly that a large part of the Persian treasure
               would have been coined money. It is questionable how far <pb n="50"/> this point of view is justified at the time with which we are now dealing.
               There is, as we shall see, evidence that he used Persian money later on, and he was willing to have earlier types continue to circulate under
               certain conditions; we have just seen that he probably was content to use the local issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> at least as supplements to his own. But there was a period of two or three years after his occupation of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> notable for the opening of new mints to produce his money. Between the summer of 333 and 330 fall the first issues of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, Alexandria-by-Issus,<ref target="#CH2-n57">57</ref> the cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>,<ref target="#CH2-n58">58</ref> Aradus,<ref target="#CH2-n59">59</ref> Byblus,<ref target="#CH2-n60">60</ref>

               <placeName>Ake</placeName>,<ref target="#CH2-n62">62</ref> as well as Sardes,<ref target="#CH2-n63">63</ref> Damascus<ref target="#CH2-n64">64</ref> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n65">65</ref> (Map 2). It seems very unlikely that so remarkable a concentration should not have had as its purpose the
               wholesale replacement of the Persian royal coinage by the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> imperial.</p>
            <p>Here we come dangerously close to those discussions of <persName>Alexander's</persName> psychology and intent which fascinate the
               participants without always convincing the observers. So far as our evidence goes, the decision what coins to strike, when and where was <persName>Alexander's</persName> alone, just as the pseudo-Aristotelian <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> says it should be. The anonymous
               author knows that the king cannot do everything <pb n="51"/> single-handed. He understands the functions that should be left to the satraps and
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, who retained the Persian organization just as far as he could,<ref target="#CH2-n66">66</ref> had his own satraps—so called even when they were <placeName>Macedonians</placeName> —and we hear a good deal
               about their powers and duties.There were special officers in charge of finance, which was the most conspicuous difference between the old
               administration and the new. Berve has pointed out that in the early days of the invasion the central royal treasury and the war treasury were
                  one<ref target="#CH2-n67">67</ref> and the finance officers were imperial and not local officials. On the most prominent of them, Harpalus, we
               have much information from excellent sources, which Berve has fully recorded,<ref target="#CH2-n68">68</ref> but nowhere is there the slightest
               indication that his powers and responsibilities extended to the mint. It is difficult for us to imagine that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> should direct so detailed an operation, especially when it had to be done from a distance,
               and obviously someone must have supplied him with the information on which the decisions were based. But the modern system of delegation of
               duties did not present itself to antiquity as self-evidently the best way of dealing with complicated affairs.<ref target="#CH2-n69">69</ref>
               Pliny's correspondence with Trajan shows what surprisingly minor details could be properly brought to the attention of the sovereign, and the
               scraps that are left of <persName>Alexander's</persName> correspondence suggest that it would have showed the same kind of picture.<ref target="#CH2-n70">70</ref> If, then, we conclude that arrangements for minting were <persName>Alexander's</persName> own business (as we
               must do in default of evidence to the contrary) can we discover anything about his motives without getting involved in historical fiction?</p>
            <pb n="52"/>
            <p>Of course there is no need to prove that he had to have money; the central question is why did he have to have money with his own types? <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>, after suggesting that he might have got along with what was already in circulation,
                  adds<ref target="#CH2-n71">71</ref> "Even so, it seems but natural that he would issue coins bearing his own name and types to take the place,
               as soon as possible, of a coinage belonging to a fast vanishing dynasty and empire." Was this replacement to be effected by having all the new
               money Alexandrine while the old issues wore out or were melted down or buried by private owners? Or was the old currency called in by the
               government and melted down to be reissued as the new money? There is evidence of the latter procedure at an earlier period. The satraps
               Pharnabazus and Datames seem to have melted down the silver of their predecessor Tiribazus to issue their own coins.<ref target="#CH2-n72">72</ref> There is no way of telling certainly whether <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> did the same thing
               but in any case the new money was to be his. In the cases of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> and Myriandrus, the metropoleis of <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> and North <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>, this meant putting an end to issues in the
               name of the Persian satrap Mazaeus and replacing them by the silver of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>,
               supplemented, in the case of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, by gold also. This needs no elaborate explanation. Whether or not the Persian
               empire was "fast vanishing" its control over this district was at an end.</p>
            <p>But not all the cases were as simple as this. Perhaps the next mint to begin operations for the conqueror was Aradus which was ruled by a king
               named Gerostratus whose son Straton met <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on his march south along the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>n coast and surrendered the city to him.<ref target="#CH2-n73">73</ref> Now Aradus had its
               own coinage whose types were purely local and had nothing to do with the Persians. The fleet of Gerostratus formed a contingent of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> navy at the siege of Tyre,<ref target="#CH2-n74">74</ref> and there would have been nothing surprising in that
               service being rewarded by the continuance of the right of coinage. But Aradus at once began to strike tedradrachms with the head of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> and seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName>, like those of
                  <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> and Myriandrus with one notable difference: their origin is clearly marked, first by the Aramaic letters used
               on the autonomous coins, then by an <hi rend="bold">A</hi> and finally by the monogram <hi rend="bold">A.<ref target="#CH2-n75">75</ref>
               </hi> A similar course was taken by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> whose king, another Straton, surrendered reluctantly
               and was therefore replaced.<ref target="#CH2-n76">76</ref> Thereupon the double shekels, some of which had been issued by the king, some by the
               satrap Mazaeus, appeared no more, being replaced by <pb n="53"/>
               <persName>Alexander's</persName> tetradrachms and staters which at first bore the town's Aramaic initial, later Σ or Σl,<ref target="#CH2-n77">77</ref> Slightly different is the case of Byblus, for there Ainel (whom Arrian calls Enylos)<ref target="#CH2-n78">78</ref>
               having delivered the city and joined <persName>Alexander's</persName> fleet, as did the king of Aradus, was rewarded—if it was a reward—by
               having the first two letters of his name <graphic url="NS11_sym9.jpg"/> used on the tetradrachms instead of the name of the city, and the later
               issues bear the monogram <graphic url="NS11_sym10.jpg"/> for his successor Adramelek. Now these three cities all had coinages of their own and
               there was nothing to prevent <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> from allowing them to continue now that they
               were his allies, as he had apparently done with the coinages north of the Taurus. To be sure, the double shekels of Mazaeus from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> would need to be replaced as had his shekels from <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, but no
               objection of that sort could be made to the emissions of Aradus and Byblus.</p>
            <p>Similar treatment was accorded to the kings of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>. They had not been as prompt to
               surrender as the mainlanders, but they joined him with their fleets at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and he was
               willing to forgive their previous service to the Persians as presumably enforced.<ref target="#CH2-n79">79</ref> They also joined the producers
               of Alexandrine tetradrachms and those from Citium are clearly identified by the monogram "K. <placeName>Salamis</placeName>, however, used
               first a bow, then a rudder as symbol on its silver and only the bronze is unmistakably marked ΣΑ. Paphos also, which may have begun a little
               later prefers her characteristic device of a dove to a literal identification.<ref target="#CH2-n80">80</ref> About these emissions <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> uses what seems to me strange language. On the mainland, he says, "every city which
               had thrown open its gates without a struggle to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was accorded local autonomy,
               and, where a mint had previously existed, was allowed to continue coining; with the proviso, however, that the issues should henceforth conform
               in types, weights, and denominations with the regular coinage of the empire. As a result, such cities as Aradus, Byblus, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName>Ake</placeName> coined as they never had before, even in their most prosperous
               days.—It would therefore be strange if, in return for their submission and the invaluable services of their fleets, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> should have deprived the kings of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>
               of the immemorial right of coinage, or even have curtailed it in any vital way."<ref target="#CH2-n81">81</ref>
               <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>'s mind at the moment was on identification and not explanation or he could hardly
               have written in that way. Can there be any more vital curtailment imagined of the right of coinage of the <pb n="54"/> king of Citium than that
               he should have to discontinue his own currency to produce silver with alien types and the name <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on which only the monogram of his city suggested that he had anything to do with the
                  affair?<ref target="#CH2-n82">82</ref> Is it not obvious that the Cypriote kings and the <placeName>Phoenician</placeName> kings were not
               "allowed" to continue coining but directed to continue? We are told that "Arados, <placeName>Byblos</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName>Ake</placeName> coined as they never had before" and this is certainly true.<ref target="#CH2-n83">83</ref> Where did all the metal come from, not only the greatly increased output of silver but the gold of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> and <placeName>Ake</placeName>?</p>
            <p>The necessary explanation seems to me to be that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, knowing that there was a
               vitally important campaign before him, required much money—his own money—and used every available source of supply. If it be asked why he should
               now make such efforts to provide his own money when he had opened no new mints in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia
                  Minor</placeName>, there are likely answers at hand. For one thing the mint of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> was continuing to pour her
               abundant production across the straits so that her gold was replacing the gold and electrum of the other continent and her tetradrachms were
               providing a major denomination in that metal. For another, north of the Taurus <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was to some extent among friends. Whatever the realities behind the professed purpose of freeing the Greek cities, he had
               come there as the leader of a Greek League as well as a king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>; the Greek cities
               understood his position and in the majority of cases were willing to accept it. He had driven the <placeName>Persians</placeName> out of the
               country and though they still had friends there, there was no prospect of their combining to make head against him. If the Greek coins of the
               cities circulated as a minor supplement to the Greek coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> it was not
               likely that any harm would come of it and no harm did. But south of the Taurus he was in alien territory. He had not come there to free anybody
               but to conquer. The Cilicians, the Syrians and the <placeName>Phoenicians</placeName> had no reason for prejudice in his favor; if he was to
               be as acceptable as the king of the <placeName>Persians</placeName> he must make his place. <pb n="55"/>
               <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> and the cities that received him after Issus were acknowledging what they thought to be the greater power. Tyre
               and Gaza held the contrary view and were destroyed for their mistake. It was vital to him that he be recognized as the master in all parts of his
               new territory and therefore all the mints were set to work to manufacture one of the most effective kinds of manifesto known to antiquity: his
               name and types on the coins. This was done quite without regard for the normal financial needs of the district; the much increased activity of
               the coast mints did not mean a sudden era of prosperity and commercial activity. It was their contribution to the conqueror's needs, and since no
               new mines were being opened it is only reasonable to assume that the necessary extra bullion came from the melting down of the king's treasure.
               There was no overstriking involved, the weights of both gold and silver pieces in previous use being different from the weights by which they
               were supplanted. We shall therefore never have the kind of proof that comes from detecting an earlier type beneath the later ones. None the less,
               we have sufficient reason for believing that in the period succeeding the battle of Issus <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> did not intend to continue the local coinages of the district but to replace them with his own, and one probable means to
               take would be to melt down and restrike.<hi rend="sup">83a</hi> We must guard against supposing that too complete a revolution was achieved. In
               the first place, the pre-Alexandrine coins did not all disappear. In the hoard from Galilee buried about 319/8<ref target="#CH2-n84">84</ref> and
               one found at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> buried about a decade later<ref target="#CH2-n85">85</ref> double shekels
               of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName> accompanied the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                  tetradrachms.<ref target="#CH2-n86">86</ref> Later events showed that there was still a place for the earlier series (below, p. 78). Then,
                  <persName>Alexander's</persName> production south of the Taurus by no means made the country independent of coins from the north. In the
                  <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard there were 1582 pieces from the mint of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, 1526 from the mints of
                  <placeName>Tarsus, Myriandrus</placeName>, the cities of <placeName>Cyprus, Aradus, Byblus, Sidon</placeName> and <placeName>Ake</placeName> all combined. And the situation is even more impressive than this appears for a much higher proportion of the coins of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> were struck during <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime than is the case with the southern mints.<ref target="#CH2-n87">87</ref> Before Gaugamela, then, there would probably have been more <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
               <persName>Alexanders</persName>
               <pb n="56"/> to be seen in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> than Syrian and Cilician ones. This must have been the result
               not of choice but of the much greater productivity of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> mines. Obviously <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> would prefer to strike coins as close as possible to the place where they were to be
               used.</p>
            <p>There is nothing surprising therefore in the fact that as he controlled more of the East he should open a mint at Damascus.<ref target="#CH2-n88">88</ref> In writing to <persName>Hill</persName> about the possibility of assigning to that mint some of the gold which he had
               previously given to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</placeName>, <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>
               speaks of it as "probably struck after Gaugamela." In <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName>Demanhur</placeName>,</hi> however, he dates the first series of silver <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 332-330; that is he
               believed that the mint was organized soon after the capture of the city by <persName>Parmenio</persName> following the victory of Issus.
               That would mean that <persName>Parmenio's</persName> action was not a mere raid to get the king's baggage, but an occupation of a vital
               point protecting <persName>Alexander's</persName> flank and broadening his territory, as did the campaign in Antilebanon during the siege of
               Tyre. This is likely enough in itself, though no ancient author discusses it. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</placeName> was
               a new step since it had never had a mint;<ref target="#CH2-n89">89</ref> doubtless artisans were brought there from the coast. The complicated
               marks with pellets, which are hard to reduce to a system, may be evidence of a factory not yet well organized. The mint is clearly marked with
               the letters ΔΑ, to which later series add the city's device of the forepart of a ram. It is not easy to find a consistent policy in the use or
               omission of mint marks. Apparently the greatest mints: <persName corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</persName>, <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>, <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName> dispense with them, but by no means all the lesser ones invariably use them and <persName>Newell's</persName> feeling that the difference was between imperial and local issues is hard to support. Here, as so often in
               ancient numismatics, one finds a general conformity without absolute uniformity which is distressing to what one likes to think of as the tidier
               minds of our day.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> would seem an obvious place for the minting of <placeName>Persian</placeName>
               coins and indeed <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> says it "had probably possessed a mint under the <placeName>Persian</placeName> kings,"<ref target="#CH2-n90">90</ref> but there is no proof of it. <placeName>Babelon's</placeName> great work
                  <hi rend="italic">Les Perses achéménides</hi> does not raise the question at all and <persName>Hill</persName>, after discussing the
               difficulties of chronological arrangement, adds,<ref target="#CH2-n91">91</ref> "Nor does it seem possible to make any attempt to identify the
               mints at which coins were struck until the very difficult problem of the mints of <persName>Alexander's</persName> coinage in the East has
               been more or less cleared up." So we do not know whether this is a case of adaptation, like <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> or, of original
               creation, like <placeName corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</placeName>. In either case the city which was intended to be the capital of
               the whole empire began to contribute its share <pb n="57"/> of the conqueror's money, presumably as soon as possible after its surrender. The
               coins were long in being recognized precisely because there was no recognizable mint mark. An article of Six in 1884 pointed the way,<ref target="#CH2-n92">92</ref> to be followed by a thorough demonstration by <persName corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</persName>
               eleven years later.<ref target="#CH2-n93">93</ref> The attribution was indignantly rejected by Sir <persName>Henry Howorth</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n94">94</ref> and many who did not rush into print must have shared his dismay in the shaking of the system of mint
               identification which <persName>Müller</persName> had so conveniently constructed, but the evidence was against <placeName>Howorth</placeName> and no one doubts any more. His insistence that a symbol or monogram should have reference to the place of minting was in the
               old tradition and was mistaken, and yet his dissatisfaction was not without reason, for the matter was more complex than the location of a new
               place of origin for the gold and silver with <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> types. The fact is that the great victory at Gaugamela opened a
               new epoch whose nature is partly expressed in unprecedented developments of the coinage.</p>
            <p>The first step was not revolutionary and it may, indeed, have preceded the occupation of <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>. It was the opening of a new mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> at Sardes (Map 1).<ref target="#CH2-n95">95</ref> There is doubtful evidence that the city may have coined for the <placeName>Persians</placeName>,<ref target="#CH2-n96">96</ref> but it was not issuing any local types. There is no reason why it should not have been used by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> at any moment after its capture in 334 but, as we have seen, there was at that time no
               attempt to supplement the emission of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> for use in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>.
               Why the situation should have changed by 331 we cannot say, but there is one important difference between the function of Sardes and that of the
               earlier <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>tic mints. She was used not so much for tetradrachms, which had been the
               principal product of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> and southern cities, as for gold and drachmae. In this she was a pattern for the
               other towns of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> presently to be put into operation: <placeName>Magnesia</placeName> (330), Lampsacus (329), Abydus, Colophon and <placeName>Miletus</placeName> (325), <placeName>Teos</placeName> (324). A
               reason for this which comes to mind at once is that the pre-Alexandrine coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia
                  Minor</placeName> had been to a large extent gold, or electrum, and small silver. <pb n="58"/> Presumably, therefore, the country liked and would
               use small silver. But there would be an advantage in having all the small silver on a single standard, and this may have been a belated provision
               of uniformity in place of the pre-existing confusion.<ref target="#CH2-n97">97</ref> Presumably the gold was intended to fill the void caused by
               the disappearance of the gold of Lampsacus and the electrum of <placeName>Cyzicus</placeName>, <placeName>Phocaea and Mytilene</placeName>,
               and the metal which used to go into those types was now diverted to the seven towns to be made into <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> staters (above p. 45). There can be no doubt that there was a plan for the special use of
               these towns, but again we find a very general plan with unexplained eccentricities of the individual mints such as might have resulted from
               decisions made by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> one at a time but such as could hardly have resulted from
               any laying out of the plan in detail at the beginning. It is quite out of the question, however, that this pattern can have been achieved by
               accident through the independent action of the cities themselves, or that they should have acted in concert without reference to the sovereign
               whose types they proposed to strike. An eighth city, Ephesus, was added to the group later—probably after 294—and a few other places made minor
               contributions of drachmae in the 3rd century. The omission of Ephesus from the original list was doubtless the result of the confusion at the
               time of her capture which may have crippled her for some time to come.<ref target="#CH2-n98">98</ref> Not only was the supply of drachmae
               adequate for <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime but, the fashion having once been set, the mints of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> continued to be the source of most of the drachmae throughout the empire into the latter half

            <p>A second innovation was more radical. It was the opening of a mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName> for
               tetradrachms, staters, and a surprising number of distaters (Map 1).<ref target="#CH2-n100">100</ref> There is good reason to believe that it

               specimens of all the varieties of tetradrachms were found. But the group cannot have lasted so long. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName> was allied with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> against <persName>Antipater</persName> in the
               Lamian War of 323/2 and cannot at that time have been striking royal <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
               <pb n="59"/> types.<ref target="#CH2-n102">102</ref> The last issue may have been coined in 323 before the beginning of the war but that is the
               latest possible date. Now there is evidence of 8 issues<ref target="#CH2-n103">103</ref> if one makes the usual assumption that each variety of
               symbol means the product of a single year. That would bring the beginning to 330/29, which would satisfy historical probability very well. For
               the purpose of the establishment of the mint is clear: it was to assist in the hiring of Peloponnesian mercenaries. In the fall of 334, between
               the beginning of the siege of <placeName>Halicarnassus</placeName> and the campaign in <placeName>Lycia</placeName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had sent Cleander to the <placeName>Peloponnesus</placeName> to collect soldiers.<ref target="#CH2-n104">104</ref> In his mention of the matter Curtius says "Cleandro cum pecunia misso." The nearest <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>an supply of money would be <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and it was
               better to send the necessary funds with Cleander. But if there had to be a shipment of coin from <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName> whenever Greek mercenaries were to be hired the system would be inconvenient. It would be much simpler if there were a mint
               nearby where money could be issued as it was needed. That should have been apparent as early as Cleander's first trip. But would not the opening
               of a royal mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> be a serious affront to the spirit, if not to the letter, of the
               agreement with the League of <placeName>Corinth</placeName>? We have no information as to <pb n="60"/> any provision about coining by members
               of the League, but there is no evidence that there was any interference with that ancient right of the cities. The large series of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, of <placeName>Corinth</placeName> and of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName> show no sign of intermission at this time, and we have one sure instance of a city initiating an autonomous coinage in <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime: the Amphictionic staters and fractions of Delphi which were struck from about 337 to 334 for the
               rebuilding of the temple.<ref target="#CH2-n105">105</ref> In time <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> coins did find their way into the Greek
                  cities<ref target="#CH2-n106">106</ref> but not because there was any effort, at this early period, of the <placeName>Macedonians</placeName> to replace civic issues by royal ones. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> might well
               have hesitated to set up his own mint in the territory of his Greek allies. But consideration for his Greek allies certainly waned as his
               phenomenal successes gave him less and less need for relying on their good will. After Gaugamela things might be done that would not have been
               done in 334. Moreover there was a consideration which was more than sentimental. Anti-<placeName>Macedonian</placeName> sentiment was centered
               in Sparta whose strength was so considerable that Agis took the offensive in 331 and pressed <persName>Antipater</persName> hard until, in
               the fall of that year, the battle of Megalopolis crushed the Spartan power.<ref target="#CH2-n107">107</ref> After that there was no anti-<placeName>Macedonian</placeName> force to resist an intrusion of royal power or to make the minting and storing of gold in the Péloponnèse an
               undesirable risk.</p>
            <p>The extension of <persName>Alexander's</persName> activities into the territories of the free cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, if a new departure, was not a
               surprising one. The really extraordinary developments were connected with <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> itself.
               The career of the satrap Mazaeus may perhaps deserve a closer scrutiny than it generally gets.<ref target="#CH2-n108">108</ref> He became Satrap
               of <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> about 361 and in this capacity he struck silver at <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> with his name but

               and <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, and in this capacity until 333 he struck silver with his name and title (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

               invasion. It was Arsames who deserted <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>; he was killed at the battle of Issus.<ref target="#CH2-n114">114</ref>
               Where Mazaeus was we do not know, but his coins seem to have continued through the uneasy term of his successor who had fought at the Granicus
               and whose subsequent perils had left him no time for civilian activities.<ref target="#CH2-n115">115</ref> Mazaeus next appears in 331 in command
               of an advance force on the Euphrates which retired before <persName>Alexander's</persName> advance.<ref target="#CH2-n116">116</ref> But if
               he proved ineffective there he gave a good account of himself at Gaugamela where he commanded the Persian right wing and pressed <persName>Parmenio</persName> so hard that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had to halt his pursuit of
               Darius to assist him. Hearing of the king's flight, however, Mazaeus broke off the engagement and led the remnants of his troops to <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-n117">117</ref> For 30 years he had been an important and—so far as
               the record shows—a loyal general and official of the Persian king, yet on the approach of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> he surrendered <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> without resistance. <persName>Curtius</persName> (V. 1. 17) makes it clear that the act was a very convenient one for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. "Gratus adventus eius regi fuit; quippe magni operis obsidio futura erat tarn munitae urbis." He took the precaution of
               marching his army in formation but it was unnecessary; the Babylonians made him welcome. Perhaps the town had been indefensible in spite of what
                  <persName>Curtius</persName> says, perhaps it was clear to Mazaeus that his king could never make another stand. Yet it is hard to avoid
               the suspicion that the surrender had been bargained for and that there was a price involved. The suspicion is deepened when we find that Mazaeus
               was promptly appointed Satrap of <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>—the first Persian to be given such a position. To
                  Tarn<ref target="#CH2-n118">118</ref> this is an act of chivalry like the later treatment of Porus: "<persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was honoring a worthy opponent." But it is surely an extravagant gesture to put so great and
               rich a district into the hands of an enemy simply because he had been "a worthy opponent." To be sure, the compliment was not without safeguards.
                  <persName>Apollo-dorus</persName> of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> was made commander of the troops left with Mazaeus and <pb n="62"/> Asclepiodorus was made collector of the taxes.<ref target="#CH2-n119">119</ref> There was a further unique aspect of the new satrap's
               position, however. He at once began to issue silver tetradrachms of the Attic standard (generally spoken of as staters) on one side of which was
               Baaltars, as the inscription showed, and on the other, a lion with the name of Mazaeus! (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 3).<ref target="#CH2-n120">120</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is this which most deeply shocked <placeName>Howorth</placeName>. "Prima facie" he says, "it seems incredible that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> should have permitted one of his satraps, and that a <placeName>Persian</placeName>...to
               issue coins in the satrap's own name." The Cilician Baal would be inappropriate to <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>,
               and the Aramaic inscriptions would be unintelligible to the Greeks, the only people who would use the coins.<ref target="#CH2-n121">121</ref>
               <placeName>Howorth</placeName> was defending a doomed thesis, but more attention should have been paid to the facts against which he
               protested. Attempts to explain this unprecedented concession have been far from convincing. Six, who was the first to face the problem, could
               only urge that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, about to set out for the Far East "ne s'est pas,
               certainment, occupé des types ou des légends de monnaies destinées aux populations indigènes." But the idea that this was a trifle too slight to
               engage <persName>Alexander's</persName> attention is certainly untenable. At the very time that the lion staters were beginning to appear
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> joined the great cities of <persName>Alexander's</persName> earlier conquest
               to produce his own types.<ref target="#CH2-n122">122</ref> He could have attended to one series if he could provide for the other. Some special
               reason must be found for this striking exception to the regular rule that satraps could not coin in their own names. Most of the historians, if
               they record the fact at all, do so without comment. Tarn<ref target="#CH2-n123">123</ref> and <persName>Cohen</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n124">124</ref> avoid the central point: "he was the only satrap permitted to coin, doubtless for the convenience of the <placeName>Babylonian</placeName> trade;" "pour aider À la renaissance du trafic (<persName>Alexandre</persName>) lui laisse le privilège de
               battre monnaie." Money issued at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> might well assist trade, but why <hi rend="italic">this</hi> money and why the name <persName>Mazaeus</persName>? In his answer to <placeName>Howorth</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n125">125</ref>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</persName> gave the most thorough-going attempt at an explanation. "<persName>Alexander's</persName> efforts to make the utmost allowance for the oriental <pb n="63"/> point of view is well known. For the silver, the types
               of the Kilikian satrapal issues of <persName>Mazaeus</persName>, Baaltars in the guise of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> and the lion were retained.—On the first silver issue struck at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>
               <persName>Mazaeus</persName> continued not only the coin types of the Kilikian satrapy, but also, in accordance with the usual practice,
               their inscriptions, which records his own name and that of the god represented, the latter being intended to promulgate the figure of Baaltars
               still little known in the far east, i.e., the figure of that particular Baal of all the countless Baalim who had to be identified with the Greek
                  <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> of contemporary imperial issues. Before the end of his short term of office
               (330-328) the satrap <persName>Mazaeus</persName> appears to have been induced to give up these inscriptions, and from this date on until
               306 the satrapal coins remain anepigraphic" (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 4). As to the types, <persName>Hill</persName> has an important amendment to offer.<ref target="#CH2-n126">126</ref> "The
               argument of most weight against the attribution to <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> lies in the fact that the coins
               with the name of Mazeus attributed to <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> identify the god on the obverse as Baaltars,
               who would be unknown and unworshipped at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>. The answer to this objection is that,
               although issued at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>, this was a satrapal coinage intended chiefly for the payment of
               troops, many of whom may have been raised in <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> by <persName>Mazaeus</persName> and brought by him to the
               East." This does indeed propose a reason for the selection of types. But can it have been necessary to maintain a separate coinage for the
               convenience of a body of mercenaries? And if they demanded western types, why the lion alone (which was the type of <placeName>Myriandrus</placeName>) instead of the familiar lion and bull or lion and deer of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>? And would it not be important
               to give them the double shekels to which they were accustomed instead of tetradrachms on the Attic standard used by the conqueror? <persName>Alexander's</persName> desire to conciliate the Orientals of which <persName corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</persName>
               speaks is indeed a most important consideration. But surely it is characteristic of his policy from this point on and not of that which guided
               him before Gaugamela. Why otherwise the replacement of local issues by his own types? When all is said there is as yet no explanation of the
               satrap's name on the silver of his new office. But how much is explained by the hypothesis that the price of the bloodless surrender of <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> was the confirming to <persName>Mazaeus</persName> of his title and privileges !
               When <persName corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</persName> speaks of the "usual practice" of inscriptions accompanying the types he
               means, of course, the practice of the Persian satraps in <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>. If <persName>Mazaeus</persName> was allowed to
               continue that, then his position as Satrap of <persName>Babylon</persName>ia under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> would be equivalent to his position as Satrap of <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> under Darius. But, whatever were his
               rights in the matter of coining in his earlier office, it is not likely that he now arrogated to himself that power of decision which the <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> restricts to the sovereign. The appointment of Asclepiodorus as collector of taxes shows that <persName>Mazaeus</persName>' <pb n="64"/> function was not financial and we may be very sure that the number and kinds of coins to be struck were decided
               by higher authority than his. The phrase "the Satrap <persName>Mazaeus</persName> appears to have been induced to give up these
               inscriptions" calls up an amusing picture of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> persuading and <persName>Mazaeus</persName> magnanimously consenting.<ref target="#CH2-n127">127</ref> If the special privilege was ended before the satrap's
               death in 328 it is hardly likely to have been done in so courtly a fashion. The reason for suggesting it is that there are anepigraphic lion
               staters which seem to come so early in the series that <persName corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</persName> would assign them to the
               first satrap. But that is not proven. The staters with <persName>Mazaeus</persName>' name are very rare but <placeName>Babelon</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n128">128</ref> publishes four varieties: with no symbol, with a wreath, with a serpent, with K. If they follow the normal
               Greek practice of a different symbol every year all the years of <persName>Mazaeus</persName>' satrapy would be accounted for.</p>
            <p>Whatever the intent behind the origin of the lion staters, and their divisions, they did serve an economic function for they continued to be
               issued from <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> into, and perhaps through, the reign of <persName>Seleucus</persName> I and, in lesser numbers, from Susa<ref target="#CH2-n129">129</ref> and Ecbatana<ref target="#CH2-n130">130</ref> in the
               same reign. This is not easy to account for. They were by then so much under weight for Attic tetradrachms that they must have been at a
               disadvantage compared with the full weight coins of Alexandrine type being struck at the same time. Yet, if this were intended for the
               convenience of a population accustomed to the use of sigloi, the fractions would have been made to fit the Persian system, which they do not.
               (Parenthetically it must be pointed out that we are by no means sure that the inhabitants of <persName>Babylon</persName>ia did have any
               preference for sigloi).<ref target="#CH2-n131">131</ref> One is tempted to think of coins only locally valid where a discrepancy between face
               value and bullion value could be ignored by the sovereign, and <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n132">132</ref> has very tentatively suggested a connection between the lion staters and the temple of Bel. He recognizes the
               difficulty created by the lion issues of Susa and Ecbatana and can only hazard a guess that "if the temple at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> could issue "temple money' so too, presumably, could the hardly less important and famous temples of
               Artemis-Nanaia at Susa and of Aene at Ecbatana." He cites the interesting <pb n="65"/> correspondence in fabric between the lion staters and the
               much later <persName>Jewish</persName> shekels of the First Revolt—also temple money. Though I have nothing better to suggest, I cannot
               believe that <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>'s hypothesis is defensible. It is true that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> made his offerings to Bel-Marduk and directed the reconstruction of his temple<ref target="#CH2-n133">133</ref> but there cannot have been any intended connection between that act and the first lion staters on which the god
               is specifically named not <persName>Marduk</persName> but Baaltars. One must suppose either that the <placeName>Babylonian</placeName>s
               could not read the inscription (which is likely enough) or that the correspondence was not thought of until the appearance of the anepigraphic
               staters. It is true that Baaltars and <persName>Marduk</persName> were of sufficiently similar nature so that the seated god could be taken
               for either one of them. But that is patently not true of Artemis-Nanaia of Susa or Aene-Anaitis-Nanea of Ecbatana. And if the basis of the lion
               staters' success had been real religious association it is surprising that it should have disappeared so quickly. Only in <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> can they have possibly lasted beyond the reign of <persName>Seleucus</persName> I and there
               only until 275 at the latest, when Antiochus moved the inhabitants to Seleucia.<ref target="#CH2-n134">134</ref> The theory of a limited
               circulation is further complicated by their appearance in the <persName>Oxus Hoard</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-n135">135</ref> I cannot
               solve the enigma but, at the moment, the point of importance is that the length of life of the experimental currency was enough to make it plain
               that it was acceptable to the community and it is only fair to suppose that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               and <persName>Mazaeus</persName> had reasonable grounds for supposing that it would be acceptable.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Mazaeus</persName> is not the only satrap to turn up on coins in <persName>Babylon</persName>ia, but the second instance has
               to do with a very different class of coins: the imitation of <placeName>Athenian</placeName> owls. At the end of the 5th century it could be
               said that the owls of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> were the international currency par excellence, and even down to

               the supply of owls was much reduced and they are accompanied by a growing number of imitations of <placeName>Athenian</placeName> coins. Early
               hoards, such as those of Caboul and Malayer published by Schlumberger, show a surprising number of 5th century owls, about equal to the coins of
               all the other cities together, but the 4th century owls do not seem to be included. Instead, one gets imitations.<ref target="#CH2-n137">137</ref> Now one kind of imitation, <pb n="66"/> said to amount to a "very large group" is the type of owl bearing in Aramaic the name of
               Mazaces, whose provenance is consistently <persName>Babylon</persName>ia (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

After Issus Mazaces had been sent as Persian satrap to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> where he kept order until the arrival of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> army, and where he
               issued tetradrachms with <placeName>Athenian</placeName> types and bronzes with the head of a satrap and a galley, both classes bearing his
               name in Aramaic.<ref target="#CH2-n139">139</ref> Being too weak to resist, he received <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in friendly fashion into the country and the cities,<ref target="#CH2-n140">140</ref> handing over 800 talents and the royal
                  furniture.<ref target="#CH2-n141">141</ref> Berve thinks it likely that he found a place at <persName>Alexander's</persName> court<ref target="#CH2-n142">142</ref> but the sources have nothing more to say about him. The evidence for his connection with <persName>Babylon</persName>ia is purely numismatic, as to which <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> says, "Our coins do suggest
               that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had entrusted to Mazaces the governorship of some important city or
               district as a reward for his ready surrender of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>." His owls then would be an exact
               parallel to <persName>Mazaeus</persName>' lion staters except that we do not know what position Mazaces could have held which would entitle
               him to this distinction. Nor do we know the location of the mint. <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> gives good
               reasons for not putting it at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>, yet he can only suggest Uruk or Opis, neither of
               which has any special claim to consideration. Yet if there are many things puzzling about these coins their purpose is more evident than that of
                  <persName>Mazaeus</persName>' issues. They can hardly have been intended primarily for use in <persName>Babylon</persName>ia, even
               though they turn up there. The imperial mint was producing <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> tetradrachms and lion staters as well, and that
               surely ought to have satisfied the demand. But if one wanted to mint silver for general circulation in the East imitation owls would be the
               obvious thing to strike. Of course, this cannot have been a private venture of Mazaces. It must have been part of a plan that had imperial
               approval and prima facie the plan was to supply familiar types for use in the East.</p>
            <p>But these two classes of silver were not the only innovation connected with the capture of <persName>Babylonia</persName>. "Demanding
               explanation also" says <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>, "is the fact that for many years double and (more rarely)
               single gold darics of Achae-minid type were coined alongside the Hon staters. These gold coins seem, almost <pb n="67"/> invariably, to turn up
               in eastern Iran and Bactria and not in <persName>Babylonia</persName>. But as most of the specimens of which we possess any record at all
               have come from the single great 'Treasure of the Oxus,' this seeming fact may be illusory. That both double darics and Hon staters were mostly
               coined at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> is certain."<ref target="#CH2-n143">143</ref> The double darics "which

Though the conventional figure of the king in kneeling or running position is preserved, the face, with its straight
               nose, is a Hellenized version of the Persian monarch. The relief is higher and the incuse on the reverse, instead of being an amorphous
               depression, is filled with wavy lines or curves that tend to form a pattern (cf. <hi rend="italic">BMC <placeName>Arabia</placeName>,</hi> Pl.
               XX, 1-13). Moreover, most of the specimens have Greek letters or monograms on the obverse. There are no double darics which do not have some or
               all of these characteristics and none, therefore, which can be assigned to an earlier period. That is, this higher denomination is an invention
               of the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. What is the unit to which it belongs—the rarer single gold
               daric? There are few darics with letters or monograms like those of the doubles<ref target="#CH2-n145">145</ref> and none with quite the same
               wavy patterns on the reverse. There are, however, some which show a similar pattern and which also have high relief and a Hellenized portrait <hi rend="italic">(BMC <placeName>Arabia</placeName>,</hi> Pl. XXV, 21-25). As to these, <persName>Hill</persName> is cautious. He calls
               attention to the likeness of the two denominations, but catalogues the darics with the <placeName>Persian</placeName> Empire instead of with
               the Alexandrine Empire of the East. They must, he says "belong to the last <placeName>Persian</placeName> king, <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</persName>,<ref target="#CH2-n146">146</ref> and in the catalogue they appear under the caption '<persName corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</persName>' <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>." There are a few
               sigloi like them. Only one is illustrated (Pl. XXV, 26) but it certainly shows a portrait unlike the earlier sigloi. Hill's arrangement would
               mean that under <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</persName> there was a marked artistic change in the coins issued at <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> affecting both darics and sigloi, and that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> used and developed the new style in the same city for the making of a denomination of his
               own, the double daric, though he did not strike either single darics or sigloi. The sudden appearance of a Greek profile on coins of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</persName> is possible but surprising, <pb n="68"/> and the suggestion might be ventured as an
               alternative that these darics and sigloi are also coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> but from a
               different mint, which would explain their differences from the double darics.</p>
            <p>That these are indeed from <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> is the general persuasion, but it can hardly be called
               proven. The piece with M in the field <hi rend="italic">(BMC,</hi> p. 176, no. 2) may be compared with the <placeName>Babylonian</placeName>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> teradrachm with M <hi rend="italic">(<placeName>Demanhur</placeName>,</hi> 3980); the combination M and Φ on the tetradrachms <hi rend="italic">(<placeName>Demanhur</placeName>,</hi>

               which <persName>Hill</persName> labels "Usually attributed to the mint of <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>" and
               that of which he says "The following are for the most part of ruder workmanship, and were perhaps made farther East than <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>." The idea that all these strange issues were the product of <persName>Mazaeus</persName> is
                  tempting<ref target="#CH2-n147">147</ref> but it will need more facts to make it a certainty.</p>
            <p>If there is general agreement on the fact of <persName>Alexander's</persName> striking the double darics there is very little said about the
               reason for it. Unlike the lion staters these from beginning to end are on a different standard from the Attic and there must have been a
               particular reason for the premeditated confusion of two gold coins one of which was not quite twice the weight of the other. It seems inescapable
               that the invention of the double daric rests on the intention to use the daric, and perhaps the darics which <persName>Hill</persName>
               assigns to Darius III are actually the units of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. But there were others
               available. Diodorus says that the capture of Susa brought in 40,000 talents of uncoined gold and silver and 9,000 talents of darics; that of
               Persepolis, 120,000 talents reckoning the gold at its value in silver.<ref target="#CH2-n148">148</ref> We have seen reason to believe that the

               There is no activity in local mints. Indeed, it is a fact of the greatest importance that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no mint for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins in the East except <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>. The map will show the surprising lack of proportion which multiplies the western mints and leaves nothing but <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> to supply the funds for the long and costly campaign east of the two rivers (Map 3).
               The army cannot have been without coin. Even though they were going into country where an economy of barter may have prevailed widely, the Greek
               and <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> soldiery cannot have been induced to forego their accustomed pay from the summer of 330 to that of 325.
               Yet the record, which contains two mutinies, has no suggestion of the kind of difficulty about pay so common with ancient armies. The
               cancellation of debts which followed the marriages at Susa<ref target="#CH2-n149">149</ref> was, to be sure, a phenomenon of the return to
               familiar civilization, but how did the army incur debts of 20,000 talents if they had been operating on payments in kind? The reorganization
               which provided for "ten stater men" between the ordinary soldiers and the "double pay men" is reported<ref target="#CH2-n150">150</ref> without
               any intimation that pay was being reintroduced. If <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had founded his eastern
               cities (particularly the military colonies)<ref target="#CH2-n151">151</ref> without money could the Greek historians possibly have avoided
               comment on it? There is no escape from the fact that the army must have had money in the East and the necessary conclusion seems to be that it
               was transported from <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>, the nearest source. But that surely presents an enormous
               problem of transport. The system of the Seleucids is enlightening. They had mints certainly at Susa, Persepolis, Ecbatana and Bactra, with
               another which may have been at Hecatompylus or Artacoana, and the contents of the <persName>Oxus Hoard</persName> show that the mint of
               Bactra supplied the needs of that district as it was intended to do.<ref target="#CH2-n152">152</ref> Why should <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> rely on so remote a city as <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>

            <p>But did he? It is instructive to look at what happened to the treasure from <placeName>Susa</placeName> and <placeName>Persepolis</placeName>. The bulk of it was so great that <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName> says<ref target="#CH2-n153">153</ref> it required 10,000 pairs of mules and 5,000 camels to move it. <persName>Curtius</persName> says<ref target="#CH2-n154">154</ref> that the baggage and a large part of the army was left at <placeName>Persepolis</placeName> in charge of <persName>Parmenio</persName> and Craterus. But it was not to stay there. We know from Arrian<ref target="#CH2-n155">155</ref> that <persName>Parmenio</persName> was ordered to take the treasure to the citadel in Ecbatana and deliver it to Harpalus who had a guard of 6,000 <placeName>Macedonians</placeName> plus a few auxiliary troops. The mention of Harpalus is puzzling. We do not know how or when he got to
               Ecbatana or why or when he left to return to <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>. Moreover, in the next section Arrian
               tells us that Cleitus, who had been left sick in <placeName>Susa</placeName>, was ordered to proceed to <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>,
               take the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> guard of the treasure and march against the Parthyaeans. Then who was left to guard the treasure?
               Something has certainly dropped out of the account. Fortunately we know the main fact. At the time of <persName>Parmenio</persName>'s
               execution in the fall of 330 he was Satrap of Media and guardian of the king's treasure whose total Diodorus gives as 180,000 talents;<ref target="#CH2-n156">156</ref>
               <persName>Justin</persName> says 190,000.<ref target="#CH2-n157">157</ref> Clearly this was <persName>Alexander's</persName> capital
               for the financing of the campaign in <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>. But it
               was not taken to <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> at all. Now it has been suggested what Harpalus was doing <pb n="72"/> in <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>: he was supervising the coining of the Persian treasure.<ref target="#CH2-n158">158</ref> This
               is on the theory that Harpalus, as treasurer, had control over minting, which there is nothing to support. But there is a more serious difficulty
               than the theoretical one. If Harpalus put 180,000 talents into coins what are they? In discussing the Seleucid mint of <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>, <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> says,<ref target="#CH2-n159">159</ref> 'There need be less
               surprise that a mint was opened by the Greeks at <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName> than that the mint should have commenced to function so late.
               At least, the earliest coins of Alexandrine types that can be assigned confidently to <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName> do not antedate the
               reign of <persName>Seleucus</persName>. There do exist a few earlier pieces which may have been coined there." But "a few pieces" will not
               solve our dilemma. From this enormous treasure must have come a series at least comparable in size to that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>. But there is no such series. There are still small groups whose attribution is doubtful but the
               product of the great mints is known, and there is nothing left over to assign to <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>. Its output must have
               disappeared.</p>
            <p>Unless its output was darics. To prove that would need the assembly of much more evidence than is now available. The gold already published as
               presumably Alexandrine is not enough in bulk to fill the need. But I think no search for darics has ever been undertaken with this in mind. Such
               a search might prove disappointing, but the possibility ought to be kept open that the double darics "certainly from <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>" were supplemented by others of more eastern appearance and by darics and sigloi whose place of
               origin may have been <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>. To the circumstantial evidence already cited one more item is to be added: the one
               experiment of <persName>Seleucus</persName> I in coining a double daric was at <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>
               <hi rend="italic">(ESM,</hi> p. 171, no. 460).</p>
            <p>Even this much proven would leave us with baffling questions. The problem of transport would not be solved. <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName> is
               a couple of hundred miles nearer the eastern campaigns but it is still far enough in all conscience. There are several possibilities, none of
               them very comfortable. There may have been mints still further east which contributed their share to the expenses of the campaign. This would
               mean reducing still further the number that we could credit to <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>. There may have been other treasures containing
               coin in the East of which we have no record. Money already in circulation may have been confiscated and used for the army. Eastern cities,
               perhaps his own foundations, may have been used as advance treasuries for the accumulation of coin. Of course, if the treasure of <placeName>Susa</placeName> and <placeName>Persepolis</placeName> is involved at all in <pb n="73"/> the eastern campaigns the question of
               transport remains. Either bullion or coin must have been carried to the army and though bullion would have been less bulky it would have been
               just as heavy. But it would seem that the most inconvenient arrangement would be for the mint to forward its current production at frequent
               intervals, though presumably that is how the paymasters got their funds when mints were close by. For a big and remote army that would have meant
               keeping the transport trains on the road constantly with a large body of men of necessity detailed for guard duty. But obviously the conversion
               into coin of enough metal for a campaign of 5 years' duration could not be done quickly.</p>
            <p>The problem of silver is also very obscure. A natural assumption would be that if <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName> minted darics it minted
               sigloi as well, but here there is a still smaller group <hi rend="italic">(BMC <placeName>Arabia</placeName>,</hi> p. 160, nos. 88-91) which
               there is reason to attribute to the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. We know, on Schlumberger's
               showing, how slight was the importance of the siglos in the total currency of the <placeName>Persian</placeName> empire. Still, in <persName>Alexander's</persName> time it had <hi rend="italic">some</hi> importance or no late ones would have been struck at all. But these
               few sigloi and the imitations of Mazaces are the only silver we have found so far which has the appearance of being designed for use in the East.
               Could that and the late darics and double darics have been sufficient for the need?</p>
            <p>This would be the place to give an account of the king's income and expenses if we could only do so with any confidence. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a summary calculation of income and expenses given by Beloch (IV. 1., pp. 41-43) in which the cost of the army is put at 7,000
               talents a year. The uncertainty of the figures is illustrated by the eclectic confidence given to the sources. <persName>Justin</persName>
               XIII. 1. 9 gives specific figures for the time of <persName>Alexander's</persName> death: erant enim in thesauris L milia talentum et in
               annuo vectigali ac tributo tricena milia. The first sum is accepted, the second rejected on the grounds that Herodotus III. 90-95 gives the
               yearly tribute of <persName>Darius I</persName> as 14,560 talents (10,000 "ohne den indischen Tribut und die Naturalleistungen"), which is
               regarded as an exaggeration, while <persName>Antigonus</persName> at the height of his power in 315, when he controlled nearly all the <placeName>Asiatic</placeName> satrapies, had an income of only 11,000 talents (Diodorus XIX. 56. 5). Beloch therefore reduces <persName>Justin's</persName> 30,000 talents to 15,000. Various extraordinary sums such as that for Hephaestion's funeral, and gifts to the army are
               accepted, but the total of 12,000 talents "contra decus regium—tumu-lumque" as <persName>Justin</persName> puts it, on which <persName>Justin</persName> (XII. 12. 12) and Diodorus (XVII. 115. 5) agree, is rejected because even the funeral of a Roman emperor cost no
               more than 400 talents. If we accept Beloch's figure of 7,000 talents for the yearly cost of the army we must do so with the realization that it
               is no more than a good guess. The most recent and most thorough study of <persName>Alexander's</persName>
               <pb n="74"/> economy is that of <persName>A. M. Andreades</persName> 'Ιστορία τ<graphic url="NS11_sym12.jpg"/>ς Ελληνίκης δημοσίας

               same unavoidable weakness of having to substitute probable hypotheses for data. Both authors agree that <persName>Alexander's</persName>
               expenses exceeded his income.</p>
            <p>Let us for the moment accept 7,000 talents as a reasonable military budget and, using very much simplified figures (since there is no possibility
               of exactitude) see what the consequences would be. If Diodorus is right and there were 9,000 talents of darics in <placeName>Susa</placeName>,
               then the first year would be paid for without the need of further mintage—indeed there would be a surplus of 2,000 talents. Suppose we say that
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> would be provided for from the death of Darius to the summer of 329. He
               must then make provision for 2 years' campaigning, from the summer of 329 to that of 327 when he entered <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and an entirely new set of conditions. He would have needed 14,000 talents for the army, which the
               treasure at <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName> was well able to provide. Let us assume that 10,000 talents is to be in the form of double darics
               and (to make things as simple as possible) let us assume that the double daric equals the distater and that 150 of them go to the talent.<ref target="#CH2-n160">160</ref> That would mean minting 1,500,000 of them. What would be a reasonable number of specimens now preserved to
               represent that number originally struck? There is one recent study which has at least some degree of control for its calculation of survival
               rate: <persName>E. J. P. Raven</persName>, 'The Amphictionic Coinage of Delphi."<ref target="#CH2-n161">161</ref> But in spite of the
               author's sane and careful treatment there is an embarrassing spread in the possibilities according to the denomination investigated and the total
               amount supposed to have been struck—a spread from 1 in 7,310 to 1 in 240,000 ! Mr. Raven himself is a little discouraged and recalling that
               "previous estimates of survival rates have usually been in the region of 1 in 5,000" admits that "that figure may not be far from the average of
               all Greek coins." Let us adopt it with no illusions.<ref target="#CH2-n162">162</ref> It would mean that of the original 1,500,000 double darics,
               300 <pb n="75"/> should have survived. If we assume that 2,000 talents consisted of silver (the other 2,000 being accounted for by the surplus
               darics) and that the silver was imitation <placeName>Athenian</placeName> tetradrachms at 1,500 to the talent, there would have been 3,000,000
               struck, of which 600 should have survived. If one follows more closely the proportions of Seleucid coinage the amount of gold will be much
               decreased and the silver correspondingly increased, but the Seleucids had no great reservoirs of gold to make into money. I will not affront the
               reader by pointing out what a tissue of uncertainties we have here. Everyone must decide for himself whether such procedure can do any good at
               all. I may express my own feeling that, no matter how you calculate, there do not seem to be enough coins to meet the requirements. There has
               been no gathering of either double darics or imitation owls, but I find it hard to believe that a census would approach the necessary figures. It
               seems to me that there must have been supplements from more <placeName>Persian</placeName> coins, from the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage, or from other series. It is unlikely that the country itself offered large amounts
               of plunder.</p>
            <p>We have some evidence of subsidiary series. There are a number of pieces that have been often attributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>: varieties of imitation owls, small coins with <placeName>Athena</placeName>'s head and an eagle,
               drachms and the famous tetradrachms with the head of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> and an eagle, these last with the
               name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi> 1,12).</hi>
               <ref target="#CH2-n163">163</ref> The old attribution is disposed of, finally, one hopes, by an admirable article by <persName>R. B,
                  Whitehead</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n164">164</ref> in which he shows clearly that, though specimens are acquired in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, their place of origin is across the mountains in <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName>. These, then, might have helped to fill
               the need, but their number cannot have been large.</p>
            <p>As to the use of <persName>Alexander's</persName> regular coinage, we are in strange doubt. <persName>Alexanders</persName> do turn up
               in <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName>. I have recently seen a number acquired by an inexpert collector who had no interest in selecting
               rarities. There were 8 tetradrachms, 6 drachms and a hemidrachm, but the only pieces surely early enough to belong to this period were one stater
               of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> and one late daric. The silver was all of 324 or later. The <persName>Oxus Hoard</persName>, which
               ought to be <pb n="76"/> very enlightening, fails us entirely. Of the 100 odd tetradrachms and 100 odd drachms said to have been included, only
               one was sufficiently described to be identified, and that turns out to be a coin of <persName>Seleucus</persName> I from <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">ESM,</hi> p. 166, no. 454. We have no way of knowing the date of the others nor, if we knew, could we tell
               whether they came into the country with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> or later. J. Hackin's "Répartition
               des Monnaies anciennes en <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName>"<ref target="#CH2-n165">165</ref> makes no mention of <persName>Alexanders</persName> (but neither does he mention Seleucids, though he prints "Séleucides" on his map at Tash Kurgan). So far as our evidence
               goes, the coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> himself played no part of any importance in his conquest
               of Bactria.</p>
            <p>There remains the possibility that he had more <placeName>Persian</placeName> coins and used them, but I do not see how that can ever be
                  proved.<ref target="#CH2-n166">166</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The record of <persName>Alexander's</persName> finances in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> is extremely meager.
                  <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n167">167</ref> records the gift to the king of Taxila of 1,000 talents, which he says was in coin, and the great displeasure
               of <persName>Alexander's</persName> friends. The same incident occurs in <persName>Curtius</persName>,<ref target="#CH2-n168">168</ref>
               with an interesting addition. Omphis, being confirmed as king of Taxila, presented <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> with sundry gifts and 80 talents signati argenti.<ref target="#CH2-n169">169</ref>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was gratified but returned the offering and instead gave Omphis 1,000
               talents ex praeda quam vehebat, gold and silver vessels, <placeName>Persian</placeName> robes and 30 horses. This is an odd episode. What did
               Omphis expect to buy with so small a gift as 80 talents? The exchange of presents would be appropriate ritual between two kings meeting to form
               an alliance but the 1,000 talents, even if <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName> was not right about its being coin,
               would be much more credible if it were to insure the cooperation of the forces of Taxila than if it were a mere gesture of vanity, as both the
               authors seem to take it to be. For what it is worth, the incident shows <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> as
               actually carrying his treasure in his baggage <pb n="77"/> and as having enough so that he could part with a large sum before the conquest of
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> had fairly begun.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Curtius</persName> says<ref target="#CH2-n170">170</ref> that after the defeat of Porus and the founding of Nicaea and Bucephala
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> gave each of the leaders a crown and 1,000 aurei—a detail so conventional
               that it is hardly to be taken seriously. Both Arrian<ref target="#CH2-n171">171</ref> and <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n172">172</ref> speak of <placeName>Indian</placeName> mercenaries. This is all that is pertinent in the literary tradition.
               The coins themselves, however, are more helpful. First there is the negative evidence of the extreme rarity of <persName>Alexander's</persName> own money in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n173">173</ref> Second there is
               the scarcity of <placeName>Persian</placeName> gold and the comparative frequency of <placeName>Persian</placeName> silver.<ref target="#CH2-n174">174</ref> Third there is the existence of a class of silver coins of double, half and quarter siglos weight<ref target="#CH2-n175">175</ref> which seems to have formed the basic currency of the northwest district to which <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> first came. Macdonald explains the infrequency of <placeName>Persian</placeName> gold in
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> by the fact that there was so much gold there that the ratio with silver was only 8:
               1. This would, of course, be unfavorable to the use of darics coined on the <placeName>Persian</placeName> standard of 13. 3: 1 and, to a
               lesser extent, to the gold coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> struck at 10: 1. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> may, therefore, have planned to use silver only, though in this case he would have had
               little need to import specie. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> is notoriously rich in metal and, moreover, much given to
                  hoarding,<ref target="#CH2-n176">176</ref> so that here, as in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, the conqueror will
               have been able to look forward to the capture of enough bullion to finance his campaign. It certainly was not financed by staters and
               tetradrachms transported from <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>.</p>
            <p>This digression into the perplexities of the East has led us far from the main course of our study, but it could hardly be neglected. No matter
               how the details are finally settled, the general picture is clear. Before Gaugamela the empire had two monetary zones: <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> (Map 2) where the <pb n="78"/>
               imperial types joined or dominated but did not extinguish the local currencies; <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> (Map 3) where the local currencies were replaced by the imperial. To this period belongs the fiscal
               purpose of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, as defined by Schlumberger, of eventually achieving monetary
               uniformity for the empire as a whole. But after Gaugamela a third zone is added, of <persName>Mesopotamia</persName> and the East (Map 4) in
               which the preexisting confusion is not merely tolerated but augmented by the emissions of the conqueror. There is concession to the <placeName>Persian</placeName> tradition, as proved by the double darics; concession to the satrapal tradition, as proved by the imitation owls.
               Whether temporarily or permanently the ideal of uniformity is laid aside. In part this was doubtless the result of difficulties greater in the
               East than in the West: the continuous warfare, the strange and remote terrain, the alien mores of the people. But it also resulted from a changed
               state of mind, for there are two phenomena in the West, one beginning about 327 during <persName>Alexander's</persName> absence in the East,
               the other in 324 after his return. The first is the institution at <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> of a series of silver staters of <placeName>Persian</placeName> weight and <placeName>Cilician</placeName> type without any reference to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, for the use of Issus, <placeName>Mallus</placeName>, Soli and <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> itself (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 7, 8).<ref target="#CH2-n177">177</ref> The other is the coining, in the mints of
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, of gold staters with the name and type of <persName>Philip</persName>
                  II.<ref target="#CH2-n178">178</ref> Neither of these can be explained by any pressure of necessity or change of conditions. Both must have
               been designed to gratify the sentiment of those who still remembered kindly the money that preceded <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
            <p>All this is perfectly appropriate to the historical situation. Until the final defeat of the <placeName>Persian</placeName> king <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was an adventurer, with everything to gain, but much to lose. Whenever his
               resolution was taken that he himself was to be the Great King, it became imperative for him to assert his prestige and <pb n="79"/> his power.
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>tics were to be taught that the imperial structure which they had regarded as
               supreme was in process of being overthrown by a mighty foreigner, supported by foreign gods, who was no mere raider, but had come among them to
               conquer, to occupy and to organize. <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> and <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> and the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> were to become as
               familiar to them as the gods of their own country and the odd little monarch with bow and spear. But when the empire was won, when he was in fact
               the <persName>Great King</persName> himself, what did it matter any longer? Then came the experiments with the amalgamation of races, the
                  <placeName>Persians</placeName> in positions of trust, the oriental splendor and extravagance, the figure of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on the great decadrachm, a <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> king on one side charging
               against Poms, but, on the other, a divine king in <placeName>Persian</placeName> dress, wielding the thunderbolt (<hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               </hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">late 1,</hi>
               </hi>13).</p>
            <p>But, if there was confusion in the East and breach of precedent in the West, it must not be thought that the general system was weakened, much
               less abandoned, after Gaugamela. The old mints continued to strike their conventional coins, the latest organized of the great mints, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>, beginning to operate about 326.<ref target="#CH2-n179">179</ref> About
               that time also there was a marked, though unexplained, increase in the output of a number of cities.<ref target="#CH2-n180">180</ref> Neither
               quantity nor quality showed signs of slackening, and there must have been few west of <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> who did not know the types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
            <p>The ultimate test of a currency is its ability to provide what is needed. So judged, <persName>Alexander's</persName> international currency
               had been a great success. It had furnished him with the resources of war and peace over a vast territory whose <pb n="80"/> expansion he could
               not foresee in detail. It had succeeded, at least as far as <persName>Mesopotamia</persName>, in introducing an economy of uniform specie to
               regions accustomed to other currencies or to none. Trade had carried the daric and the owl far and wide, but the army and the civil power carried
               the gold <placeName>Athena</placeName> and the silver <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> farther yet. As an
               instrument of conquest or commerce and of government, the coinage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> made a
               record no less brilliant than his more familiar achievements.</p>
            <p>Could its success have continued? Would it have served the whole established empire which he planned? No question which must assume the continued
               life and health of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> can have a satisfying answer, but here, as in other
               cases, one must doubt if he could have maintained what he created. There is no reason to suspect that he was an economist more gifted than his
               generation. It is the common belief that his expenses outran his income. Doubtless the mines of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> seemed inexhaustible; inexhaustible also the huge <placeName>Persian</placeName> treasure. With its capture begin the
               tales of extravagances which, in the end, were sure to impoverish the royal power. If he could have learned in <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>, when there was nothing more to conquer, to match his expenses to his needs as successfully as he
               seems to have done while he was winning <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName>, his financial structure might have
               stood for generations. But who was there to teach him?</p>

               <p>In the essay on <hi rend="italic">The Fortune or Virtue of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
                  </hi> II. 11, the 30 days' provisions are given on the authority of Phylarchus. These two calculations cannot be made to coincide. If the
                  total of <persName>Alexander's</persName> army of invasion and <persName>Parmenio</persName>'s advance force was about 40,000 foot
                  and 6,000 horse (<persName>G. T. Griffith</persName>, <hi rend="italic">The Mercenaries of the Hellenistic World,</hi>
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_2653941">Cambridge</placeName>, 1935, p. 12) it could hardly have been supported for 30 days on 70 talents.
                  There is an unfortunate silence of the sources on the fundamental matter of the soldiers' daily wage in <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                  army (Parke, <hi rend="italic"> Greek Mercenary Soldiers,</hi> p. 233, n. 1. It may be pointed out that the fragmentary inscription IG II.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 1. 329, which is cited as proving that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was to pay
                  his allies 1 drachma a day, seems rather to show a payment of I drachma to the hypaspistae with some other, and presumably lesser, amount for
                  the troops in general. Tarn does not appear to have taken account of the inscription inhis discussion of the hypaspists, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great</hi> II, pp. 148–154). However, we have an interesting
                  detailed proposal by <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(First <persName>Philip</persName>pic,</hi> 28f.) for an expeditionary force against <persName>Philip</persName>
                  that was never raised. His calculation allows 2 obols a day for foot soldiers, one drachma for horse, citizen and mercenary alike. This was
                  put forward as an emergency measure and, in view of the fact that the pauper's allowance was 2 obols, it is very unlikely that citizen
                  infantry, let alone mercenaries, could have been induced to serve ordinarily for that wage, which would have been sufficient only if
                  supplemented with plunder. There is evidence that by the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the
                  ordinary pay of a Greek mercenary was 4 obols a day (Parke, loc. cit.) and perhaps we may assume that the pay of all privates was the same; in
                  that case the pay of a horseman would also be double <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</persName>' figure. Now, if we
                  take the later amount, the pay of the foot for 30 days would be 800,000 drachmae (40,000 χ 4 obols χ 30 days ÷ 6), that of the horse 360,000
                  drachmae (6,000 χ 12 obols χ 30 days ÷ 6). The total would be 193⅓ talents (1,160,000 ÷ 6,000), while even at <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</persName>' figures the sum would be 96⅔ talents with no allowance for the pay of higher ranks or any
                  other military expense. Seventy talents would not have lasted 3 weeks even at starvation wages. Probably the reports of the king's finances at
                  the beginning of the campaign were no more than gossip.</p>

               <p>Arrian's words imply that <persName>Alexander's</persName> own borrowing was to finance the expedition. If the 800 were added to <persName>Philip's</persName> debt of 500, the total of 1,300 talents would be no excessive burden. Interest at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> normally ranged from 12% to 18%. If we take the latter figure he would have a yearly interest of
                  234 talents to pay and as the mines of <persName>Philip</persName>pi alone yielded 1,000 talents there should be no difficulty in
                  retiring the debt. It must be observed that he did not say he was without funds when he landed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName>; being in debt is a different thing.</p>

                  the main body but went off on a romantic expedition of his own to Troy. It is incredible that a general of the ability of Memnon should allow
                  the <placeName>Macedonians</placeName> to cross the <placeName>Hellespont</placeName> without a bridge head to make them safe. It is
                  indeed remarkable that <persName>Philip's</persName> expedition was allowed to cross but we have only the bare fact recorded. It may have
                  been a surprise, or the Persian force in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> may have been too weak at the time

                  <placeName>Babelon</placeName>, op. cit., pp. 1329-1332. Here we are faced with the difficulty of accurate dating. Wroth, <hi rend="italic">BMC Troas,Aeolis and Lesbos,</hi> p. xli, says "This series may, on grounds of style, be attributed to <hi rend="italic">circa</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> 320 to 280." Without disputing the calculation based on style, <placeName>Babelon</placeName> moves the
                  series back to 340–300. Twenty years is surely not a great difference when one is dating by style in the 4th century, but for our purpose the
                  difference is critical. According to one system Abydus began her large output of silver before <persName>Philip's</persName> invasion of
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName> and continued it through the life of <persName>Antigonus</persName> I;
                  according to the other it did not begin until after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death and continued through the life of <persName>Seleucus</persName> I. I follow <placeName>Babelon</placeName> because he is the later (and, I think, the better) authority and
                  also because his dates seem to me to accord better with historical probability. Among the phenomena following the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> I find it hard to believe that there was any long continued show of independence by
                  cities in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>. Some such outburst as occasioned the Lamian War in mainland <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> is easy to imagine, but for Abydus to begin an issue of autonomous coins which
                  persisted through the terms of at least 28 officials seems very unlikely. Nevertheless, probability is not proof and the use of Abydus as
                  evidence for the procedure of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName> involves a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii.</hi> But neither date avoids the difficulty of
                  simultaneous issue of autonomous coins on one standard and drachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on
                  another. Thompson and Bellinger, p. 9. Bikerman has nothing to say about Abydus in his sweeping denial that the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName>tic cities retained the right of coinage. "Alexandre le Grand et les Villes d'Asie," <hi rend="italic">REG</hi> 1934, p. 349. Ehrenberg, admitting that because of the uncertainty of the chronology "our notions are bound to
                  remain rather vague" comes to the opposite conclusion that "the great majority of the cities continued autonomous coining of silver and copper

               <p>A notable instance of the control of local value by convention is the variation in price of gold coins at Delphi between 335 and 328. <hi rend="italic">Sylloge</hi> I, 251, n. 15 and 253, n. 14. <persName corresp="#viaf_122375252">J. G. Milne</persName> was eminent in his
                  defense of the thesis that, in domestic transactions, the amount of bullion in a coin was of less importance than its face value. (Cf. "The
                  Monetary Reform of Solon," <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 1930, pp. 179–185; <hi rend="italic">The Melos Hoard of 1907</hi> (NNM 62), 1934). The
                  power of the sovereign to set a value to a coin which should not be affected by variation in the price of metal is of course dependent on the
                  degree of control which he had over the metal available, and probably not many would be tempted to apply the principle, as Milne did, to
                  Pheidon and the very beginning of coinage <hi rend="italic">(Greek and Roman Coins,</hi>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, 1939, pp. 81f., n. X. 2). But he had been impressed by the lack of uniformity in
                  Greek coin weights and was inclined to echo the complaint of <persName>Sir George Macdonald</persName> that the instrument of metrology
                  "has indeed broken short in our hands" ("Fifty Years of Greek Numismatics," <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the International Numismatic
                     Congress,</hi>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, 1938, pp. 3–16). Macdonald reviews the enthusiastic hopes of the metrologists and
                  the vigorous reaction to them with reference to his studies in the coinage of Crete, where indeed the weights cannot be got to make any sense.
                  But it is going too far to assert, because this situation obtains in one area, that Greek money is all token money except for a few issues
                  such as the Athenian, coined with international trade specifically in view. There is too great a majority of cases in which the standards <hi rend="italic">are</hi> adhered to, though these are often obscured by the fact that we have not enough data to be statistically safe. If
                  value really had no relation to metal content there would be nothing to prevent a drastic and universal reduction in weight of all coins not
                  intended to go abroad. The enigma of Crete would be only half solved, for though we might have an explanation for the light coins, we should
                  have none for the heavy. We may continue to believe that, as a rule, silver coins were worth their weight, with exceptions, some of which we
                  can understand and some of which we cannot. One thing we can understand is that convenience might demand a conventional adjustment of values
                  to save the nuisance of perpetual weighing. If there were large quantities in question the scales were undoubtedly resorted to as they still
                  are in the East, but when a few small pieces of Abydus had to be exchanged for small silver of Lampsacus it was doubtless done by agreement.
                  Still, we should not exaggerate an <placeName>Asiatic's</placeName> impatience with weighing or belittle his willingness to spend his
                  leisure for a small profit.</p>

                  believe that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was as generous to the Greeks as possible. With the question
                  of constitutional and juridical relations between them we are not concerned. The theory that the cities were freed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was challenged by <persName>E. Bickermann</persName>, "Alexandre le Grand et les
                  Villes d'Asie," <hi rend="italic">REG</hi> 1934, pp. 346-374. His conclusion is that such liberty as they had rested on the unilateral and
                  revocable act of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. Tarn, op. cit., II, pp. 199-232, protested against this
                  in favor of the earlier theory. In 1938 Victor Ehrenberg published <hi rend="italic">

               <p>Tarn, op. cit., II, pp. 237f. cannot believe that there was an Alexandria earlier than the one in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, and presents an hypothesis that it was founded after Gaugamela by command of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> but not by his act in presence. It does not matter to us at what point the city also
                  known as Myriandrus received the conqueror's name but I do not believe that the argument is a very good one that some ancient writer <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have mentioned the foundation if it had occurred immediately after Issus. The city had been important enough to
                  have its own Persian issues and without any doubt those of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> at once
                  succeeded (<persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">E. T. Newell</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Myriandros).</hi> It might be remarked that
                  Tarn has difficulty (pp. 239f.) with another Alexandria: Alexandria Troas. The tradition is (Strabo, XIII. 26) that the city was founded by
                     <persName>Antigonus</persName> by the synoecism of the surrounding towns and named after himself; that when <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> acquired it he refounded it and renamed it Alexandria. This Tarn will not credit, "It
                  is impossible to believe" he says, "that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Successor, just <hi rend="italic">once,</hi> used the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>-name.—There is only one explanation. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> must have promised to found a city there—but he did not live to do it." But in <persName>Alexander's</persName> time
                  a city in that place would have made no sense at all. The whole thing is a characteristic Hellenistic performance (<persName>Louis

                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, 1951, pp. 5-13). If <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had in mind the founding of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Alexandria before the one in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, Myriandrus would have been a reasonable location, a site in the Troad would not.</p>

               <p>Of these, 1, 3 and 6 are large issues. In 1 there are 8 reverse dies used for the tetradrachms, though only one each for distater and stater.
                  In 3 there are 18 reverse dies used for the distaters, I for the stater. In 6 there are 9 reverses used for the tetradrachms. The others are
                  all small, each using only a single reverse die, except that there are 2 for tetradrachm no. 4 and 2 for distater no. 9. There is, however, no
                  reason for combining any of the minor issues, and combining 1 and 6, where the difference is one of style alone, would still leave 7
                  issues.</p>
               <p>Since the terminal date is 323/2, that would put the beginning not later than 330/29. The latest issue (presumably 8) might have come in 323
                  before the outbreak of the Lamian war. The earliest could not be before the battle of Megalopolis in the fall of 331, and therefore an issue
                  before 330 would be hardly possible. If we are to provide a year for each of Noe's varieties, therefore, we should put 1 in 330/29 and 8 in
                  323.</p>

               <p>This is not serious variation. The chief question is, was any of the treasure in the form of coin? I do not believe that <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName>'s νομίσματος is of any importance. In view of <persName>Curtius</persName>' explicit phrase

                  must suppose there was bullion, which is likely even without testimony. But Diodorus is so clear in his antithesis between the bullion and the

                  he believed there to have been both bullion and coin. It is less likely that his source invented the darics than that the source of Arrian and

                  pay was intermitted during the Indian campaign on two grounds: first, "It is difficult to think that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> carried vast sums of money about with him during his Indian campaign" and second "when he
                  returned from India and discharged 10,000 <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> veterans, he had arrears of pay to make up" (Arrian VIT. 12.1).
                  The difficulty as to transport is a serious one, but not so serious in India where he had the rivers to use as in the mountains of Bactria.
                  And there is nothing to suggest that the arrears in pay were of long standing. They may have been only in connection with the march back from
                  India. <placeName>Griffith</placeName> is hardly justified in saying "in fact it is certain that he did not pay μισθός regularly by the
                  month." In any case, this concerns only one element of expense.</p>

                  between 5,000 and 4,000 is a palliative, but I do not feel that it can cure our difficulty. Since this was written <persName corresp="#viaf_109772791">Margaret Thompson</persName>'s great work on the <placeName>Athenian</placeName> New Style Silver has appeared
                  with calculations that in that series the survival rate might be as low as 1: 2625, as high as 1: 395. Her conclusion (p. 709) "There is no

                  whatever its explanation, adds to the effect of the first. The significance of both these series will need to be reconsidered in view of the

                  is about to publish. It would not be proper to anticipate the publication, but it may be remarked that while the new coin proves that Series

                  Series I (ibid. p. 17, d-f) is the mark of the same official, still less whether he is the B who shares with A the issue of the early Tarsiote
                     <persName>Alexanders</persName> (ibid. p. 9). On the initial date will depend the solution to the question whether the signed lion

                  assumed in the present study, or whether <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had already allowed another
                  satrap to put his name on a coin. In any case, the privilege seems to have been of short duration.</p>

                  believe that those with <persName>Alexander's</persName> name may have been struck in his own lifetime. I am not competent to deal with
                  the linguistic and paleographical problems involved, but I believe that no one would assign, on the grounds of appearance, the first four
                  coins of Pl. VI of the former article to the end of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C</hi>. Even that, however, is more likely than
                  that a series so barbaric should have been begun under <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and in his name.
                  The condition of the High Priest of Hierapolis was doubtless unique, but he was not so far from <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> that his
                  city would have been totally unaware of numismatic propriety. <placeName>Babelon</placeName>
                  <hi rend="italic">(Perses achéménides,</hi> pp. LI-LIV) though he suggests that the place of issue might be Comana instead of <placeName>Hierapolis</placeName>, accepts the theory that we have to do with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great and not a dynast of that name, since the types are imitations of those of <persName>Mazaeus</persName>.
                  But the style of imitation is quite uncharacteristic of the time, and the appearance of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> as dynast or High Priest signing coins of a petty state with types totally unrelated to his own is without parallel and
                  without probability. I would invite the Orientalists to consider the possibility that the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> of Six' nos. 1 and 2 is a High Priest, like Abd-Hadad of nos. 4 and 5 and that the whole series belongs to a much later
                  time.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">THE SUCCESSORS AND THE CITIES</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> left his empire without a leader and there was great difficulty
               in choosing one. Some were for retaining the kingship in the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> royal house and supported <persName>Philip's</persName> son Arrhidaeus, <persName>Alexander's</persName> half-brother. Others felt that the family of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> himself was the proper source of royal power and hoped for an heir in the child which <persName>Roxane</persName> was expecting. The factions were vehement and almost came to blows, yet to the wiser minds it must have been
               apparent that the true question was not who was to have the name of king but who was to control the armies and the finances of the empire. The
               generals could not know, any more than we know now whether it was possible that the vast realm which they had conquered could be ruled as a unit,
               but even those who doubted most had no plan for division except the appeal to arms. But civil war was to the liking of no one and so it was
               essential that the formal question as to the kingship should be settled promptly. A compromise was reached: Arrhidaeus' name was changed to <persName>Philip</persName> and he was declared king with the proviso that if <persName>Roxane</persName>'s child should be a son he was
               to share the royal title. <persName>Roxane</persName>'s child, as it turned out, was a son; he was duly named <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and war was for the time averted. <placeName>Perdiccas</placeName> and Craterus divided
               the ill-defined powers and duties of guardian and regent. Many of the necessary arrangements of which we are not told must have been made by them
               and it may have been they who decided that, as money must continue to be struck, the familiar types should be retained but that some of the coins
               should bear the name of <persName>Philip</persName>, and this plan was put into effect as soon as the problem of the kingship was
               solved.</p>
            <p>It was not universally done, however. The most conspicuous exception is that the premier mint of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName> never used
                  <persName>Philip's</persName> name. It is not easy to see why this should have been so. The <placeName>Macedonians</placeName> had
               been <persName>Philip's</persName> supporters in the contest as to the succession and <persName>Antipater</persName>, who was regent in
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, was a thorough legitimist. Moreover, he had long been at odds with <placeName>Olympia</placeName>s, that fervent partisan of her grandson and foe of his co-ruler, which should have put <persName>Antipater</persName> in <persName>Philip's</persName> party if partisanship was important in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> in 323. It is a further complication that there is an issue for <persName>Philip</persName> from Pella in about
                  318.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> At that time there is indeed evidence of a <pb n="82"/> division in the country. Cassander was making head
               against the duly appointed guardian Polyperchon; <persName>Eurydice</persName>, <persName>Philip's</persName> wife and half-sister, had
               attempted to take charge of affairs and transfer the command from Polyperchon to Cassander; the young <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was apparently with his grandmother in Epirus. It may be that <persName>Eurydice</persName> had enough influence in Pella to have it strike in her husband's name, but not enough to prevent the same magistrate from
               striking in that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. But this does not explain why the omission should have
               been made in the beginning when <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> was using both names.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref>
               Perhaps there will ultimately be found adequate political explanations for the other places where <persName>Philip's</persName> name was not
               used, such as <placeName>Miletus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</placeName>, but at present it seems as though the irregular procedure is no more than a symptom of
               imperfect control by the regents of minting regulation. This does not prevent the unhappy <persName>Philip</persName>, burdened with
               illegitimacy, an over-bearing wife and a weak intellect, from being a person of numismatic importance. Since his brief career began in 323 and
               ended in 317 his coins, of course, must fall between those limits, and consequently also the coins with the name of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and symbols identical with <persName>Philip's</persName> which is a very important aid
               in the arrangements of the coins after 323.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>

            <p>It is remarkable how few of these governors played parts of any importance during the struggles of the Successors. The boundaries of the
               satrapies would be maintained as they had been in <persName>Alexander's</persName> time and it may be that the entrusting of important
               provinces to men not of the first importance was caused less by a mistaken estimate of their abilities than by the mutual jealousies of greater
               men. The fact that there was obviously no attempt to provide an equal distribution of mints can only mean that the unity of the empire was still
               so fundamental in the minds of the generals that it was taken for granted that all money was still the kings' money, only now at the disposal of
               the regent. There are positive indications that this was true. In 321, after the murder of <placeName>Perdiccas</placeName>, his
               brother-in-law <persName corresp="#nomisma_priscus_attalus">Attalus</persName> sailed to Tyre and there recovered 800 talents from
               Archelaüs, the captain of the garrison, which <placeName>Perdiccas</placeName> had given him for safekeeping.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref>
               This was evidently a transaction entirely independent of Laomedon, the satrap. In 319 <persName>Antigonus</persName> committed what was
               regarded as a clear act of rebellion when he captured and appropriated 600 talents which were being conveyed by ship from <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> to the kings in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> And in the next
               year, when Polyperchon was strengthening the hand of Eumenes against <persName>Antigonus</persName> he sent letters in the name of the kings
               to the generals in <placeName>Cilicia</placeName> and the treasurers to pay Eumenes 500 talents and any more that he might require.<ref target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName>, indeed, protested to the treasurers against paying any money to Eumenes and
               promised to protect them if they failed to carry out instructions, but nobody paid any attention to him.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="85"/>
            <p>The assumption of the unity of empire, however, soon began to be challenged. <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> was
               apparently the first to conceive of making a part of the empire his own domain, though perhaps the idea had come as soon to <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>, fighting to organize the still unconquered elements of Thrace. After his recovery of
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName> from <persName>Antigonus</persName> in 312 <persName>Seleucus</persName> set himself to make a permanent possession of the East. And in the spring of that same year when Cassander had put <placeName>Olympias</placeName> to death, though he was the only one with any title to be considered the guardian of the young <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, he showed his true purpose by having the boy imprisoned with his mother <persName>Roxane</persName>. In 310 by having them assassinated he left no basis for any legitimist party.</p>
            <p>Against these separatist forces the regents had fought, <placeName>Perdiccas</placeName> with more than a little personal ambition involved,
                  <persName>Antipater</persName> with loyal devotion to the royal house, Polyperchon with good intentions, doubtless, but with little
               practical sense and with diminishing effectiveness. But there was another opponent of the separatists: <persName>Antigonus</persName>, and
               he was moved not by sentiment but by the determination to keep the empire together for himself. This ambition was shared and inherited by his son
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</persName>, and the greatest episode of the closing of the 4th century and the opening
               of the 3rd is the account of the adventures of those two warriors.</p>
            <p>The interplay of all these individuals meant constant change in the control of territory and in the condition of the cities. Though the mints may
               have struck coins originally for the use of all parts of the empire alike—subject always to the element of convenience—there must have come a
               time when for <persName>Antigonus</persName> to capture a mint meant for him to capture additional revenue. The activity of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> mints in 310 and 309 seems to be part of his program,<ref target="#CH3-n8">8</ref> and perhaps some of the constant friction between the Ptolemies and their neighbors was caused by desire to control the mint-cities
               of the Syrian coast.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to give any general picture of the fortunes of the mints in the period just after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death.
               That must be worked out a city at a time, a labor which has hardly begun as yet, though many issues have been assigned to their proper cities
               without historical commentary. <persName>Newell's</persName> works on <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</persName> and
               the Seleucids have obiter dicta about the preceding <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins and so have
               publications of sundry hoards, but we are still in the dark as to such a matter as the closing of the mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</placeName>, its date and cause. Much meticulous work with individual series is necessary before we can write
               the history of the early posthumous <persName>Alexanders</persName>.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, there are some things that can be said as to the practice of the different Successors, for there are only a few of them of any
               numismatic <pb n="86"/> importance. In the realm of <persName>Antipater</persName>, as one would expect, nothing was ever minted except the
               old types, and that was true of the realm in the hands of Polyperchon. Since they regarded the empire as the kings' estate, it could be financed
               only by the kings' money. Cassander held to the convention so far as gold and silver were concerned, but he did issue bronze with the head of
                  <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> and a lion with his own name.<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref>
               <persName>Antigonus</persName> also used only the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> types; the coins
               bearing the legend <persName>Antigonus</persName> or King <persName>Antigonus</persName> belong to his grandson <persName>Antigonus</persName> Gonatas or <persName>Antigonus</persName> Doson.<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref> Of course his endeavor was to avoid
               anything that might seem to acknowledge the possibility of partition, and as long as the old man lived his son <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</persName>, if he is to be regarded as an independent minting authority, followed the father's example. The
               first breach of tradition was that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> about 320 when he substituted for the head
               of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> a head of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               wearing a headdress made of an elephant with jutting tusks and uplifted trunk (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 4). This is the deified <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>: above his cheek may be seen the ram's
               horn of his divine father <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> Ammon. A few years later there was a more extreme innovation.
               The deified head remained but the familiar seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> was replaced by an <placeName>Athena</placeName> with helmet, aegis, shield and thunderbolt. The earliest coins of this type bore the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΕΙΟΝ,</hi>
               </hi> a further deviation from tradition but a somewhat puzzling one which gave place again to the conventional <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY.</hi>
               </hi> So far there had been no overt show of independence, but a step was taken which actually made for more independence than a change of type
               could. <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> abandoned the Attic standard of 17.62 grams and began to strike
               tetradrachms of Rhodian weight (15.50 grams) and so cut <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> off from the international
               currency of his rivals. Then, after the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV in 310 had left no
               legitimate monarch, <persName>Antigonus</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</persName>, <persName>Seleucus</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> took the title of king in 306/5 and 305/4, and
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> joined them, now introducing his own portrait on the obverse and using as his
               reverse the eagle which had been on <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName>' hand. This became the standard Ptolemaic type and
               the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coinage thus disappears from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName> forever.</p>
            <p>The development of types was different in other cases. <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> had originally
               controlled no mint<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> and it was not until 308 that he provided himself <pb n="87"/> with a suitable capital by
               building the city of Lysimacheia near Cardia in Thrace. There he struck <persName>Alexanders</persName> on which about 303 he put a
               distinguishing mark: the forepart of a Hon, which was his own device; and his own name now stood in place of <persName>Alexander's</persName>. In 296<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> he imitated <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName> in
               replacing the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> head with a portrait of the divinized <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, again with the horns of Ammon but without the elephant skin (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 5). It is one of the most spectacular of Hellenistic portraits. The reverse shows a seated <placeName>Athena</placeName> holding
               Nike and leaning on her shield. The title is that of King <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName>, and with that
               he was content; his portrait never appeared on his coins, and since he had no heir his types would have died with him except that, like those of
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, they had caught the fancy of the cities and were imitated long after his
               death.</p>
            <p>When the disaster of Ipsus had ended <persName>Antigonus</persName>' plans and ambitions <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</persName> was left to gather the remnants of his father's great empire and, from the cities still in his control, he issued notice of
               his continued command of the sea: the magnificent tetradrachms bearing his name and showing Nike with a trumpet on a prow and Poseidon standing
               with menacing trident. Later there were two series with <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</persName>' own portrait, one with
               Poseidon seated, the other with his foot on a rock, leaning on a trident.</p>
            <p>The first change introduced by <persName>Seleucus</persName> was the substitution of his own name for that of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> after 306 when he took the title of king. This was at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris about 305.<ref target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> It became common about 300 and was the regular type for gold and silver in the West, though the bronze shows
               considerable variation. An apparent exception occurs in Pergamum where <persName>Seleucus</persName>' name is used on tetradrachms with
               horse's head/elephant. But those were actually issued by Philetaerus and his governor and were followed by a reversion to <persName>Alexander's</persName> type and name, and then to <persName>Alexander's</persName> type with <persName>Seleucus</persName>' name.<ref target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> In the East two other types were used for silver: the head of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName>/<placeName>Athena</placeName> in a biga or quadriga of elephants;<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref> and head of <persName>Seleucus/Nike</persName> and trophy.<ref target="#CH3-n16">16</ref> It is interesting that the king confined the use of his own
               portrait to his eastern mints, and even there it did not entirely displace the older design as <persName corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</persName>'s portrait did in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. In <placeName>Susa</placeName>, for instance,
               there is a reversion to the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> type with <persName>Seleucus</persName>'
               name after both of the others had been used<ref target="#CH3-n17">17</ref> and at <placeName>Ecbatana</placeName>
               <persName>Alexander's</persName> name appears in the latter half of <persName>Seleucus</persName>'</p>
            <pb n="88"/>
            <p>reign.<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref> By the end of that reign, however, the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               types had been abandoned.<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Mention must be made of three interesting uses of the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> type by lesser powers
               than the dynasts of whom we have spoken. One is the case of a client king, Nicocles of Paphos in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</placeName>. A number of tetradrachms of that mint, apparently perfectly ordinary <persName>Alexanders</persName>, are found on close
               inspection, to have the name <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">ΝΙΚΟΚΛΕΟΥΣ</hi>
               </hi> inscribed on the mane of the lion headdress in letters so tiny that they are not visible on a photograph and are frequently only to be seen
               on the coins themselves under a magnifying glass.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref>
               <persName>J. M. F. May</persName> in an admirably complete treatment of them<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref> concludes that they were issued
               from 323, immediately after <persName>Alexander's</persName> death, to 320, which would allow for their appearance in the <placeName>Demanhur</placeName> Hoard, buried in 318/7. As he says, the legend has every appearance of being surreptitious and it is tempting to think that
               the Paphian king was a bit intoxicated by the feeling of liberty caused by the news from <persName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</persName>, but not so confident as to let his state of mind be obvious to the regents. We have no way of knowing whether his temerity
               escaped notice, or was indulged, or was punished. But none of his fellow kings copied his experiment. There are letters on coins of <placeName>Salamis</placeName> which may perhaps have stood for the names of the kings Nicocreon and Menelaus<ref target="#CH3-n22">22</ref> but
               those cases were undoubtedly official and were far less explicit. A similar license had been accorded kings of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</placeName> in <persName>Alexander's</persName> lifetime.<ref target="#CH3-n23">23</ref> But it seems that
               Nicocles was aiming at something more than that.</p>
            <p>The second case is that of a tetradrachm of eastern appearance which, in addition to the usual inscription, has the name <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">ΑΣΠΕΙΣΟΥ,</hi>
               </hi> under the arm of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>

               no doubt that this is the same man. There was a mint in operation at <placeName>
                  <placeName>Susa</placeName>
               </placeName> by 317/6<ref target="#CH3-n25">25</ref> striking coins with the names of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and <persName>Philip</persName>, and sometime between that date and 312 when <persName>Seleucus</persName>
               recovered the territory this piece must have been struck. Though it is without parallel and without consequence,<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref>
               it is worthy of attention, for it ventures on a show of independence which the greater Successors were slow to follow. Modesty or caution or both
               forbade the introduction of a new design. Who was Aspeisas that the East should accept his money? But he was more than the mint official who must
               be content to be known by a monogram or an ambiguous symbol and he saw to it that he should appear as a man of importance in the realm that had
               been <persName>Alexander's</persName>. One wonders whether he knew of the case of Nicocles and declined to use such a mixture of display and
               concealment. One wonders also what impression it made on <persName>Antigonus</persName> who had appointed him—<persName>Antigonus</persName> who was so scrupulous to maintain the old types unchanged.</p>
            <p>The third instance is even more surprising. It is the issuance by Areus king of Sparta, 309-264, of a tetradrachm with <persName>Alexander's</persName> types and the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">ΒΑΣΙΛΕΟΣ ΑΡΕΟΣ.<ref target="#CH3-n27">27</ref>
                  </hi>
               </hi> Areus is chiefly known as the opponent of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>, as leader of the <placeName>Peloponnesian</placeName> League in 280 and again in the Chremonidean war until he fell in battle at <placeName>Corinth</placeName>. Beloch<ref target="#CH3-n28">28</ref> supposes that the act of striking his own money, unprecedented for a Spartan, was one of the manifestations of
               eminence and self-confidence which resulted from his victory over Pyrrhus in 272. No Spartan king for a long time had been so powerful, and it is
               easy to assume that his emulation of royal power of which <placeName>Athena</placeName>eus speaks<ref target="#CH3-n29">29</ref> falls in this
               period. It might be a time suitable for the introduction of the silver with his own portrait,<ref target="#CH3-n30">30</ref> if that is indeed
               struck by him, but the use of his name on the <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> type would be much more
               appropriate to the years 306-304 when the Successors whom he considered his rivals were taking the title of king. We know nothing of what he was
               doing from his accession in 309 to his first campaign in 280, and this may have been a kind of announcement that he also was one of the
               Successors, with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> for his province. But at any juncture it is <pb n="90"/> astonishing
               to have the types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> vised by a king of the one Greek state which had been
                  <persName>Alexander's</persName> consistent and pertinacious foe.<ref target="#CH3-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The economy of these posthumous Alexanders is still unstudied. It is evident that after the change of standard, the silver of Egypt was isolated
               from the rest of the Hellenistic world,<ref target="#CH3-n32">32</ref> but what about the money of the other Successors? How much of their
               product remained in their own territory? How much was at the disposition of their rivals? I ventured remarks on this subject a few years ago<ref target="#CH3-n33">33</ref> suggesting that there might be evidence for the development of separate monetary districts. I did not have much
               material to go on, and how upsetting to reasonable conjecture the facts can be is clearly seen in a hoard from Basra, recently published by <persName>Georges Le Rider</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n34">34</ref> This extraordinary collection, of which he saw 507 pieces, begins with a
               5th century Attic owl and ends with a tetradrachm of Attambelus I of Characene struck in 45/4 <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>
               </hi>. It includes 4 drachms and 159 tetradrachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. Of these 93 are from
               the mint of Amphipolis (60 being of the series with ∧ and race torch from the beginning of the 3rd century);<ref target="#CH3-n35">35</ref> 23
               more are imitations of <placeName>Amphipolis</placeName>. There are only 2 from <placeName>Tarsus</placeName> and 7 from <placeName>Babylon</placeName>. Such a proportion could not possibly have been anticipated. Surely the mint of Babylon could have supplied money to Basra (it
               did in fact supply 11 lion staters) without anyone getting coins from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> ! Yet
               though at present we are at a loss, the accumulation of evidence will in time certainly show us something of the movement of currency in the
               early Hellenistic world. We are not without some indications. We know that the kings were not as rich as <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> had been.<ref target="#CH3-n36">36</ref> We know that they issued much less gold and much
               more bronze. We know that they modified his geographical arrangement of mints: <persName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</persName> was served by some which had never struck for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, and the
               Seleucids pushed eastward to Bactria itself (Map 4), showing that whatever were the dispositions of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> there <pb n="91"/> they could not be made permanent. But these were phenomena that lie
               beyond the limits of this study.</p>
            <p>After the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</persName> no one had any illusions about the possibility of keeping the
               empire together, and even before that, at the death of Cassander in 297 or of his sons in 294, the uniform types as a symbol of imperial unity
               had been abandoned. It would seem that <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</persName> and the seated <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</persName> had come to the end of their career. But in fact they reappear, not in the service of the kings but in
               that of the cities. Indeed, their use now is a sign of independence of the kings.<ref target="#CH3-n37">37</ref> These issues as related
               phenomena have had the benefit so far of only one serious study: Henri Seyrig's article "Parion au 3<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Siècle avant nôtre
                  Ère"<ref target="#CH3-n38">38</ref> in which he considers the posthumous Alexanders of northern <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</placeName> together with the posthumous imitations of the tetradrachms of Lysimachus coined after 281 on
               both sides of the Propontis and on the Thracian coasts. There are two distinct periods to which the Alexanders belong, clearly distinguished in
               appearance. As to the earlier I can do no better than quote Seyrig's summary. ''We have in Seleucid <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName> two kinds of money. At Sardes the types are royal, the name of the ruling sovereign is habitual; civic
               symbols are absent, the issue is continuous, the likeness of the coins to those of the eastern mints reveals the imperial centralization. In the
               other towns, on the contrary, the pieces have the traditional types of Alexander the Great, the name of the ruling sovereign is absent, the use
               of civic symbols is habitual, the issues are of limited importance. In other words, the coins of Sardes testify to immediate royal control while
               those of the other towns show no trace of it. The fact is that Sardes, the ancient capital, was left by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> under its Lydian laws and depended directly on the royal authority, while the other towns
               were Greek cities. The coins show, therefore, that the administrative capital in the first half of the 3rd century was still subject, while <persName>Seleucus</persName> had given the Greek cities a status which respected certain attributes of sovereignty."<ref target="#CH3-n39">39</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of Antiochus I, however, the royal power encroached on this sovereignty, whatever its nature, and royal types reappear in various
               cities. This was the situation until the death of Antiochus Hierax in 229/8. There followed another period of quasi-independence under the
               friendly protection of <persName corresp="#nomisma_priscus_attalus">Attalus</persName> I of Pergamum. This was celebrated in many towns by
               the issuance of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> type tetradrachms with low relief and very large flans. I

               </hi> III, 10). On these, as on the earlier series, the symbols and monograms identify the issuing town, and they must be regarded as civic, not
               as royal issues. I have endeavored to put both series into their context in the case of Alexandria Troas.<ref target="#CH3-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Seyrig observes, as to the earlier posthumous series, "the issues are of limited importance," and that would seem to be still more true of the
               later ones. They are, in fact, analogous to the civic types, also struck on large flans, whose explanation, I am convinced, is sentimental rather
               than economic. I have discussed this matter at length in regard to the tetradrachms of Ilium<ref target="#CH3-n41">41</ref> and I need not repeat
               the argument here. It is clear how wide a difference there is between these rare pieces and the great <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> issues
               which, more than a century before, financed the campaigns of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
            <p>There is no study comparable to Seyrig's for other districts and I will not embark on the complicated problems involved except by way of
               illustration. Coins are known, for example, certainly attributable to <placeName>Miletus</placeName>, <persName>Müller</persName> 1043

               the same period, whereas <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName>

               attribution to the second century is very doubtful. There were exceptions: dated Alexander tetradrachms from Aradus go as late as 171 <hi rend="smallcaps">

               also invite and deserve investigation. In publishing the Olympia Hoard <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</persName> called
               attention to the presence of some of those rare varieties and offered comments on them which were intended as only preliminary observations.<ref target="#CH3-n47">47</ref> Since then the publication of Noe's <hi rend="italic">

               Alexanders from that city, contributing a few more details of uncertainty.<ref target="#CH3-n49">49</ref> Someone should have the courage to go
               through the fragmentary history of Hellenistic <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> and try to discover whether the
               Alexanders belong to connected episodes or to independent ones and how they relate to the autonomous coinage.</p>
            <p>The need for more systematic study of the posthumous Alexanders is really part of a much larger one: the need for more attention to the relation
               of one Greek mint with another. The study of Greek issues city by city has, of course, been a first necessity and has not yet been completed by
               any means. Nevertheless, the independence of Greek towns, important as it is, must not obscure the fact that their careers were parallel and that
               the fiscal fabric of antiquity must be judged by coincidences as well as by consequences. But that subject far transcends the concern of these
               essays which is only a single aspect of a picture almost infinitely complex. If we pursue the types of the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>
               king into a period so long succeeding his death we may as well acknowledge that we are moved by sentiment as well as by science, and perhaps the
               best illustration that can be found of his place in the imagination of later generations is the fact that from 92 to 88 <hi rend="smallcaps">

               <p>The few pertinent facts about <persName>Philip</persName> are to be found in Diodorus XVIII, XIX, sometimes confirmed by other sources.
                  They may be summarized as follows:</p>
               <p>323 The infantry supported him for the kingship. He was made king and his name changed from Arrhidaeus to <persName>Philip</persName>.
                  (Diodorus XVIII. 2. 2–4).</p>
               <p>322 <placeName>Perdiccas</placeName> took him on campaign to Cappodocia (16.1). After the defeat of Ariarathes they campaigned in Pisidia
                  (22.1).</p>
               <p>321 After the death of <placeName>Perdiccas</placeName>, Pithon and Arrhidaeus were elected regents and guardians of the kings (36. 7). At
                  the conference of Triparadeisos, because of the interference of Eurydice, the guardians resigned and <persName>Antipater</persName> was
                  elected in their place (39.1–4). He took the kings back to their fatherland, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>
                  (39.7).</p>
               <p>319 On his death bed <persName>Antipater</persName> appointed Polyperchon regent and guardian (48. 4). Polyperchon invited <placeName>Olympias</placeName> to return from Epirus to take charge of <persName>Alexander's</persName> son until he should be of age
                  (49. 4, 57. 3). Eumenes in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName> supported the kings against Anti-gonus (57. 3, 4).</p>
               <p>318 On Eumenes' advice <placeName>Olympias</placeName> decided to stay in Epirus (58. 2–4). Polyperchon supported Eumenes by authority of
                  the kings (58. 1, 59. 3, 62. 1, 2). Polyperchon and the kings were in Phocis. When Cassander came to the Piraeus Polyperchon moved into Attica
                  but presently left part of the army with his son <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> while he went to the
                     <placeName>Peloponnesus</placeName> (68. 2, 3).</p>
               <p>317 Eurydice assumed the regency (XIX. 11.1) (and transferred the command from Polyperchon to Cassander. <persName>Justin</persName> XIV.
                  5.1–3). Polyperchon, in alliance with Aeacides of Epirus brought <placeName>Olympias</placeName> with <persName>Alexander's</persName>
                  son back to the kingdom (11. 2). <persName>Eurydice's</persName> army deserted her at sight of <placeName>Olympias</placeName>; <persName>Philip</persName> and <persName>Eurydice</persName> were captured and killed (11. 2–7).</p>
               <p>We may suppose that <persName>Eurydice's</persName> activity caused the change of affairs between 318 and 317.</p>
               <pb n="83"/>
               <p>At once after the settlement of the question about the kingship the satrapies were dealt out, and there was a second distribution in 321 at
                  the conference of Triparadeisus. From the point of view of the control of mint cities the result was very strangely proportioned. A full
                  discussion of the satrapies will be found in Bervé's <hi rend="italic">

                  cities we may abbreviate the lists to deal only with those which did. (I give merely mints whose position is fairly sure).</p>

               <p>In the earlier year both the kings were with Polyperchon in Phocis. He apparently did not take them with him to the <placeName>Peloponnesus</placeName>, where his failure to capture Megalopolis injured his reputation and induced most of the Greek states to desert him
                  for his rival Cassander. It will have been at this time that Eurydice (who may have come back to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> in 321 with the kings) achieved her coup d'état which must have been accompanied by the
                  return of <persName>Philip</persName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> and the flight of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> to his grandmother in Epirus. (Miss Macurdy believes that <persName>Roxane</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> IV stayed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName>, <persName>Grace H.

                  Polyperchon is not quite clear. He generally speaks and acts in the name of "the kings," making no distinction between them, but when he
                  invited <placeName>Olympias</placeName> to return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</placeName> to take care of
                     "<persName>Alexander's</persName> son" he can hardly have believed that the result would be to <persName>Philip's</persName>
                  advantage. For a long time he did not persuade her that it would be to hers either. There are two strange reappearances of <persName>Philip's</persName> name: on a tetradrachm of Marathus struck about 301, <hi rend="italic">WSM,</hi> p. 195, no. 1241; and on a stater from an

               <hi rend="bold">THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The following list is intended to serve a restricted purpose: to give a chronological framework for the years while <persName>Alexander's</persName> types were being issued by the Conqueror and his successors, and to mention some of the events which may be of importance
               for the understanding of those issues. Of course, it is not a history of the period, which would include much material foreign to this inquiry.
               Such histories are available in Vol. VI of the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Ancient History;</hi> Karl Julius Beloch, <hi rend="italic">Griechische Geschichte,</hi> ed. 2, Vols.

               these works, though many have appeared since their publication which must be sought for in the periodicals.</p>
            <p>Under each entry I have set a reference to the ancient source. In the interests of brevity I have generally given one reference only, though the
               event may be attested in a number of places, since it is the fact and not its interpretation which is important to us; when there are more
               references than one it is because the second provides some important information which the first does not. The commonest ancient Greek
               chronological system is the list of eponymous archons of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. I have used the archon
               years, indicating closer dating only when some evidence is given in the source.</p>
            <p>The only continuous ancient account that we have is that of Diodorus of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName> whose Greek
                  <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Historica,</hi> in 40 books, was written under Caesar and Augustus. Books XVII-XX, which deal with our period,
               are preserved complete. The work is invaluable but very fallible; the author used good sources and used them assiduously, but his power of
               organization was not equal to the demands of constructing a world history. He was not unaware of the seriousness of the difficulties, and in XX.
               43. 7 he makes apology for history which cannot present simultaneously simultaneous events. But his attempt to combine episodic treatment with a
               chronological reckoning by Roman consuls (who took office in January) and Attic archons (who took office in July) has led to great confusion
               which the ingenuity of modern scholarship has not wholly dispelled, and never will. Nevertheless, I have followed their conclusions— <pb n="95"/>
               fortunately fairly harmonious for this period—as best I could, and have not indicated the places where I depart from his chronology. Nor have I
               called attention to his errors as to consuls and archons. To have argued the justification for these deviations would have occupied a quite
               unreasonable amount of space, and might not have been convincing in the end.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> The chronology here presented may be
               called reasonably orthodox at the present time. There is a Loeb Library text and translation of Diodorus XVIII-XX by Russel M Geer: Vol. IX,
               1929; Vol. X, 1933.</p>

               </hi> by <persName>Quintus Curtius</persName>, a Latin work of uncertain date, while it gives more extended accounts of many episodes,
               provides no reliable data of importance not given by the two preceding authors, and is not cited here. More useful are two other Greek works: the
                  <hi rend="italic">Parallel Lives</hi> of <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName>, and the <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> of Strabo. The former is a series of biographies of notable Greeks and <placeName>Romans</placeName> written in the 1st and
               2nd centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">A.D.</hi>
               </hi> They are ethical in purpose and do not confine themselves to the use of impeccable sources, but the lives of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, Eumenes and <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</persName> preserve some
               significant facts not given elsewhere. Strabo published his monumental <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> about 7 <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">B.C.</hi>
               </hi> He sometimes furnishes us with special information about places connected with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.</p>
            <p>The sparse references to other authors and to inscriptions should not mislead the reader into supposing that the scattered evidence for this
               period is slight. On the contrary, it is abundant, but very little of it provides otherwise unknown events for such a list as this.</p>
            <p>It will be seen that our main authorities are far later than their subjects and though that has little importance for this study, for general
               historical purposes it is important to know where they got their information and how they used it. A characteristically brilliant analysis of the
               sources for <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> is to be found in <persName>W. W. Tarn's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Alexander the Great,</hi>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_2653941">Cambridge</placeName>, 1948, Vol. II, <pb n="96"/> pp. 1-133, while Beloch's much briefer "Quellen und
               Literatur," Vol. IV, Part 2, pp. 1-19, deals also, to some extent, with modern works as well as with ancient. Lionel Pearson's book, <hi rend="italic">The Lost Histories of Alexander the Great, Philological Monographs XX,</hi> American Philological Association, 1960, which
               appeared too late for me to use extensively, will be found to contain a great deal of valuable criticism.</p>
            <p>The composition of the list—the decision which items to include and which to exclude—has been difficult and has certainly been imperfect.
               Something of the kind has already been done in the "Zeittafeln" of Beloch, Vol. Ill, Part 2, pp. 450-464 and Vol. IV, Part 2, pp. 623-639, which
               I have found very helpful, but those were not devised to serve our special need. Since we are concerned with the striking of coins, the basic
               question is: who was in control of a certain territory at a certain time? Generally the answer bears on the operation of particular mints, but
               sometimes it is important to know that a ruler controlled such-and-such a place but did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> operate a mint there. When we
               know the location of a mint—as we do of the most important ones—we can follow its history and fortunes so far as the sources give us information,
               which is not as complete as one could wish. There are others, to be sure, not yet exactly located, as to which there is perhaps more to be known
               than we realize, and future scholars may wish that this or that piece of information had been included. But it is not my purpose here to record
               every mention of every place that has or may have connection with a mint. I am trying to give more general guidance, and since the decision that
               an item is worth citing must be a subjective one, I cannot hope that the reader's judgment will always coincide with mine. I have omitted, with
               entire confidence, all reference to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName>, and to <placeName>Cyrene</placeName> after its first surrender to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. I have omitted, with less feeling of certainty, affairs in Epirus, Aetolia and the barbarian countries of Asia lying
               outside the empire. I do not believe that any of these produced Alexander coins during the period treated—but I may turn out to have been
               mistaken.</p>
            <p>Since others besides <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> struck his types and name it has been necessary to
               carry the entries down beyond the date of his death. But as posthumous Alexanders appear very much later I have had to set a terminus, and the
               one selected has been the battle of Ipsus in 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>
               </hi>. when <persName>Antigonus</persName> died, who was that one of <persName>Alexander's</persName> marshals who clung most
               tenaciously to the hope of himself controlling all the empire, and who never issued gold or silver except with the traditional types and names.
               Later revivals, by younger rulers, are brief and intermittent phenomena for which a complete chronology is not so necessary. The list might have
               been continued to the death of Cassander in 297, for Cassander also never issued his own types in the noble metals, but the portion of Diodorus
               which is complete ends with the 20th book, just before <pb n="97"/> Ipsus, and thereafter the materials for an outline are even less satisfactory
               than before. It has seemed wise to deal with later issues separately without trying to work them into an historic scheme.</p>
            <p>The abbreviations used are A for Arrian, D for Diodorus, P for <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</persName>, S for Strabo.</p>
