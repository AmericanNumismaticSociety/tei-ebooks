            </head>
            <p>The study of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage has been pursued for a long time and has interested a number of eminent numismatists.
               It is, of course, merely a part of the study of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> and a part which omits or
               only slightly illumines the most famous aspects of that famous man. Yet the coins have some things to show which the texts pass over in silence
               and their evidence is as yet far from exhausted. The prodigious number of coins still in existence which bear his name and types has made it
               natural that a large part of the interest of those who have dealt with them should be devoted to trying to determine where they were struck and
               when. Much has been accomplished in this primary task of arrangement but much is still to be done. And beyond this question is the more
               fundamental one of what part the coinage played in the total functioning of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> empire. We need to know not
               only where the coins were struck and when but by whose agency, in what quantity, with what purpose and to what effect. These pages raise and
               discuss some facets of the problem. They are essays only and far from a definitive treatment. In some cases they are premature, propounding
               questions which further evidence will presently resolve, and sometimes new evidence has accumulated during the time the book was being composed.
               I must beg the reader's indulgence on the plea that what I am trying to do is not to settle questions so much as to raise them in the hope that
               they may ultimately be settled by the combined efforts of many with new material at their command and with different points of view which may
               supplement or invalidate my own. I have set down the phenomena that seemed to me most important from the beginning of <name type="pname"
                  >Alexander's</name> coinage to the end of its imitations. If the essays should attract new students to the Alexandrine coinage and somewhat
               advance the understanding of the experts they will, I believe, have justified their existence.</p>
            <p>The book has been a pleasure to write. It was begun and finished at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, for me certainly the ideal
               place for such a composition. The thought of my colleagues there and in the American Numismatic Society will always color these essays with the
               happiest memories. As in other cases, I have submitted my ideas to my most valuable mentors: <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_51769105">E. S. G.
                  Robinson</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_381705">Henri Seyrig</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_109772791">Margaret
                  Thompson</name>, not always convincing them but always profiting by their counsel.</p>

               </hi> They are the king's money. Not in the way that the laws are the king's laws: abstractions of which he is the responsible source with the
               same relations to all men. Nor in the way that his sword and horse are the king's: by personal, absolute right, capable of being modified only by
               himself through gift or loan. Without the king's act, entirely without his knowledge, a man may acquire title to coins exactly as he can to any
               other piece of property. Doubtless the king could take them away from him, as he could take away his cattle or his house or his wife. Legally a
               man's money is no more vulnerable than any of his other possessions. There may have been a time when coins were the property of the king in an
               immediate and personal sense. Recently the interesting suggestion has been made that they were not originally intended for currency, but for
               payment of the Lydian king's mercenaries and that circulation was an incidental and unforeseen consequence.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> It is
               interesting to guess at the process by which the secondary function absorbed the primary one.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> It must have been
               early, for the silver of the Greek cities was surely intended as currency from the beginning. In any case, by <name type="pname"
                  >Alexander's</name> time all thought of personal connection between the king and his money had long since been forgotten. To one of his
               subjects the genitive on gold and silver must have meant that the coins were struck by authority of the king, from his metal and that they were
               the medium by which his government paid his obligations and received his dues. They would be legal tender wherever his power extended, for both
               types and weights were uniform.</p>
            <p>Their bullion value was supposed to equal their nominal value: a silver tetradrachm was taken to be four drachmae of silver. Yet, if that had
               been <pb n="2"/> strictly true, the whole expense of manufacture would have been borne by the king. Originally that may have been so. A man who
               was accustomed to receive his pay in electrum by weight (and by metal content if that was determined) would hardly be satisfied with a less
               amount simply because it bore a device when there were still unmarked dumps in circulation of full weight. There must have been some critical
               point at which the cost of manufacture was transferred from the minting authority to the user and there is no way of telling when that came, but
               it was before <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>. His tetradrachms were in competition with those of Athens
               whose minting, as we know, was an important economic asset of the state. She certainly would not consciously lose by the process, and the
               simplest way to break even was to reduce the weight of each coin a little so that the part subtracted should be metal equal to the cost of
               manufacture. That is presumably what Athens did and what <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> did also.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> How much the deduction was we do not know. The tetradrachm was supposed to weigh 17.62 grams.<ref target="#CH1-n5"
                  >5</ref> Four drachmae of silver must have weighed somewhat more, but while the coins themselves conform to standard very well, such other
               weights as are preserved are not nearly so uniform, so that the attempt to find the weight of the official non-monetary drachm is not likely to
               be successful. No doubt it was all governed by law and the difference a matter of record. We know, from a much later period, what precautions the
               Athenians took to keep their weights and standards true; we know also that they were perfectly acquainted with a coin weight which was different
               from the commercial <pb n="3"/> weight.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> If the Macedonian citizens were aware that the government was issuing coins
               of less than full weight they probably cared very little. The conveniences of a money economy were worth much more than the amount involved.</p>

            <p>The types of the gold have occasioned much comment. They are new to the Macedonian coinage and are usually, though not universally, regarded as
               having an Athenian origin. To be sure, their general propriety to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> is
               sometimes held to be sufficient explanation without closer investigation into details. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_14897764">Percy
                  Gardner</name> represented this point of view:<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> the types of <name type="pname">Philip's</name> gold <hi

               who therefore selected Pallas "the patroness of the besiegers of Ilium" and a warlike Nike with a "trophy-stand." The curiosity of other
               scholars, however, has not been so easily satisfied, and a considerable literature has grown up about the identification of Pallas and Nike. In
               1847 <pb n="4"/>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_7485941">Charles Lenormant</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> deduced from comparison of the staters with the heads of Athena on vases and the later bronze coins of Athens that
               the goddess was Athena Promachus, Pheidias' heroic bronze statue which stood on the Acropolis between the Erechtheium and the Propylaea, a
               dedication, according to <name type="pname">Pausanias</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> from the spoils of the Persians defeated at Marathon.
               In 1890 Ernest <name type="place">Babelon</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> was quite willing to accept this and <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_2598262">Charles Seltman</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> regarded the head as probably a free adaptation of Athena Promachus, perhaps convinced by the hearty support of
               this solution by Philip Lederer.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> Considering the uncertainties in regard to this celebrated statue, a positive
               identification is hardly safe,<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> but the other suggestions that have been made are not persuasive.</p>
            <p>1) Prokesch-Osten,<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> followed by <name type="pname">E. J. Seltman</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> put forward
               as a possible original the ancient Palladium of Pella. This is met by Lederer<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> with the objection that <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> coins had and were intended to have an ecumenical importance and an obscure local deity would not suit his
               purpose at all.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> It may be added that when Pallas appears on the obverse of Pella's own coins<ref target="#CH1-n18"
                  >18</ref> it is in the form of Athena Parthenus in obvious imitation of the New Style silver of Athens.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref>
            </p>
            <p>2) <name type="place">Babelon</name>, recanting his previous acceptance of Athena Promachus believed <pb n="5"/> that the type was Pallas "des
               monnaies de Corinthe"<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> in which he was followed by <name type="place">Svoronos</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> who thought that the adoption of "Pallas Corinthienne" may have resulted from a decision of the Council of
               Corinth and who could not believe that relations between Athens and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> were
               such as to make his borrowing a device from her possible. This is a good example of an attempt to exalt likelihood into evidence. If there were
               no documents this might be regarded as an interesting possibility which, from frequent repetition, would come to be accepted as a fact. But here
               there is evidence, and one only has to compare the heads of Athena on the coins of Corinth (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, <hi rend="bold">I</hi>) and of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> to see instantly that it is
               impossible that the latter should be derived from the former. If <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> goddess had been supposed to be the same
               person as that on the Corinthian silver she would have been made to look the same. What other way would there have been for men to recognize
               her?</p>
            <p>3) In a recent study of the whole problem of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> imperial currency <name type="pname">Gerhard Kleiner</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> urges, on grounds of historical probability, that the goddess is Athena of Ilium and that it was not until after
               his visit to Ilium that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> began to strike his own types on gold.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n23">23</ref>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name> work is a connected whole and cannot fairly be disposed of piecemeal; it will be treated more thoroughly
               presently. But it may be said here that, on purely numismatic grounds, his suggestion is a weak one. Athena Ilias, as she is known to us from
               many coins (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 2,3), was a deity of very special appearance: she wore a polos, over her shoulder she held a filleted spear, and in her other hand was
               a distaff; that is, she was an Anatolian deity with more oriental than Greek features. If <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> had had her in mind he could have produced a head with a polos. Now it is true, as <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> says,
               that on later coins of Ilium the head of Athena has other forms, one of which is like that on the staters. But the first coins have on the
               reverse the cult statue of Athena Ilias; on the obverse a head of Athena with a round Attic helmet (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 3). These were issued under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>; the head in Corinthian helmet comes
               later under Seleucus I, again with Athena Ilias as a reverse type. To assume that there was an image at Ilium of the appearance of Athena
               Promachus is purely gratuitous; there were two forms of Athena known earlier on the coins and one of them is clearly named Athena Ilias on the
               2nd century silver<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 2).</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>A user who knew both Athena Promachus and Athena Ilias must conclude that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> type referred to the former and
               not to the latter.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> An Athenian model for the obverse of the gold is therefore still the most likely.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The reverse is quite as worthy of remark. Nike has a long and interesting career on ancient coins, but none of her previous appearances has any
               connection with Macedonia. This in itself raises no difficulty, and when the object in Nike's left hand was thought to be the frame for the
               erection of a trophy, it seemed a most appropriate augury of the future to which <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> was entitled if any man ever was. But it was early noticed that the object assumed a great variety of forms and <name
                  type="place">Babelon</name> presently showed that it was, in fact, a stylis,<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> which he took to be an instrument
               for propping up the aphlaston on the stern of a Greek ship. The naval significance was accepted by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_115419736"
                  >Ernst Assmann</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> who asserted however that what was represented was actually a <name type="place">Phoenician</name> standard,
               borne on the admiral's ship. Some part of his argument was met by <name type="pname">G. F. Hill</name> in the same number of the <hi
                  rend="italic">Zeitschrift für Numismatik<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref>
               </hi>
               <pb n="7"/> and <name type="place">Babelon</name> also answered him in a discussion much extended from his first essay<ref target="#CH1-n30"
                  >30</ref> which proved that the object was not purely <name type="place">Phoenician</name>. Its function, however, was hardly adequately
               treated until 1914 when <name type="pname">Jean</name>
               <name type="place">Svoronos</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> argued with a wealth of illustration that the stylis was an image of the protecting deity set up on the stern of
               a ship. Whatever interpretations may be advanced in the future, one thing is clear: what Nike holds in her left hand has a naval significance.
               That does raise a difficulty, for it is well known that, at his accession, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               had no fleet and therefore no reason to select a type that meant victory at sea.</p>
            <p>There are three ways in which this dilemma is met: 1) by assuming that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               looked confidently ahead to victory at sea; 2) by assuming that he did not strike this gold at the beginning of his career but at a later time
               when it would have been appropriate; 3) by assuming that the stylis was part of the original on which <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> type
               was based and that he copied it as it was without concerning himself about its propriety in detail.</p>
            <p>1) Is by its nature incapable of proof, but certainly not very likely unless at the beginning of his career he expected to have the help of some
               other naval power. We do not know of any plans of his looking to control of the sea.</p>
            <p>2) Has been argued more than once. Its acceptance means either that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> struck
               no gold in the first years of his reign or that he continued to issue the types of his father (<ref target="#fig-7">PLATE I, 1</ref>–<ref
                  target="#fig-9">3</ref>). There is, I think, no defender of the first alternative now, for it is clear that <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> cannot have conquered <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>
               without money, and the mines of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> were still providing gold. We may assume that
               the second alternative is the only one which needs to be argued. It is generally assumed that the capture of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> is the point at which such an announcement of naval supremacy would become appropriate. That is <name
                  type="pname">Assmann's</name> theory in the article referred to: in 332 <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               found himself in the position of the <name type="place">Phoenician</name> admiral and could adopt his insignia. In replying to <name type="pname"
                  >Assmann</name>, <name type="place">Babelon</name> makes the interesting observation that by 332 there had been no sea battles (for the
               capture of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> can hardly be considered such) whereas the army of the Great King had been
               defeated at Issus and one would be inclined to expect that the real victory would be commemorated on any device adopted then rather than a
               strategic situation which was not, in fact, of capital importance to his great conquests.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Assman</name> is not the first to have put forward the theory that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage does not
               begin at the beginning of his reign. It appears as early as <name type="pname">E. M. Cousinéry</name> in whose <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Voyage dans la Macédoine</name>
               </hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>, 1831) there is a section, "<name type="pname">Monnaies d'Alexandre</name>" (pp.
               229–270). It is naive and careless in <pb n="8"/> detail (particularly in regard to the correspondence of text and illustrations) but it advances
               the doctrine which has had fuller and abler treatment since: that the first coins struck by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> were not those with his own types but a posthumous continuation of those of his father. "<name type="pname">Nous ne
                  pouvons—nous</name> refuser À croire qu'en entrant dans l'Asie, il ne soit borné À mettre en émission la monnaie de son père dans les trois
               metaux" (pp. 230f.). This is rejected by <name type="pname">Müller</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> but has been revived in an impressive presentation: <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">Alexanders Reichmünzen</name>
               </hi>. It will be well, however, to deal first with Cousinéry's earlier and less important treatment, though this will make it necessary to
               anticipate our discussion of the silver.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Cousinéry's</name> theory is founded on two convictions: first, that the head on the obverse of the silver is invariably a
               portrait of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>. "<name type="pname">Cette tête ne présente rien d'idéal</name>"
               he says (p. 236); he finds complete uniformity not only on the coins struck during <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> lifetime but also with
               the head in elephant-skin headdress issued by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">

                  >Lysimachus</name> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 5), which he rightly recognizes as likenesses not of the kings who minted them but of their deified leader. Of these he gives
               engravings, but none of the <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> types to let the reader judge whether they are
               of invariable style. He does, indeed, remark that the flans of the coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>
               after its division by the <name type="place">Romans</name> are thinner and broader, but there is no indication that he used this or any other
               criterion to distinguish the epochs to which <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> coins belong. Apparently he
               found the same face on the earliest <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n silver and on the spread-flan tetradrachms
               which succeeded the collapse of the Seleucid power. His second conviction is the surprising one that it was the Greek cities, grateful for their
               deliverance from the Persians, which selected the types and manufactured the coins. A modern numismatist would hardly feel called on to refute
               this but, of course, if it were true it would mean that the silver types could not have begun until the cities had been freed. The gold, as
               already remarked, he thinks was subsequent to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> visit to Ilium. The appearance of <name type="place"
                  >Athena</name> on the obverse would be a natural consequence of the devotion there paid to her by the conqueror; the Nike of the reverse
               appears to be no problem to the author.</p>
            <p>After the Granicus <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> could use Persian gold and silver, but he continued to
               issue his father's types "soit par respect pour sa mémoire, soit À cause du crédit que ces monnaies avaient acquis partout où le nom de Philippe
               était parvenu. Ce que nous le prouve c'est la grande quantité de ces pièces qu'on ne cesse de découvrir dans toute l'Asie" (p. 231). This last
               remark is the only appearance of what can fairly be called evidence in a fabric of conjecture, and it is evidence which we can test to some
               extent. It is essential to distinguish <pb n="9"/> between the gold and silver. The gold of Philip achieved a great success as an international
               medium and its popularity was such that it certainly was issued posthumously.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> The wide currency of the staters is
               shown by the hoards in which they occur. There are 19 such hoards listed by Noe:<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> they come from <name type="place"
                  >Bulgaria</name>, <name type="place">Romania</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name>, <name type="place"

               <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver, on the other hand, had a more restricted territory. Among the barbarians of the north it was well
               received, so that from the mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> these types also were issued posthumously.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref>
               The great number of Celtic imitations, much commoner than those copied from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>,
               is testimony to the success of the originals in that direction. But if the crossing to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name>
               and the early campaigns there were financed with <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver as well as his gold, which is essential to Cousinéry's
               theory, the hoards containing his silver should be conspicuous in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>. There are
               24 such hoards, and they come from <name type="place">Bulgaria</name>, <name type="place">Romania</name>, <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> It
               cannot be said that there is any lack of evidence from the territory with which we are concerned. From <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, the adjacent islands, and north <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>
               Noe's list has 140 hoards, and of these there are no less than 17 which contain silver of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref> And not one silver coin of <name type="pname">Philip</name> ! This is surely enough to
               justify us in asking "If <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver was used in the first campaigns, where is it?"</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> deals with <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage as a whole, which nobody had done since <name
                  type="pname">Müller</name>. He has a familiarity with the literary sources which numismatists in general would do very well to match. He has
               supported his thesis with great learning and ingenuity, assembling much material on iconography with which also numismatists should be better
               acquainted than they are. It is quite impossible to do justice to the work in any résumé since it is a large body of related details but, though
               I feel called upon to disagree with him, I should like to do him as little injustice as possible.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name> thesis is that the imperial coinage—silver as well as gold—was inaugurated at the festival at <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> in the spring of 331 after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> return <pb n="10"/> from
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> It was at that time that Harpalus, induced by <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> to return from his flight to Megara, was reinstated as treasurer. It is, of
               course, an attractive idea that so large and important a system should have been planned in advance and put into operation all at once, and the
               second visit to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> would certainly be an appropriate moment for such an innovation. But <name
                  type="pname">Kleiner</name> does not rely on this appropriateness alone. Like others, he maintains the improbability of <name type="pname"
                  >Alexander's</name> using Nike as a device before the capture of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> (pp. 12, 20, 21); he
               denies that Pallas is a probable deity for him to have honored in the earliest years of his reign, before his visit to Troy (pp. 18, 19); and he
               adds a more complicated psychological argument. In 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>
               </hi>., to celebrate the freeing of the Greeks, gold pieces were struck with the portrait of Flamininus on the obverse, and on the reverse, with
               the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">T. QVINCTI,</hi>
               </hi> an imitation of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> Nike with a palm substituted for the stylis (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 6).<ref target="#CH1-n40">40</ref>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> regards this to be a presentation of Flamininus the Liberator as an equivalent for <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> the Liberator. But he believes that if this type had been employed by <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> at the beginning of his reign it would have been remembered as the money of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> the Destroyer of Thebes and so altogether unsuitable for the model of a type in
               honor of emancipation, whereas if it had been introduced after his freeing of the Greek cities of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> there would have been no such objection (pp. 5, 6).<ref target="#CH1-n41">41</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These arguments, to my mind, are based on probability only and are therefore bound to fail if confronted with <hi rend="italic">evidence</hi> to
               the contrary. And we have contrary evidence in three places. The first is the absence of <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver in hoards from
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, already discussed in connection with Cou-sinéry. The other two are alike.
               In discussing the <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> coinage of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref> and Myriandrus<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref> Newell shows how directly it was based on the coinage of the
               Persian satrap Mazaeus which preceded it. Now <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> entered <name type="place"
                  >Tarsus</name> September 3, 333 and won the battle of Issus November 12 of the same year.<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref> If coins were issued
               from those mints as soon after falling into <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> hands as dies could be cut, obviously the theory that the first
               appearance of his <pb n="11"/> types was in the spring of 331 must be abandoned. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>
               does not undertake to prove that the Greek coins follow the Persian ones immediately, though he certainly believed it.<ref target="#CH1-n45"
                  >45</ref> But there are only two other possibilities: either the mints were idle from 333 to 331 or, conformable to <name type="pname"
                  >Kleiner's</name> general theory, there were intervening issues bearing <name type="pname">Philip's</name> types. In the first case, some
               reason ought to be alleged; in the second, the issues ought to be identified. Unless or until these conditions are met, <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s hypothesis holds the field.<ref target="#CH1-n46">46</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Account should also be taken of the arrangement of the issues of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> in <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s study of the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard.<ref target="#CH1-n47">47</ref> They
               extend from "circa 336 <hi rend="bold">B.C.</hi> to circa 318 <hi rend="bold">B</hi>.c.," the latter being the date of the hoard's burial (p.
               135); they are put in groups A to K. This arrangement the author justifies on pp. 68f.: "The dates here assigned the various groups of the <name
                  type="place">Amphipolis</name> coinage are, perhaps, to a certain extent approximate. But even so, they cannot be in error by much more than a
               year either way." He points out that important confirmation for the dating of the earlier groups comes from a hoard buried at <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_cyparissia">Kyparissia</name> in 328 or 327.<ref target="#CH1-n48">48</ref>
               <name type="pname">Kleiner's</name> theory, which does not affect the date of burial of the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard, would force
               us to compress this material by five years, reducing the groups from eleven to six. How is it to be done? It may be urged that <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> himself had revised an earlier arrangement, and so he had, and in important respects.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n49">49</ref> There has been much new information made <pb n="12"/> available since his second study and that needs to be worked
               through; a particular need is the systematic treatment of the issues of <name type="pname">Philip</name> II. But it is not enough to say that
               this arrangement is fallible. It is founded on careful study and unless or until a better arrangement is proposed, we are not justified in
               lowering the beginning of the coinage by five years.<ref target="#CH1-n50">50</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I cannot see that <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> has done justice to the evidence of style. The difference between the earliest <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> heads from the different mints is made much of in the article by Gebaur to be
               discussed below.</p>
            <p>3) Such being the weaknesses of our second possibility, we are left with our third: namely, that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> Nike is
               copied from one with which the stylis belongs. An <name type="place">Athenian</name> origin was an obvious possibility to those who believed that
               Pallas on the obverse was <name type="place">Athena</name> Promachus, but <name type="place">Babelon</name> made the suggestion very specific by
               pointing out<ref target="#CH1-n51">51</ref> that Nike with a stylis upon a column beside <name type="place">Athena</name> Promachus was painted
               on a Panathenaic vase of 336/5, the archonship of Pythodelos. This seemed to him more than a coincidence and he concluded that the two Nikai were
               related documents of a time of cordiality between the monarch and the city. Hill defended him against Assmann on matters of fact, but was not
               convinced by the suggestion that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> had borrowed from Athens.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n52">52</ref> Neither was <name type="place">Svoronos</name> who, as already remarked, could not believe that at this time <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> would have had any reason to flatter the <name type="place">Athenian</name>s as
                  <name type="place">Babelon</name> thought. Instead, he suggested that it was the other way around and that the Nike on the Panathenaic vase
               was copied from "les types désormais historiques des statères qu' <name type="pname">Alexandre</name> venait de frapper dès son retour en
                  Macédoine."<ref target="#CH1-n53">53</ref> This was dismissed by Lederer as impossible because there was not enough time for the coins to have
               been struck and become so well known as to invite imitation in the year 336/5 after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> return from the
               Congress of Corinth.<ref target="#CH1-n64">64</ref> On the other hand, he produced as evidence of the connection with <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> a newly discovered gold stater on which the type of Nike was accompanied by Nike also as a symbol
               bearing an aphlaston and an obscure object which he thought might be a stylis. This unprecedented use of the same figures as both major and minor
               device he regarded as certainly calculated. Stylistically the coin belongs to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> earliest <pb n="13"/> issues;
               Lederer believed that it was the very first die cut for the new king's gold (and possibly cut in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens"
                  >Athens</name> itself). Moreover, he made more specific an idea that had already been advanced by <name type="place">Babelon</name>. Golden
               Nikai had been dedicated in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> in the latter half of the 5th century, but in the critical
               days of 407/6 they had, with one exception, been melted down into money. One was restored in 374/3 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>.,<ref

               have a literary tradition and inscriptional evidence as well. The pseudo-Plutarchian <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Ten Orators</hi> (841 D and
               852 B) and <name type="pname">Pausanias I</name>, 29 both record the fact that <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q211326">Lycurgus</name>,
               who was notable for the extent to which he restored her ancient riches to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, had

               II, 333 and 1493 testify to that fact. Now when the gift was dated in 336, as understood by <name type="place">Babelon</name>, a connection
               between <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>' and <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> Nike is an obvious possibility, and
                  <name type="pname">Lederer</name> (p. 202) definitely holds the coin to be inspired by those restored statues. One item that makes this
               attractive is the fact that the figure is not at all what we should expect from the 4th century, whereas it is perfectly appropriate to a
               restoration of a 5th century original.<ref target="#CH1-n56">56</ref> Unfortunately for the theory in this form, the two inscriptions are now
               dated 334/3.<ref target="#CH1-n57">57</ref> It has been rescued, however, by a daring conjecture of Homer A. Thompson:<ref target="#CH1-n58"
                  >58</ref> to wit, that the restoration of 336/5 was an act of munificence of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> himself, whose selection of the type would then commemorate an act of generosity toward a city for which he had recurring
               moods of affection. We have only to read the speeches of the later Attic orators to find that not all <name type="place">Athenian</name>s were
               his enemies; doubtless he had more friends than we know, and perhaps he thought he had more friends than he did. It is obvious that the only real
               objection to this solution is skepticism as to such cordial relations between <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> in 336.<ref target="#CH1-n59">59</ref> If that can be
               accepted, all difficulties are met. But we should have the candor to admit that the choice would not have been expected and is foreign to general
               historical probability.</p>
            <p>As to the obverse type of the silver, we are met with a different kind of question. The head of young <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> with a lion's skin covering had ample <pb n="14"/> precedent on <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n coins, having appeared under Archelaus I, 413-399, <name type="pname">Amyntas</name> III,
               389-383, 381-369, Perdiccas III, 364-359 and <name type="pname">Philip</name> II, 359-336.<ref target="#CH1-n60">60</ref> The legend of the
               descent of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n kings from <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248"
                  >Heracles</name>, whenever it was invented, had been very useful to their claim to admission among the first families of the Hellenic world
               and no reason beyond tradition was needed for the adoption of the hero's portrait as a device. <name type="pname">Kleiner</name>, whose theory
               requires that the silver as well as the gold should have been inaugurated in 331, argues that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> interest in
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> was not conspicuous until the episode of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name>, after which his heroic ancestor assumes great importance in his life,<ref target="#CH1-n61">61</ref> but
               the conclusion is open to the same objections that have already been discussed in regard to the gold. The simplest explanation is that the new
               king adopted an old type but for a new denomination.</p>
            <p>It is natural that the question should have been repeatedly asked: "is the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> head a
               portrait of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> himself?" There are really two independent questions, not always
               distinguished by investigators. Was it the intention of the die-engravers to produce a likeness (which might be true without any effect on the
               general public, most of whom would not have seen the king at close enough range to judge)? Was it the general persuasion that the head was a
               likeness of the king (which might be true without any such intent on the part of the die-engravers)? We have sundry bits of evidence that the
               second was true in later tradition.</p>
            <p>1) A very interesting tetradrachm was issued in the 2nd century B.C. by <name type="pname">Agathocles</name>, king of Bactria, one of a number
               honoring his predecessors. The obverse has the familiar head in lion's skin with the inscription AΛEΞANΞPOY TOY ΦIΛIΠΠOY (<ref target="#fig-43"
                  >Plate II, 7</ref>).<ref target="#CH1-n62">62</ref> Here <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> is altogether ignored
               and the portrait is meant to be not that of the deified conqueror but of Agathocles' royal but human precursor.</p>

               <pb n="15"/> head in lion's skin which, considering the town, must be understood as a picture of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n63">63</ref>
            </p>
            <p>3) A great many bronze coins were issued in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> in the 3rd century <hi rend="bold"
                  >A.D.</hi> with the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> on the obverse identified by the inscription

               <hi rend="bold">late</hi> II, 8).<ref target="#CH1-n64">64</ref> The most favored portrait seems to be one with diadem and flowing hair,
               obviously modelled on the coinage of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>, but there also appears the head in
               lion's skin headdress,<ref target="#CH1-n65">65</ref> which shows that at that period there was no doubt as to who was represented.</p>
            <p>4) Apollonia Mordiaeum struck a bronze coin in the time of Caracalla on which the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>
               portrait is identified by inscription as <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> the Founder of Apollonia.<ref

            </p>
            <p>5) There is also an interesting mediaeval item in the <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="pname">De Thematibus</name>
               </hi> of the emperor <name type="pname">Constantine Porphyrogenetus</name> (945-959 <hi rend="bold">A.D</hi>.).<ref target="#CH1-n67">67</ref>
               Speaking of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n kings who considered themselves descendants of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> who slew the Nemean lion, he reports that instead of taenia or crown or royal purple,
               they crowned themselves with the skin of a lion's head which they prized more than jewels. "Trustworthy proof of this is the coin of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> of Macedon adorned with that kind of portrait." So there were <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> tetradrachms to be seen in the 10th century and at so late a date the answer to
               the second question is still that the head was commonly supposed to be that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name>, and surely it is not very daring to guess that the same answer would be right for a much earlier period, even the period of
                  <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own lifetime. But for lack of a statement it cannot be proven.</p>
            <p>The first question may be debated and has been. It is unnecessary to refer to all the writers who have had their say, since some have nothing new
               to offer. A few believed that the head is always intended to be <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>. We have
               seen that this is the position taken, for different reasons by <name type="pname">Cousinéry</name> and by <name type="pname">Kleiner</name>.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n68">68</ref> It was supported also by some of the older numismatists writing in <pb n="16"/> a day before the resource of
               abundant illustration, so that their conclusions could not be presented so as to convince the eye; nor, indeed, were their own convictions based
               on wide and intimate visual acquaintance with the material.</p>
            <p>Others have held that the head was never intended as a portrait. Such is <name type="pname">Eckhel's</name> belief,<ref target="#CH1-n69"
                  >69</ref> supported by a bookish argument characteristic of his time. He appeals to the words of Horace <hi rend="italic">(Epistles</hi> II.
               I. 239–41):</p>
            <p>"<name type="pname">Edicto vetuit</name>, ne quis se praeter Apellem</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Pingeret</name>, aut alius Lysippo duceret aera</p>
            <p>Fortis <name type="pname">Alexandri</name> vultum simulantia."</p>
            <p>He might have added the passage from Pliny the Elder <hi rend="italic">(H. N.</hi> VII. 37. 125): Idem hic imperator edixit ne quis ipsum alius
               quam Apelles pingeret, quam Pyrgoteles scalperet, quam Lysippus ex aere duceret; and the later passage (XXXVII. 4.1) where the authorization of
               Pyrgoteles seems to apply only to carving in emerald.<ref target="#CH1-n70">70</ref> Even so fortified the argument does not amount to much. The
               meaning of the edict (whatever form it took) must have been that the king was not going to sit for his portrait to any artists except those
               three. He cannot have hoped, or desired, to prevent the making of copies and copies of copies by any who felt so inclined. Indeed we have ancient
               references to other portraits besides those of the official appointees.<ref target="#CH1-n71">71</ref> Die-sinkers could certainly make portraits
               of the king without breaking the law.</p>
            <p>Most of the discussions have been, of course, parts of more general inquiries into the portraits of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> in all media, but whether other kinds are included or not, the scholars have taken one of
               two positions, either denying that there were any numismatic portraits of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               during his lifetime, or admitting that certain coins might be so considered. The former view has the weighty authority of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n72">72</ref> which is heartily supported by <name type="pname">Theodor
                  Schreiber</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n73">73</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>According to them portraiture was an invention of the Hellenistic age, and the difference between one <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> tetradrachm and the next is to be explained by differences in time and place of striking and
               difference of die-sinkers. Both authors look to the issues of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> (<hi
                  rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi> II, 5) and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name>
               <hi rend="bold">(<ref target="#fig-40">Plate II, 4</ref>)</hi> for real evidence as to the appearance of the king their master.</p>
            <p>But other scholars are not able to dismiss the differences so lightly and maintain, with greater or less conviction, that here and there <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> own face does appear under the lion's skin. It is noticeable that the numismatists are mostly very cautions
               and show no disposition to cite specific examples. <name type="pname">Müller</name> who, in his time, had studied a much larger body of material
               than anyone else, lays down the general principle that the earliest <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> heads of the
               reign are like their predecessors on the coins of previous kings, but that sometimes later, and commonly after 323 a likeness appears, not as a
               result of any command of the king but at the choice of the several magistrates or of the artists themselves.<ref target="#CH1-n74">74</ref> But
               there is no indication of where to look for these appearances. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_100184717">George MacDonald</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n75">75</ref> is very reticent: "Tradition, indeed, has it that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> features are to be
               discerned in the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>—even if we grant that this is so, the very circumstance
               that portraiture was introduced in covert fashion, lurking under the shelter of religion, is highly significant." And <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> in a book where positive identification would certainly be appropriate,<ref target="#CH1-n76"
                  >76</ref> says only, "The silver coins invariably bear the head of the youthful <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>
               covered with a lion's skin—the features frequently resembling those of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               himself."</p>
            <p>There are those, however, who are willing to be more specific. <name type="pname">E. Q. Visconti</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n77">77</ref> finds indication of the king's features on tetradrachms of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rhodes"
                  >Rhodes</name> and of <name type="place">Ake</name>. <name type="pname">G. F. Hill</name>, more daring than his fellow numismatists, publishes
               "a head of young <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> r., with features resembling <name type="pname"

               >Cyprus</name>.</p>
            <p>Using <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s plates as a basis, <name type="pname">Kurt Gebauer</name> has a full and
               careful stylistic analysis of the coinage as the first part of his "<name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>bildnis
               und <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>typus."<ref target="#CH1-n79">79</ref>
               <pb n="18"/> He argues that the first pieces from the mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi> I, <hi rend="bold">II</hi>) and, to a lesser extent, the first from other mints, show a head which is perfectly
               characteristic of the mid-fourth century. Within the next half decade there is a breaking with tradition and a greater freedom and individuality,
               usually followed by a hardening into schematization. From this the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> mints never recover but those of <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>, farther from the artistic dominance of the homeland, and inheriting the traditions of
               local schools of art, produce essentially new portraits. From <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> in 327 comes a die which
               he recognizes as the first true likeness of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> on a coin (<hi rend="bold"

               there is no return to the impersonal and universal <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>, though the individual portrait
               too loses something of its original freshness. Another essay in portraiture comes from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon"
                  >Babylon</name> in 316 <ref target="#fig-46">
                  <hi rend="bold">(PLATE</hi> II, 10</ref>), this time showing Lysippan influence. Gebauer regards the development of the head in the years
               after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death as a combination of the conception of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> as a god with that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> as an historic ruler, the various
               local streams finally merging in the full tide of Hellenistic art. The portraits which appear on the first silver of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> and on both silver and gold of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus"
                  >Lysimachus</name> are unmistakably identifiable as the deified <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>The article has excellent, clear and well-chosen illustrations. Its tone is logical and temperate and the case it makes is certainly a
               respectable one. Of course, the language of aesthetic criticism is hard. There is so much that the eye perceives that cannot be put into adequate
               words. And there are so many times when two beholders will perceive different things as to matters of expression and emotion. The difficulties
               are increased when the argument is not about single substantative works of art but, as here, about items selected as examples from a large group
               which has its inner differences as well as its common characteristics. Perhaps another scholar, working with the same material, might modify the
               course of this study and its conclusions. But it does seem to me that the argument is probable as a whole and supported by its details. It will
               be seen that it altogether rejects the idea that the broadcasting of his portrait was part of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> original
               plan, or, indeed, that he had anything to do with it at any time. <hi rend="italic">A priori</hi> it would be attractive to think that it <hi
                  rend="italic">had</hi> been part of the plan for the imperial coinage—that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> had anticipated <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> and <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> and
                  <name type="pname">Demetrius Poliorcetes</name> in making use of his money to spread his fame. It has been suggested that he himself had been
               anticipated by his father and that the bearded head on <name type="pname">Philip's</name> silver was <pb n="19"/> intended at once for <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> and for the king.<ref target="#CH1-n80">80</ref> But in this case we have no reliable
               portraits of <name type="pname">Philip</name> preserved for comparison and the unproven possibility cannot be used to strengthen the case for
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>The different approach of Miss <name type="pname">Bieber's</name> "The <name type="pname">Portraits</name> of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> the Great" leads to a similar result. As none of her predecessors had done, she
               "distinguishes between the different periods in which the bewildering varieties of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> portraits preserved for us have been created." Her only addition to the numismatic material in Gebauer's article is the
               enlargement, as fig. 32, of another coin of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> of about 320 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. (<hi

            <p>Both of these studies assume, as do <name type="pname">Müller</name> and Hill, that the appearance of a real portrait is the achievement of an
               individual engraver or perhaps an individual magistrate or satrap. On the other hand, <name type="place">Erik <name type="place">Sjöqvist</name>
               </name>, publishing a head in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</name> Museum<ref target="#CH1-n82">82</ref> illustrates,
               as a parallel, a tetradrachm of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</name> (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>

                  type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> iconography." This, he believes, is not merely the work of a single gifted die-cutter
               but a document of the gradual process of the deification of</p>
            <pb n="20"/>
            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> during his own lifetime. "It marks," he says, "the first decisive step in
               the evolution of an iconography that was totally new to Greek art: that of rendering an image of a deified ruler." He enumerates convincingly the
               specific traits which make this seem to be an actual individual and not a mere traditional convention, and he believes that the original is the
               official portrait of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> in 332, probably by <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_297421082">Lysippus</name>. If we are dealing with an official program the result ought to be that from this time on the coins
               show with increasing frequency and success heads that are recognizably those of an actual person, somewhat idealized to be sure, but not those of
               a conventional hero. But do they? Comparison of the different specimens selected as likenesses by the various scholars raises a certain
               uneasiness in the mind of the beholder and a feeling that we need much more material than even Gebauer has provided.</p>
            <p>There is a certain deceptive pattern in the situation. On the one hand there are the coins earlier than <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> with a beardless head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>.
               These cannot be portraits of him. They vary considerably in style but it is impossible that they should be portraits of the various rulers who
               struck them.<ref target="#CH1-n84">84</ref> They must be <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> alone. On the other hand
               there are the heads generally agreed to be posthumous portraits of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, issued
               by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>.
               Between are the issues of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> himself which should be related to one extreme or
               the other. But it is not quite as easy as this, for no one has yet demonstrated the uniformity of the testimony of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>. Indeed, a glance at
               Pl. IX of Hill's <hi rend="italic">Select Greek Coins</hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>, 1927) which shows
               enlargements of coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> and his two successors tempts us to wonder whether
               we may not recognize the later heads because they bear the accessories of divinization—the elephant's head and the ram's horns—and not because
               they resemble each other. We must never forget that we are dealing with the craftsmanship of many die-sinkers who varied greatly in skill and
               also—as Professor <name type="place">Sjöqvist</name> reminds me—in sympathy with the idea of divinization. <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>
               mints never achieved, and probably never attempted the degree of uniformity shown in the <name type="place">Athena</name> heads of 5th century
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. But what is the proportion between the specimens which show conformity with an
               official program and those aberrations of intent or execution which would seem to deny its existence? An enormous task awaits some heroic
               scholar: analysis which shall be not selective but inclusive of the dozens of dies of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248"
                  >Heracles</name>' head <pb n="21"/> to see what generalizations can be safely made. It must be done without preconceptions—and it might well
               end in failure. Perhaps some guidance can be provided by Cahn's synopsis of the elements which form style<ref target="#CH1-n85">85</ref> but it
               is a work not to be undertaken by the impatient or the faint of heart.</p>
            <p>For the present let us content ourselves with concluding that a traditional type was selected by <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> as suitable for an imperial currency, which proved its acceptability in an empire wider than
               he could have imagined and that, at some times and in some places, true likenesses of the king and his commanding personality inspired the hands
               of his artisans so that men came eventually to believe that he and <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> were one.</p>
            <p>The reverse type is invariable in its main features. <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> is always seated to the left, he
               has an himation over his legs but is undraped from the waist up, on his outstretched right hand he holds an eagle, with his left he leans upon a
               long scepter behind him. There are details, with which we shall deal presently, that vary. He is sometimes called <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> Olympios.<ref target="#CH1-n86">86</ref> Yet there are important differences from the statue of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> that was at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</name> in <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> time: the great chryselephantine statue by Pheidias. They have deterred most scholars from giving a title to
                  <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> deity. One other identification was put forward, but it cannot be seriously considered. Eckhel<ref
                  target="#CH1-n87">87</ref> says "Jupiter hic Nicephorus (a mere slip for Aetophorus) haud dubie est Bottiaeus ille seu cultus in Bottiaea
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>e regione in qua sita Pella." Impressed by "haud dubie" from so great an
               authority, <name type="pname">Müller</name> accepted the name,<ref target="#CH1-n88">88</ref> and, in his early work<ref target="#CH1-n89"
                  >89</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> contributed a rhetorical flourish which his maturer judgment allowed to be
               forgotten: "on the reverse we see <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> of Bottiaea, who had a famous temple at Pella and was
               honored throughout <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>." But Bottiaean <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201"
                  >Zeus</name> is a very elusive figure indeed. The single ancient mention of him is by Libanius in connection with a dedication of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> at Antioch-on-the-Orontes (or rather where Antioch was later to be founded)<ref
                  target="#CH1-n90">90</ref>. Any connection with the district of Bottiaea around Pella is conjecture and nothing more.</p>
            <p>The divergence from Olympian <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> is excellently stated by Cook in a passage worth quoting
               in full.<ref target="#CH1-n91">91</ref> "When <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> the Great placed upon his <pb

               would choose for the purpose the great cult-statue at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</name>—and the more so as Mount
               Olympos was a prominent feature of his own domain. In point of fact, he did nothing of the sort. He set aside all the improvements introduced by
               Pheidias and deliberately reverted to the old pre-Pheidiac type. A comparison of his tetradrachms on the one hand with the federal coins of <name

            <p>The inference is clear. <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, ignoring the idealized ruler at <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_olympia">Olympia</name>, harked back to the more ancient and popular type of <name type="pname">Zeus Lykaios</name>. After
               all, <name type="place">Mount Lykaion</name> too was called Olympos. Yet so immense was the fame of the Pheidiac figure that tetradrachms issued
               later in the name and with the types of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> are increasingly influenced by it.
               The left leg is advanced instead of the right, and the throne is manifestly assimilated to that of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201"
                  >Zeus</name> Olympios—so even <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> failed to arrest the moral evolution of
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name>." To the resultant questions, "What motive led him to make the attempt? Why did he
               select for his world-wide coinage the old eagle-bearer of <name type="place">Arkadia</name> rather than the newer and nobler creation of
               Pheidias?"—he has no answer to offer.<ref target="#CH1-n92">92</ref>
            </p>
            <p>But the particular form of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> was less important than the fact that, like <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> other devices, he was easy for inhabitants of the various districts <pb n="23"/> of the empire to accept as
               their own. <name type="pname">Seltman</name> has put the case clearly:<ref target="#CH1-n93">93</ref> "Though introduced in 336 <hi rend="bold"
                  >B.C</hi>. these types were destined to appeal equally to <name type="place">Greeks</name> and to Oriental subjects of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> as yet unconquered; for the <name type="place">Phoenician</name> was to see in the obverse
               type his own god Melqart, the Cilician was to regard the seated deity as the god Ba'al of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, and the Babylonian,
               though he might not be able to read the Greek name of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, was to look on
               pictures that might recall his own <name type="place">Gilgamesh</name>, the lion-slayer, and the figure of Bel-Marduk, god of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. When it is realized that, next to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>,
               the greatest mints of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> were to be established precisely in <name type="pname"
                  >Phoenicia</name>, <name type="place">Cilicia</name>, and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, the uncanny foresight
               that the king showed in the selection of these types becomes apparent."</p>
            <p>Cook recorded the fact that the earliest pose, with the legs stiffly parallel, the right in front of the left, gives place to an easier position,
               more like that of Pheidias' figure, with the right leg drawn back and the right foot appearing in back of the left one <hi rend="bold"
                  >(PLATE</hi> II, 10, 11). This change does not take place everywhere at the same time, but it is general and is an indication of date rather
               than of place. But there are small differences which are useful for a more exact placing of the issues in their respective mints. Not only does
               the throne sometimes have a back (as mentioned by Cook) but the back may be decorated with little Nikai on the top, and the shape of the legs and
               the placing of the crossbars differ. The god is sometimes laureate; sometimes there are long locks on the nape of his neck, sometimes short ones,
               sometimes none. There may be a dotted exergual line beneath his feet, or a straight one, or a footstool, or nothing. Together with these items
               also goes a constant modification of style which is in itself sometimes sufficient to prove the relation between reverse dies without more
               objective variants.</p>
            <p>But far more important than other minutiae for the reverses of both silver and gold are the little ancillary figures—the symbols—or the letters
               or monograms which, with very few exceptions, occur in the field of the reverse type. They are not conceived as parts of the main design, as is
               evident from the fact that the scales of the type figure and the symbol are quite unrelated. Scholars were early convinced that symbols,
               monograms and letters alike were indications of the place of striking, and great ingenuity was displayed in recognizing civic devices and
               deciphering cities' names. Some of the suggestions were good and have been confirmed by later work with greater resources, though the original
               discoverer is sometimes forgotten. Some were quite fantastic and displayed an astonishing ignorance of ancient history and geography. It would be
               amusing to list the impossible guesses that have been made, but no serious <pb n="24"/> value would result. Any who are disposed to investigate
               this chapter in the history of human error might start with Eckhel's list of his predecessors,<ref target="#CH1-n94">94</ref> noting his own
               selective and conservative suggestions as to mints, based largely upon Pellerin "post infelices aliorum conatus."<ref target="#CH1-n95">95</ref>
            </p>
            <p>These early attempts have one common weakness: they do not distinguish between the first coins and the later ones, some of them very much later.
               Such differentiation is among the great merits of what is still the basic work in the field: <name type="pname">L. Müller's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Numismatique d'Alexandre le Grand.</hi> To a volume which discussed all aspects of the coinage of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, with that of <name type="pname">Philip</name> II and <name type="pname">Philip</name> III
               as well, was added an Atlas wherein is displayed in clear tabular form all the varieties known to him (1735 for <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, 313 for the elder <name type="pname">Philip</name>, 142 for the younger) with drawings of
               the symbols and monograms, indication of their placing on the coin and of its fabric.<ref target="#CH1-n96">96</ref> The fabric was arranged in
               seven classes, the increasing breadth and flatness of whose flans was the sign of a chronological development, and they are illustrated by
               engravings on the first two plates. His discussion of them, on pp. 5-9, 97-104, allows for border-line cases, and would not now be accepted in
               all its details, but it added an important new instrument for the analysis of the huge number of coins with which we have to deal.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Müller</name> treats of symbols and monograms more than once (pp. 35-49, 90—93, 116-122). He began with the conviction that
               they represented towns or districts and in his Atlas the main headings are place names, with lists of Incerti for the various districts, the
               length of which might have given him some cause for doubt. Thus, in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> he lists 15
               towns followed by 61 varieties from Incertae Urbes which, on the least reckoning, would amount to 11 more. He does at one point admit that
               symbols might be those of magistrates,<ref target="#CH1-n97">97</ref> but he is sure that the marks are generally those of towns.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n98">98</ref> Of course, additions to his lists were made, but I think there was no published questioning of his principle until
               a quarter of a century later.</p>
            <pb n="25"/>
            <p>In 1869 <name type="pname">Edward H. Bunbury</name> published<ref target="#CH1-n99">99</ref> two tetradrachms of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>, one (<name type="pname">Müller</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n100">100</ref> no. 112, Aenos) with caduceus and bee, the other (<name type="pname">Müller</name> no. 445 a, <name
                  type="place">Chrysaoris</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_caria">Caria</name>) with torch and bee; they were both struck with
               the same obverse die. "It appears to me, therefore," he said, "as certain as any conclusion can be, in a subject where we are necessarily left to
               inference, that the two coins in question belong to the same part of the country, and can only be referred to neighboring cities." This is as far
               as his disagreement with <name type="pname">Müller</name> went. But a much more serious doubt as to the validity of <name type="pname"
                  >Müller's</name> method was raised by von Sallet.<ref target="#CH1-n101">101</ref> He found three staters of <name type="pname">Philip</name>
               II with the same obverse die. Two of them were <name type="pname">Müller</name> no. 88 (<name type="pname">Philip</name>pi) with K and tripod;
               the third, the gold counterpart of <name type="pname">Müller</name> no. 237 (Incerti) with K and a broad hat but without the tripod. He concluded
               that these must all have come from the same mint, and that the mint was not <name type="pname">Philip</name>pi. The symbols, then, may be those
               of magistrates or emissions and not of places. In reviewing this essay with approval<ref target="#CH1-n102">102</ref> Head remarked, "It is
               becoming every year more and more apparent that the whole edifice rests on a foundation of sand. The symbols, however much they may resemble
               municipal devices or coin-types, are, as <name type="pname">Dr. von</name> Sallet clearly shows, merely the signets of the monetary magistrates,
               and only very exceptionally to be accepted as mint-marks." This was so much more drastic than <name type="place">Bunbury's</name> essays in
               revision that it drew a cry of distress from him.<ref target="#CH1-n103">103</ref> Head, he protested, was destroying the whole foundation for a
               reasonable arrangement of the <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> coinage and leaving mere chaos. To this Head
               replied in a brief note.<ref target="#CH1-n104">104</ref> He granted that <name type="pname">Müller's</name> Classes V, VI, and VII, which were
               issued by free cities after the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, bore symbols, sometimes
               accompanied by initial letters, the devices of the cities which struck them. But, for the earlier coins, he expressed his conviction that three
               fourths of the signs were those of magistrates and not of cities. Head's doctrine convinced <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655"
                  >Imhoof-Blumer</name>, who appealed to it in support of his identification of the mint of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon"
                  >Babylon</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n105">105</ref> Finally, in 1912, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>, in his <hi

               <hi rend="italic">Teiradrachms of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> the Great,</hi> produced such a wealth of
               evidence on identical dies from the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard that the hypothesis of a large number of little mints had to be
               abandoned permanently.</p>
            <p>There are, to be sure, cases in which true mint marks do appear, and they are not all confined to the posthumous issues (for example, ĸ or
                  <graphic url="NS11_sym1.jpg"/> for <name type="place">Kition</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>, <graphic

               but the great majority, as Head saw, stand not for places but for persons. Who these persons were we do not know; they had supervision over
               particular issues, holding office for a term, which would usually be a year after the regular Greek custom, seeing that the official standards
               were maintained and being allowed to put their private marks on the coins struck under their charge as a subordinate guarantee to the great
               guarantee of the king's name.</p>
            <p>The bronze was less common and is much less well known. The types refer to <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name>, both
               obverse and reverse, though no one has raised any question about the portrait. The positions of the bow and club vary, and there are letters or
               symbols which will ultimately help in achieving an arrangement, but correspondences with the symbols on gold and silver are spasmodic and it is
               likely that the bronze issues were the care of separate officials. They were certainly not struck with the frequency and regularity of the gold
               and silver. The serious study of them has hardly begun.</p>
            <p>Such are the essential aspects of the major coins which formed the international currency of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> empire.</p>
            <p>These denominations were supplemented at one time or another by the following multiples and fractions:</p>

            <p>To translate these pieces of money with any thoroughness into terms of human existence would need far more information than we possess, but we

                  >Athens</name> according to which the drachm weighed 4.3 grams and was divided into 6 obols. There has been a good deal of discussion as to
               why he made the change, and talk of bimetallism which is, <hi rend="bold">I</hi> think, sufficiently dealt with by <name type="place">Théodore

                  corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> was certainly not surprising considering the assured reputation and universal acceptability of the
                  <name type="place">Athenian</name> owls. Schlumberger, indeed, believes that his choice was influenced not only by their importance in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> but also by their imitations which had become so notable an element in the currency of
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>. What <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> wanted
               to do, he says, was to give a generally recognized coinage to an empire which did not have one and to extend the use of coinage to the whole
                  territory.<ref target="#CH1-n119">119</ref> This largeness of view, however, would only have been possible at a time when he could foresee the
               eastern extension of his empire. It therefore fits Schlumberger's idea that the imperial currency does not begin with the beginning of the reign.
               But with the difficulties caused by this theory we have already dealt. In any case, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> had silver drachms 20 of which were equal to one gold stater in value.</p>
            <p>And what were they worth to their possessors? Any attempt to answer this question ought to be prefaced by a reminder that we have no evidence
               from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> itself. In the works of the orators and the comedians there is a
               considerable amount of economic information about 4th century <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, and this has been
               carefully gathered by August Böckh in his book <hi rend="italic">Die Staatshaushaltung der Athener.<ref target="#CH1-n120">120</ref>
               </hi> There a great deal can be found out about the range of revenues and expenses—rents, dowries, wages, fines, loans, and such matters. But
               these figures, while interesting and illuminating in themselves, must be used with caution for the economy of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> or <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name>. Nevertheless, there is one figure
               so basic that it seems safe to use it. In the latter part of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</name>'s <hi rend="italic"
                  >Constitution of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>,</hi> which deals with the constitution of his own time, section
               49 records the fact that the Council considered the case of paupers, and any who were found to have less than 3 minae capital and to be
               physically incapacitated received 2 obols a day for food at the public expense. In 4th century <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens"
                  >Athens</name>, then, 2 obols a day is the level of bare subsistence. This is borne out by <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q504986"
                  >Demosthenes</name>' proposal for an expedition against Macedon<ref target="#CH1-n121">121</ref> in which the foot soldiers were to get 2
               obols a day which would keep them alive even if they were not supplemented by plunder. We know nothing of the cost of living in the country, and
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> may well have been more expensive than any town in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>, but, if we keep that in mind, it is safe to calculate that a silver diobol was about the
               minimum that a man could get along on for a day. Then a drachma would support him for three days, a tetradrachm for 12.</p>
            <pb n="31"/>
            <p>This being the scale of values for silver, we need to convert it into gold and bronze. Since the gold stater (of two gold drachmae) weighed just
               twice the silver drachma, the ratio between gold drachma and silver drachma will be exactly the ratio between the bullion values of the metals.
               Now the value of gold and silver will vary according to supply and demand and will vary differently except in those instances in modern times
               where government control has produced a true bimetallism. Since in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> the standard was
               silver the result was an apparent fluctuation in the value of gold only, though sometimes ancient writers recognized the interaction of the
                  metals.<ref target="#CH1-n122">122</ref> There is evidence that in the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>n empire

               the proportion had sunk to 11 or 12: 1.<ref target="#CH1-n124">124</ref> In the middle of the 4th century the opening of the mines of Pangaeus
               suddenly increased the available gold supply which appears to have dropped the ratio to 10: 1,<ref target="#CH1-n125">125</ref> and this seems to

               we have encourages us to assume that 10: I was the usual ratio.One gold stater, then, equalling 20 silver drachmae or 5 tetradrachms, would be
               subsistence for one man for 60 days, and a distater for twice as long.</p>
            <pb n="32"/>
            <p>When we come to speculate about the bronze we are in greater difficulties. It is generally agreed that bronze money was essentially fiduciary:
               that its value was not measured by the weight of the metal. This is confirmed, though it cannot be said to be proved, by what little information
               we have about the price of bronze.<ref target="#CH1-n128">128</ref> More conclusive is the variation in weight of individual pieces of the same
               denomination. In the Drama Hoard there are 94 bronze coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> all well
               preserved and in about the same condition; 13 of them weigh over 7 grams, 25 weigh less than 6. It is obvious that there has been no such attempt
               at exactness as even the fractional silver shows.<ref target="#CH1-n129">129</ref> To be sure, the loss or gain in value would be very small, but
               if a coin of 4.78 grams was supposed to be worth the same as one of 8.09 that must be because the bullion value did not matter. But too much can
               be made of the indifference. I may quote the conclusions to which I came in regard to Selucid issues where there are sometimes denominations not
               distinguished by difference in type.<ref target="#CH1-n130">130</ref> "Everyone will agree that the weighing of the original flans for bronze
               coins was less careful than in the case of silver because the bullion value was so much less. On the other hand, it is too drastic to assume that
               the bullion value was of no account whatever. The conception of token money with a value entirely independent of its material, like our paper, is
               a modern one which cannot fairly be attributed to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name>tics of the third century <hi
                  rend="bold">B.C</hi>. Doubtless the ultimate worth of the bronze coins was their theoretical ability to be exchanged for precious metals, and
               this allowed them to circulate freely in spite of variation in weight and at a value higher than that of their material. Yet the analogy of
               silver and gold must have affected the peasant or soldier user of bronze coins. The persistence of a system of denominations distinguishable only
               by weight must rest on the instinctive conviction that the more metal there is in your coin the more it is worth."</p>
            <p>Weight, then, may be helpful in separating denominations but is no guide to their relation with the silver issues, and we must look for other
               methods of analysis. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> tentatively proposed alternate schemes for identifying
               Seleucid bronze, based on the hypothesis of equality between the largest bronze and the smallest silver.<ref target="#CH1-n131">131</ref> As I
               have had occasion to remark,<ref target="#CH1-n132">132</ref> it is doubtful whether a single system can be substantiated for all the kings from
                  <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I to Antiochus <pb n="33"/> III, and for all their mints, which by no means issue all the same
               denominations in silver and bronze. But aside from this his values are unsatisfactory for the period of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>. According to his calculations the piece which he calls the unit would be either ⅛ obol or
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">16</hi> obol, and therefore <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sup">48</hi>ro<hi rend="sub">1</hi>/<hi
                  rend="sub">96</hi> drachma. On the evidence of a possible reduction in weight by Antiochus IV, he prefers the second ratio for the early
               Seleucid period. On the basis of convenience, however, the former or a lower one would be preferable. There is no denomination between the bronze
               unit and the silver drachma issued frequently enough to have been in common use, and 48: 1 seems a wide gap, let alone 96: 1. The relation of
               gold stater to silver drachm was 20: 1 and, as the tetradrachm was even commoner than the drachma, there was a ratio of 5: 1 between the most
               available large denominations. Why should the minor ones be separated by 48: I? Yet, as I have pointed out, in the case of Ilium the first local
               issues of that mint provided not multiples of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> denomination but fractions: half and quarter, <hi rend="sup"
                  >1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">96</hi> and <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">192</hi> drachma according to <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s lower reckoning, <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">192</hi> and <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi
                  rend="sub">384</hi> according to his higher ! This surely must be rejected from its inherent improbability.</p>

               <name type="place">Reinach</name>, who has done us the service of confuting some of the unsuccessful speculations of his predecessors, has made a
               cautious suggestion as to the values of Ptolemaic bronze.<ref target="#CH1-n133">133</ref> Since from 305 <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>. on the <name

                  >Alexander's</name> coins, but he gives voice to an interesting principle which ought not to be overlooked. "S'il me fallait" he says "À toute
               force hasarder À mon tour un système de dénomination, je verrais volontiers dans la classe de bronze B de <name type="place">Svoronos</name>, qui
               est de beaucoup la plus fréquente, l'obole, la pièce divisionnaire par excellence." The obol is, in truth, so prominent in the writers that it
               seems reasonable that it should be conspicuous as an actual coin. There is a silver obol but it does not seem to have been common enough to
               satisfy the requirement, and it is tempting to call our bronze piece an obol and so establish a ratio of 6: 1 between the minor denominations.
               The purely factual name chalkous "the bronze piece" we may safely assume was used of our unit as it had been used of the much-despised first
                  <name type="place">Athenian</name> attempt to use token money;<ref target="#CH1-n134">134</ref> as it would presumably always be used of a
               bronze piece which was the only denomination or the dominant one. In more developed systems it may have been confined to a particular step in a
               series of denominations, having its multiples and divisions, as illustrated by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>"s
               tables, but for this early period it is almost certain that the commonest bronze piece would be called chalkous. That, however, <pb n="34"/>
               takes us no farther into the question of its value in terms of silver. There we have nothing to go on except reasonable conjecture. We are
               neither helped nor hindered by evidence from other places or other times,<ref target="#CH1-n135">135</ref> for it is clear that a coin without
               mark of value or necessary relation to its metal content would be very sensitive to circumstance, capable of being easily manipulated by
               authority or changed by conditions so that the work done by the unit of one situation might require a multiple in another. Let us assume, then,
               until we encounter evidence to the contrary, that the bronze unit was an obol and that two of them made a pauper's dole in the countries where
                  <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> authority ran.</p>

               <p>The term "seigniorage" is an anachronism, but we are driven to employ it because we do not know what word the Greeks used. The amount of
                  seigniorage in mediaeval and modern times might be enough not only to cover costs but to provide a revenue for the sovereign (the Bureau of
                  the Mint of the <name type="place">United States</name> is reported to have made a profit of over $45,000,000 in 1957). But that is under
                  conditions where the coinage does not have to compete with others whose bullion content is higher. Leaving out of consideration all other
                  Greek coinages, Athens and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> were alike in the intention that their coins

               <p>Indeed, <name type="pname">Kleiner</name> in a later passage (pp. 31f.) seems to me to compromise his position strangely: Harpalus the
                  treasurer must have been influential in the choice of types; Harpalus may have become acquainted with Athens on his first mysterious flight to
                  Megara in 333 and he was inclined to benevolence toward Athens by the celebrated Athenian hetairai Pythionike and Glykera; he was therefore
                  probably responsible for the Athenian character of the gold types. "Durch Harpalos wird es auch am ehesten möglich, die Goldstatere mit Athen
                  in Zusammenhang zu bringen." But then why introduce the Trojan episode at all?</p>

               <p>There is an interesting detail of the obverse type. The bowl of the helmet of Athena, when it is decorated, may carry one of four different
                  kinds of ornament which have been discussed by <name type="pname">G. F. Hill</name> ("<name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                     >Alexander</name> the Great and the Persian Lion-Gryphon," <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 1923, pp. 156-161). The first, and much the
                  commonest, is a serpent in which Lederer saw a symbol of Athena <hi rend="italic">(ZfN</hi> 1922, p. 195). The second is a remarkable animal
                  with straight wings, the body of a lion and the head of a bird. This type of gryphon belongs to the period after <name type="pname"
                     >Alexander's</name> death and to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, <name type="pname">Phoenicia</name>
                  and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. A rarer variant has the head of a lion, which is sometimes horned, with
                  curved wings. "The lion-gryphon'' says <name type="pname">Hill</name>, "was conceived by the Greek as the enemy <hi rend="italic">par
                     excellence</hi> of the Persian." It appears at <name type="place">Ace-Ptolemais</name> and <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, at <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> (or perhaps Damascus) and possibly in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus"
                     >Cyprus</name>, and its dates suggest that it may have been used for a short time as a symbol of the destruction of the Persian power. The
                  rarest ornament is a Greek sphinx, used at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> and perhaps elsewhere in the East. If
                  it is symbolic its significance is now lost.</p>
               <p>Professor <name type="pname">Machteld Mellink</name> of <name type="pname">Bryn Mawr</name> whose attention I called to this material points
                  out that the horned lion-headed griffin occurs by itself in contexts where it is surely apotropaic and so can hardly be called "the enemy par
                  excellence of the Persians." At the same time it appears to be unknown outside Persian art so that on <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>
                  coins it shows familiarity with a Persian art form. Of the other animals, all traditional as decorations on Athena's helmet, the most striking
                  thing is the galloping pose of the bird-headed griffin. But there is no sure explanation of the significance of any of them.</p>

               <p>It might be asked, if relations later deteriorated, why was not the type changed? But this admits of an easy answer. It is obvious that what

                  was allowed to affect his types once they had been chosen. It is possible that there was, in his lifetime, variety in the appearance of the
                  minor denominations, but there was none in the coins that did the main fiscal work of the empire.</p>

                  also be pointed out that while stylistically Baal on coins of Mazaeus at <name type="place">Tarsus</name> just before <name type="pname"

                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> dwarfed that of his father. Of course, the thing that made this possible was that <name type="pname"
                  >Philip</name> came into control of the gold and silver of the Pangaean district. When he took over the Thasian colony of Crenides in 357<ref
                  target="#CH2-n2">2</ref> he developed the neighboring gold mines until they produced an income of more than 1,000 talents.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> That undoubtedly took the form of coined money.<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref>

               </hi> puts abundance of money at the beginning of the kinds of wealth, followed by real estate, movables, cattle and slaves. There is no mention
               of bullion, and while we read of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>n bullion captured by <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> and of gold objects included in the plunder, there is no record of royal transactions in
               bullion any more than there is of transactions on credit. This fact, that the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>n
               kings, like the Greek cities, used not merely a money economy but a specie economy is of importance to keep in mind. If the thousand talents of
               income were all gold they would be 300,000 gold staters, since a silver talent, to translate it into its commonest forms, equalled 1,500
               tetradrachms or 300 gold pieces at a ratio of 10: I.<ref target="#CH2-n6">6</ref> Now though <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868"
                  >Aristotle</name>, and doubtless his contemporaries, generally believed that a supply of money was wealth, <name type="pname">Philip</name>
               does not seem to have accumulated much. None <pb n="36"/> of the kings who preceded him had been able to coin gold<ref target="#CH2-n7">7</ref>

               and, if we had no other evidence than the charges and counter-charges of the orators, we could judge how freely the king's money was spent in
                  bribery;<ref target="#CH2-n18">13</ref> it may well have amounted to a larger outlay than pay for the troops. And the tradition, whatever its
               accuracy, represents <name type="pname">Philip</name> as having no talent for economy. A passage from the <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi> of
                  Theopompus<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> describing his dissipation is certainly sensational and probably libellous, but it contains an
               interesting observation which does not seem to be an expression of prejudice, "He was a soldier and could not calculate income and expenditure at
               leisure." This must be considered in connection with the reports that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> was,
               at the beginning of his reign, short of funds. In the <hi rend="italic">Life of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                     >Alexander</name>
               </hi> (15.1) Plutarch quotes Aristobulus to the effect that on his crossing to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> had only 70 talents in the war chest; <name type="pname">Duris</name> says
               it was only provision for 30 days<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> while Onesicritus adds that he had a debt of 200 talents besides.</p>
            <pb n="37"/>
            <p>Still more lurid accounts of his financial distress are attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               himself when he was haranguing the mutineers at Opis. According to Curtius (X. II) he said that he had inherited from his father 60 talents and a
               debt of 500, while the sober Arrian gives the most extreme account of all (VII. 9.6): his assets from his father were a few gold and silver cups
               and less than 60 talents, while <name type="pname">Philip's</name> debt of 500 talents he had increased by borrowing 800 more.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n16">16</ref> The words attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> himself refer to the
               exchequer at the time of his accession, not at the time of his crossing. We should not count too much on the evidential value of such a speech,
               but there is nothing to contradict the common testimony that <name type="pname">Philip</name> had used up his money.</p>
            <p>Plutarch takes the circumstances to show the high adventurous spirit of the young king and he adds the famous tale of his distributing all the
               royal property to his friends, keeping for himself only his hopes, in which <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> gallantly said he would share,
               refusing all other benefits. But this romantic story is <pb n="38"/> quite impossible to believe in the form in which it is given. It would mean
               that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> embarked on an expensive and perilous enterprise without making any
               provision at all for the campaign after its very beginning. One serious check would have left him with an army that he could not support,
               separated from a kingdom whose resources were exhausted with no means of being reestablished. There may well have been a distribution of gifts,
               perhaps so spectacular as to make it seem that he had left nothing for himself, but the record does not support the legend that he would have
               given away his soldier's pay and their safety to make an impression on his friends. Much that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> did was adventurous to the point of recklessness. Like other great generals of antiquity he conceived it his obvious duty to
               lead his troops in the field and he never seems to have provided against the risk by arranging for a second in command, as in the end he died
               without providing for the succession. If the battle-axe of Spithridates had cut him down at the Granicus it is hard to see how the <name
                  type="place">Macedonian</name> army could have escaped annihilation. Whether there was a quality in the man that made him take risks beyond
               reason is a question outside the scope of this study. What concerns us is a class of evidence which lies altogether within reason. <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> strategy may have been bold but it was not hap-hazard. His plans may have been fallible at times, but there
                  <hi rend="italic">were</hi> plans, and among them fiscal plans to provide the money without which the expedition would have been
               impossible.</p>
            <p>The records tell us a great deal about the accomplishments of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> but little or
               nothing of what lay behind them. There is tactical information about his arrangement of the order of battle, and such an episode as the siege of
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_tyre">Tyre</name> is treated with a detail which includes experiment and failure as well as ultimate
               success, but operations on a larger scale are treated as though they were an automatic sequence. And yet, of course, a prodigious amount of
               planning must have been required for the success of the all but incredible progress of his arms and of this <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> must have been the master mind. We get a glimpse of him in his youth questioning the
               ambassadors of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>n king not only about what was that monarch's position in the line
               of battle, which might have been prompted by youthful valor and his adventurous spirit, but also about the size of the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>n forces and the shortest roads for those going inland from the sea, which was essentially strategic
                  material.<ref target="#CH2-n17">17</ref> The ambassadors recognized these as subjects in which a king should properly be interested, and
               called him a <name type="pname">Great King</name> in contrast to their own who was only rich. Slight as the incident is, it suggests that even as
               a boy he had an idea of the value of military intelligence, which is one element of a long-range military program. It would be <pb n="39"/>
               interesting if we could have even this much light on the preparations for later stages of his campaign. But it was not the kind of thing that
               antiquity found worthy of recording, and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> is not the only great ruler whose
               plans are entirely unreported. Once in a while we get an intimation of the day to day work which a king must do. <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n18">18</ref> remarks that kingship, which is the most perfect and greatest of offices, has the most cares and burdens and
               occupations, and he quotes <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> as saying, "If people knew what a labor it is to write and read so many letters,
               they would not even pick up a crown that had been thrown away." We must imagine, then, what the record fails to show: an <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> busy with many things less than heroic, but essential for all that. One of those things was
                  finance.<hi rend="sup">18a</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was recognized in the 4th century that finance was a special study. <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</name> in the <hi
                  rend="italic">Politics</hi> (I. 4. 8) lays it down that it is well for statesmen to understand money, since states often need money like
               households, but in greater quantity. Some statesmen, he says, have devoted themselves to that alone, doubtless having in mind the <name
                  type="place">Athenian</name> statesman Eubulus whom <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n19">19</ref> cites as having been commended because although he held unparalleled influence he did not deal at all with
               foreign affairs or the military but concerned himself only with finance and increasing the revenue. There was even some specialized literature:
               Aeneas whose <hi rend="italic">Tactica</hi> appears to have been written shortly after 360 <hi rend="bold">B.C.</hi> also wrote a treatise on
               military finance.<ref target="#CH2-n20">20</ref> An interesting, though too brief ancient view of imperial finance is presented in Book 2 of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q868">Aristotle</name>, edited by <name type="place">Van
                  Groningen</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n21">21</ref> In the theoretical introduction which comprises Chapter I we read 'There are four kinds of
               economy: that of a king; that of a satrap; that of a city state; that of an individual." It is plain that in the opinion of the author, which can
               hardly have been contradicted by the practice of his day, the coining of money is altogether in the <pb n="40"/> hands of the sovereign; the
               powers of a satrap may be great but they do not include coining. This is a continuation of 5th century doctrine according to which the issue of
               money was a declaration of sovereignty. Qualification is necessary for the Persian practice of the 4th century, however. The striking of gold was
               generally regarded as a royal monopoly. When Orontas, Satrap of Mysia presumed to do that it was because he was in revolt against the king and
               intended to declare himself independent.<ref target="#CH2-n22">22</ref> But with silver the matter is different. The <name type="place"
                  >Cilicia</name>n silver bearing the names of the satraps Tiribazus, Pharna-bazus, Datames and Mazaeus is well known.<ref target="#CH2-n23"
                  >23</ref> It is so large and important a constituent of the Persian currency—so much more important than the royal shekels—that it seems mere
               legalism to insist that these powerful subordinates could strike only by grace of the <name type="pname">Great King</name>. <name type="place"
                  >Babelon</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n24">24</ref> maintains that no satrap was permitted to strike <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> satrap, the power being always
               temporary and always in connection with the command of troops. But since on the previous page he has admitted that the client kings coined with
               considerable freedom and by no means always in connection with the business of their overlord, and since there is no way of relating each
               satrapal issue to a military event, and no explanation of the fact that this military money was issued in the name of the satrap and not of the
               king, we may believe that the restriction was perhaps a theoretical but not a practical one, and that the problem of silver coinage was generally
               left to the satrap's judgment. That is not the case with <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, however. In <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> the coining of silver was a government monopoly, and when the name of a subordinate
               appears on a coin struck for <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> there is an exceptional reason for it.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n25">25</ref> Initials were sometimes permitted to a governor as to a mint official, but in general the empire of <name

            <p>Our author does not discuss the relations of royal currency with that of a city state lying within the royal dominion, yet that situation was a
               common one in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> under Persian kings and <name type="place">Macedonian</name>
               kings as well. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_51784706">Daniel Schlumberger</name> has recently shown<ref target="#CH2-n26">26</ref> that,
               while the Persian king's gold was a monopoly, his silver was only one of several kinds that circulated in his own land. <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> came into no vacuum of currency when he brought his money <pb n="41"/> to <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>. Schlumberger's statement of his purpose is very good.<ref target="#CH2-n27">27</ref> "What <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> intended to do is clear. He intended to give to an empire that did not have it
               a silver coinage universally acceptable as money and, in so doing, to extend the use of silver money as such (and not as bullion) to the entire
               territory of that empire." The intention was never entirely carried out, partly, of course, because of the shortness of his life, but, aside from
               that, it is not likely that the plan itself was ever so complete as to contemplate the retirement of the great variety of silver that was already
               in use. Whatever the theory, the fact was that there was a supplementary coinage from the cities<ref target="#CH2-n28">28</ref> which somewhat
               complicated the <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica's</hi> simple conception of the king as the only supplier of money.</p>
            <p>But the king had to decide, as the text says, what kind of money should be made and when, and whether the coins should be of greater or less
               value. The author realized that the king would not be fulfilling his proper duty if he merely directed that all bullion should forthwith be
               converted into coin, leaving the details to the master of the mint. What was the nature of his decision and by what considerations was it
               affected? <name type="place">Van Groningen</name> argues that it was the king's business to see that the official ratio of gold to silver was
                  maintained.<ref target="#CH2-n29">29</ref> He must therefore issue sufficient quantity of each to keep the values from fluctuating. The editor
               surprisingly argues on the assumption that it is the Persian king who is under consideration, who struck only darics of 8.336 grams or sigloi of
               5.56 grams. If his date for the work be accepted (between 325 and 305) there was no Persian king at the time it was written. Moreover his
               hypothesis, which in any case credits the monarch with an unlikely degree of economic sagacity, is less plausible for the Persian king than for a
               Hellenistic one. The Persian king could doubtless dictate how much gold should be minted, but he could neither dictate nor foresee how much
               silver was to go into circulation, for the major part of the silver was provided by the cities.<ref target="#CH2-n30">30</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> was in far better position to control the money market than any king of <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>. Nevertheless, <pb n="42"/> whether he was much or little concerned with preserving the
               ratio between metals, the king must decide how much gold must be coined and how much silver, and in what denominations.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Philip</name> had used the mints of Pella and <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> for gold and silver; perhaps also that of
                  <name type="place">Philippi</name> for bronze.<ref target="#CH2-n31">31</ref>
               <name type="pname">Müller</name> believed that his coins came from a large number of other towns as well. Some of his identifications have been
               proved wrong; other have to do with the posthumous tetradrachms and staters; it may be that other mints of <name type="pname">Philip</name> will
               eventually be confirmed, but certainly none to compare with the two great <name type="place">Macedonian</name> cities and, on the basis of our
               present information, we can only safely assume that at <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> accession he found Pella and <name type="place"
                  >Amphipolis</name> in operation for the precious metals. His decision in regard to them will have been very simple. With the exchequer low he
               undoubtedly required new coin as fast as he could get it. What proportions of the various denominations he needed we cannot say.</p>
            <p>His sources of supply were well placed for his first needs: in the spring of 335 he embarked on the northern expedition, which is described in
               detail in Arrian I. I. 4-6. 11, which occupied him until the Theban revolt brought him back to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece"
                  >Greece</name> in the fall of that year. His purpose was to discipline the barbarians on the periphery of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> who showed signs of restlessness at the news of <name type="pname">Philip's</name> death. He
               marched from <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> to the Ister, crossed it and beat the Getae in battle, then turned westward against the Agriani
               and Paeones and thence south to Pelium in Illyria where he broke up a serious rebellion. It was there that he heard of the situation at Thebes in
               consequence of which he returned to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> with all speed. His work in the north seems to
               have been thoroughly done, in spite of the interruption, for the barbarians gave him no further trouble, even after he had crossed to <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>. There is no mention of the acquisition of territory, the founding of cities or the
               establishment of garrisons. It is very unlikely that the expedition resulted in the opening of new mints, immediately or later. To be sure, <name
                  type="pname">Müller</name> assigns certain issues to a mint of Pelagonia (nos. 205-215) but some of these have been identified as coming from
                  <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>, others from <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, and it is now clear that this territory was supplied with
               silver by the mint of Damastion which operated until 325 B.C., to be continued by the latest coins of Pelagia and the kings of Paeonia down to
               the Gallic invasions of 280.<ref target="#CH2-n32">32</ref>
            </p>
            <p>How was the campaign financed? Partly by plunder. On two occasions Arrian speaks of booty;<ref target="#CH2-n33">33</ref> the first after <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> victory over the Thracians when he sent it to the cities on the coast in charge of Lysanias and Philotas; <pb
                  n="43"/> the second when that from the conquered Getae was taken back (presumably again to the coast cities) by <name type="pname">Meleager
                  and Philip</name>. The only way we have of forming any idea of what it would amount to is to realize that <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> would not in each case have detached two officers for escort duty unless the prize were of
               considerable value.<ref target="#CH2-n34">34</ref> Cohen indeed ingeniously calculates the amount by supposing that it is the difference between

               The expedition may have paid for itself. It is probable that if he did borrow an extra 800 talents that would have been in preparation for the

               Abydus itself which issued coins weighing 2.55-3.30 grams as well as a few of larger and smaller denomination. Since the names of 28 magistrates

            <pb n="46"/>
            <p>I am not sure that the valiant effort of numismatists to give a name to every standard that they find has contributed as much light as they have
               evidently intended. The theoretical weight of the Persic tetrobol is given by <name type="pname">Hill</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n45">45</ref> as 3.73-3.74 grams. The difference from the Abydus type is considerable, and the title does not help to explain
               why the lighter coins were used at Abydus. It certainly cannot have been because the Persian is of the same weight as the "Persic drachm." For
               one thing, the sigloi were by no means of outstanding importance in the currency of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia
                  Minor</name>; for another, if she had wanted to connect her currency to the sigloi Abydus would have struck "Persic drachms" which she did
               not. She struck <hi rend="sup">2</hi>/<hi rend="sub">3</hi> drachmas which was surely inventing unnecessary trouble if there was anything
               "Persic" in her intent. The conspicuous thing about the coins of Abydus is that they are not easily related to any adjacent currency of
               importance unless that of Mytilene can be considered adjacent. Mytilene also struck "Persic" weights, though with a larger proportion of
               didrachms and fewer tetrobols. Otherwise Abydus was isolated.<ref target="#CH2-n46">46</ref> The neighboring town of Lampsacus struck still
               smaller silver (obols, diobols and tetrobols) on what is generally supposed to be the Rhodian standard, with a theoretical drachma of 3.72-3.88
               grams.</p>
            <p>The Rhodian standard had more adherents than the Persic in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, according to the
               received opinion, but the fact is that we need a great deal more data before any safe conclusion can be reached. And even after the weighing and

                  target="#CH2-n47">47</ref> The towns issued their own small change for local use with little or no regard to the practice of their neighbors.
               When different currencies were dealt with it must have been by calculation or by convention.<ref target="#CH2-n48">48</ref> It would seem that
               here was an excellent occasion for <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> to confer the benefit of a standard
               currency on a district so broken into little monetary districts. If the opportunity occurred to him he was too busy with more immediate duties to
               act upon it. Between the spring of 334 and the spring of 333 he occupied, either peaceably or by force, a great many small towns and a number of
               cities of importance: <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sardes">Sardes</name>, <name type="place">Ephesus</name>, <name type="place"

               Side. In no case is there any sign of his using their mints to strike his own types (Map 1) <ref target="#CH2-n49">49</ref> Doubtless he made <pb
                  n="48"/> use of what local currency was available; contributions from the cities would have come to him in their own coin or from such stores
               of gold and electrum as they had accumulated. It is generally assumed that he collected the taxes that had been paid to the Persians from the
               satrapies; this is specially attested for <name type="place">Hellespont</name>ine Phrygia and the Aeolian and Ionian cities and there is nothing
               to suggest that the practice was not regularly followed.<ref target="#CH2-n50">50</ref> In the case of Priene which surrendered voluntarily there
               is explicit evidence of remission of taxes<ref target="#CH2-n51">51</ref> and in the case of Ephesus, where there had been rioting and danger of
               civil war, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> directed that they should contribute such taxes as they had paid
               to the Persians to rebuilding the temple of Artemis, which had burned down.<ref target="#CH2-n52">52</ref> Both exceptions show that he was not
               in desperate need of money. I do not know the basis of Tarn's dictum "till after Issus he was in financial straits and the taxes from the king's
               land were his only source of revenue."<ref target="#CH2-n53">53</ref> The case of Ephesus is particularly interesting because that was the one
               mint city which fell into his hands north of the Taurus which seems to have had at the time an output of large silver (in this instance Rhodian
               tetradrachms) sufficiently great to suggest it as a possible producer of tetradrachms of his own. The other cities which he controlled were
               striking small denominations or in small amounts.</p>
            <p>But when he reached <name type="place">Tarsus</name> in the spring of 333 he found a place which was altogether suitable for the establishment of
               a royal mint and this was the first to be added to those which his father had used. The early Alexandrian coinage of <name type="place"
                  >Tarsus</name> has been so thoroughly studied by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n54">54</ref> that there is no necessity <pb n="49"/> of doing more than recapitulate the essentials. <name type="place"
                  >Tarsus</name> under the Persians had become the capital of the district of <name type="place">Cilicia</name> and North <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>. It had been the residence of satraps, the latest of whom was Mazaeus, who ruled for their master but
               issued large quantities of silver coins which were not the royal sigloi but double shekels with a theoretical weight of 11.2 grams, bearing <name
                  type="place">Cilicia</name>n types and, more remarkable still, the satraps' names (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 1). There was evidently a convenient near-by supply of silver sufficient to take care of the military and administrative expenses. The
               obverse type was a seated Baal which needed but little modification to become the seated <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201"
                  >Zeus</name> of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> reverse, and the extreme similarity of the two figures produced at <name type="place"
                  >Tarsus</name> shows that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coins followed those of his predecessor immediately and employed the same
               die-sinker (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 2). Of course the size of the flan was increased since the tetradrachms were 6 grams heavier, but <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> was not noticeably larger than Baal had been. The head of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> now replaced the lion and bull and city walls of Mazaeus' reverse and thereby eliminated anything
               to identify the mint, for, like the products of Pella and <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>, these were to be imperial coins showing no
               special mark of their origin. Indeed the first issues bore not even the sign of a responsible official, or only an inconspicuous pellet between
               the seat and the cross-bars of the throne. At the same time, or shortly thereafter, a series of gold was initiated. Since the satraps had not
               struck gold and there seems to have been no easily accessible supply of the metal it may be that the staters appeared only after Issus with the
               capture of Darius' money which he had left at Damascus. Doubtless much of it was gold which could be melted down and restruck; Curtius says that
               the coined money amounted to 2600 talents.<ref target="#CH2-n55">55</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of course it would not be necessary to restrike the Persian money and we cannot prove that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"

                  >Alexander</name> had to use. <hi rend="sup">"</hi> At the time of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> invasion of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name>," he says,<ref target="#CH2-n56">56</ref> "the currency of the East consisted, in the main, of Persian
               gold darics and silver sigloi and <name type="place">Athenian</name> tetradrachms. Two of these—the gold darics and the <name type="place"
                  >Athenian</name> tetradrachms—had for the last hundred and fifty years enjoyed a world-wide circulation and were well known to <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> soldiers. It is probable, therefore, that during his campaigns, from the battle of the Granicus to the
               invasion of India, for the pay of his troops he relied principally upon the fabulous hoards of wealth which had been stored away by the Persian
               monarchs and which now fell into his hands." He assumes without discussion and, I think, mistakenly that a large part of the Persian treasure
               would have been coined money. It is questionable how far <pb n="50"/> this point of view is justified at the time with which we are now dealing.
               There is, as we shall see, evidence that he used Persian money later on, and he was willing to have earlier types continue to circulate under
               certain conditions; we have just seen that he probably was content to use the local issues of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor"
                  >Asia Minor</name> at least as supplements to his own. But there was a period of two or three years after his occupation of <name type="place"
                  >Tarsus</name> notable for the opening of new mints to produce his money. Between the summer of 333 and 330 fall the first issues of <name

               <ref target="#CH2-n65">65</ref> (Map 2). It seems very unlikely that so remarkable a concentration should not have had as its purpose the
               wholesale replacement of the Persian royal coinage by the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> imperial.</p>
            <p>Here we come dangerously close to those discussions of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> psychology and intent which fascinate the
               participants without always convincing the observers. So far as our evidence goes, the decision what coins to strike, when and where was <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> alone, just as the pseudo-Aristotelian <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> says it should be. The anonymous
               author knows that the king cannot do everything <pb n="51"/> single-handed. He understands the functions that should be left to the satraps and
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, who retained the Persian organization just as far as he could,<ref
                  target="#CH2-n66">66</ref> had his own satraps—so called even when they were <name type="place">Macedonians</name> —and we hear a good deal
               about their powers and duties.There were special officers in charge of finance, which was the most conspicuous difference between the old
               administration and the new. Berve has pointed out that in the early days of the invasion the central royal treasury and the war treasury were
                  one<ref target="#CH2-n67">67</ref> and the finance officers were imperial and not local officials. On the most prominent of them, Harpalus, we
               have much information from excellent sources, which Berve has fully recorded,<ref target="#CH2-n68">68</ref> but nowhere is there the slightest
               indication that his powers and responsibilities extended to the mint. It is difficult for us to imagine that <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> should direct so detailed an operation, especially when it had to be done from a distance,
               and obviously someone must have supplied him with the information on which the decisions were based. But the modern system of delegation of
               duties did not present itself to antiquity as self-evidently the best way of dealing with complicated affairs.<ref target="#CH2-n69">69</ref>
               Pliny's correspondence with Trajan shows what surprisingly minor details could be properly brought to the attention of the sovereign, and the

                  target="#CH2-n70">70</ref> If, then, we conclude that arrangements for minting were <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own business (as we

            <pb n="52"/>
            <p>Of course there is no need to prove that he had to have money; the central question is why did he have to have money with his own types? <name

               as soon as possible, of a coinage belonging to a fast vanishing dynasty and empire." Was this replacement to be effected by having all the new
               money Alexandrine while the old issues wore out or were melted down or buried by private owners? Or was the old currency called in by the
               government and melted down to be reissued as the new money? There is evidence of the latter procedure at an earlier period. The satraps
               Pharnabazus and Datames seem to have melted down the silver of their predecessor Tiribazus to issue their own coins.<ref target="#CH2-n72"
                  >72</ref> There is no way of telling certainly whether <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> did the same thing
               but in any case the new money was to be his. In the cases of <name type="place">Tarsus</name> and Myriandrus, the metropoleis of <name
                  type="place">Cilicia</name> and North <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, this meant putting an end to issues in the

               supplemented, in the case of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, by gold also. This needs no elaborate explanation. Whether or not the Persian
               empire was "fast vanishing" its control over this district was at an end.</p>
            <p>But not all the cases were as simple as this. Perhaps the next mint to begin operations for the conqueror was Aradus which was ruled by a king
               named Gerostratus whose son Straton met <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> on his march south along the <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>n coast and surrendered the city to him.<ref target="#CH2-n73">73</ref> Now Aradus had its
               own coinage whose types were purely local and had nothing to do with the Persians. The fleet of Gerostratus formed a contingent of the <name

               service being rewarded by the continuance of the right of coinage. But Aradus at once began to strike tedradrachms with the head of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> and seated <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name>, like those of
                  <name type="place">Tarsus</name> and Myriandrus with one notable difference: their origin is clearly marked, first by the Aramaic letters used

               having delivered the city and joined <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> fleet, as did the king of Aradus, was rewarded—if it was a reward—by
               having the first two letters of his name <graphic url="NS11_sym9.jpg"/> used on the tetradrachms instead of the name of the city, and the later
               issues bear the monogram <graphic url="NS11_sym10.jpg"/> for his successor Adramelek. Now these three cities all had coinages of their own and
               there was nothing to prevent <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> from allowing them to continue now that they
               were his allies, as he had apparently done with the coinages north of the Taurus. To be sure, the double shekels of Mazaeus from <name

            <p>Similar treatment was accorded to the kings of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>. They had not been as prompt to
               surrender as the mainlanders, but they joined him with their fleets at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> and he was
               willing to forgive their previous service to the Persians as presumably enforced.<ref target="#CH2-n79">79</ref> They also joined the producers

                  type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> uses what seems to me strange language. On the mainland, he says, "every city which
               had thrown open its gates without a struggle to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> was accorded local autonomy,
               and, where a mint had previously existed, was allowed to continue coining; with the proviso, however, that the issues should henceforth conform
               in types, weights, and denominations with the regular coinage of the empire. As a result, such cities as Aradus, Byblus, <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> and <name type="place">Ake</name> coined as they never had before, even in their most prosperous
               days.—It would therefore be strange if, in return for their submission and the invaluable services of their fleets, <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> should have deprived the kings of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus">Cyprus</name>
               of the immemorial right of coinage, or even have curtailed it in any vital way."<ref target="#CH2-n81">81</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s mind at the moment was on identification and not explanation or he could hardly
               have written in that way. Can there be any more vital curtailment imagined of the right of coinage of the <pb n="54"/> king of Citium than that
               he should have to discontinue his own currency to produce silver with alien types and the name <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> on which only the monogram of his city suggested that he had anything to do with the
                  affair?<ref target="#CH2-n82">82</ref> Is it not obvious that the Cypriote kings and the <name type="place">Phoenician</name> kings were not
               "allowed" to continue coining but directed to continue? We are told that "Arados, <name type="place">Byblos</name>, <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> and <name type="place">Ake</name> coined as they never had before" and this is certainly true.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n83">83</ref> Where did all the metal come from, not only the greatly increased output of silver but the gold of <name
                  type="place">Tarsus</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> and <name type="place">Ake</name>?</p>
            <p>The necessary explanation seems to me to be that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, knowing that there was a
               vitally important campaign before him, required much money—his own money—and used every available source of supply. If it be asked why he should
               now make such efforts to provide his own money when he had opened no new mints in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia
                  Minor</name>, there are likely answers at hand. For one thing the mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> was continuing to pour her
               abundant production across the straits so that her gold was replacing the gold and electrum of the other continent and her tetradrachms were
               providing a major denomination in that metal. For another, north of the Taurus <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> was to some extent among friends. Whatever the realities behind the professed purpose of freeing the Greek cities, he had
               come there as the leader of a Greek League as well as a king of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</name>; the Greek cities
               understood his position and in the majority of cases were willing to accept it. He had driven the <name type="place">Persians</name> out of the
               country and though they still had friends there, there was no prospect of their combining to make head against him. If the Greek coins of the
               cities circulated as a minor supplement to the Greek coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> it was not
               likely that any harm would come of it and no harm did. But south of the Taurus he was in alien territory. He had not come there to free anybody
               but to conquer. The Cilicians, the Syrians and the <name type="place">Phoenicians</name> had no reason for prejudice in his favor; if he was to
               be as acceptable as the king of the <name type="place">Persians</name> he must make his place. <pb n="55"/>
               <name type="place">Tarsus</name> and the cities that received him after Issus were acknowledging what they thought to be the greater power. Tyre
               and Gaza held the contrary view and were destroyed for their mistake. It was vital to him that he be recognized as the master in all parts of his
               new territory and therefore all the mints were set to work to manufacture one of the most effective kinds of manifesto known to antiquity: his
               name and types on the coins. This was done quite without regard for the normal financial needs of the district; the much increased activity of
               the coast mints did not mean a sudden era of prosperity and commercial activity. It was their contribution to the conqueror's needs, and since no
               new mines were being opened it is only reasonable to assume that the necessary extra bullion came from the melting down of the king's treasure.
               There was no overstriking involved, the weights of both gold and silver pieces in previous use being different from the weights by which they
               were supplanted. We shall therefore never have the kind of proof that comes from detecting an earlier type beneath the later ones. None the less,
               we have sufficient reason for believing that in the period succeeding the battle of Issus <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> did not intend to continue the local coinages of the district but to replace them with his own, and one probable means to
               take would be to melt down and restrike.<hi rend="sup">83a</hi> We must guard against supposing that too complete a revolution was achieved. In
               the first place, the pre-Alexandrine coins did not all disappear. In the hoard from Galilee buried about 319/8<ref target="#CH2-n84">84</ref> and
               one found at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_byblus">Byblus</name> buried about a decade later<ref target="#CH2-n85">85</ref> double shekels
               of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name> accompanied the <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
                  tetradrachms.<ref target="#CH2-n86">86</ref> Later events showed that there was still a place for the earlier series (below, p. 78). Then,
                  <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> production south of the Taurus by no means made the country independent of coins from the north. In the
                  <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard there were 1582 pieces from the mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>, 1526 from the mints of
                  <name type="place">Tarsus, Myriandrus</name>, the cities of <name type="place">Cyprus, Aradus, Byblus, Sidon</name> and <name type="place"
                  >Ake</name> all combined. And the situation is even more impressive than this appears for a much higher proportion of the coins of <name
                  type="place">Amphipolis</name> were struck during <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> lifetime than is the case with the southern mints.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n87">87</ref> Before Gaugamela, then, there would probably have been more <name type="place">Macedonian</name>

               <pb n="56"/> to be seen in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> than Syrian and Cilician ones. This must have been the result
               not of choice but of the much greater productivity of the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> mines. Obviously <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> would prefer to strike coins as close as possible to the place where they were to be
               used.</p>
            <p>There is nothing surprising therefore in the fact that as he controlled more of the East he should open a mint at Damascus.<ref target="#CH2-n88"
                  >88</ref> In writing to <name type="pname">Hill</name> about the possibility of assigning to that mint some of the gold which he had
               previously given to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sidon">Sidon</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>
               speaks of it as "probably struck after Gaugamela." In <hi rend="italic">
                  <name type="place">Demanhur</name>,</hi> however, he dates the first series of silver <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 332-330; that is he
               believed that the mint was organized soon after the capture of the city by <name type="pname">Parmenio</name> following the victory of Issus.
               That would mean that <name type="pname">Parmenio's</name> action was not a mere raid to get the king's baggage, but an occupation of a vital
               point protecting <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> flank and broadening his territory, as did the campaign in Antilebanon during the siege of
               Tyre. This is likely enough in itself, though no ancient author discusses it. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> was
               a new step since it had never had a mint;<ref target="#CH2-n89">89</ref> doubtless artisans were brought there from the coast. The complicated
               marks with pellets, which are hard to reduce to a system, may be evidence of a factory not yet well organized. The mint is clearly marked with
               the letters ΔΑ, to which later series add the city's device of the forepart of a ram. It is not easy to find a consistent policy in the use or
               omission of mint marks. Apparently the greatest mints: <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_pella_macedon">Pella</name>, <name type="place"
                  >Amphipolis</name>, <name type="place">Tarsus</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> and <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name> dispense with them, but by no means all the lesser ones invariably use them and <name
                  type="pname">Newell's</name> feeling that the difference was between imperial and local issues is hard to support. Here, as so often in
               ancient numismatics, one finds a general conformity without absolute uniformity which is distressing to what one likes to think of as the tidier
               minds of our day.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> would seem an obvious place for the minting of <name type="place">Persian</name>
               coins and indeed <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> says it "had probably possessed a mint under the <name
                  type="place">Persian</name> kings,"<ref target="#CH2-n90">90</ref> but there is no proof of it. <name type="place">Babelon's</name> great work
                  <hi rend="italic">Les Perses achéménides</hi> does not raise the question at all and <name type="pname">Hill</name>, after discussing the
               difficulties of chronological arrangement, adds,<ref target="#CH2-n91">91</ref> "Nor does it seem possible to make any attempt to identify the
               mints at which coins were struck until the very difficult problem of the mints of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> coinage in the East has
               been more or less cleared up." So we do not know whether this is a case of adaptation, like <name type="place">Tarsus</name> or, of original
               creation, like <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>. In either case the city which was intended to be the capital of
               the whole empire began to contribute its share <pb n="57"/> of the conqueror's money, presumably as soon as possible after its surrender. The
               coins were long in being recognized precisely because there was no recognizable mint mark. An article of Six in 1884 pointed the way,<ref
                  target="#CH2-n92">92</ref> to be followed by a thorough demonstration by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name>
               eleven years later.<ref target="#CH2-n93">93</ref> The attribution was indignantly rejected by Sir <name type="pname">Henry Howorth</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n94">94</ref> and many who did not rush into print must have shared his dismay in the shaking of the system of mint
               identification which <name type="pname">Müller</name> had so conveniently constructed, but the evidence was against <name type="place"
                  >Howorth</name> and no one doubts any more. His insistence that a symbol or monogram should have reference to the place of minting was in the
               old tradition and was mistaken, and yet his dissatisfaction was not without reason, for the matter was more complex than the location of a new
               place of origin for the gold and silver with <name type="place">Macedonian</name> types. The fact is that the great victory at Gaugamela opened a
               new epoch whose nature is partly expressed in unprecedented developments of the coinage.</p>
            <p>The first step was not revolutionary and it may, indeed, have preceded the occupation of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon"
                  >Babylon</name>. It was the opening of a new mint in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> at Sardes (Map 1).<ref
                  target="#CH2-n95">95</ref> There is doubtful evidence that the city may have coined for the <name type="place">Persians</name>,<ref
                  target="#CH2-n96">96</ref> but it was not issuing any local types. There is no reason why it should not have been used by <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> at any moment after its capture in 334 but, as we have seen, there was at that time no
               attempt to supplement the emission of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> for use in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name>.
               Why the situation should have changed by 331 we cannot say, but there is one important difference between the function of Sardes and that of the
               earlier <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name>tic mints. She was used not so much for tetradrachms, which had been the
               principal product of the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> and southern cities, as for gold and drachmae. In this she was a pattern for the
               other towns of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> presently to be put into operation: <name type="place"
                  >Magnesia</name> (330), Lampsacus (329), Abydus, Colophon and <name type="place">Miletus</name> (325), <name type="place">Teos</name> (324). A
               reason for this which comes to mind at once is that the pre-Alexandrine coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia
                  Minor</name> had been to a large extent gold, or electrum, and small silver. <pb n="58"/> Presumably, therefore, the country liked and would
               use small silver. But there would be an advantage in having all the small silver on a single standard, and this may have been a belated provision
               of uniformity in place of the pre-existing confusion.<ref target="#CH2-n97">97</ref> Presumably the gold was intended to fill the void caused by
               the disappearance of the gold of Lampsacus and the electrum of <name type="place">Cyzicus</name>, <name type="place">Phocaea and Mytilene</name>,
               and the metal which used to go into those types was now diverted to the seven towns to be made into <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> staters (above p. 45). There can be no doubt that there was a plan for the special use of
               these towns, but again we find a very general plan with unexplained eccentricities of the individual mints such as might have resulted from
               decisions made by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> one at a time but such as could hardly have resulted from
               any laying out of the plan in detail at the beginning. It is quite out of the question, however, that this pattern can have been achieved by
               accident through the independent action of the cities themselves, or that they should have acted in concert without reference to the sovereign
               whose types they proposed to strike. An eighth city, Ephesus, was added to the group later—probably after 294—and a few other places made minor
               contributions of drachmae in the 3rd century. The omission of Ephesus from the original list was doubtless the result of the confusion at the
               time of her capture which may have crippled her for some time to come.<ref target="#CH2-n98">98</ref> Not only was the supply of drachmae
               adequate for <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> lifetime but, the fashion having once been set, the mints of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> continued to be the source of most of the drachmae throughout the empire into the latter half
               of the 3rd century. What was the proportionate manufacture of gold we do not yet know enough to say.<ref target="#CH2-n99">99</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A second innovation was more radical. It was the opening of a mint at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</name> for
               tetradrachms, staters, and a surprising number of distaters (Map 1).<ref target="#CH2-n100">100</ref> There is good reason to believe that it
               began operations in 330/29. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> said "about 330 <hi rend="smallcaps">

               </hi>—and certainly by 325—a large issue of staters and tetradrachms bearing <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               types was instituted at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</name>."<ref target="#CH2-n101">101</ref> Noe does not debate the

                  <hi rend="bold">B.C</hi>
               </hi>." as the limits of Group I. The lower limit is provided by the burial date of the <name type="place">Demanhur</name> Hoard in which
               specimens of all the varieties of tetradrachms were found. But the group cannot have lasted so long. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicyon"
                  >Sicyon</name> was allied with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> against <name type="pname">Antipater</name> in the
               Lamian War of 323/2 and cannot at that time have been striking royal <name type="place">Macedonian</name>
               <pb n="59"/> types.<ref target="#CH2-n102">102</ref> The last issue may have been coined in 323 before the beginning of the war but that is the
               latest possible date. Now there is evidence of 8 issues<ref target="#CH2-n103">103</ref> if one makes the usual assumption that each variety of
               symbol means the product of a single year. That would bring the beginning to 330/29, which would satisfy historical probability very well. For
               the purpose of the establishment of the mint is clear: it was to assist in the hiring of Peloponnesian mercenaries. In the fall of 334, between
               the beginning of the siege of <name type="place">Halicarnassus</name> and the campaign in <name type="place">Lycia</name>, <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> had sent Cleander to the <name type="place">Peloponnesus</name> to collect soldiers.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n104">104</ref> In his mention of the matter Curtius says "Cleandro cum pecunia misso." The nearest <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>an supply of money would be <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> and it was
               better to send the necessary funds with Cleander. But if there had to be a shipment of coin from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6255147"
                  >Asia</name> whenever Greek mercenaries were to be hired the system would be inconvenient. It would be much simpler if there were a mint
               nearby where money could be issued as it was needed. That should have been apparent as early as Cleander's first trip. But would not the opening
               of a royal mint in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> be a serious affront to the spirit, if not to the letter, of the
               agreement with the League of <name type="place">Corinth</name>? We have no information as to <pb n="60"/> any provision about coining by members
               of the League, but there is no evidence that there was any interference with that ancient right of the cities. The large series of <name

                  >Alexander</name> he surrendered <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> without resistance. <name type="pname"
                  >Curtius</name> (V. 1. 17) makes it clear that the act was a very convenient one for <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name>. "Gratus adventus eius regi fuit; quippe magni operis obsidio futura erat tarn munitae urbis." He took the precaution of
               marching his army in formation but it was unnecessary; the Babylonians made him welcome. Perhaps the town had been indefensible in spite of what
                  <name type="pname">Curtius</name> says, perhaps it was clear to Mazaeus that his king could never make another stand. Yet it is hard to avoid
               the suspicion that the surrender had been bargained for and that there was a price involved. The suspicion is deepened when we find that Mazaeus
               was promptly appointed Satrap of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>—the first Persian to be given such a position. To
                  Tarn<ref target="#CH2-n118">118</ref> this is an act of chivalry like the later treatment of Porus: "<name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> was honoring a worthy opponent." But it is surely an extravagant gesture to put so great and
               rich a district into the hands of an enemy simply because he had been "a worthy opponent." To be sure, the compliment was not without safeguards.
                  <name type="pname">Apollo-dorus</name> of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> was made commander of the troops left with Mazaeus and <pb
                  n="62"/> Asclepiodorus was made collector of the taxes.<ref target="#CH2-n119">119</ref> There was a further unique aspect of the new satrap's
               position, however. He at once began to issue silver tetradrachms of the Attic standard (generally spoken of as staters) on one side of which was
               Baaltars, as the inscription showed, and on the other, a lion with the name of Mazaeus! (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 3).<ref

            </p>
            <p>It is this which most deeply shocked <name type="place">Howorth</name>. "Prima facie" he says, "it seems incredible that <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> should have permitted one of his satraps, and that a <name type="place">Persian</name>...to
               issue coins in the satrap's own name." The Cilician Baal would be inappropriate to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>,
               and the Aramaic inscriptions would be unintelligible to the Greeks, the only people who would use the coins.<ref target="#CH2-n121">121</ref>
               <name type="place">Howorth</name> was defending a doomed thesis, but more attention should have been paid to the facts against which he
               protested. Attempts to explain this unprecedented concession have been far from convincing. Six, who was the first to face the problem, could
               only urge that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, about to set out for the Far East "ne s'est pas,
               certainment, occupé des types ou des légends de monnaies destinées aux populations indigènes." But the idea that this was a trifle too slight to
               engage <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> attention is certainly untenable. At the very time that the lion staters were beginning to appear
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> joined the great cities of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> earlier conquest
               to produce his own types.<ref target="#CH2-n122">122</ref> He could have attended to one series if he could provide for the other. Some special
               reason must be found for this striking exception to the regular rule that satraps could not coin in their own names. Most of the historians, if
               they record the fact at all, do so without comment. Tarn<ref target="#CH2-n123">123</ref> and <name type="pname">Cohen</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n124">124</ref> avoid the central point: "he was the only satrap permitted to coin, doubtless for the convenience of the <name

               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name> gave the most thorough-going attempt at an explanation. "<name type="pname"

               their inscriptions, which records his own name and that of the god represented, the latter being intended to promulgate the figure of Baaltars
               still little known in the far east, i.e., the figure of that particular Baal of all the countless Baalim who had to be identified with the Greek
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> of contemporary imperial issues. Before the end of his short term of office
               (330-328) the satrap <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> appears to have been induced to give up these inscriptions, and from this date on until
               306 the satrapal coins remain anepigraphic" (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 4). As to the types, <name type="pname">Hill</name> has an important amendment to offer.<ref target="#CH2-n126">126</ref> "The
               argument of most weight against the attribution to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> lies in the fact that the coins
               with the name of Mazeus attributed to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> identify the god on the obverse as Baaltars,
               who would be unknown and unworshipped at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. The answer to this objection is that,
               although issued at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, this was a satrapal coinage intended chiefly for the payment of
               troops, many of whom may have been raised in <name type="place">Cilicia</name> by <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> and brought by him to the
               East." This does indeed propose a reason for the selection of types. But can it have been necessary to maintain a separate coinage for the
               convenience of a body of mercenaries? And if they demanded western types, why the lion alone (which was the type of <name type="place"
                  >Myriandrus</name>) instead of the familiar lion and bull or lion and deer of <name type="place">Tarsus</name>? And would it not be important
               to give them the double shekels to which they were accustomed instead of tetradrachms on the Attic standard used by the conqueror? <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> desire to conciliate the Orientals of which <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name>
               speaks is indeed a most important consideration. But surely it is characteristic of his policy from this point on and not of that which guided
               him before Gaugamela. Why otherwise the replacement of local issues by his own types? When all is said there is as yet no explanation of the
               satrap's name on the silver of his new office. But how much is explained by the hypothesis that the price of the bloodless surrender of <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> was the confirming to <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> of his title and privileges !
               When <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name> speaks of the "usual practice" of inscriptions accompanying the types he
               means, of course, the practice of the Persian satraps in <name type="place">Cilicia</name>. If <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> was allowed to
               continue that, then his position as Satrap of <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia under <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> would be equivalent to his position as Satrap of <name type="place">Cilicia</name> under Darius. But, whatever were his
               rights in the matter of coining in his earlier office, it is not likely that he now arrogated to himself that power of decision which the <hi
                  rend="italic">Oeconomica</hi> restricts to the sovereign. The appointment of Asclepiodorus as collector of taxes shows that <name type="pname"
                  >Mazaeus</name>' <pb n="64"/> function was not financial and we may be very sure that the number and kinds of coins to be struck were decided
               by higher authority than his. The phrase "the Satrap <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> appears to have been induced to give up these
               inscriptions" calls up an amusing picture of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> persuading and <name
                  type="pname">Mazaeus</name> magnanimously consenting.<ref target="#CH2-n127">127</ref> If the special privilege was ended before the satrap's
               death in 328 it is hardly likely to have been done in so courtly a fashion. The reason for suggesting it is that there are anepigraphic lion
               staters which seem to come so early in the series that <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_25371655">Imhoof-Blumer</name> would assign them to the
               first satrap. But that is not proven. The staters with <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>' name are very rare but <name type="place"
                  >Babelon</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n128">128</ref> publishes four varieties: with no symbol, with a wreath, with a serpent, with K. If they follow the normal
               Greek practice of a different symbol every year all the years of <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>' satrapy would be accounted for.</p>
            <p>Whatever the intent behind the origin of the lion staters, and their divisions, they did serve an economic function for they continued to be
               issued from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> into, and perhaps through, the reign of <name type="pname"
                  >Seleucus</name> I and, in lesser numbers, from Susa<ref target="#CH2-n129">129</ref> and Ecbatana<ref target="#CH2-n130">130</ref> in the
               same reign. This is not easy to account for. They were by then so much under weight for Attic tetradrachms that they must have been at a
               disadvantage compared with the full weight coins of Alexandrine type being struck at the same time. Yet, if this were intended for the
               convenience of a population accustomed to the use of sigloi, the fractions would have been made to fit the Persian system, which they do not.
               (Parenthetically it must be pointed out that we are by no means sure that the inhabitants of <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia did have any
               preference for sigloi).<ref target="#CH2-n131">131</ref> One is tempted to think of coins only locally valid where a discrepancy between face
               value and bullion value could be ignored by the sovereign, and <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n132">132</ref> has very tentatively suggested a connection between the lion staters and the temple of Bel. He recognizes the
               difficulty created by the lion issues of Susa and Ecbatana and can only hazard a guess that "if the temple at <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> could issue "temple money' so too, presumably, could the hardly less important and famous temples of
               Artemis-Nanaia at Susa and of Aene at Ecbatana." He cites the interesting <pb n="65"/> correspondence in fabric between the lion staters and the
               much later <name type="pname">Jewish</name> shekels of the First Revolt—also temple money. Though I have nothing better to suggest, I cannot
               believe that <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>'s hypothesis is defensible. It is true that <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> made his offerings to Bel-Marduk and directed the reconstruction of his temple<ref
                  target="#CH2-n133">133</ref> but there cannot have been any intended connection between that act and the first lion staters on which the god
               is specifically named not <name type="pname">Marduk</name> but Baaltars. One must suppose either that the <name type="place">Babylonian</name>s
               could not read the inscription (which is likely enough) or that the correspondence was not thought of until the appearance of the anepigraphic
               staters. It is true that Baaltars and <name type="pname">Marduk</name> were of sufficiently similar nature so that the seated god could be taken
               for either one of them. But that is patently not true of Artemis-Nanaia of Susa or Aene-Anaitis-Nanea of Ecbatana. And if the basis of the lion
               staters' success had been real religious association it is surprising that it should have disappeared so quickly. Only in <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> can they have possibly lasted beyond the reign of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I and there
               only until 275 at the latest, when Antiochus moved the inhabitants to Seleucia.<ref target="#CH2-n134">134</ref> The theory of a limited
               circulation is further complicated by their appearance in the <name type="pname">Oxus Hoard</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n135">135</ref> I cannot
               solve the enigma but, at the moment, the point of importance is that the length of life of the experimental currency was enough to make it plain
               that it was acceptable to the community and it is only fair to suppose that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               and <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> had reasonable grounds for supposing that it would be acceptable.</p>

               <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> is not the only satrap to turn up on coins in <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia, but the second instance has
               to do with a very different class of coins: the imitation of <name type="place">Athenian</name> owls. At the end of the 5th century it could be
               said that the owls of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name> were the international currency par excellence, and even down to
                  <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time they held their place as one of the principal elements of the currency of the East, though now they
               were joined by satrapal silver and that of the cities of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>n coast.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n136">136</ref> The appearance of these latter issues begins at the time of the <name type="place">Peloponnesian</name> war when
               the supply of owls was much reduced and they are accompanied by a growing number of imitations of <name type="place">Athenian</name> coins. Early
               hoards, such as those of Caboul and Malayer published by Schlumberger, show a surprising number of 5th century owls, about equal to the coins of

                  >Babylon</name>ia is purely numismatic, as to which <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> says, "Our coins do suggest
               that <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> had entrusted to Mazaces the governorship of some important city or
               district as a reward for his ready surrender of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>." His owls then would be an exact
               parallel to <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>' lion staters except that we do not know what position Mazaces could have held which would entitle
               him to this distinction. Nor do we know the location of the mint. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> gives good
               reasons for not putting it at <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, yet he can only suggest Uruk or Opis, neither of
               which has any special claim to consideration. Yet if there are many things puzzling about these coins their purpose is more evident than that of
                  <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name>' issues. They can hardly have been intended primarily for use in <name type="pname">Babylon</name>ia, even
               though they turn up there. The imperial mint was producing <name type="place">Macedonian</name> tetradrachms and lion staters as well, and that
               surely ought to have satisfied the demand. But if one wanted to mint silver for general circulation in the East imitation owls would be the
               obvious thing to strike. Of course, this cannot have been a private venture of Mazaces. It must have been part of a plan that had imperial
               approval and prima facie the plan was to supply familiar types for use in the East.</p>
            <p>But these two classes of silver were not the only innovation connected with the capture of <name type="pname">Babylonia</name>. "Demanding
               explanation also" says <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>, "is the fact that for many years double and (more rarely)
               single gold darics of Achae-minid type were coined alongside the Hon staters. These gold coins seem, almost <pb n="67"/> invariably, to turn up
               in eastern Iran and Bactria and not in <name type="pname">Babylonia</name>. But as most of the specimens of which we possess any record at all
               have come from the single great 'Treasure of the Oxus,' this seeming fact may be illusory. That both double darics and Hon staters were mostly

               nose, is a Hellenized version of the Persian monarch. The relief is higher and the incuse on the reverse, instead of being an amorphous
               depression, is filled with wavy lines or curves that tend to form a pattern (cf. <hi rend="italic">BMC <name type="place">Arabia</name>,</hi> Pl.
               XX, 1-13). Moreover, most of the specimens have Greek letters or monograms on the obverse. There are no double darics which do not have some or
               all of these characteristics and none, therefore, which can be assigned to an earlier period. That is, this higher denomination is an invention
               of the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>. What is the unit to which it belongs—the rarer single gold
               daric? There are few darics with letters or monograms like those of the doubles<ref target="#CH2-n145">145</ref> and none with quite the same
               wavy patterns on the reverse. There are, however, some which show a similar pattern and which also have high relief and a Hellenized portrait <hi
                  rend="italic">(BMC <name type="place">Arabia</name>,</hi> Pl. XXV, 21-25). As to these, <name type="pname">Hill</name> is cautious. He calls
               attention to the likeness of the two denominations, but catalogues the darics with the <name type="place">Persian</name> Empire instead of with
               the Alexandrine Empire of the East. They must, he says "belong to the last <name type="place">Persian</name> king, <name type="pname"

               sigloi like them. Only one is illustrated (Pl. XXV, 26) but it certainly shows a portrait unlike the earlier sigloi. Hill's arrangement would
               mean that under <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q102865">Darius III</name> there was a marked artistic change in the coins issued at <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> affecting both darics and sigloi, and that <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> used and developed the new style in the same city for the making of a denomination of his
               own, the double daric, though he did not strike either single darics or sigloi. The sudden appearance of a Greek profile on coins of <name

               different mint, which would explain their differences from the double darics.</p>
            <p>That these are indeed from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> is the general persuasion, but it can hardly be called

               that of which he says "The following are for the most part of ruder workmanship, and were perhaps made farther East than <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>." The idea that all these strange issues were the product of <name type="pname">Mazaeus</name> is
                  tempting<ref target="#CH2-n147">147</ref> but it will need more facts to make it a certainty.</p>
            <p>If there is general agreement on the fact of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> striking the double darics there is very little said about the
               reason for it. Unlike the lion staters these from beginning to end are on a different standard from the Attic and there must have been a
               particular reason for the premeditated confusion of two gold coins one of which was not quite twice the weight of the other. It seems inescapable
               that the invention of the double daric rests on the intention to use the daric, and perhaps the darics which <name type="pname">Hill</name>
               assigns to Darius III are actually the units of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>. But there were others
               available. Diodorus says that the capture of Susa brought in 40,000 talents of uncoined gold and silver and 9,000 talents of darics; that of
               Persepolis, 120,000 talents reckoning the gold at its value in silver.<ref target="#CH2-n148">148</ref> We have seen reason to believe that the

               There is no activity in local mints. Indeed, it is a fact of the greatest importance that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no mint for <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> coins in the East except <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon"
                  >Babylon</name>. The map will show the surprising lack of proportion which multiplies the western mints and leaves nothing but <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> to supply the funds for the long and costly campaign east of the two rivers (Map 3).
               The army cannot have been without coin. Even though they were going into country where an economy of barter may have prevailed widely, the Greek
               and <name type="place">Macedonian</name> soldiery cannot have been induced to forego their accustomed pay from the summer of 330 to that of 325.
               Yet the record, which contains two mutinies, has no suggestion of the kind of difficulty about pay so common with ancient armies. The
               cancellation of debts which followed the marriages at Susa<ref target="#CH2-n149">149</ref> was, to be sure, a phenomenon of the return to
               familiar civilization, but how did the army incur debts of 20,000 talents if they had been operating on payments in kind? The reorganization
               which provided for "ten stater men" between the ordinary soldiers and the "double pay men" is reported<ref target="#CH2-n150">150</ref> without
               any intimation that pay was being reintroduced. If <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> had founded his eastern
               cities (particularly the military colonies)<ref target="#CH2-n151">151</ref> without money could the Greek historians possibly have avoided
               comment on it? There is no escape from the fact that the army must have had money in the East and the necessary conclusion seems to be that it
               was transported from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, the nearest source. But that surely presents an enormous
               problem of transport. The system of the Seleucids is enlightening. They had mints certainly at Susa, Persepolis, Ecbatana and Bactra, with
               another which may have been at Hecatompylus or Artacoana, and the contents of the <name type="pname">Oxus Hoard</name> show that the mint of
               Bactra supplied the needs of that district as it was intended to do.<ref target="#CH2-n152">152</ref> Why should <name type="pname"

            <p>But did he? It is instructive to look at what happened to the treasure from <name type="place">Susa</name> and <name type="place"
                  >Persepolis</name>. The bulk of it was so great that <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name> says<ref target="#CH2-n153"
                  >153</ref> it required 10,000 pairs of mules and 5,000 camels to move it. <name type="pname">Curtius</name> says<ref target="#CH2-n154"
                  >154</ref> that the baggage and a large part of the army was left at <name type="place">Persepolis</name> in charge of <name type="pname"
                  >Parmenio</name> and Craterus. But it was not to stay there. We know from Arrian<ref target="#CH2-n155">155</ref> that <name type="pname"
                  >Parmenio</name> was ordered to take the treasure to the citadel in Ecbatana and deliver it to Harpalus who had a guard of 6,000 <name
                  type="place">Macedonians</name> plus a few auxiliary troops. The mention of Harpalus is puzzling. We do not know how or when he got to
               Ecbatana or why or when he left to return to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. Moreover, in the next section Arrian
               tells us that Cleitus, who had been left sick in <name type="place">Susa</name>, was ordered to proceed to <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>,
               take the <name type="place">Macedonian</name> guard of the treasure and march against the Parthyaeans. Then who was left to guard the treasure?
               Something has certainly dropped out of the account. Fortunately we know the main fact. At the time of <name type="pname">Parmenio</name>'s
               execution in the fall of 330 he was Satrap of Media and guardian of the king's treasure whose total Diodorus gives as 180,000 talents;<ref
                  target="#CH2-n156">156</ref>
               <name type="pname">Justin</name> says 190,000.<ref target="#CH2-n157">157</ref> Clearly this was <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> capital
               for the financing of the campaign in <name type="place">Afghanistan</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>. But it
               was not taken to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> at all. Now it has been suggested what Harpalus was doing <pb
                  n="72"/> in <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>: he was supervising the coining of the Persian treasure.<ref target="#CH2-n158">158</ref> This
               is on the theory that Harpalus, as treasurer, had control over minting, which there is nothing to support. But there is a more serious difficulty
               than the theoretical one. If Harpalus put 180,000 talents into coins what are they? In discussing the Seleucid mint of <name type="place"
                  >Ecbatana</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> says,<ref target="#CH2-n159">159</ref> 'There need be less
               surprise that a mint was opened by the Greeks at <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> than that the mint should have commenced to function so late.
               At least, the earliest coins of Alexandrine types that can be assigned confidently to <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> do not antedate the
               reign of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name>. There do exist a few earlier pieces which may have been coined there." But "a few pieces" will not
               solve our dilemma. From this enormous treasure must have come a series at least comparable in size to that of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>. But there is no such series. There are still small groups whose attribution is doubtful but the
               product of the great mints is known, and there is nothing left over to assign to <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>. Its output must have
               disappeared.</p>
            <p>Unless its output was darics. To prove that would need the assembly of much more evidence than is now available. The gold already published as
               presumably Alexandrine is not enough in bulk to fill the need. But I think no search for darics has ever been undertaken with this in mind. Such
               a search might prove disappointing, but the possibility ought to be kept open that the double darics "certainly from <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>" were supplemented by others of more eastern appearance and by darics and sigloi whose place of
               origin may have been <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>. To the circumstantial evidence already cited one more item is to be added: the one
               experiment of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I in coining a double daric was at <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>
               <hi rend="italic">(ESM,</hi> p. 171, no. 460).</p>
            <p>Even this much proven would leave us with baffling questions. The problem of transport would not be solved. <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> is
               a couple of hundred miles nearer the eastern campaigns but it is still far enough in all conscience. There are several possibilities, none of
               them very comfortable. There may have been mints still further east which contributed their share to the expenses of the campaign. This would
               mean reducing still further the number that we could credit to <name type="place">Ecbatana</name>. There may have been other treasures containing
               coin in the East of which we have no record. Money already in circulation may have been confiscated and used for the army. Eastern cities,
               perhaps his own foundations, may have been used as advance treasuries for the accumulation of coin. Of course, if the treasure of <name
                  type="place">Susa</name> and <name type="place">Persepolis</name> is involved at all in <pb n="73"/> the eastern campaigns the question of
               transport remains. Either bullion or coin must have been carried to the army and though bullion would have been less bulky it would have been
               just as heavy. But it would seem that the most inconvenient arrangement would be for the mint to forward its current production at frequent
               intervals, though presumably that is how the paymasters got their funds when mints were close by. For a big and remote army that would have meant
               keeping the transport trains on the road constantly with a large body of men of necessity detailed for guard duty. But obviously the conversion
               into coin of enough metal for a campaign of 5 years' duration could not be done quickly.</p>
            <p>The problem of silver is also very obscure. A natural assumption would be that if <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> minted darics it minted
               sigloi as well, but here there is a still smaller group <hi rend="italic">(BMC <name type="place">Arabia</name>,</hi> p. 160, nos. 88-91) which
               there is reason to attribute to the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>. We know, on Schlumberger's
               showing, how slight was the importance of the siglos in the total currency of the <name type="place">Persian</name> empire. Still, in <name
                  type="pname">Alexander's</name> time it had <hi rend="italic">some</hi> importance or no late ones would have been struck at all. But these
               few sigloi and the imitations of Mazaces are the only silver we have found so far which has the appearance of being designed for use in the East.
               Could that and the late darics and double darics have been sufficient for the need?</p>
            <p>This would be the place to give an account of the king's income and expenses if we could only do so with any confidence. There <hi rend="italic"
                  >is</hi> a summary calculation of income and expenses given by Beloch (IV. 1., pp. 41-43) in which the cost of the army is put at 7,000
               talents a year. The uncertainty of the figures is illustrated by the eclectic confidence given to the sources. <name type="pname">Justin</name>
               XIII. 1. 9 gives specific figures for the time of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death: erant enim in thesauris L milia talentum et in
               annuo vectigali ac tributo tricena milia. The first sum is accepted, the second rejected on the grounds that Herodotus III. 90-95 gives the
               yearly tribute of <name type="pname">Darius I</name> as 14,560 talents (10,000 "ohne den indischen Tribut und die Naturalleistungen"), which is
               regarded as an exaggeration, while <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> at the height of his power in 315, when he controlled nearly all the <name
                  type="place">Asiatic</name> satrapies, had an income of only 11,000 talents (Diodorus XIX. 56. 5). Beloch therefore reduces <name type="pname"
                  >Justin's</name> 30,000 talents to 15,000. Various extraordinary sums such as that for Hephaestion's funeral, and gifts to the army are
               accepted, but the total of 12,000 talents "contra decus regium—tumu-lumque" as <name type="pname">Justin</name> puts it, on which <name
                  type="pname">Justin</name> (XII. 12. 12) and Diodorus (XVII. 115. 5) agree, is rejected because even the funeral of a Roman emperor cost no
               more than 400 talents. If we accept Beloch's figure of 7,000 talents for the yearly cost of the army we must do so with the realization that it
               is no more than a good guess. The most recent and most thorough study of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>
               <pb n="74"/> economy is that of <name type="pname">A. M. Andreades</name> 'Ιστορία τ<graphic url="NS11_sym12.jpg"/>ς Ελληνίκης δημοσίας
               Οίκονομίας Book II, Part 1, 'H δημOσία οίκονομία το<graphic url="NS11_sym14.jpg"/> μ∊γάλου 'Αλ∊ξάνδρου, <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>, 1930. He thinks that Beloch's 7,000 is too low a figure (p. 21), but his calculations suffer from the
               same unavoidable weakness of having to substitute probable hypotheses for data. Both authors agree that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>
               expenses exceeded his income.</p>
            <p>Let us for the moment accept 7,000 talents as a reasonable military budget and, using very much simplified figures (since there is no possibility
               of exactitude) see what the consequences would be. If Diodorus is right and there were 9,000 talents of darics in <name type="place">Susa</name>,
               then the first year would be paid for without the need of further mintage—indeed there would be a surplus of 2,000 talents. Suppose we say that
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> would be provided for from the death of Darius to the summer of 329. He
               must then make provision for 2 years' campaigning, from the summer of 329 to that of 327 when he entered <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> and an entirely new set of conditions. He would have needed 14,000 talents for the army, which the
               treasure at <name type="place">Ecbatana</name> was well able to provide. Let us assume that 10,000 talents is to be in the form of double darics
               and (to make things as simple as possible) let us assume that the double daric equals the distater and that 150 of them go to the talent.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n160">160</ref> That would mean minting 1,500,000 of them. What would be a reasonable number of specimens now preserved to
               represent that number originally struck? There is one recent study which has at least some degree of control for its calculation of survival
               rate: <name type="pname">E. J. P. Raven</name>, 'The Amphictionic Coinage of Delphi."<ref target="#CH2-n161">161</ref> But in spite of the
               author's sane and careful treatment there is an embarrassing spread in the possibilities according to the denomination investigated and the total
               amount supposed to have been struck—a spread from 1 in 7,310 to 1 in 240,000 ! Mr. Raven himself is a little discouraged and recalling that
               "previous estimates of survival rates have usually been in the region of 1 in 5,000" admits that "that figure may not be far from the average of
               all Greek coins." Let us adopt it with no illusions.<ref target="#CH2-n162">162</ref> It would mean that of the original 1,500,000 double darics,
               300 <pb n="75"/> should have survived. If we assume that 2,000 talents consisted of silver (the other 2,000 being accounted for by the surplus
               darics) and that the silver was imitation <name type="place">Athenian</name> tetradrachms at 1,500 to the talent, there would have been 3,000,000
               struck, of which 600 should have survived. If one follows more closely the proportions of Seleucid coinage the amount of gold will be much
               decreased and the silver correspondingly increased, but the Seleucids had no great reservoirs of gold to make into money. I will not affront the
               reader by pointing out what a tissue of uncertainties we have here. Everyone must decide for himself whether such procedure can do any good at
               all. I may express my own feeling that, no matter how you calculate, there do not seem to be enough coins to meet the requirements. There has
               been no gathering of either double darics or imitation owls, but I find it hard to believe that a census would approach the necessary figures. It
               seems to me that there must have been supplements from more <name type="place">Persian</name> coins, from the <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> coinage, or from other series. It is unlikely that the country itself offered large amounts
               of plunder.</p>
            <p>We have some evidence of subsidiary series. There are a number of pieces that have been often attributed to <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>: varieties of imitation owls, small coins with <name type="place">Athena</name>'s head and an eagle,
               drachms and the famous tetradrachms with the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> and an eagle, these last with the
               name of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi> 1,12).</hi>
               <ref target="#CH2-n163">163</ref> The old attribution is disposed of, finally, one hopes, by an admirable article by <name type="pname">R. B,
                  Whitehead</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n164">164</ref> in which he shows clearly that, though specimens are acquired in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india"
                  >India</name>, their place of origin is across the mountains in <name type="place">Afghanistan</name>. These, then, might have helped to fill
               the need, but their number cannot have been large.</p>
            <p>As to the use of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> regular coinage, we are in strange doubt. <name type="pname">Alexanders</name> do turn up
               in <name type="place">Afghanistan</name>. I have recently seen a number acquired by an inexpert collector who had no interest in selecting
               rarities. There were 8 tetradrachms, 6 drachms and a hemidrachm, but the only pieces surely early enough to belong to this period were one stater
               of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> and one late daric. The silver was all of 324 or later. The <name type="pname">Oxus Hoard</name>, which
               ought to be <pb n="76"/> very enlightening, fails us entirely. Of the 100 odd tetradrachms and 100 odd drachms said to have been included, only
               one was sufficiently described to be identified, and that turns out to be a coin of <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> I from <name type="place"
                  >Ecbatana</name>, <hi rend="italic">ESM,</hi> p. 166, no. 454. We have no way of knowing the date of the others nor, if we knew, could we tell
               whether they came into the country with <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> or later. J. Hackin's "Répartition
               des Monnaies anciennes en <name type="place">Afghanistan</name>"<ref target="#CH2-n165">165</ref> makes no mention of <name type="pname"
                  >Alexanders</name> (but neither does he mention Seleucids, though he prints "Séleucides" on his map at Tash Kurgan). So far as our evidence
               goes, the coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> himself played no part of any importance in his conquest
               of Bactria.</p>
            <p>There remains the possibility that he had more <name type="place">Persian</name> coins and used them, but I do not see how that can ever be
                  proved.<ref target="#CH2-n166">166</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The record of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> finances in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> is extremely meager.
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n167">167</ref> records the gift to the king of Taxila of 1,000 talents, which he says was in coin, and the great displeasure
               of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> friends. The same incident occurs in <name type="pname">Curtius</name>,<ref target="#CH2-n168">168</ref>
               with an interesting addition. Omphis, being confirmed as king of Taxila, presented <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name> with sundry gifts and 80 talents signati argenti.<ref target="#CH2-n169">169</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> was gratified but returned the offering and instead gave Omphis 1,000
               talents ex praeda quam vehebat, gold and silver vessels, <name type="place">Persian</name> robes and 30 horses. This is an odd episode. What did
               Omphis expect to buy with so small a gift as 80 talents? The exchange of presents would be appropriate ritual between two kings meeting to form
               an alliance but the 1,000 talents, even if <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523">Plutarch</name> was not right about its being coin,
               would be much more credible if it were to insure the cooperation of the forces of Taxila than if it were a mere gesture of vanity, as both the
               authors seem to take it to be. For what it is worth, the incident shows <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> as
               actually carrying his treasure in his baggage <pb n="77"/> and as having enough so that he could part with a large sum before the conquest of
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> had fairly begun.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Curtius</name> says<ref target="#CH2-n170">170</ref> that after the defeat of Porus and the founding of Nicaea and Bucephala
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> gave each of the leaders a crown and 1,000 aurei—a detail so conventional
               that it is hardly to be taken seriously. Both Arrian<ref target="#CH2-n171">171</ref> and <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q41523"
                  >Plutarch</name>
               <ref target="#CH2-n172">172</ref> speak of <name type="place">Indian</name> mercenaries. This is all that is pertinent in the literary tradition.
               The coins themselves, however, are more helpful. First there is the negative evidence of the extreme rarity of <name type="pname"
                  >Alexander's</name> own money in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name>.<ref target="#CH2-n173">173</ref> Second there is
               the scarcity of <name type="place">Persian</name> gold and the comparative frequency of <name type="place">Persian</name> silver.<ref
                  target="#CH2-n174">174</ref> Third there is the existence of a class of silver coins of double, half and quarter siglos weight<ref
                  target="#CH2-n175">175</ref> which seems to have formed the basic currency of the northwest district to which <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> first came. Macdonald explains the infrequency of <name type="place">Persian</name> gold in
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> by the fact that there was so much gold there that the ratio with silver was only 8:
               1. This would, of course, be unfavorable to the use of darics coined on the <name type="place">Persian</name> standard of 13. 3: 1 and, to a
               lesser extent, to the gold coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> struck at 10: 1. <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> may, therefore, have planned to use silver only, though in this case he would have had
               little need to import specie. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_india">India</name> is notoriously rich in metal and, moreover, much given to
                  hoarding,<ref target="#CH2-n176">176</ref> so that here, as in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>, the conqueror will
               have been able to look forward to the capture of enough bullion to finance his campaign. It certainly was not financed by staters and
               tetradrachms transported from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>.</p>
            <p>This digression into the perplexities of the East has led us far from the main course of our study, but it could hardly be neglected. No matter
               how the details are finally settled, the general picture is clear. Before Gaugamela the empire had two monetary zones: <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> (Map 2) where the <pb n="78"/>
               imperial types joined or dominated but did not extinguish the local currencies; <name type="place">Cilicia</name> and <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> (Map 3) where the local currencies were replaced by the imperial. To this period belongs the fiscal
               purpose of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, as defined by Schlumberger, of eventually achieving monetary
               uniformity for the empire as a whole. But after Gaugamela a third zone is added, of <name type="pname">Mesopotamia</name> and the East (Map 4) in
               which the preexisting confusion is not merely tolerated but augmented by the emissions of the conqueror. There is concession to the <name
                  type="place">Persian</name> tradition, as proved by the double darics; concession to the satrapal tradition, as proved by the imitation owls.
               Whether temporarily or permanently the ideal of uniformity is laid aside. In part this was doubtless the result of difficulties greater in the
               East than in the West: the continuous warfare, the strange and remote terrain, the alien mores of the people. But it also resulted from a changed
               state of mind, for there are two phenomena in the West, one beginning about 327 during <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> absence in the East,
               the other in 324 after his return. The first is the institution at <name type="place">Tarsus</name> of a series of silver staters of <name
                  type="place">Persian</name> weight and <name type="place">Cilician</name> type without any reference to <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, for the use of Issus, <name type="place">Mallus</name>, Soli and <name type="place"
                  >Tarsus</name> itself (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III, 7, 8).<ref target="#CH2-n177">177</ref> The other is the coining, in the mints of
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, of gold staters with the name and type of <name type="pname">Philip</name>
                  II.<ref target="#CH2-n178">178</ref> Neither of these can be explained by any pressure of necessity or change of conditions. Both must have
               been designed to gratify the sentiment of those who still remembered kindly the money that preceded <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>All this is perfectly appropriate to the historical situation. Until the final defeat of the <name type="place">Persian</name> king <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> was an adventurer, with everything to gain, but much to lose. Whenever his
               resolution was taken that he himself was to be the Great King, it became imperative for him to assert his prestige and <pb n="79"/> his power.
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name>tics were to be taught that the imperial structure which they had regarded as
               supreme was in process of being overthrown by a mighty foreigner, supported by foreign gods, who was no mere raider, but had come among them to
               conquer, to occupy and to organize. <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> and <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> and the name of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> were to become as
               familiar to them as the gods of their own country and the odd little monarch with bow and spear. But when the empire was won, when he was in fact
               the <name type="pname">Great King</name> himself, what did it matter any longer? Then came the experiments with the amalgamation of races, the
                  <name type="place">Persians</name> in positions of trust, the oriental splendor and extravagance, the figure of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> on the great decadrachm, a <name type="place">Macedonian</name> king on one side charging
               against Poms, but, on the other, a divine king in <name type="place">Persian</name> dress, wielding the thunderbolt (<hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               </hi>

                  <hi rend="bold">late 1,</hi>
               </hi>13).</p>
            <p>But, if there was confusion in the East and breach of precedent in the West, it must not be thought that the general system was weakened, much
               less abandoned, after Gaugamela. The old mints continued to strike their conventional coins, the latest organized of the great mints, <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name>, beginning to operate about 326.<ref target="#CH2-n179">179</ref> About
               that time also there was a marked, though unexplained, increase in the output of a number of cities.<ref target="#CH2-n180">180</ref> Neither
               quantity nor quality showed signs of slackening, and there must have been few west of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon"
                  >Babylon</name> who did not know the types of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>The ultimate test of a currency is its ability to provide what is needed. So judged, <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> international currency
               had been a great success. It had furnished him with the resources of war and peace over a vast territory whose <pb n="80"/> expansion he could
               not foresee in detail. It had succeeded, at least as far as <name type="pname">Mesopotamia</name>, in introducing an economy of uniform specie to
               regions accustomed to other currencies or to none. Trade had carried the daric and the owl far and wide, but the army and the civil power carried
               the gold <name type="place">Athena</name> and the silver <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> farther yet. As an
               instrument of conquest or commerce and of government, the coinage of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> made a
               record no less brilliant than his more familiar achievements.</p>
            <p>Could its success have continued? Would it have served the whole established empire which he planned? No question which must assume the continued
               life and health of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> can have a satisfying answer, but here, as in other
               cases, one must doubt if he could have maintained what he created. There is no reason to suspect that he was an economist more gifted than his
               generation. It is the common belief that his expenses outran his income. Doubtless the mines of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia"
                  >Macedonia</name> seemed inexhaustible; inexhaustible also the huge <name type="place">Persian</name> treasure. With its capture begin the
               tales of extravagances which, in the end, were sure to impoverish the royal power. If he could have learned in <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name>, when there was nothing more to conquer, to match his expenses to his needs as successfully as he
               seems to have done while he was winning <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name>, his financial structure might have
               stood for generations. But who was there to teach him?</p>

               <p>Diodorus XVI, 8. 6. "A thousand talents" means gold to the value of 1,000 silver (Attic) talents. Diodorus specifies gold but <name
                     type="pname">Philip</name> certainly got his greatly increased supply of silver from the Pangaean region. There may therefore have been a
                  thousand talents of gold plus an unspecified amount of silver. I make the cautious assumption, however, that the thousand talents in fact
                  included gold and silver both.</p>

                  </hi> II. 11, the 30 days' provisions are given on the authority of Phylarchus. These two calculations cannot be made to coincide. If the
                  total of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> army of invasion and <name type="pname">Parmenio</name>'s advance force was about 40,000 foot
                  and 6,000 horse (<name type="pname">G. T. Griffith</name>, <hi rend="italic">The Mercenaries of the Hellenistic World,</hi>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2653941">Cambridge</name>, 1935, p. 12) it could hardly have been supported for 30 days on 70 talents.
                  There is an unfortunate silence of the sources on the fundamental matter of the soldiers' daily wage in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>
                  army (Parke, <hi rend="italic"> Greek Mercenary Soldiers,</hi> p. 233, n. 1. It may be pointed out that the fragmentary inscription IG II.<hi

                  his allies 1 drachma a day, seems rather to show a payment of I drachma to the hypaspistae with some other, and presumably lesser, amount for
                  the troops in general. Tarn does not appear to have taken account of the inscription inhis discussion of the hypaspists, <hi rend="italic">
                     <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> the Great</hi> II, pp. 148–154). However, we have an interesting
                  detailed proposal by <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">(First <name type="pname">Philip</name>pic,</hi> 28f.) for an expeditionary force against <name type="pname">Philip</name>
                  that was never raised. His calculation allows 2 obols a day for foot soldiers, one drachma for horse, citizen and mercenary alike. This was
                  put forward as an emergency measure and, in view of the fact that the pauper's allowance was 2 obols, it is very unlikely that citizen
                  infantry, let alone mercenaries, could have been induced to serve ordinarily for that wage, which would have been sufficient only if
                  supplemented with plunder. There is evidence that by the time of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> the
                  ordinary pay of a Greek mercenary was 4 obols a day (Parke, loc. cit.) and perhaps we may assume that the pay of all privates was the same; in
                  that case the pay of a horseman would also be double <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</name>' figure. Now, if we
                  take the later amount, the pay of the foot for 30 days would be 800,000 drachmae (40,000 χ 4 obols χ 30 days ÷ 6), that of the horse 360,000
                  drachmae (6,000 χ 12 obols χ 30 days ÷ 6). The total would be 193⅓ talents (1,160,000 ÷ 6,000), while even at <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#wikidata_Q504986">Demosthenes</name>' figures the sum would be 96⅔ talents with no allowance for the pay of higher ranks or any
                  other military expense. Seventy talents would not have lasted 3 weeks even at starvation wages. Probably the reports of the king's finances at
                  the beginning of the campaign were no more than gossip.</p>

               <p>Arrian's words imply that <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> own borrowing was to finance the expedition. If the 800 were added to <name

                  <name type="place">Babelon</name>, op. cit., pp. 1329-1332. Here we are faced with the difficulty of accurate dating. Wroth, <hi rend="italic"
                     >BMC Troas,Aeolis and Lesbos,</hi> p. xli, says "This series may, on grounds of style, be attributed to <hi rend="italic">circa</hi>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">B.C.</hi> 320 to 280." Without disputing the calculation based on style, <name type="place">Babelon</name> moves the
                  series back to 340–300. Twenty years is surely not a great difference when one is dating by style in the 4th century, but for our purpose the
                  difference is critical. According to one system Abydus began her large output of silver before <name type="pname">Philip's</name> invasion of
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name> and continued it through the life of <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> I;
                  according to the other it did not begin until after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death and continued through the life of <name
                     type="pname">Seleucus</name> I. I follow <name type="place">Babelon</name> because he is the later (and, I think, the better) authority and
                  also because his dates seem to me to accord better with historical probability. Among the phenomena following the death of <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> I find it hard to believe that there was any long continued show of independence by
                  cities in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name>. Some such outburst as occasioned the Lamian War in mainland <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> is easy to imagine, but for Abydus to begin an issue of autonomous coins which
                  persisted through the terms of at least 28 officials seems very unlikely. Nevertheless, probability is not proof and the use of Abydus as
                  evidence for the procedure of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> involves a <hi rend="italic">petitio principii.</hi> But neither date avoids the difficulty of

                  another. Thompson and Bellinger, p. 9. Bikerman has nothing to say about Abydus in his sweeping denial that the <name type="place"

               <p>A notable instance of the control of local value by convention is the variation in price of gold coins at Delphi between 335 and 328. <hi
                     rend="italic">Sylloge</hi> I, 251, n. 15 and 253, n. 14. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_122375252">J. G. Milne</name> was eminent in his
                  defense of the thesis that, in domestic transactions, the amount of bullion in a coin was of less importance than its face value. (Cf. "The
                  Monetary Reform of Solon," <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 1930, pp. 179–185; <hi rend="italic">The Melos Hoard of 1907</hi> (NNM 62), 1934). The
                  power of the sovereign to set a value to a coin which should not be affected by variation in the price of metal is of course dependent on the
                  degree of control which he had over the metal available, and probably not many would be tempted to apply the principle, as Milne did, to
                  Pheidon and the very beginning of coinage <hi rend="italic">(Greek and Roman Coins,</hi>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, 1939, pp. 81f., n. X. 2). But he had been impressed by the lack of uniformity in
                  Greek coin weights and was inclined to echo the complaint of <name type="pname">Sir George Macdonald</name> that the instrument of metrology
                  "has indeed broken short in our hands" ("Fifty Years of Greek Numismatics," <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the International Numismatic
                     Congress,</hi>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, 1938, pp. 3–16). Macdonald reviews the enthusiastic hopes of the metrologists and
                  the vigorous reaction to them with reference to his studies in the coinage of Crete, where indeed the weights cannot be got to make any sense.
                  But it is going too far to assert, because this situation obtains in one area, that Greek money is all token money except for a few issues
                  such as the Athenian, coined with international trade specifically in view. There is too great a majority of cases in which the standards <hi
                     rend="italic">are</hi> adhered to, though these are often obscured by the fact that we have not enough data to be statistically safe. If
                  value really had no relation to metal content there would be nothing to prevent a drastic and universal reduction in weight of all coins not
                  intended to go abroad. The enigma of Crete would be only half solved, for though we might have an explanation for the light coins, we should
                  have none for the heavy. We may continue to believe that, as a rule, silver coins were worth their weight, with exceptions, some of which we
                  can understand and some of which we cannot. One thing we can understand is that convenience might demand a conventional adjustment of values
                  to save the nuisance of perpetual weighing. If there were large quantities in question the scales were undoubtedly resorted to as they still
                  are in the East, but when a few small pieces of Abydus had to be exchanged for small silver of Lampsacus it was doubtless done by agreement.
                  Still, we should not exaggerate an <name type="place">Asiatic's</name> impatience with weighing or belittle his willingness to spend his
                  leisure for a small profit.</p>

               <p>Tarn, op. cit., II, pp. 237f. cannot believe that there was an Alexandria earlier than the one in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt"
                     >Egypt</name>, and presents an hypothesis that it was founded after Gaugamela by command of <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> but not by his act in presence. It does not matter to us at what point the city also
                  known as Myriandrus received the conqueror's name but I do not believe that the argument is a very good one that some ancient writer <hi
                     rend="italic">must</hi> have mentioned the foundation if it had occurred immediately after Issus. The city had been important enough to
                  have its own Persian issues and without any doubt those of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> at once
                  succeeded (<name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">E. T. Newell</name>, <hi rend="italic">Myriandros).</hi> It might be remarked that
                  Tarn has difficulty (pp. 239f.) with another Alexandria: Alexandria Troas. The tradition is (Strabo, XIII. 26) that the city was founded by
                     <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> by the synoecism of the surrounding towns and named after himself; that when <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> acquired it he refounded it and renamed it Alexandria. This Tarn will not credit, "It
                  is impossible to believe" he says, "that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Successor, just <hi rend="italic">once,</hi> used the <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>-name.—There is only one explanation. <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                     >Alexander</name> must have promised to found a city there—but he did not live to do it." But in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time
                  a city in that place would have made no sense at all. The whole thing is a characteristic Hellenistic performance (<name type="pname">Louis
                     Robert</name>, <hi rend="italic">Études de Numismatique grecque,</hi>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>, 1951, pp. 5-13). If <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                     >Alexander</name> had in mind the founding of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Alexandria before the one in <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, Myriandrus would have been a reasonable location, a site in the Troad would not.</p>

                  bureaucracy had its own drawbacks. The late Roman empire found by experience how disastrously a bureaucracy could divide the sovereign and his

               <p>Noe's arrangement would provide 8 issues distinguished by their symbols or by style:</p>
               <p>I. Boy with outstretched arms alone (distater no. 1. stater no. 2, tetradrachm no. 3).</p>
               <p>2. Boy and rudder (stater no. 5, tetradrachm no. 4).</p>
               <p>3. Thunderbolt and A (distater nos. 6, 7—supposing A and A to be the same—stater no. 8).</p>
               <p>4. Boy and A (distater no. 9, stater no. 11).</p>
               <p>5. Boy A and ivy leaf (distater no. 10).</p>
               <p>6. Boy alone, different style from 1 (stater no. 12, tetradrachms nos. 13, 14—distinguished only by a die break on the former).</p>
               <p>7. Ear of barley (tetradrachm no. 15).</p>
               <p>8. Goat's head (tetradrachm no. 16).</p>
               <p>Of these, 1, 3 and 6 are large issues. In 1 there are 8 reverse dies used for the tetradrachms, though only one each for distater and stater.
                  In 3 there are 18 reverse dies used for the distaters, I for the stater. In 6 there are 9 reverses used for the tetradrachms. The others are
                  all small, each using only a single reverse die, except that there are 2 for tetradrachm no. 4 and 2 for distater no. 9. There is, however, no
                  reason for combining any of the minor issues, and combining 1 and 6, where the difference is one of style alone, would still leave 7
                  issues.</p>
               <p>Since the terminal date is 323/2, that would put the beginning not later than 330/29. The latest issue (presumably 8) might have come in 323
                  before the outbreak of the Lamian war. The earliest could not be before the battle of Megalopolis in the fall of 331, and therefore an issue
                  before 330 would be hardly possible. If we are to provide a year for each of Noe's varieties, therefore, we should put 1 in 330/29 and 8 in
                  323.</p>

                  pay was intermitted during the Indian campaign on two grounds: first, "It is difficult to think that <name type="pname"
                     corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> carried vast sums of money about with him during his Indian campaign" and second "when he

                  The difficulty as to transport is a serious one, but not so serious in India where he had the rivers to use as in the mountains of Bactria.
                  And there is nothing to suggest that the arrears in pay were of long standing. They may have been only in connection with the march back from
                  India. <name type="place">Griffith</name> is hardly justified in saying "in fact it is certain that he did not pay μισθός regularly by the

               generals could not know, any more than we know now whether it was possible that the vast realm which they had conquered could be ruled as a unit,
               but even those who doubted most had no plan for division except the appeal to arms. But civil war was to the liking of no one and so it was
               essential that the formal question as to the kingship should be settled promptly. A compromise was reached: Arrhidaeus' name was changed to <name
                  type="pname">Philip</name> and he was declared king with the proviso that if <name type="pname">Roxane</name>'s child should be a son he was
               to share the royal title. <name type="pname">Roxane</name>'s child, as it turned out, was a son; he was duly named <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> and war was for the time averted. <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> and Craterus divided
               the ill-defined powers and duties of guardian and regent. Many of the necessary arrangements of which we are not told must have been made by them
               and it may have been they who decided that, as money must continue to be struck, the familiar types should be retained but that some of the coins
               should bear the name of <name type="pname">Philip</name>, and this plan was put into effect as soon as the problem of the kingship was
               solved.</p>
            <p>It was not universally done, however. The most conspicuous exception is that the premier mint of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name> never used
                  <name type="pname">Philip's</name> name. It is not easy to see why this should have been so. The <name type="place">Macedonians</name> had
               been <name type="pname">Philip's</name> supporters in the contest as to the succession and <name type="pname">Antipater</name>, who was regent in
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>, was a thorough legitimist. Moreover, he had long been at odds with <name
                  type="place">Olympia</name>s, that fervent partisan of her grandson and foe of his co-ruler, which should have put <name type="pname"
                  >Antipater</name> in <name type="pname">Philip's</name> party if partisanship was important in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia"
                  >Macedonia</name> in 323. It is a further complication that there is an issue for <name type="pname">Philip</name> from Pella in about
                  318.<ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref> At that time there is indeed evidence of a <pb n="82"/> division in the country. Cassander was making head
               against the duly appointed guardian Polyperchon; <name type="pname">Eurydice</name>, <name type="pname">Philip's</name> wife and half-sister, had
               attempted to take charge of affairs and transfer the command from Polyperchon to Cassander; the young <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> was apparently with his grandmother in Epirus. It may be that <name type="pname"
                  >Eurydice</name> had enough influence in Pella to have it strike in her husband's name, but not enough to prevent the same magistrate from
               striking in that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>. But this does not explain why the omission should have
               been made in the beginning when <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> was using both names.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref>
               Perhaps there will ultimately be found adequate political explanations for the other places where <name type="pname">Philip's</name> name was not
               used, such as <name type="place">Miletus</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> and <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name>, but at present it seems as though the irregular procedure is no more than a symptom of
               imperfect control by the regents of minting regulation. This does not prevent the unhappy <name type="pname">Philip</name>, burdened with
               illegitimacy, an over-bearing wife and a weak intellect, from being a person of numismatic importance. Since his brief career began in 323 and
               ended in 317 his coins, of course, must fall between those limits, and consequently also the coins with the name of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> and symbols identical with <name type="pname">Philip's</name> which is a very important aid
               in the arrangements of the coins after 323.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>

            <p>It is remarkable how few of these governors played parts of any importance during the struggles of the Successors. The boundaries of the
               satrapies would be maintained as they had been in <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> time and it may be that the entrusting of important
               provinces to men not of the first importance was caused less by a mistaken estimate of their abilities than by the mutual jealousies of greater
               men. The fact that there was obviously no attempt to provide an equal distribution of mints can only mean that the unity of the empire was still
               so fundamental in the minds of the generals that it was taken for granted that all money was still the kings' money, only now at the disposal of
               the regent. There are positive indications that this was true. In 321, after the murder of <name type="place">Perdiccas</name>, his
               brother-in-law <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_priscus_attalus">Attalus</name> sailed to Tyre and there recovered 800 talents from
               Archelaüs, the captain of the garrison, which <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> had given him for safekeeping.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref>
               This was evidently a transaction entirely independent of Laomedon, the satrap. In 319 <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> committed what was
               regarded as a clear act of rebellion when he captured and appropriated 600 talents which were being conveyed by ship from <name type="place"
                  >Cilicia</name> to the kings in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n5">5</ref> And in the next
               year, when Polyperchon was strengthening the hand of Eumenes against <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> he sent letters in the name of the kings
               to the generals in <name type="place">Cilicia</name> and the treasurers to pay Eumenes 500 talents and any more that he might require.<ref
                  target="#CH3-n6">6</ref>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name>, indeed, protested to the treasurers against paying any money to Eumenes and
               promised to protect them if they failed to carry out instructions, but nobody paid any attention to him.<ref target="#CH3-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="85"/>
            <p>The assumption of the unity of empire, however, soon began to be challenged. <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> was
               apparently the first to conceive of making a part of the empire his own domain, though perhaps the idea had come as soon to <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>, fighting to organize the still unconquered elements of Thrace. After his recovery of
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</name> from <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> in 312 <name type="pname"
                  >Seleucus</name> set himself to make a permanent possession of the East. And in the spring of that same year when Cassander had put <name
                  type="place">Olympias</name> to death, though he was the only one with any title to be considered the guardian of the young <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, he showed his true purpose by having the boy imprisoned with his mother <name type="pname"
                  >Roxane</name>. In 310 by having them assassinated he left no basis for any legitimist party.</p>
            <p>Against these separatist forces the regents had fought, <name type="place">Perdiccas</name> with more than a little personal ambition involved,
                  <name type="pname">Antipater</name> with loyal devotion to the royal house, Polyperchon with good intentions, doubtless, but with little
               practical sense and with diminishing effectiveness. But there was another opponent of the separatists: <name type="pname">Antigonus</name>, and
               he was moved not by sentiment but by the determination to keep the empire together for himself. This ambition was shared and inherited by his son
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name>, and the greatest episode of the closing of the 4th century and the opening
               of the 3rd is the account of the adventures of those two warriors.</p>
            <p>The interplay of all these individuals meant constant change in the control of territory and in the condition of the cities. Though the mints may
               have struck coins originally for the use of all parts of the empire alike—subject always to the element of convenience—there must have come a
               time when for <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> to capture a mint meant for him to capture additional revenue. The activity of the <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> mints in 310 and 309 seems to be part of his program,<ref target="#CH3-n8"
                  >8</ref> and perhaps some of the constant friction between the Ptolemies and their neighbors was caused by desire to control the mint-cities
               of the Syrian coast.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to give any general picture of the fortunes of the mints in the period just after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death.
               That must be worked out a city at a time, a labor which has hardly begun as yet, though many issues have been assigned to their proper cities
               without historical commentary. <name type="pname">Newell's</name> works on <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name> and
               the Seleucids have obiter dicta about the preceding <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> coins and so have
               publications of sundry hoards, but we are still in the dark as to such a matter as the closing of the mint at <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name>, its date and cause. Much meticulous work with individual series is necessary before we can write
               the history of the early posthumous <name type="pname">Alexanders</name>.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, there are some things that can be said as to the practice of the different Successors, for there are only a few of them of any
               numismatic <pb n="86"/> importance. In the realm of <name type="pname">Antipater</name>, as one would expect, nothing was ever minted except the
               old types, and that was true of the realm in the hands of Polyperchon. Since they regarded the empire as the kings' estate, it could be financed
               only by the kings' money. Cassander held to the convention so far as gold and silver were concerned, but he did issue bronze with the head of
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> and a lion with his own name.<ref target="#CH3-n9">9</ref>
               <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> also used only the <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> types; the coins
               bearing the legend <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> or King <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> belong to his grandson <name type="pname"
                  >Antigonus</name> Gonatas or <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> Doson.<ref target="#CH3-n10">10</ref> Of course his endeavor was to avoid
               anything that might seem to acknowledge the possibility of partition, and as long as the old man lived his son <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name>, if he is to be regarded as an independent minting authority, followed the father's example. The
               first breach of tradition was that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> about 320 when he substituted for the head
               of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> a head of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>
               wearing a headdress made of an elephant with jutting tusks and uplifted trunk (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 4). This is the deified <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>: above his cheek may be seen the ram's
               horn of his divine father <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> Ammon. A few years later there was a more extreme innovation.
               The deified head remained but the familiar seated <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> was replaced by an <name type="place"
                  >Athena</name> with helmet, aegis, shield and thunderbolt. The earliest coins of this type bore the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΕΙΟΝ,</hi>
               </hi> a further deviation from tradition but a somewhat puzzling one which gave place again to the conventional <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">AΛEΞANΞPOY.</hi>
               </hi> So far there had been no overt show of independence, but a step was taken which actually made for more independence than a change of type
               could. <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> abandoned the Attic standard of 17.62 grams and began to strike
               tetradrachms of Rhodian weight (15.50 grams) and so cut <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> off from the international
               currency of his rivals. Then, after the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> IV in 310 had left no
               legitimate monarch, <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name>, <name type="pname"
                  >Seleucus</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> took the title of king in 306/5 and 305/4, and
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> joined them, now introducing his own portrait on the obverse and using as his
               reverse the eagle which had been on <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name>' hand. This became the standard Ptolemaic type and
               the <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> coinage thus disappears from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt"
                  >Egypt</name> forever.</p>
            <p>The development of types was different in other cases. <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name> had originally
               controlled no mint<ref target="#CH3-n11">11</ref> and it was not until 308 that he provided himself <pb n="87"/> with a suitable capital by
               building the city of Lysimacheia near Cardia in Thrace. There he struck <name type="pname">Alexanders</name> on which about 303 he put a
               distinguishing mark: the forepart of a Hon, which was his own device; and his own name now stood in place of <name type="pname"
                  >Alexander's</name>. In 296<ref target="#CH3-n12">12</ref> he imitated <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_ptolemy_i">Ptolemy</name> in
               replacing the <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> head with a portrait of the divinized <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, again with the horns of Ammon but without the elephant skin (<hi rend="bold">P</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">
                  <hi rend="bold">LATE</hi>
               </hi> II, 5). It is one of the most spectacular of Hellenistic portraits. The reverse shows a seated <name type="place">Athena</name> holding
               Nike and leaning on her shield. The title is that of King <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus">Lysimachus</name>, and with that
               he was content; his portrait never appeared on his coins, and since he had no heir his types would have died with him except that, like those of
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, they had caught the fancy of the cities and were imitated long after his
               death.</p>
            <p>When the disaster of Ipsus had ended <name type="pname">Antigonus</name>' plans and ambitions <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius"
                  >Demetrius</name> was left to gather the remnants of his father's great empire and, from the cities still in his control, he issued notice of
               his continued command of the sea: the magnificent tetradrachms bearing his name and showing Nike with a trumpet on a prow and Poseidon standing
               with menacing trident. Later there were two series with <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name>' own portrait, one with
               Poseidon seated, the other with his foot on a rock, leaning on a trident.</p>
            <p>The first change introduced by <name type="pname">Seleucus</name> was the substitution of his own name for that of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> after 306 when he took the title of king. This was at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris about 305.<ref
                  target="#CH3-n13">13</ref> It became common about 300 and was the regular type for gold and silver in the West, though the bronze shows
               considerable variation. An apparent exception occurs in Pergamum where <name type="pname">Seleucus</name>' name is used on tetradrachms with
               horse's head/elephant. But those were actually issued by Philetaerus and his governor and were followed by a reversion to <name type="pname"
                  >Alexander's</name> type and name, and then to <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> type with <name type="pname">Seleucus</name>' name.<ref
                  target="#CH3-n14">14</ref> In the East two other types were used for silver: the head of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q34201"
                  >Zeus</name>/<name type="place">Athena</name> in a biga or quadriga of elephants;<ref target="#CH3-n15">15</ref> and head of <name

                  >Ptolemy</name>'s portrait did in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. In <name type="place">Susa</name>, for instance,

            <p>Mention must be made of three interesting uses of the <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> type by lesser powers
               than the dynasts of whom we have spoken. One is the case of a client king, Nicocles of Paphos in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cyprus"
                  >Cyprus</name>. A number of tetradrachms of that mint, apparently perfectly ordinary <name type="pname">Alexanders</name>, are found on close
               inspection, to have the name <hi rend="smallcaps">

               </hi> inscribed on the mane of the lion headdress in letters so tiny that they are not visible on a photograph and are frequently only to be seen
               on the coins themselves under a magnifying glass.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref>
               <name type="pname">J. M. F. May</name> in an admirably complete treatment of them<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref> concludes that they were issued
               from 323, immediately after <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> death, to 320, which would allow for their appearance in the <name type="place"
                  >Demanhur</name> Hoard, buried in 318/7. As he says, the legend has every appearance of being surreptitious and it is tempting to think that
               the Paphian king was a bit intoxicated by the feeling of liberty caused by the news from <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_babylon"
                  >Babylon</name>, but not so confident as to let his state of mind be obvious to the regents. We have no way of knowing whether his temerity
               escaped notice, or was indulged, or was punished. But none of his fellow kings copied his experiment. There are letters on coins of <name
                  type="place">Salamis</name> which may perhaps have stood for the names of the kings Nicocreon and Menelaus<ref target="#CH3-n22">22</ref> but
               those cases were undoubtedly official and were far less explicit. A similar license had been accorded kings of <name type="place"

               Nicocles was aiming at something more than that.</p>
            <p>The second case is that of a tetradrachm of eastern appearance which, in addition to the usual inscription, has the name <hi rend="smallcaps">

               recovered the territory this piece must have been struck. Though it is without parallel and without consequence,<ref target="#CH3-n26">26</ref>
               it is worthy of attention, for it ventures on a show of independence which the greater Successors were slow to follow. Modesty or caution or both
               forbade the introduction of a new design. Who was Aspeisas that the East should accept his money? But he was more than the mint official who must
               be content to be known by a monogram or an ambiguous symbol and he saw to it that he should appear as a man of importance in the realm that had
               been <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>. One wonders whether he knew of the case of Nicocles and declined to use such a mixture of display and
               concealment. One wonders also what impression it made on <name type="pname">Antigonus</name> who had appointed him—<name type="pname"
                  >Antigonus</name> who was so scrupulous to maintain the old types unchanged.</p>
            <p>The third instance is even more surprising. It is the issuance by Areus king of Sparta, 309-264, of a tetradrachm with <name type="pname"
                  >Alexander's</name> types and the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">

                  target="#CH3-n28">28</ref> supposes that the act of striking his own money, unprecedented for a Spartan, was one of the manifestations of
               eminence and self-confidence which resulted from his victory over Pyrrhus in 272. No Spartan king for a long time had been so powerful, and it is
               easy to assume that his emulation of royal power of which <name type="place">Athena</name>eus speaks<ref target="#CH3-n29">29</ref> falls in this
               period. It might be a time suitable for the introduction of the silver with his own portrait,<ref target="#CH3-n30">30</ref> if that is indeed
               struck by him, but the use of his name on the <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> type would be much more
               appropriate to the years 306-304 when the Successors whom he considered his rivals were taking the title of king. We know nothing of what he was
               doing from his accession in 309 to his first campaign in 280, and this may have been a kind of announcement that he also was one of the
               Successors, with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> for his province. But at any juncture it is <pb n="90"/> astonishing
               to have the types of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> vised by a king of the one Greek state which had been
                  <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> consistent and pertinacious foe.<ref target="#CH3-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The economy of these posthumous Alexanders is still unstudied. It is evident that after the change of standard, the silver of Egypt was isolated
               from the rest of the Hellenistic world,<ref target="#CH3-n32">32</ref> but what about the money of the other Successors? How much of their
               product remained in their own territory? How much was at the disposition of their rivals? I ventured remarks on this subject a few years ago<ref
                  target="#CH3-n33">33</ref> suggesting that there might be evidence for the development of separate monetary districts. I did not have much
               material to go on, and how upsetting to reasonable conjecture the facts can be is clearly seen in a hoard from Basra, recently published by <name
                  type="pname">Georges Le Rider</name>.<ref target="#CH3-n34">34</ref> This extraordinary collection, of which he saw 507 pieces, begins with a

               the mint of Amphipolis (60 being of the series with ∧ and race torch from the beginning of the 3rd century);<ref target="#CH3-n35">35</ref> 23
               more are imitations of <name type="place">Amphipolis</name>. There are only 2 from <name type="place">Tarsus</name> and 7 from <name type="place"
                  >Babylon</name>. Such a proportion could not possibly have been anticipated. Surely the mint of Babylon could have supplied money to Basra (it
               did in fact supply 11 lion staters) without anyone getting coins from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> ! Yet
               though at present we are at a loss, the accumulation of evidence will in time certainly show us something of the movement of currency in the
               early Hellenistic world. We are not without some indications. We know that the kings were not as rich as <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> had been.<ref target="#CH3-n36">36</ref> We know that they issued much less gold and much
               more bronze. We know that they modified his geographical arrangement of mints: <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_lysimachus"
                  >Lysimachus</name> was served by some which had never struck for <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>, and the
               Seleucids pushed eastward to Bactria itself (Map 4), showing that whatever were the dispositions of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> there <pb n="91"/> they could not be made permanent. But these were phenomena that lie
               beyond the limits of this study.</p>
            <p>After the death of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_demetrius">Demetrius</name> no one had any illusions about the possibility of keeping the
               empire together, and even before that, at the death of Cassander in 297 or of his sons in 294, the uniform types as a symbol of imperial unity
               had been abandoned. It would seem that <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q122248">Heracles</name> and the seated <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q34201">Zeus</name> had come to the end of their career. But in fact they reappear, not in the service of the kings but in
               that of the cities. Indeed, their use now is a sign of independence of the kings.<ref target="#CH3-n37">37</ref> These issues as related
               phenomena have had the benefit so far of only one serious study: Henri Seyrig's article "Parion au 3<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Siècle avant nôtre
                  Ère"<ref target="#CH3-n38">38</ref> in which he considers the posthumous Alexanders of northern <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_asia_minor">Asia Minor</name> together with the posthumous imitations of the tetradrachms of Lysimachus coined after 281 on
               both sides of the Propontis and on the Thracian coasts. There are two distinct periods to which the Alexanders belong, clearly distinguished in
               appearance. As to the earlier I can do no better than quote Seyrig's summary. ''We have in Seleucid <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</name> two kinds of money. At Sardes the types are royal, the name of the ruling sovereign is habitual; civic
               symbols are absent, the issue is continuous, the likeness of the coins to those of the eastern mints reveals the imperial centralization. In the
               other towns, on the contrary, the pieces have the traditional types of Alexander the Great, the name of the ruling sovereign is absent, the use
               of civic symbols is habitual, the issues are of limited importance. In other words, the coins of Sardes testify to immediate royal control while
               those of the other towns show no trace of it. The fact is that Sardes, the ancient capital, was left by <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> under its Lydian laws and depended directly on the royal authority, while the other towns
               were Greek cities. The coins show, therefore, that the administrative capital in the first half of the 3rd century was still subject, while <name
                  type="pname">Seleucus</name> had given the Greek cities a status which respected certain attributes of sovereignty."<ref target="#CH3-n39"
                  >39</ref>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of Antiochus I, however, the royal power encroached on this sovereignty, whatever its nature, and royal types reappear in various
               cities. This was the situation until the death of Antiochus Hierax in 229/8. There followed another period of quasi-independence under the
               friendly protection of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_priscus_attalus">Attalus</name> I of Pergamum. This was celebrated in many towns by
               the issuance of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> type tetradrachms with low relief and very large flans. I
               illustrate <pb n="92"/> one such from the mint of Myrina, <name type="pname">Müller</name> 934 <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi>
               </hi> III, 10). On these, as on the earlier series, the symbols and monograms identify the issuing town, and they must be regarded as civic, not
               as royal issues. I have endeavored to put both series into their context in the case of Alexandria Troas.<ref target="#CH3-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Seyrig observes, as to the earlier posthumous series, "the issues are of limited importance," and that would seem to be still more true of the
               later ones. They are, in fact, analogous to the civic types, also struck on large flans, whose explanation, I am convinced, is sentimental rather
               than economic. I have discussed this matter at length in regard to the tetradrachms of Ilium<ref target="#CH3-n41">41</ref> and I need not repeat
               the argument here. It is clear how wide a difference there is between these rare pieces and the great <name type="place">Macedonian</name> issues
               which, more than a century before, financed the campaigns of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name>.</p>
            <p>There is no study comparable to Seyrig's for other districts and I will not embark on the complicated problems involved except by way of
               illustration. Coins are known, for example, certainly attributable to <name type="place">Miletus</name>, <name type="pname">Müller</name> 1043
                  <hi rend="bold">(P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi>

               </hi> III, 12). These evidently contemporary series are confidently dated in the old catalogues to the period after the battle of Magnesia 190

               </hi>.<ref target="#CH3-n42">42</ref> But Head supposes that all the Alexanders of Miletus, <name type="pname">Müller</name> 1033-1057, belong to
               the same period, whereas <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name>

               attribution to the second century is very doubtful. There were exceptions: dated Alexander tetradrachms from Aradus go as late as 171 <hi

               also invite and deserve investigation. In publishing the Olympia Hoard <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_newell">Newell</name> called
               attention to the presence of some of those rare varieties and offered comments on them which were intended as only preliminary observations.<ref

               Alexanders belong to connected episodes or to independent ones and how they relate to the autonomous coinage.</p>
            <p>The need for more systematic study of the posthumous Alexanders is really part of a much larger one: the need for more attention to the relation
               of one Greek mint with another. The study of Greek issues city by city has, of course, been a first necessity and has not yet been completed by
               any means. Nevertheless, the independence of Greek towns, important as it is, must not obscure the fact that their careers were parallel and that
               the fiscal fabric of antiquity must be judged by coincidences as well as by consequences. But that subject far transcends the concern of these
               essays which is only a single aspect of a picture almost infinitely complex. If we pursue the types of the <name type="place">Macedonian</name>
               king into a period so long succeeding his death we may as well acknowledge that we are moved by sentiment as well as by science, and perhaps the
               best illustration that can be found of his place in the imagination of later generations is the fact that from 92 to 88 <hi rend="smallcaps">

                  elected in their place (39.1–4). He took the kings back to their fatherland, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name>
                  (39.7).</p>
               <p>319 On his death bed <name type="pname">Antipater</name> appointed Polyperchon regent and guardian (48. 4). Polyperchon invited <name
                     type="place">Olympias</name> to return from Epirus to take charge of <name type="pname">Alexander's</name> son until he should be of age
                  (49. 4, 57. 3). Eumenes in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</name> supported the kings against Anti-gonus (57. 3, 4).</p>
               <p>318 On Eumenes' advice <name type="place">Olympias</name> decided to stay in Epirus (58. 2–4). Polyperchon supported Eumenes by authority of
                  the kings (58. 1, 59. 3, 62. 1, 2). Polyperchon and the kings were in Phocis. When Cassander came to the Piraeus Polyperchon moved into Attica
                  but presently left part of the army with his son <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> while he went to the
                     <name type="place">Peloponnesus</name> (68. 2, 3).</p>
               <p>317 Eurydice assumed the regency (XIX. 11.1) (and transferred the command from Polyperchon to Cassander. <name type="pname">Justin</name> XIV.
                  5.1–3). Polyperchon, in alliance with Aeacides of Epirus brought <name type="place">Olympias</name> with <name type="pname">Alexander's</name>
                  son back to the kingdom (11. 2). <name type="pname">Eurydice's</name> army deserted her at sight of <name type="place">Olympias</name>; <name
                     type="pname">Philip</name> and <name type="pname">Eurydice</name> were captured and killed (11. 2–7).</p>
               <p>We may suppose that <name type="pname">Eurydice's</name> activity caused the change of affairs between 318 and 317.</p>

               <p>At once after the settlement of the question about the kingship the satrapies were dealt out, and there was a second distribution in 321 at
                  the conference of Triparadeisus. From the point of view of the control of mint cities the result was very strangely proportioned. A full

               <p>In the earlier year both the kings were with Polyperchon in Phocis. He apparently did not take them with him to the <name type="place"

                  for his rival Cassander. It will have been at this time that Eurydice (who may have come back to <name type="place"
                     corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> in 321 with the kings) achieved her coup d'état which must have been accompanied by the
                  return of <name type="pname">Philip</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> and the flight of <name

                  Polyperchon is not quite clear. He generally speaks and acts in the name of "the kings," making no distinction between them, but when he
                  invited <name type="place">Olympias</name> to return to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_macedonia">Macedonia</name> to take care of

               <hi rend="bold">THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The following list is intended to serve a restricted purpose: to give a chronological framework for the years while <name type="pname"
                  >Alexander's</name> types were being issued by the Conqueror and his successors, and to mention some of the events which may be of importance
               for the understanding of those issues. Of course, it is not a history of the period, which would include much material foreign to this inquiry.
               Such histories are available in Vol. VI of the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Ancient History;</hi> Karl Julius Beloch, <hi rend="italic"

               these works, though many have appeared since their publication which must be sought for in the periodicals.</p>
            <p>Under each entry I have set a reference to the ancient source. In the interests of brevity I have generally given one reference only, though the
               event may be attested in a number of places, since it is the fact and not its interpretation which is important to us; when there are more
               references than one it is because the second provides some important information which the first does not. The commonest ancient Greek
               chronological system is the list of eponymous archons of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</name>. I have used the archon
               years, indicating closer dating only when some evidence is given in the source.</p>
            <p>The only continuous ancient account that we have is that of Diodorus of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> whose Greek
                  <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Historica,</hi> in 40 books, was written under Caesar and Augustus. Books XVII-XX, which deal with our period,
               are preserved complete. The work is invaluable but very fallible; the author used good sources and used them assiduously, but his power of
               organization was not equal to the demands of constructing a world history. He was not unaware of the seriousness of the difficulties, and in XX.
               43. 7 he makes apology for history which cannot present simultaneously simultaneous events. But his attempt to combine episodic treatment with a
               chronological reckoning by Roman consuls (who took office in January) and Attic archons (who took office in July) has led to great confusion
               which the ingenuity of modern scholarship has not wholly dispelled, and never will. Nevertheless, I have followed their conclusions— <pb n="95"/>
               fortunately fairly harmonious for this period—as best I could, and have not indicated the places where I depart from his chronology. Nor have I
               called attention to his errors as to consuls and archons. To have argued the justification for these deviations would have occupied a quite
               unreasonable amount of space, and might not have been convincing in the end.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> The chronology here presented may be
               called reasonably orthodox at the present time. There is a Loeb Library text and translation of Diodorus XVIII-XX by Russel M Geer: Vol. IX,
               1929; Vol. X, 1933.</p>
            <p>For the lifetime of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> a more reliable source is <hi rend="italic">The Anabasis

            <p>The sparse references to other authors and to inscriptions should not mislead the reader into supposing that the scattered evidence for this
               period is slight. On the contrary, it is abundant, but very little of it provides otherwise unknown events for such a list as this.</p>
            <p>It will be seen that our main authorities are far later than their subjects and though that has little importance for this study, for general
               historical purposes it is important to know where they got their information and how they used it. A characteristically brilliant analysis of the
               sources for <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> is to be found in <name type="pname">W. W. Tarn's</name>
               <hi rend="italic">Alexander the Great,</hi>
               <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2653941">Cambridge</name>, 1948, Vol. II, <pb n="96"/> pp. 1-133, while Beloch's much briefer "Quellen und
               Literatur," Vol. IV, Part 2, pp. 1-19, deals also, to some extent, with modern works as well as with ancient. Lionel Pearson's book, <hi
                  rend="italic">The Lost Histories of Alexander the Great, Philological Monographs XX,</hi> American Philological Association, 1960, which
               appeared too late for me to use extensively, will be found to contain a great deal of valuable criticism.</p>
            <p>The composition of the list—the decision which items to include and which to exclude—has been difficult and has certainly been imperfect.
               Something of the kind has already been done in the "Zeittafeln" of Beloch, Vol. Ill, Part 2, pp. 450-464 and Vol. IV, Part 2, pp. 623-639, which
               I have found very helpful, but those were not devised to serve our special need. Since we are concerned with the striking of coins, the basic
               question is: who was in control of a certain territory at a certain time? Generally the answer bears on the operation of particular mints, but
               sometimes it is important to know that a ruler controlled such-and-such a place but did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> operate a mint there. When we
               know the location of a mint—as we do of the most important ones—we can follow its history and fortunes so far as the sources give us information,
               which is not as complete as one could wish. There are others, to be sure, not yet exactly located, as to which there is perhaps more to be known
               than we realize, and future scholars may wish that this or that piece of information had been included. But it is not my purpose here to record
               every mention of every place that has or may have connection with a mint. I am trying to give more general guidance, and since the decision that
               an item is worth citing must be a subjective one, I cannot hope that the reader's judgment will always coincide with mine. I have omitted, with
               entire confidence, all reference to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily"
                  >Sicily</name>, and to <name type="place">Cyrene</name> after its first surrender to <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</name>. I have omitted, with less feeling of certainty, affairs in Epirus, Aetolia and the barbarian countries of Asia lying
               outside the empire. I do not believe that any of these produced Alexander coins during the period treated—but I may turn out to have been
               mistaken.</p>
            <p>Since others besides <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</name> struck his types and name it has been necessary to
               carry the entries down beyond the date of his death. But as posthumous Alexanders appear very much later I have had to set a terminus, and the

               Later revivals, by younger rulers, are brief and intermittent phenomena for which a complete chronology is not so necessary. The list might have
               been continued to the death of Cassander in 297, for Cassander also never issued his own types in the noble metals, but the portion of Diodorus
               which is complete ends with the 20th book, just before <pb n="97"/> Ipsus, and thereafter the materials for an outline are even less satisfactory
               than before. It has seemed wise to deal with later issues separately without trying to work them into an historic scheme.</p>
