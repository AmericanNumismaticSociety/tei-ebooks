            <p>The subject of this study is a hoard consisting of twenty-nine silver pieces unearthed<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> on November 15th, 1930, at Dura "in the street west of the 'Cistern House,' against the wall of the house at the floor level of the big room to the south of the central court of that house." The hoard, when found, presented a compact and rounded mass, the individual coins of which were heavily corroded and closely adhering to each other. The outer surfaces of this conglomerate mass showed distinct traces left by the mesh of the cloth which once had served as a container to the hoard, but which was now completely rotted away. The roundish shape of the lump further attested the fact that this container had apparently once been some sort of cloth purse or bag.</p>
             <p>The heavy corrosion and close adherence of the coins rendered them illegible, and therefore the entire mass was subjected by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Dr. Bellinger</name> to an electrolytic bath. This immersion was successful in disintegrating the lump into its component parts and the coins were finally carefully cleaned, one by one, by the writer. The following specimens, comprising twenty-two tetradrachms, six denarii and one an-toninianus, eventually emerged :</p>

It had not proved feasible to weigh the coins before cleaning as they were not only too heavily corroded but also closely stuck together. The metallic composition of these coins is known to have originally contained a large proportion of copper, which copper—by the slow electrolytic action to which the coins have been subjected in the earth for some seventeen hundred years—had gradually become deposited upon the surface of each coin where it turned to verdegris. The removal of this verdegris by the process of cleaning reduces considerably the weight of the coin. Thus our tetradrachms, in addition to toss of weight incurred by many years of circulation in ancient times, are also lighter by the amount of copper which their alloy had once contained.</p>

                <p>The composition of our hoard, as made evident by the preceding catalogue, is, to say the least, rather extraordinary. Even more surprising (if that were possible) is the list of things we should have every right to expect to be present but which are curiously lacking. And yet, as stated above, the coins had been corroded into a single compact mass and this unbroken mass—just as it was lifted from the ground by the discoverers and sent to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4839366">New Haven</name> for cleaning and study—proves conclusively that the hoard must be considered as having reached us absolutely intact.</p>
                <p>The Fifth Dura Hoard, as it lies before us, is composed of four distinct groups of coins well separated from each other by their denominations and the date of their several coinings. First, both in point of time and number, come the fifteen posthumous tetradrachms bearing the name and types of the Seleucid king <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q263489">Philip Philadelphus</name>. It has been shown<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> by the present writer that these tetradrachms represent a late re-issue of Seleucid type brought out by the city of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> in the days of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Julius Caesar</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_octavian">Octavian</name> his successor. The dates which these coins bear are calculated according to the Era of Pharsalia established by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_julius_caesar">Julius Caesar</name> himself. In the Dura Hoard we find the more or less legible dates Δ,ς,⊙, IB, ⊙I, K, KA (or ΚΔ?), ςK—representing various years between 46/5 and 24/3 B.C. Even the specimens with illegible dates (nos. 12-15) can scarcely be later than 17/6 B.C. which represents the. latest known date which has come down to us of
<pb n="8"/>
this particular series. Our coins are all very much worn.</p>
                <p>The second group comprises seven imperial tetradrachms, also from the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> mint,<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> bearing portraits of <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_nero">Nero</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_galba">Galba</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_titus">Titus</name>, together with dates running from ς/HP (59-60 A.D.) under <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_nero">Nero</name> to '′Eτoυς Γ (72-73 A.D.) under <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_titus">Titus</name>. These coins, too, all show evidences of long circulation and, in fact, are hardly less worn than nos. 1 to 15.</p>
                <p>Thus between the first and second groups of tetradrachms our hoard displays a hiatus of over eighty years duration unrelieved by even a single specimen of the rather common tetradrachm struck at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> by <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</name> bearirfg his portrait and a representation of the seated Tyche. This fact, while curious, is not without precedent. The identical phenomenon recurs in a much larger hoard from Nineveh which has recently been published by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_68994178">Dr. Hill</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> In this there turned up no less than one hundred and twenty-one of the posthumous Seleucid type tetradrachms from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Roman Antioch</name>, together with a few tetradrachms of <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_nero">Nero</name> (the earliest, as in our hoard, dated ς/HP or
<pb n="9"/>
59/60 A.D.) and his successors. Apparently, then, in and about the Mesopotamian region these posthumous Seleucid coins continued to circulate in considerable numbers down to a comparatively late date.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref>
               </p>
                <p>The third group contains six imperial denarii from the mint at Rome, all being in a good, some in even a fine state of preservation. The earliest is a denarius of Trajan issued between the years 114 and 117 A.D.; the latest are a denarius of Commodus (struck in 184-5 A.D.) and an undated one of his wife Crispina issued about the same time. In other words we have here a group of six coins, better preserved than any of those in the first and second groups, struck between the years <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 114 and 185 A.D. Not only do they thus cover a period of some seventy years but their earliest is later by over forty years than the latest issue (no. 22) of the immediately preceding group. This contrasts with the above-mentioned Nineveh hoard which contained an unbroken series of denarii running from <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_galba">Galba</name> to and including the dynasty of the Severi and thus are closely linked, in point of time, with the accompanying imperial tetradrachms of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> mint.</p>
               <pb n="10"/>
                <p>Lastly, and strangest of all in view of what precedes, comes the solitary antoninianus (no. 29) bearing the portrait of Valerian Senior. This coin is known<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> to have been struck between the years 253 and 260 A.D. and is thus nearly seventy years later than the latest issues (nos. 27 and 28) of Group III! Thus the Fifth Dura Hoard represents a rather curious state of affairs somewhat difficult to explain. According to the excavators and to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Dr. Bellinger</name> who had charge of the cleaning, there can be no doubt but that the coins had all been amalgamated by corrosion into a single lump, thus proving beyond any possible doubt that the hoard before us is intact and that the coins were buried at one and the same time.</p>
               <p>Leaving aside no. 29, whose present poor condition allows of no conjecture as to its original state of preservation when buried, the three first groups show varying stages of wear proportionate to their several ages. Thus, Group I is entirely composed of very much worn coins. Group II, as a whole, is somewhat less worn and one of its specimens (no. 19) is actually still in a very good state of preservation. Group III is composed of even better preserved coins than the immediately preceding lot, some of the pieces showing but slight signs of circulation. If the hoard had ended here one would be justified in considering it to have been put away some time in the reign of Commodus, or shortly afterwards. One would sur-
<pb n="11"/>
                   mise that its former owner had felt a peculiar predilection for tetradrachms of the posthumous <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q263489">Philip Philadelphus</name> type and had thereunto added others of <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_nero">Nero</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_galba">Galba</name> and <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_titus">Titus</name>, the while (following some idiosyncracy of his own) rejecting the at least equally common tetradrachms of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_vespasian">Vespasian</name> and <name type="pname">Trajan</name>—to say nothing of the somewhat scarcer but far from rare tetradrachms of Domitian, Nerva, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius and the young Commodus. Neither any available analysis nor the experiences of many years of active collecting would suggest that the rejected types represent coins of poorer alloy than those actually chosen. The denarii (nos. 23-8) accompanying the tetradrachms were probably selected because of their generally good condition, earlier denarii from <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_nero">Nero</name> to Trajan being by <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 190 A.D. presumably already in a noticeably more worn condition. The total absence of denarii of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius would suggest that the accumulation of Group III, at least, took place after the Parthian conquests of Lucius Verus and the absorption of the Dura-Europos district into the Roman Empire.</p>
               <p>The unexpected—and one might almost say unwelcome—presence of Valerian's lone coin (no. 29) considerably alters the whole aspect of the hoard. Because of the presence of this one piece the hoard could not possibly have been put away finally until the middle of the third century A.D. And if "buried" at this late date how is one to account for its consequently somewhat extraordinary composition? The first and second Dura hoards<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> recently published by
<pb n="12"/>
                   <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Dr. Bellinger</name> give an excellent idea of what must assuredly have constituted the ordinary circulating medium at Dura-Europos immediately preceding the fall of the city in 256 <name type="pname">A.D. Barring</name> copper coins representing "small change," the general circulating medium evidently consisted almost exclusively of Antiochene tetradrachms from Septimius Severus to Trebonianus and Volusianus, together with imperial "antoniniani" from Caracalla to Valerianus and Gallienus. With the exception of no. 29 not one of these coins is represented in the present board. It is therefore difficult to believe that any of our twenty-eight pieces were actually circulating as late as <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 250 A.D. But granting this for sake of argument, then we must admit that the former owner of our hoard had evidently rejected all Syrian and Imperial Roman issues later than Septimius Severus (perhaps because of their increasingly inferior metal) and, further, had made a very rigid selection of the earlier currency passing through his hands, laying aside only tetradrachms struck before <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 73<hi rend="italic"/> A.D. (not including those of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_vespasian">Vespasian</name>, etc.) and certain denarii of the two last Antonines. All of which is decidedly strange.</p>
               <p>In the light of the above mentioned Nineveh Hoard, and especially in the light of two further hoards since found in Dura,<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> our Nos. 1 to 28 inclusive form a group distinctly reminiscent of an epoch earlier than the date at which our hoard was actually abandoned. Nos. 1-28, then, when taken as a group, appear clearly
<pb n="13"/>
anomalous in a hoard from <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 256 A.D. and so would seem to suggest either that the last owner of our hoard (he of the "Antoninianus" of Valerian) had inherited<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> it or had been the lucky finder of an earlier accumulation, and that, into this—for some reason known only to himself—he had placed a coin of his own time and generation.</p>
                <p>In any case, the presence of Valerian's coin is absolutely definitive and fixes the date <hi rend="italic">post quem</hi> for the final abandonment of our hoard. It must therefore be compared with the "First and Second Dura Hoards" described by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34584084">Dr. Bellinger</name> and proved by him to have been buried not earlier and probably, also, not later than <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 256-7 A.D.

Dura-Europos, and because of the apparent date of destruction of associated buildings and inscriptions, the interment of these several hoards must be directly connected with the final assault and capture of the fortress of Dura by the Persians<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> under Sapor I—an event which for historical reasons could only have taken place in the year 256-7 A.D. At that time the city was sacked and burned by the enemy and ever afterward remained deserted except, perhaps, for a small Persian military post, or such wandering Arab tribes as from time to time may have used it as a temporary camping site.</p>
               <p>However curious the actual composition of our present hoard may seem, we must take it as chance has decreed—gratefully accepting the lone coin of Valerian as definite proof that our treasure had been finally abandoned in 256-7 A.D. The word <hi rend="italic">abandoned,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">buried,</hi> is here advisedly used as the finder's report clearly states that the little mass of conglomerated coins was actually found "...in the street ... against the wall of the house at the floor level ..." Obviously the hoard would not have been placed deliberately in such a position but, more probably, had been lost there by some terrified citizen fleeing the enemy, or inadvertently dropped by an over-burdened looter in the frenzied confusion attending the sack of the city by the victorious Persian soldiery.</p>

                   <p>In this regard only the coin of <name type="pname" corresp="nomisma_titus">Titus</name> (no. 22) is open to doubt.

Mus. Cat., Greek Coins of Phoenicia, pp. cxxxvii-cxxxix, is distinctly hesitant about attributing these pieces to Tyre.

                   <p>It is extremely interesting to find these posthumous tetradrachms of <name type="pname" corresp="#wikidata_Q263489">Philip Philadelphus</name> in two late Roman hoards, evidently circulating alongside of Imperial Roman tetradrachms from the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> mint. Their presence in these particular hoards further substantiates the evidences, deduced by the present writer from their types and style alone, that they must have been issued posthumously some years after the fall of the Seleucid empire and after the last direct scion of the royal house of Seleucus had long been dead. In fact, this late revival under Roman rule of Seleucid types with royal portrait, name and titles constitutes one of the curiosities of numismatics.</p>

                   <p>Admitting this much, should we logically go still further, attempting to account for the <hi rend="italic">three</hi> distinct groups into which nos. 1-28 seem to fall? Is it that we have in these coins, as it were, a family estate handed down from father to son for many generations—in other words the savings of a whole dynasty of dwellers in Dura? Were nos. 1-15 accumulated by some great-great-grandfather living in the days of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</name>? Following this line of speculation then, the succeeding heir must have flourished under the Flavians and added nos. 16-22 to the family fortune, leaving it, in turn, to some descendant who in the days of the later Antonines added his modest savings of six denarii (nos. 23-28) to the family estate. The final heir, perhaps a bit of a spendthrift, added but one debased coin to the accumulated pile—only to abandon the lot in the terror of the final days of Dura's existence. But this grows rapidly more improbable, and as there exist numerous evident objections (such, for instance, as the different stages of wear exhibited by the several groups) the whole somewhat amusing speculation had best be rejected without further comment.</p>
