               125th anniversary celebration in the fall of 1983. One year later, the first Coinage of the Americas Conference became a reality.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present
               papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all interested in the
               topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants to come to know the Society's collections and library
               better during the days of the conference.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Presented herein are the papers delivered at the third annual Coinage of the Americas Conference. They incorporate a good deal of original
               research in an area of American coinage which had been neglected until recent years. The quality and scope of the studies published in this
               volume indicates that work on America's silver coinage has advanced significantly in a remarkably short time.</p>
            <p>It is noteworthy that a number of the presentations (and the research that made them possible) have been joint studies. These collaborative
               efforts, which put the common goal of sharing new information above the private one of ego satisfaction, might be expected of those who gave us
               the monumental, jointly-authored, Early <placeName>United States Dimes</placeName>, but it is still sufficiently rare in American numismatics
               to excite and deserve comment.</p>
            <p>The papers focus attention in three areas-the first concerns the obverse and reverse dies used for early American coinage. We are constantly
               discovering new coinage varieties, and the authors included here have approached the problem from a number of dif-ferent aspects. <persName>David Davis</persName> has examined half dimes in detail, linking scholars and discoveries in the past to his work in the present. He
               has also indicated the current state of research in the area: so much is now being done that a new book on the denomination will soon appear.
                  <persName>John McCloskey</persName> works in the later <persName>Gobrecht</persName> series, examining changes in the actual hubs
               used to prepare the working dies for that coinage. He justly notes that these changes, which tended to be of a subtle nature, laid unnoticed for
               over a century, and are only now receiving the attention they deserve, the result of a larger group of collectors examining the coinage with
               greater care than previously. <persName>McCloskey</persName> divides his hub changes into three <pb n="x"/> categories, linked to the larger
               world of which they formed a part. Elsewhere, he writes "we are still uncovering information about these beautiful silver coins of the 19th
               century and only through the systematic study of these pieces will we ever be able to clear up the many mysteries that still remain about our
               coinage of this period." These words may be understood as the theme for this entire Coinage of the Americas Conference.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Randall Wiley</persName> and <persName>William Bugert</persName> continue this close look at the coins. <persName>Wiley</persName> concentrates on a select group of half dollars from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>
               mint, chosen as a specific example of what he aptly refers to as the "divide and conquer" approach to understanding coinage of the <persName>Gobrecht</persName> design. <persName>Bugert</persName> examines several rare half dollars from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>
               facilities, in the process demonstrating that new information is still being gathered on the actual places where American coins were struck: a
               half dollar of 1840, which we assumed came from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, turns out to
               have been made in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>. <persName>Harry X Boosel</persName> rounds out this
               first category of presentations, with a paper on the issues of 1873. <persName>Boosel</persName>, of course, demonstrated many years ago
               that there are two varieties of the three in the date of all coins struck that year, including silver ones. But he now puts these issues into the
               larger context of historical events which were taking place at the time. He also provides welcome documentation for the reasons for the adoption
               of different numeral punches for 1873 dates.</p>
            <p>This conference has also been notable in that it has afforded us looks at another, different set of dies, one which we would not ordinarily
               consider, but one which was a very important component of every American silver coin struck during the first 45 years of the mint's existence.
               That is, our dollars and half dollars sported lettered edges in those days, while our smaller coins bore reeded ones, applied in all cases by
               means of a third set of dies, working in what was called a "Caistaing" machine. <persName>Ivan Leaman</persName> and <persName>Donald Gunnet</persName> have discovered, and have aptly demonstrated, that there was a system—a fairly consistent sequence of employment
               relating to the edge dies in use at any particular time. In so doing, they have given us a most powerful new tool to ascertain coinage emission
               at the early mint. In a happy bit of accidental numismatic collaboration, <persName>Russell Logan</persName> has devised a new way of
               photographing the edges of these coins, at a time when it is increasingly necessary to do so.</p>
            <pb n="xi"/>
            <p>The discoveries of <persName>Leaman</persName> and <persName>Gunnet</persName> lead us into the third area to which the conference
               participants have devoted themselves, which we might term mint practices and production sequences. As with work on the dies, the authors in this
               last category have tended to confine their attentions to coins of a single series. In another joint paper, <persName>Allen
                  Lovejoy</persName> and <persName>William Subjack</persName> have examined one of the workhorses of the early coinage system, the dime, and
               they give a vivid picture of the practices and difficulties surrounding its production at the fledgling mint. They also give much new information
               on early dime varieties; it was their expertise in this respect which was responsible for their being asked to contribute to the book on early
               dimes mentioned previously. <persName>Robert Hilt</persName> has devoted his attention to the first half dollars, and, in particular, to how
               dies for those first American coins were produced and organized for use. His book on the subject was published in 1980; the occasion of this
               conference provided him with the opportunity to share his recent work and to explain the reasoning behind his basic conclusions. <persName>Robert Stark</persName> looks at the early dollars, examining their origins and production in detail, explaining the difficulties
               surrounding the first issues of these, the keystones of the entire federal monetary system. The difficulties he outlines in the adoption and
               striking of the denomination cause us to marvel that any were ever coined, and, as he points out, the career of these early dollars was an
               unhappy and a brief one. <persName>David Cohen</persName> examines dollars too, but the much later ones of the <persName>Gobrecht</persName> design. He is investigating a particular technological problem, the use of the date logotype, essential in the
               mass-production techniques which were being applied to American coinage dies by the middle of the nineteenth century. Very little work has yet
               been done on the problem in this country, and <persName>Mr. Cohen's</persName> efforts will be most appreciated.</p>
            <p>All of the above might be called common practice at the early mint-that is, how it prepared the dies and struck the coins. Some details of this
               practice have long been known, while people such as our participants are now discovering others. But there was also what might be called un
               common practice, things which the coiners did in private, for personal gain, and which have only been discovered in recent times-if they have
               been discovered at all. Once people began collecting coins, it could hardly have been otherwise. The <placeName>Renaissance</placeName> saw
               the phenomenon called <placeName>Paduans</placeName>-faithful and not-so-faithful replicas of <placeName>Roman</placeName> sestertii. The
               gifted <persName>Karl Wilhelm Becker</persName> produced brilliant forgeries of virtually every well-known, and hence collectible, coin, and
               his forgeries bedeviled collectors <pb n="xii"/> in the last century and continue to be a problem for museum curators in this one. But the early
               forgers had been enterprising individuals, not usually connected to an official mint, and they tended to confine their attentions to ancient
               forgeries, not modern fantasies.</p>
            <p>But in the years around 1850, corrupt individuals in an official coining facility did begin producing instant rarities for the delectation of
               collectors. Unfortunately, the mint in question was located in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, and before the forgers were done, they had created one of the two <placeName>United States</placeName> coins about
               which everyone, regardless of collecting interest, has heard-the 1804 dollar (the other coin, a Liberty nickel of 1913, was created for similar
               reasons and under similar circumstances a half century later). In the early 1960s, two intrepid numismatic researchers, <persName>Eric
                  P. Newman</persName> and <persName>Kenneth Bressett</persName>, set out to unravel the mystery and misunderstanding surrounding the 1804
               dollar. By most accounts, they succeeded brilliantly, in a bit of numismatic detective work which has inspired a generation of later writers. And
               now, as we approach the silver anniversary of the publication of The Fantastic 1804 Dollar, they have presented us with a paper on developments
               in the story of the coin since they last published on it. As they demonstrate, the controversy continues. But this questioning, the presentation
               and refutation of new opinion, new information, merely serves to inform us that study on early American silver coinage is in a healthy state, and
               that we can expect more revelations, more controversy, in the years to come.</p>

            <p>Coinage of the Americas Conference at The American Numismatic Society, <placeName>New York City</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>— The American Numismatic Society, 1987</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>Two events occurred in 1873 which contributed to the produc-tion during that year of the largest number of varieties of silver coins of any year
               in U.S. Mint history, without regard to die breaks, recutting of dies, errors, size and position of mint marks, and the like. All varieties are
               discernible to the naked eye or with a low powered glass.</p>
            <p>The first event of importance was a letter dated January 18, 1873, from <persName>A. Louden Snowden</persName>, Chief Coiner of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint, to the <persName>Honorable James Pollock</persName>,
               Director of the U.S. Mint.<ref target="#CH2-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <q>I desire in a formal manner to direct your attention to the 'figures' used in dating the dies for the present year.</q>
            <q>They are so heavy, and the space between each, so small, that upon the smaller gold and silver, and upon the base coins, it is impossible to
               distinguish with the naked eye, whether the last figure is an eight or a three.</q>
            <q>In our ordinary coinage, many of the pieces are not fully brought up, and upon such it is impossible to distinguish what is the last figure of
               this year's date.</q>
            <q>I do not think it creditable to the institution that the coinage of the year should be issued bearing this defect in the date.</q>
            <q>I would recommend that an entire new set of figures, avoiding the defects of those now in use, be prepared at the earliest possible day. (See
                  <ref target="#fig-2">fig. 1</ref>.)</q>
            <figure xml:id="fig-2">
               <graphic url="COAC3_002.jpg"/>
               <p>Fig. 1</p>
            </figure>
            <p>This, of course, resulted in the now well-known "Open 3s and Closed 3s" of that year. No one had publicized this change prior to my research on
               the coinage of 1873, beginning in 1950. <persName>Beistle</persName>
               <ref target="#CH2-n2">2</ref>
               <pb n="3"/> had mentioned an 1873 half dollar without arrows, with a 3 more open than all others without arrows.</p>
            <p>Most numismatic research is accomplished by studying the coins themselves. Based on the <placeName>Snowden</placeName> letter and <persName>Beistle</persName>, I undertook to find the changes, if any, in the numeral 3 on all 1873 coins.</p>
            <p>The other event affecting the silver coinage of 1873 was the Coinage Act of 1873, approved by President Grant on February 12,<ref target="#CH2-n3">3</ref> to take effect on April 1.</p>
            <p>That legislation changed the weight of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> dimes, quarters, and half dollars to metric
               standards, increasing the weights slightly. The dimes were increased by .01g, the quarters by .03g, and the half dollars by .06g. Since the Act
               specifically designated the coins to be minted and their respective weights, the mint could not issue any silver coins after April 1, 1873, which
               did not conform to the Act, whether coined prior to April 1 or after. The standard silver dollar was not authorized or mentioned in the Act.</p>
            <p>The following silver coins were minted in 1873 at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint,
               for general circulation, prior to April 1: the half dime, dime, quarter and half dollar without arrows, and the standard silver dollar, none of
               which could be issued after March 31, 1873, because they did not conform to the Act.</p>
            <p>A precedent had been set in 1853 for a weight change in silver coins, so the Mint followed that in 1873 by placing reversed arrows pointing
               outward from the sides of the date on dimes, quarters, and half dollars, to show the increase in weight. But the 3 cent piece, made only in proof
               and prior to April 1, the half dime and standard silver dollar were not authorized or mentioned in the Act, and thus were discontinued. The trade
               dollar was authorized in the Act, and its coinage commenced on July 11, 1873,<ref target="#CH2-n4">4</ref> after substantial design problems.</p>
            <p>There are thus 9 different weight silver coins which were issued in 1873 for general circulation. They are: the half dime, two different dimes,
               quarters and half dollars, the standard silver dollar, and the trade dollar, all from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint. We also have the Open and Closed 3s in the dimes, quarters and half
               dollars without arrows (see <ref target="#fig-3">fig. 2</ref>), and the half dollars with large and small arrows (see <ref target="#fig-4">fig.
                  3</ref>), as well as what can be called the "4-striper" half dollar with small arrows, caused by a bounced die. All half dollars made from
               1839 through 1891 have the vertical bars of Liberty's shield in groups of three. This 1873 variety is the only one that has them in groups of 4.
               It is unmentioned in <persName>Beistle</persName> and, thus, is my discovery (see <ref target="#fig-5">fig. 4</ref>).<ref target="#CH2-n5">5</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In major varieties there are therefore 15 different business strike <pb n="4"/>

               <head>The "Crime of 1873"</head>
               <p>The Coinage Act of 1873 is often referred to as the "Crime of 1873 " Why was it called a "Crime," and is that justified?</p>
               <p>The Act of 1873 had a long and devious history, going back as far as 1867. In that year an International Monetary Conference was <pb n="6"/>
                  held in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, and our representative was <persName>Samuel B. Ruggles</persName>, a
                  member of the Chamber of Commerce of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. Senator <persName>John
                     Sherman</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</placeName>, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, con-veyed a message
                  to Ruggles to press for a single international coinage standard—gold.</p>
               <p>In June 1868 Senator <persName>Sherman</persName>, who also attended the conference, made a report to the <placeName>United
                     States</placeName> Senate in favor of a "single coinage standard, exclusively of gold." In the same year, <persName>Sherman</persName>
                  introduced a bill in the Senate, having the same objective: a single standard of gold.<ref target="#CH2-n9">9</ref> This bill was accompanied
                  by letters of approbation from Secretary of the Treasury <persName>George S. Boutwell</persName>, Deputy Comptroller <persName>John Jay Knox</persName>, and various reports and recommendations from subordinate officials of the Treasury Department, including the mint.
                  But there was nothing in any of the reports that indicated the slightest comprehension of the economic effect of demonetizing silver.</p>
               <p>Senator <persName>Sherman</persName> introduced Senate bills in the two succeeding Congresses to effect his goal of making gold the sole
                  standard of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. His bill of April 28, 1870, included "revising the laws relating to the Mints, Assay
                  Offices, and coinage of the <placeName>United States</placeName>," which, of course, was referred to the Senate Finance Committee of which
                     <persName>Sherman</persName> was Chairman. On December 19 <persName>Sherman</persName> reported the bill back to the Senate with
                  some amendments, among which was a charge for coinage of silver brought into the mints.</p>
               <p>The bill was adopted in committee January 9, 1871, as amended, and passed the whole Senate but with the amendment calling for a charge for
                  coinage striken out. It is interesting to note that <persName>Sherman</persName>, who had voted for the amendment to charge for coinage
                  in committee, voted against it when the bill reached the Senate floor on January 10 and was sent to the House the same day.</p>
               <p>In the House of Representatives, the bill was bandied back and forth between the committee and the floor for over one year. <persName>Samuel Hooper</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>, on April 19, 1872, in a debate in support of
                  the bill, let drop a remark in the House which helps to explain the origin of the carefully laid plot to change the money standard of the
                     <placeName>United States</placeName>. He made this admission: "<persName>Mr. Ernst Seyd</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, a distinguished writer who has given great attention to the mints and coinage, after examining the
                  first draft of this bill, has furnished many valuable suggestions, which have been incorporated in this bill" (italics added). It is not known
                  what parts of the bill <persName>Mr. Seyd</persName> furnished. It is highly improbable that he came all the way from <persName>London</persName> to make suggestions about the basis for our coinage, the practical running of our mints or about the devices on our coins.
                     <pb n="7"/> We will hear about <persName>Mr. Seyd</persName> again.</p>
               <p>On May 27, 1872, the same <persName>Mr. Hooper</persName> offered a substitute bill in the House, which, after much argument, was finally
                  voted on and approved, without even having been read.<ref target="#CH2-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The next day it went back to the Senate, and again was referred to committee. Senator <persName>Sherman</persName> finally called the
                  bill up before the Senate on January 17, 1873. The Senate passed it and, since it had been amended, it went to conference and was approved by
                  both houses on February 12, 1873. President Grant, deferring to Congress, approved it the same day, to take effect on April 1, 1873.</p>
               <p>An undated pamphlet, "The Crime of 1873," was printed about 1895 by the American Bimetallic Union, which had offices in the Sun Building,
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>, DC, and 134 Monroe Street, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-n11">11</ref> Near the end of the pamphlet is a copy of an affidavit, dated May 9, 1892, sworn to before
                  the Clerk of the <placeName>Colorado</placeName> Supreme Court, by a prominent <placeName>Colorado</placeName> citizen, <persName>Frederick A. Luckenbach</persName>. In the affidavit, <persName>Mr. Luckenbach</persName> stated that he had become
                  acquainted with <persName>Mr. Ernst Seyd</persName> of <persName>London</persName> in 1865, and had visited with him and his family
                  on every trip <placeName>Luchenbach</placeName> made to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. That in February
                  1874, <persName>Luckenbach</persName> was visiting with <persName>Seyd</persName>, when the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> papers had hints of corruption in Parliament, and he commented on it. <persName>Seyd</persName> then told <persName>Luckenbach</persName>, "If you will pledge me your honor as a gentlemen not to divulge what I am
                  about to tell you while I live...." Given the pledge, <persName>Seyd</persName> continued, "I went to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in the winter of 1872-73, authorized to secure, if I could, passage of a bill demonetizing
                  silver. It was in the interests of those I represented—the governors of the <persName>Bank of England</persName>—to have it done. I took
                  with me 100,000 pounds sterling, with instructions if that was not sufficient to accomplish the object, to draw another 100,000 pounds, or as
                  much as was necessary. I saw the committees of the House and Senate, paid the money and stayed in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> until I knew the measure was safe." At that time, —100,000 sterling was equal to $500,000.</p>
               <p>The Honorable <persName>Thomas Fitch</persName> of <placeName>Nevada</placeName>, at a later Silver Convention in <placeName>St. Louis</placeName>, said to great applause: <q>That the nation which consumes 50% and produces but 7% of the world's supply of silver,
                     beguiled the nation which produces nearly 50% and consumes 25% of the world's supply of silver, into a conspiracy to strike 35% of the
                     value of silver. The nation which is the biggest importer of wheat in the world, inveigled the nation which is the greatest exporter of
                     wheat in the world into a financial and commercial dead-fall where 35% <pb n="8"/> was taken from the value of the wheat. The nation whose
                     looms would be idle, and whose people would be hungry, and whose government would be upheaved upon a storm of riot without a supply of
                     American cotton, deceived the nation which is the biggest producer of cotton, into striking 35% of the value of the cotton. Why, Gentlemen,
                        <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> is the bunco steerer of the world, and <persName>Uncle Sam</persName>
                     is the gentleman from the rural districts.<ref target="#CH2-n12">12</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is now evident who was responsible for the Crime of 1873. Some of the effects of the Coinage Act of 1873 were:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Act destroyed free coinage. Prior to its enactment, anyone could bring foreign silver coins or bullion to the mints and have it
                     coined into <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> silver coins free of charge. The Act abolished this option, and
                     depositors had to sell it to the mints or have it cast into ingots. The only exception was that it could be coined into trade dollars for
                     the depositor. But trade dollars were being discounted by merchants and brokers, and no one really wanted them.</item>
                  <item>2. In abolishing the standard silver dollar by omitting it from the Act, the gold dollar of 25 8/10 grains was designated as the only
                     monetary standard of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. In effect, silver was demonetized. The Act specified the weight of the
                     subsidiary silver coins in "grams," and the weight of the gold coins in "grains." Prior to the Act, all gold minted in the <placeName>United States</placeName> was stated in values equal to silver dollars, which had been the standard, and the same weight, from
                     the inception of the mint to 1873. Gold coins had been changed in weight on two previous occasions.<ref target="#CH2-n13">13</ref>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Silver coins were changed by the Act from unlimited legal tender to only $5, but, unintentionally and inadvertently, the trade dollar
                     also became legal tender to $5. However, its legal tender was eliminated by the Act of July 22, 1876,<ref target="#CH2-n14">14</ref> and it
                     was finally demonetized on March 3, 1887, with holders given six months after that date to redeem their unmutilated trade dollars for
                     silver dollars.<ref target="#CH2-n15">15</ref> Chop-marked trade dollars were not accepted. After that date, and even several decades into
                     the twentieth century, trade dollars could be purchased for less than one dollar.</item>
               </list>
               <p>At the time the Act passed, specie payments for legal tender notes had not been resumed, and the public debt was still high from the Civil War
                  obligations. Most <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Bonds were held in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, and it was in the interests of European investors that the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> debt
                  be paid in gold.</p>
               <p>By demonetizing silver, half of the metal in which bonds could be payable was deprived of monetary use for that purpose, and the other half
                  had almost doubled in value. In effect, it almost doubled <pb n="9"/> the public debt.</p>
               <p>Congress debated for many years after 1873, trying to fix the blame for the Crime of 1873, and trying to nullify the effect of the Act. The
                  Congressional Record, periodicals and newspapers were full of debates and accusations. Even most of the legislators who passed the Act were
                  not aware of the enormous impact it had on the <placeName>United States</placeName>. Even President Grant, who approved the Act, was not
                  aware of its impact.<ref target="#CH2-n16">16</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The passage of the Coinage Act of 1873 really was the Crime of 1873. The criminals have been identified, and some of the economic effects have
                  been detailed.</p>

            <p>The Industrial Revolution in the <placeName>United States</placeName> prior to the Civil War created the need for more coins. As a result,
               there was a cor-responding need for a faster and more efficient method of making dies.</p>
            <p>Primarily, three improvements at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint allowed more dies to be made in less time.
               These improvements were better materials, so that dies could withstand greater pressure without breaking, steam power to operate the presses, and
               the purchase of a transfer lathe.</p>
            <p>This article is devoted in the main to the transfer lathe, probably the most important improvement in the production of dies.</p>

               <ref target="#fig-7">Fig. 1</ref> illustrates the type of transfer lathe purchased by the mint in 1836 in order to produce a punch for the main
               design.</p>
            <p>In his major work entitled <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint and Coinage</hi>
               <ref target="#CH3-n1">1</ref>
               <persName>Taxay</persName> described how the transfer lathe operated, as follows: <q>The portrait lathe operated on the principle of a
                  three-dimensional pantograph. A long, rigid bar or lever, ran along the front of the lathe and hinged, at the farthest left-hand side, to a
                  fulcrum. At a short distance from the fulcrum a very sharp graver, or cutting tool, was fastened to the lever.The graver faced a soft
                  tool-steel cylinder (the hub blank) which was fixed on a large, solid wheel. <persName>Toward</persName> the right end of the lever, a
                  pointed steel stub was mounted directly opposite the casting.</q>
               <q>By means of a spring at the upper end, the lever was drawn in, causing the graver and the tracing point to touch the center of their
                  respective models. The models were now rotated in an equal counter-clockwise motion, with the two points gradually working their way to the
                  edge. In this duet, the tracing point was the leader, and its motions were precisely reproduced on the hub in a smaller ratio, the proportion
                  being established by the distance between the two tools. After every complete revolution, a screw mechanism lowered the right end of the lever
                  slightly, placing the two tools closer to the edge of their respective models. The entire operation was repeated several times until the
                  design was sufficiently blocked out. Even then, however, it was comparatively rough and required a good deal of hand finishing before the
                  master hub could be used to sink a master die.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The transfer lathe had certain limitations and could only be used to make a main design punch and other individual punches. The cutting of one
               positive punch containing all of the parts of the die had to wait until 1907 when the mint acquired the <persName>Janvier</persName>
               transfer lathe.</p>
            <p>We know that in 1836, the mint had the capability of making a main design punch. We also know that the mint did not yet have the capability of
               making one die by the use of a transfer lathe. Thus, the question of how master dies and master hubs were made arises.</p>
            <p>The numismatic literature available does not describe this process in detail, and therefore we must look to the numismatic evidence itself to
               arrive at a narrative account of how master dies and master hubs were made from 1836 to the end of the century.</p>
            <pb n="14"/>
            <p>An overall view of this process is shown in <ref target="#fig-8">fig. 2</ref>. There are three pieces of evidence I used in making my
               determinations: a <persName>Gobrecht</persName> die in the <persName>Smithsonian Institution collection</persName>; three die punch
               trial pieces in the American Numismatic Society collection; and the 1857 die punch trial piece reported in <persName>Judd</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-8">

            </figure>
            <p>In 1985, I had the privilege of viewing the SI collection, where I found an obverse <persName>Gobrecht</persName> die which appeared to be
               severely <pb n="15"/> worn. It did not bear <persName>Gobrecht's</persName> name and appeared to be a very early brass die (<ref target="#fig-9">fig. 3</ref>).</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-9">
               <graphic url="COAC3_015a.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <figure xml:id="fig-10">
               <graphic url="COAC3_015b.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>When I first saw this die, I thought it had been defaced so that it could no longer be used. I have now come to a different conclusion. I believe
               that the die had been lightly scored, giving it a checkerboard effect, so that additional items, such as stars or <persName>Gobrecht's</persName> name, could be added. It is interesting to note that the letters "<persName>C. Gobrecht F</persName>" were punched
               five separate places on the reverse of this die, almost as if the punch was tested first and it was later decided not to use the punch on the die
               because the die was worn out (see <ref target="#fig-10">fig. 4</ref> and punch enlargement). I therefore assume <pb n="16"/> that a new die was
               made and this one was formally retired. I also suspect that <persName>Gobrecht's</persName> name was added to this master die with one punch
               rather than individual letters. It was most likely that <persName>Gobrecht's</persName> name was to be added to this master die, and the
               checkerboard effect was to be polished off once the name was added.</p>
            <p>At the ANS, I found three die punch trial pieces, the first of which (<ref target="#fig-11">fig. 5</ref>) is a die punch trial piece showing the
               main design of one of the standard silver obverse patterns of 1869. After the transfer lathe produced the master design punch (a puncheon),
               having the size for the denomination required, this punch was struck onto a copper planchet.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-11">
               <graphic url="COAC3_016.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>After the main design was punched onto the copper planchet, a horizontal and a vertical line were drawn through the design. Thereafter, as shown
               in <ref target="#fig-12">fig. 6</ref>, a compass was used to draw two circles around the design so that the legend letters could be applied.
               After the circles were drawn, individual punches were applied with the letters "<placeName>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</placeName>" within the
               circles.</p>
            <p>In <ref target="#fig-12">fig. 6</ref>, the mint worker experimenting with the lettering made a mistake in his spacing. The last "A" in "<placeName>AMERICA</placeName>" was not punched in because, if applied, it would have fallen below the horizontal line, creating an obvious
               imbalance.</p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <figure xml:id="fig-12">

            <p>He then started over, this time starting slightly higher and placing the letters a little closer together, as exhibited in <ref target="#fig-13">fig. 7</ref>. It also appears that he experimented with the date punch.</p>

            <pb n="18"/>
            <p>Once the designer found where the motto and design should be placed on the copper piece, the same process, using the same punches, was applied to
               the master die. When the punches were properly applied, the horizontal and vertical lines were polished off the master die, which in turn was
               used to make a master hub or working hubs, and, ultimately, working dies.</p>
            <p>The denticles were added to the master die by drawing two circles around the perimeter of the die. Within these two circles, a two-denticle punch
               was applied. Each additional denticle was added by placing the first leg of the two-denticle punch into the previous slot, and was punched again,
               adding one additional denticle at a time, creating the proper interval. This process accounts for why the den-ticles vary from design to
               design.</p>

            <p>The 1857 die punch trial piece reported in <persName>Judd-Kosoff</persName> is reproduced as <ref target="#fig-14">fig. 8</ref>. This piece
               clearly shows that the Mint was able to make letters and numbers of the same style, but in various sizes. I believe that the transfer lathe was
               used to produce individual letters of the size needed for each denomination, as well as for making a single, straight-line punch of letters or
               numerals. Evidently, only a date or name in a straight line could be made in one punch. Punches that would work in a circle or arc could not be
               made with a transfer lathe. This awaited the Janvier machine in 1907.</p>

               <p>A date logotype is a number punch with two or more digits on the punch. I believe that by 1857 the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint was using a fourdigit logotype. The transfer lathe was used to make number pun- <pb n="19"/>
                  ches by approximately 1847, based upon my close inspection of Liberty Seated material of this era. Prior to 1847, the numbers ap-pearing on
                  Liberty Seated coinage were very crude, as if they were made by hand. A comparison of the digits on 1846 and 1847 coins indicates that those
                  on 1847 coins are much crisper and clearer, leading me to conclude that the transfer lathe was used to make individual digits at this
                  date.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Taxay</persName> has argued that a two-digit logotype was used on large cents and half dollars in 1840, and a three-digit
                  logotype was used on smaller coins.<ref target="#CH3-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Walter Breen</persName> claims that a four-digit logotype was used on smaller coins as early as 1840.<ref target="#CH3-n4">4</ref> He further claims that the adoption of the four-digit logotypes may have been difficult for large denominations.</p>
               <p>It is clear that by 1859 the mint was using four-digit logotypes, as shown by this punch for the 1859 dollar in the SI (<ref target="#fig-15">fig. 9</ref>). I submit that a transfer lathe was used to create four-digit logotype punches for all denominations when the mint was
                  revamped in 1857.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-15">

               </figure>
               <p>A close look at the numbers on the 1851 and 1852 dollars will reveal that the last digit is always lower than the other numbers. It is
                  well-known that the dates were individually added to the work-ing dies each year. From inspection of the last digits on numerous seated
                  dollars and other denominations of the Liberty Seated series, I have come to the conclusion that by 1857, the last digits were made by a
                  mechanical process and the styles of the numbers from denomination to denomination were always the same–only the size of the numbers
                  changed.</p>
               <p>Fig. 10 illustrates the last digit of each date from 1840 to 1873. If the three styles of numbers do not match those of your coins for any
                  particular date, the numbers have probably been altered in some way.</p>

            <p>The collecting of half dimes by die variety can easily be traced back more than one hundred years. <persName>Harold P. Newlin</persName>,
               writing in 1883, opened with the admonition, "it seems unjust that these small but interesting coins should be so slighted, especially when the
               larger members of the family, the dollars, halves, quarters and cents, are treated with such distinguished attention, and so many articles
               written descriptive of their beauty."<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref>
               <persName>Newlin</persName> continued with the reason some of us collect such coins: "an 'amiable face,' the length of a curl, in short, in
               a coin any marked peculiarity <hi rend="italic">sui generis</hi> seems to insure for it a greater appreciation and value, and one experiences no
               small feeling of pride in being the happy possessor of a <hi rend="italic">unique</hi> piece."</p>
            <p>I cannot speak for everyone who has had such a thrill, but I know that, in my case, discovering a new variety is a grand and a glorious feeling.
               And when other specimens of that variety are eventually found, it matters not, because only one person can be first.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Newlin</persName> listed 25 different varieties from 1792 through 1805. For the Capped Bust design, used from 1829 to 1837, he
               very briefly mentions, "...two varieties of 1835, viz: large and small date, the latter being the scarcer."<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> In the
               Seated Liberty series he mentions two varieties of 1840, with and without drapery, and states, "there are two varieties of the 1848 half-dime,
               large and small date."<ref target="#CH4-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Another feature of the <persName>Newlin</persName> work was the enumeration of 16 examples of the classic rarity, the 1802 half dime. A
               little research on the 1802 highlights some of the present collecting activities that get so much publicity. In 1935 a coin dealer named <persName>Macallister</persName> stated he knew of at least 35 different pieces. In the 1960s and 70s, 1802s appeared infrequently and three or
               four years might pass between auction appearances. The Mid-American Rare Coin Auctions (<placeName>San Diego Sale</placeName>), Sept. 28-29,
               1984, 276, listed an 1802 half dime Extremely Fine (45/45), Valentine-1, which sold for $55,000 with the buyer's fee. The description stated, "No
               examples appeared in 1976, 1977, 1980, 1981, 1982 (to our knowledge), 1983, or yet this year," and, unfortunately for scholars, this condition
               census piece was without pedigree. The piece reappeared in July of this year (Auction '86, July 25-26, 1986, 1041), where it was listed as
               Extremely Fine-40 and sold for $41,250 with the buyer's fee. This same sale also included the Garrett 1802 half dime, lot 78 V.1 (R-5) Choice
               Extremely Fine-45, ex <persName>Bowers &amp; Ruddy Galleries</persName> (<placeName>Garrett Coll.</placeName> Part 1), Nov. 28-29, 1979,
               234. With the buyer's fee included, it realized $40,700, as compared to the $45,000 it realized in 1979.</p>
            <p>Is this today's market reality? Changing grading standards? Prices for true rarities are still less than during the boom years of the late <pb n="25"/> 1970s. Where are the collectors? I do not have the answers, but I think it is of value to make these observations.</p>
            <p>In August 1927, <persName>Will W. Neil</persName> took up where <persName>Newlin</persName> left off by publishing a list of "The <placeName>United States</placeName> Half Dimes From 1829 Through 1873".<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref> Included were 53 varieties of the Capped
               Bust design and 137 varieties of the Seated Liberty design. In an adden-dum published in December, he listed 11 additional varieties.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> The problem with the <persName>Neil</persName> list was that he gave numbers to different die states of the same
               marriage and included the notorious 1833 "oversize" half dime. I don't believe he actually saw this piece and only used the information published
               in the November 1927 issue of The Numismatist.<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> The piece was illustrated and the owner, <persName>F.D.
                  Langenheim</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, reported the diameter as 17.5 mm and
               the weight as being half way between a regular issue half dime and a dime. The actual weight was not given. What is believed to be this coin
               reappeared in 1979 in a <placeName>Milwaukee</placeName> coin shop "junk box." It was purchased by <persName>Jim Skwarek</persName>, who
               attributed it as a Valentine-5, and told me the coin weighs 19.4 grains—just about right for a worn half dime. My best guess is that the coin was
               probably hammered out between two pieces of leather. The story was reported in the May 1986 issue of the <persName>John Reich</persName>
                  Journal.<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In 1931 the American Numismatic Society published Valentine's The <placeName>United States</placeName> Half Dimes.<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref> This was a significant improvement over previous publications and included photographs of most varieties, enlarged to two diameters.
                  <persName>Valentine</persName> had expanded the list to 29 varieties from 1794-1805, 69 varieties of the Capped Bust design and an
               uncounted number of Seated Liberty varieties.</p>
            <p>In 1958 <persName>Walter Breen</persName> published on half dimes in what was the final issue of The Coin Collectors Journal, No. 160, as
               reborn under the auspices of <persName corresp="#viaf_75915787">Wayte Raymond</persName> Publications. <persName>Breen</persName> did a
               lot more than add new varieties. He commented on emission order, listed some of the finest known specimens and added rarity ratings to the
               significant marriages.</p>
            <p>By 1974 the Valentine book was becoming harder to find and Quarterman Publications announced their plans to reprint it, along with the <persName>Newlin</persName>, <persName>Neil</persName> and <persName>Breen</persName> monographs. <persName>Kamal M.
                  Ahwash</persName> and I also added some new varieties, a few observations and a price guide. This book is easily obtainable and has pictures of
               almost all the varieties.<ref target="#CH4-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Today's collector also needs Jules Reiver's "Rapid Finder" guide to half dimes, published in 1984.<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref> In addition to
               presenting his method of identifying marriages, he included six new discoveries, gave rarity ratings for all of the varieties and published the
               first plates <pb n="26"/> of the new 1835 B-ll reverse and the new 1837 reverse used to strike M-4 and D-5. <persName>Reiver</persName>
               broke with what had become the tradition for varieties discovered after <persName>Valentine</persName>. He labeled all of his marriages with
               a <persName>V. Breen</persName>, <persName>Witham</persName>, I and others had continued the numbering of varieties by taking the next
               number for that year and, in place of the V, we used the first initial of our surname to identify the discoverer. The system had worked well,
               until <persName>John Marker</persName> came up with 1830 J-12. We were using M to designate the 1829 M-16 and 1837 M-4 discovered by <persName>John McCloskey</persName>. Using all Vs was one way to avoid a decision about what to call the 1830 V-13.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>The rediscovered 1801 Valentine-2 is a good example of some of the problems encountered with the Valentine book. Until <persName>Dr.
                     Eric Gutscher</persName> bought Stack's, June 18, 1986, 761, 1801 half dime V.2 (R-5), no one seemed to be sure what Valentine-2 looked like.
                  Is <pb n="27"/> this the variety Valentine saw or a new discovery? <persName>Jules Reiver</persName> and, apparently, quite a few other
                  people have been labeling the late die state V-l as a V-2. Even Stack's is inconsistent. Neither of the two 1801 Valentine-2s listed as lots
                  76 and 77 in Auction '86 match this piece. The obverse is easily identified by examining the spacing of the stars on the left side. The
                  position of S5 to the upper ribbon end can be used in checking catalogue illustrations. This variety may be a true rarity.</p>
               <p>The story of 1829 M-16 goes back to before the 1975 Valentine reprint. When doing my research, one of the things I did was to take copious
                  notes on the <persName>Stewart P. Witham</persName> collection. <persName>Witham</persName> had the most complete variety collection
                  known to me. He had 73 of the then known 75 Capped Bust varieties. The condition of his coins was superb; almost all of them were uncirculated
                  or proof. The only other collector I know who tried to assemble an uncir-culated set was <persName>Carl McClurg</persName>. He had 56
                  different varieties before he lost interest and sold his set.</p>
               <p>The two varieties <persName>Witham</persName> lacked were 1829 V-10 and 1832 V-4. He asked me to help find the two missing marriages. I
                  found my first Valentine-10 about one month later. Unfortunately, it had a hole in it. The coin was a nice F/VF, so I bought it and gave it to
                     <persName>Witham</persName>. I found two more within a year and he ended up with an EF piece. I had told several other collectors
                  about the key attributes and, in 1975, <persName>John McCloskey</persName> found an 1829 with the Valentine Reverse-10, but the obverse
                  didn't match the Valentine-4 description. He bought the coin, later identified the obverse as Valentine-1, and the coin is now recognized as
                  1829 M-16. Before I could find my first 1832 Valentine-4, Witham sold his collection to RARCOA and it was auctioned off at the <placeName>Milwaukee Central States</placeName> Numismatic Society Show, April 30-May 1, 1977. Oddly enough, I found my first 1832 Valentine-4
                  in October of that year.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>John Marker</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</placeName> collected nickel three cent pieces because
                  he liked coins with die cracks. As some of you probably know, Capped Bust half dimes are a rich field for cracks and cuds, and, after <persName>Marker</persName> ran out of nickel three cent varieties to collect, he started collecting half dimes about 1980. He found 1830
                  J-12 shortly thereafter. It is a marriage of 1830 Obverse-2 and the reverse of 1829 V-10. This reverse was also used to strike the 1831
                  Valentine-7. But it is not the workhorse that one might initially think. The 1829 and 1830 strikings must have been limited as all of these
                  marriages are quite rare. <persName>Reiver</persName> lists them as R-7 (4-12 known). I would only disagree on the 1829 V-10. I have seen
                  five of them and would be more inclined to call it an R-6, at best.</p>
               <pb n="28"/>
               <p>The 1830 V-13, a new marriage of Obverse-9 and Reverse-3, was discovered by a dealer, who shall remain nameless. He wasn't sure of his
                  attribution and sent it to <persName>Eric Gutscher</persName> at a certain price. <persName>Gutscher</persName> called me and when
                  we had confirmed what it was, he notified the dealer. The dealer then raised the price of the coin. <persName>Gutscher</persName> then
                  refused to buy it and sent the coin to <persName>Jules Reiver</persName>, who now has it in his collection. I remain disturbed by the
                  dealer's actions since I do not think this is the way to conduct a business.</p>
               <p>1833 L-9, a marriage of Obverse-7 and Reverse-5 of 1832, doesn't have much of a story. It was found a few years ago by <persName>Russell Logan</persName> at a small <placeName>Cleveland</placeName> coin show.</p>
               <p>The new varieties of 1837, M-4 and D-5, are parts of one story. M-4, discovered by <persName>John McCloskey</persName>, is a marriage of
                  Obverse 1 and a new reverse. It is a lot easier to identify than to find. Interestingly enough, it has a recut or repunched C in AMERICA,
                  similar to the 1829 V-10 reverse. I find the most distinguishing feature to be the <figure xml:id="fig-53">
                     <graphic url="COAC3_028.jpg"/>
                     <p>1837 M-4/D-5 Rev.</p>
                  </figure> flag of the 5 in the denomination. It is completely under the feather. After <persName>McCloskey</persName> described it to me,
                  he noted, "it is the only half dime like that." In checking my collection, it appeared that he was right. Later, when looking through some
                  duplicates, I did find one 1837 with the new reverse. Only my VF-20 coin had 1837 Obverse-2 and D-5 became one more marriage for which to
                  look. I took the coin to the 1975 Los Angeles ANA convention, where I showed it to <persName>Stewart Witham</persName> at lunch and, when
                  we got up to leave, I inadvertently left it on the table. I soon discovered my mistake, but no one in the restaurant could remember seeing it.
                  I don't know if the coin ended up in the trash or the pocket of a not so honest employee.</p>
               <p>In all, there are five or six collectors who have shared the excitement in recent years of finding at least six, and possibly seven, new
                  marriages. Within the <persName>John Reich</persName> Collectors Society, there are about <pb n="29"/> 100 collectors who have indicated
                  an interest in half dimes, but I don't know how serious they are about trying for all of the marriages, no matter what the series. For the
                  Capped Bust series, "87 Different" doesn't sound like an impossible goal.</p>

            <p>Chapter 2 is an analysis of the half dollars of 1794 and 1795 and what I term Group Strength. This article develops more fully the reasoning
               behind this approach to organizing the coinage and to understanding early minting practices.</p>

            <p>The various combinations of 25 obverse and 26 known Flowing Hair reverse dies used for the production of the Flowing Hair design half dollar are
               formed from 12 die chains fig (see <ref target="#fig-54">fig. 1</ref>). You can build one of these die chain sequences by simply purchasing the
               Overton or Beistle half dollar books.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref> The only change is in the — chain; the <pb n="33"/> left hand die is a new
               obverse, which I discovered in 1976. It is an unusual obverse, bearing all the traits of the 1795 small head Flowing Hair half dollar. For many
               years these Flowing Hair half dollars of 1795 have been attributed to <persName>John Smith Gardner</persName>, assistant to Chief Engraver
                  <persName>Robert Scot</persName>. Hired on November 19, 1794, <persName>Gardner</persName> would have been responsible for this one
               1794 half dollar obverse die.</p>
            <p>Since there were six obverse dies dated 1794 and the only delivery of half dollars occurred very late in the year on December 1, 1794, the entire
               group of six sets of dies must have been prepared prior to the commencement of the half dollar coinage.<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> On this
               basis, I reasoned that they were using a number of sets of dies rather than just a single set. Since a few days were required to manufacture each
               die in the engraving department, it appears logical that the Mint Director would have wanted multiple sets of dies on hand. If only a single set
               were available and a die deteriorated beyond use, the entire output of the mint would have halted until a new die could be made. Such a procedure
               would have been unlikely in an establishment under the control of <persName>David Rittenhouse</persName>, a man who had the reputation of
               being the greatest scientific mind in the <placeName>United States</placeName> in his day.</p>
            <p>Since there were six obverse dies, the assumption was that the mint used six sets of dies for the half dollars. The total number of Flowing Hair
               half dollar dies (25 obverse, 26 reverse) indicates that at least five groups of dies were made, that is, four complete sets of six dies with one
               left over. Therefore, the necessary groups of dies would have been rebuilt at least five times. The 12 chains can logically be ordered into 5
               groups as diagramed in fig. 2. The 1794 chains, which I have labeled a and —, form Group 1.</p>
            <p>An examination of all the dies confirmed the theory that there were indeed six obverses and six reverses. There are in the entire series six
               reverse dies with a Type 1 eagle hub. The shape of the eagle on the coin reveals that two hubs were used in the entire 1794 and 1795 series. The
               Type 1 hub appears only six times; five of those are in the 1794 series and the E die that was carried over and the sixth is the F die. On the
               basis of the eagle hubs, the die chain was placed in the next group. An examination of the rest of the dies shows that there were two types of
               wreaths used on the 1794 and 1795 dies. The Type 1 wreath of 1794 and early 1795 has fewer leaves than the Type 2 wreath, which occurs on only a
               few of the late 1795 reverse dies. All the Type 2 wreaths appear in Group V, which comprises six obverses and five reverses; an indication that
               there would have— been one reverse left over, which I term the hex <pb n="34"/> die. The analysis of the Type 1 and Type 2 eagle hubs therefore
               yields the chains labeled a, —, and d at the left on <ref target="#fig-55">fig. 2</ref>, as well as f, — and ?, the last three chains completely
               to the right.</p>
            <p>An examination of the edges of the half dollars was then necessary. The use of two edge designs was confirmed. All of the 1794 half dollars and
               the early 1795 halves have an edge design which has two stars after the words FIFTY and DOLLAR. Presumably, the die which initially made the edge
               design on the coins broke and was replaced with another edge design with three stars beside each of these words. In both cases, the number of
               stars on the edge of the half dollar is 15; only their location changed. Careful examination of the edge designs distinguishes coins of one die
               pair, identified as 14-N, which have both the old and new edge design, although the old edge design predominates. An additional 170 coins with
               both the old and new edge design, among which the vast majority bears the new edge design, have been analyzed. These latter coins are labeled
               17—0. In other words, the planchets were apparently prepared in advance and, consequently, when the coins were struck, there was a mixed box of
               planchets with both the 14-N and 17-0 edge die. These two chains are labeled ? and ? in the sequence. This sequence is borne out by examination
               of the other die varieties. All coins prior to 14-N have the Type 1 edge design and all of the coins after 17—0 have the new edge design. The
               location of the coins can thus be determined exactly.</p>
            <p>
               <ref target="#fig-55">Fig. 2</ref> illustrates an initial six sets of dies—obverses 1—6 and reverses A-F. The mint started striking coins with
               1-A. The A die broke, and was replaced by B with obverse 1. Both dies then broke. Striking continued with 2-C in the press until 2 broke and was
               substituted by 3-C. When the C die broke, D was used. This procedure continued until 6-E, when the sixth obverse die broke. All the dies were
               thus used. E is a used survivor and the F die was never used. Consequently, six sets of dies had to be rebuilt before more coins could be struck.
               In this case, since it was already into 1795, six more obverses were needed, and, since there were two survivor dies, four more reverses were
               engraved. With the next set of dies, Group II, the mint recommenced striking coins. When the second chain of coinage was completed, one reverse
               survived, the J die. Again six obverses and five reverses were made and the striking of Group III coins was begun.</p>
            <p>At the end of this series, either one of two events took place as the 18-O combination was being struck. Either the 18 and the O dies were in the
               press when the rebuilding of the six sets commenced, which did not include either of these dies; or the O die, which <pb n="35"/> had become
               clashed, was not counted as a viable die. As a result, when the group was rebuilt, four obverses and six reverses were made to begin the next
               sequence of striking. At the end of Group IV, three obverses remained. This is proof that this sequence is correct. Since three obverses
               survived, three obverses and six reverses would have been made in order to rebuild the number of dies to six sets. In fact, the obverses, labeled
               23, 24 and 25, made to rebuild this die set, are all now the small head variety of 1795, which has been attributed to <persName>John
                  Smith Gardner</persName>. The assistant engraver made all the obverse and reverse replacements to complete the Group V die set. Since three
               obverses survived, he had to make only three small head obverses. The entire set of six reverses, which are all of the Type 2 wreath design, were
               also engraved.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>This theory is significant, because not only can the die sequence be determined, but also some contemporary history of the mint can be
               ascertained. The mint was not relying on one set of dies at a time. A group of dies was kept in stock and periodically replenished. Another good
               example of this procedure is the 1794 half dime. Even though there were three obverse 1794 half dime dies, no half dimes were struck in 1794.
               This is eloquent testimony that three sets of dies were on hand for the half dime series.</p>

               <p>I am also interested in the survival rate of these coins as a means to determine the approximate numbers of each variety extant. Toward this
                  end, in 1954 I began a survey of all 1794 half dollar specimens by die variety. Over the years I have recorded every 1794 half dollar example
                  I have seen. When I had recorded approximately 75 1794 half dollars, I observed that whenever I saw a 1794 half dollar, chances were about one
                  in four that I had already seen it. In the range of 90 to 110 distinct 1794 half dollar specimens identified, I discovered that approximately
                  one in three coins had been previously recorded. When my record grew to 150 1794 half dollars, one out of every two observations had been
                  already listed. During the survey, I took great pains not to visit the same dealer or collector twice about the same coin, as that would not
                  be a separate observation. If the coin changed hands and I identified it a second time with a different owner, then that was a new sighting
                  and an already- seen coin for the purpose of my statistical evaluation. When I wrote the book in 1980, I had seen 201 1794 half dollars and at
                  that time I estimated that the chances were about 2/3 that the next coin observed would have already been examined.</p>
               <p>A reasonable parameter for estimating the extant number of 1794 half dollars was thus determined. On the basis of my survey, there must be
                  about 300 1794 half dollars in existence. I am of course measuring the coins that are in the marketplace and in exchange among collectors. If
                  one has been salted away in a safe deposit box for the past 50 years, it will have been missed. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the 1794
                  half dollars in existence are in circulation, so that a safe extrapolation is a total field of approximately 317 specimens of the 1794 half
                  dollar (see <ref target="#fig-57">fig. 4</ref>, below).</p>
               <p>The mint records reveal that delivery Warrant no. 1 was for 1,758 silver dollars, delivered on October 15, 1794. The first half dollar
                  warrant, Warrant no. 2, for 5,300 half dollars was on December 1, 1794. Warrant no. 3 for 18,164 half dollars was on February 4, 1795. It has
                  generally been assumed that this latter delivery was all 1794 half dollars, since there are too many 1794 half dollars to assert that the only
                  1794 delivery of 5,300 coins comprised all of the 1794s that were minted. Walter Breen and a great many other researchers have long since
                  concluded that the second delivery was probably also 1794 half dollars. No one, however, substantiated this assumption. Nevertheless, if this
                  theory is correct, the number of 1794 half dollars (5,300 from the December 1, 1794 delivery and 18,164 from <pb n="37"/> the February 4, 1795
                  delivery) totals 23,464 coins. The first two chains reveal that 1-A and 1-B would probably be the 5,300 coins that were delivered in 1794. In
                  my 201 observations of 1794 half dollars, the 1-A variety occurs 30 times, the 1-B 15 times. These varieties comprise 45 of the 201
                  observations or 22.38% (see <ref target="#fig-56">fig. 3</ref>). Mathematically, the 5,300 coins equal 22.58% of the first two deliveries of
                  23,164 coins. Similarly, the second chain of Group I comprised 77.62% of the total by observation and the second delivery of 18,164 coins
                  equals 77.41% of the mathematical total. This strong statistical correlation is ample proof that the first two die chains comprised the first
                  two deliveries of Flowing Hair half dollars.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">a</hi> As of January 10, 1980.</p>
               <p>The Bank of Maryland made the first deposit of silver to the United States Mint in July 1794. By law, that bullion was to be coined and
                  returned, at no expense, before any other coinage could take place. The first payment record is the memorandum of March 12, 1795.<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> Since this was a memorandum of payment rather than a receipt, the Bank of Maryland representatives must have come
                  to the mint and received a partial payment of 90,932 half dollar coins. According to mint delivery records, Warrant no. 4 for 60,660 coins
                  took place on March 3, 1795- Warrant no. 5 for 46,808 coins is dated March <pb n="38"/> 30. The Bank of Maryland must therefore have received
                  all the coins struck by the mint from their deposit up to March 12, 1795.</p>
               <p>An analysis of these facts yields important results. Of the initial output of 23,464 coins, 317 1794 half dollars survive. A survival rate of
                  1.35% is established. By inversion, statistically, one out of every 74.074 half dollars struck will exist today. Using that same ratio and
                  estimating the number of coins in the 1795 series for each die variety in their proper sequence, the dies that should have been in the press
                  when the Bank of Maryland received payment was the pair 11-E. This pair, together with 12-E, will have struck coins in the range of 90—95,000
                  from the inception of the half dollar mintage, according to the sequence. The 11-E die pair produced the only known coin of 1794 or 1795 where
                  there is a so-called proof presentation piece. <persName>Walter Breen</persName> places the coin early in 1795,<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> but that coin has been flashed, and the reverse die was well used by the time it was paired as 11-E. It was definitely not one of
                  the first 1795 half dollars. I propose that it was a special coin struck at the time the Bank of Maryland officials arrived at the mint to
                  pick up the first payment of silver coinage issued by the mint. The presentation piece was struck by the dies in use on March 12, 1795,
                  namely, the 11-E pair.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Robert Julien</persName> has discussed the assay commission—s work during the early years of the mint—s operation.<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref> By law, coins were to be withdrawn from each batch of silver and reserved for assay by the commission. A minimum
                  of three coins were required to be selected. <persName>Julien—s</persName> reconstruction of those assay coins indicates that
                  periodically only two coins were saved. Correlating <persName>Julien—s</persName> selections for assay with my groupings, I observed that
                  two half dollars in the last die chain were missing and, according to <persName>Julien—s</persName> assay coin list, only one coin
                  reached the commission from the last die chain. Two other coins should have been reserved, but never reached the assay commission.</p>
               <p>On October 13, 1964, in a Christie—s sale in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, a group of coins were auctioned
                  identified as the coins originally obtained from the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint by the <persName>Major the Lord Saint Oswald</persName>. As a youth of 19, during a tour of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, he visited the mint
                  and received a number of coins as a souvenir. He received two 1794 silver dollars, a 1795 silver dollar of the early 1795 sequence, and two
                  half dollars. The two half dollars, which he received, were the two assay pieces missing from <persName>Julien—s</persName> sequence and
                  from the last die chain. These two half dollars thus provide further substantiation for the proposed 1794—1795 sequence.</p>
               <p>Additionally, in Group V, there is one remaining unknown reverse <pb n="39"/> die, identified above as the hex die. The next series of half
                  dollars represents the beginning of the Bust type coinage. To complete three sets of dies, only three obverses and two reverses were needed,
                  since one reverse (hex) would have been carried over. But, since the large silver dollar press was constructed in 1795 and dollars began to be
                  produced in May, the production of half dollar planchets probably ceased in mid-April 1795. This cessation of half dollars lasted for two
                  years. From 1795 until 1797 mint records show that no half dollars were made during the period mid-1795 until 1797. This information confirms
                  the carryover of the hex die and provides further proof of the group strength theory.</p>
               <p>The three die sets that comprise the first group of 1796-dated halves include both 15 and 16 star varieties of the coins. These varieties can
                  be explained by examining the employment of <persName>John Smith Gardner</persName>. On March 30, 1795, <persName>Gardner</persName>
                  left his position as assistant engraver due to a pay dispute. Nevertheless, he returned to the mint on July 1, 1796, and worked for exactly 50
                  days until August 26, receiving $3 as a daily wage. Evidently, there was a specific reason for bringing <persName>Gardner</persName> back
                  for just 50 days. A probable explanation is that the Bust half dollar sequence was begun in the first quarter of 1796, and <persName>Gardner</persName> had made the first two dies for the obverse with 15 stars before leaving on March 30. During <persName>Gardner—s</persName> absence, the entire responsibility of engraving dies would have been thrown upon <persName>Robert Scot</persName>,
                  and work stopped on the half dollar dies. When <persName>Gardner</persName> returned to the mint on July 1, <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> had just joined the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796. <persName>Gardner</persName> therefore finished the
                  third die as a 16 star 1796 half dollar.</p>
               <p>At the end of 1795 the mint had usable dies in almost all denominations, which continued to be used even though they bore the wrong date. This
                  led to the decision to engrave dies without the last digit of the year. The engravers thus made multiple dies of each denomination, completing
                  the dies with the exception of the last digit. The first obverse die in the Bust series was complete, except for the last digit; the second
                  and third were completed as 1796 dies. Some complete dies would obviously be needed in stock.<ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> The problem is that
                  the hex die, which completes this sequence, is not known with those half dollar obverses. The reason is that the first delivery of half
                  dollar—s which took place after the 1795 deliveries was made on February 28, 1797, and it consisted of only 60 coins. This delivery would have
                  contained the die combination of the second obverse die and the hex die. With a 60 coin delivery and a survival rate of 1 in 74 coins, it is
                  unlikely that any of these coins have survived in circulation and come down to us today.</p>
               <pb n="40"/>
               <p>As this survey has indicated, and as I have detailed at much greater length in my book, the engraving of dies was not an arbitrary process.
                  The mint officials conscientiously built an inventory of working dies in each denomination and rebuilt the group to its proper group strength
                  when the supply was used. From this organization of the dies, it is possible to locate every single known die of every denomination of these
                  early coins.</p>

               <p>At an ANA convention in the early 1970s <persName>Paul Munson</persName> mentioned that he had developed an emission order for the 1801
                  to 1807 half dollars by using edge links. He suggested that the authors try his method for the capped bust series of 1807 to 1836. The
                  project, begun in 1975, has been more successful than we could have anticipated.</p>

                  <head>A) The Process of Manufacturing Edge Dies</head>
                  <p>There were four hubs prepared for early half dollars (see <ref target="#fig-58">fig. 1</ref>).<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref>
                  </p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-58">

                  </figure>
                  <p>The first, which contained five ornaments between FIFTY and CENTS, was used from 1794 to mid-1975 producing 5 edge dies that edge-lettered
                     approximately 30,000 coin blanks or planchets each. The second, which had three stars between FIFTY and CENTS, through 1806 producing 14
                     edge dies lettering 100,000 each. All of the edges from this hub exhibit a broken second star. The third, which was devoid of
                     ornamentation, from 1807 to 1814, produced 35 edge dies lettering 270,000 each. The fourth, with a star after DOLLAR, through 1836 produced
                     241 edge dies lettering about 300,000 each.</p>
                  <p>The hub, with its incuse lettering, was hardened and placed in the screw press opposite a softer steel bar. Several strokes of the press
                     were required to force the steel into the recesses of the hub to create the working die. Most edges exhibit a shift of the hub or the
                     recipient die between strokes, resulting in doubling or tripling within the confines of the letter, not of the letters per se, as in
                     doubled edge lettering.</p>
                  <p>Each working edge die was composed of two bars; the first contained FIFTY CENTS OR; the second, HALF A DOLLAR. Each bar was hubbed
                     separately as many edges show doubling on one bar opposite to the doubling on the other. The two bars were always inserted as a pair into
                     the edge-lettering, or Castaing machine, to form the edge die. Of the 552 working die bars known for the capped <pb n="43"/> bust series,
                     there are only 85 or 15% which have no evidence of hub doubling; 274 or 50% exhibit doubling on the left side; 174 or 32% show right side
                     doubling, and 19 or 3% other hubbing errors. <ref target="#fig-59">Fig. 2</ref> demonstrates varying amounts of hub doubling on the left
                     side. The top coin exhibits very little doubling, but the doubling <figure xml:id="fig-59">
                        <graphic url="COAC3_043a.jpg"/>
                     </figure> increases with each edge until it reaches the entire width of the letters on the bottom coin. Note that the doubling is within
                     the letter. <ref target="#fig-60">Fig 3</ref> illustrates examples of doubling on the right side, again from slight to full letter.</p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-60">

                  </figure>
                  <p>There are also 9 each of triple-hubbed edges. Although there is no clearly defined example of a quadruple-hubbed edge, in 1985 <persName>Gunnet</persName> found an 1809 that had an edge we had never seen. It is the —Spanish steps— of the early half dollar edge
                     world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <ref target="#fig-61">Fig. 4</ref> illustrates a coin that shows a definite quintupling on the left side. We hesitate to claim that this
                     die was struck five times in <figure xml:id="fig-61">

                     have never seen another machine-doubled edge or we haven—t been able to recognize it.</p>

                     the cause of missing and overlapped letters. In this case the sliding die had not been fully returned to its proper starting position when

                  <p>In addition to the foregoing very common blunders, there are other more interesting errors to be found on these edges. They comprise the

                     shows this phenomenon. In <ref target="#fig-66">fig. 9</ref>, the coin was lettered but for some reason placed back in the machine with the

                  <p>A phenomenon that edge dies share with obverse and reverse dies is die cracks. The force required to letter and upset the edge of the

                     reverse dies to crack. <ref target="#fig-67">Fig. 10</ref> illustrates coins with a heavy die crack at the upper edge, a crack in the

                  <head>C) Differentiation of Edge Dies and Process of Deterioration</head>
                  <p>The question most asked is —how do you tell the edges apart?— It is an indisputable fact that each of the 295 edges is different from any
                     other. Separating sharp new edges that show multiple hubbing to varying degrees is simple as are those with die cracks. The edges of 1831
                     to 1836 are easy to distinguish because the reeding applied to each die varies in amount, width and depth. It is more difficult to separate
                     edges that do not have outstanding features. When the die is hubbed, the metal flows into the letter recesses to different depths causing
                     deeper and shallower areas, which can be discerned. Some letters may contain chips, lines or other irregularities that make them
                     distinguishable. These are easily linked to others with the same configuration. Progressive deterioration of the die can be followed and,
                     with experience, anticipated.</p>
                  <p>The most difficult part of an edge study is comparing an early die state edge to a very deteriorated one. No one could possibly anticipate
                     that the two edges of <ref target="#fig-68">fig. 11</ref> were produced by the same die. The D and O on the early die state edge show
                     distinct hub-doubling on the right and several heavy horizontal lines. The top and bottom of the first L are much deeper than the very
                     shallow stand. The late die state edge displays none of these characteristics.</p>

                  <head>D) Conclusions Based on Edge Analysis</head>
                  <p>The foundations for establishing the emission order for early half dollars was edge die linkage and states and obverse and reverse die
                     linkage and states. The pairing of an obverse die and a reverse die created a die variety or die marriage. As the study progressed, it
                     became increasingly apparent that edge die linkage was more important than obverse and reverse die linkage. In no instance, however, was an
                     edge link used to contradict a marriage die state.</p>
                  <p>The average edge die life was much longer than the average die marriage life. Since there was no correlation between the edge dies and the
                     marriage dies, it was inevitable that in most cases the same edge die was used for several consecutive marriages or that many marriages
                     will exhibit two or more different edges. By examining many thousands of coins, we have been able to find a link of two edges within the
                     same marriage in all but three instances in the draped bust series, and in all but six in the capped bust series.</p>
                  <p>Until 1824 the edge links and states coincide almost perfectly with the marriage links and states. This indicates that the planchets were
                     struck as they came from the Castaing machine and that there was strict inventory control. As production increased in later years, there is
                     more mixing of the marriages and edges. At times the emission order becomes blurred, but it is still discernible.</p>
                  <p>The methodology of the emission charts which follow is explained in the introduction. Here we wish to touch on several interesting points
                     revealed by the analysis. Reference is to the year-dated charts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">1807</hi>: In the last column (emission order equals EO), the line indicates a break in the edge links, the first of six
                     such breaks. We have been unable to find a late die state 114 with the third edge or an early die state 111 with the second edge. The third
                     edge hub <pb n="48"/> was initiated at the beginning of 1807 and used for both the draped bust and capped bust halves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">1809</hi>: This diagram contains a feature not shown in 1807—the sharing of a reverse die with a marriage of a succeeding
                     year. DMs 107 and 108 share a reverse die with 1810—103. The 1809s were struck before the 1810.</p>
                  <p>Three of the 1809 edges bear ornamentation and are called the —experimental edges.— The third edge exhibits heavy vertical grooves at the
                     beginning of each bar in front of FIFTY and HALF. The fourth edge is called the —engrailed— edge. There is a series of X-like figures at
                     the front of the first bar and at the end of the second. The sixth edge contains only 106. There are light grooves in front of HALF. We
                     call this the —pseudo-engrailed— edge. <ref target="#fig-70">Fig. 13</ref> illustrates the third edge with the vertical grooves, the
                     —engrailed— fourth edge, and the —pseudo-engrailed— sixth edge.</p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-70">
                     <graphic url="COAC3_048.jpg"/>
                  </figure>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">1814</hi>: This chart is interesting for two reasons—a change in the edge hub and an edge out of sequence. The first and
                     second edges were produced by the third hub of 1807. The fourth hub with a STAR after DOLLAR was used for others and for the rest of the
                     series.</p>
                  <p>The 103 in the third edge caused great frustration because it does not belong there. It should be in the sixth or seventh edge with all the
                     other 103s. This is the only instance seen in the entire series in which a planchet was struck sometime after being lettered, probably
                     several months.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">1826</hi>: This is noteworthy because of its complexity, with the use of so many edges and the appearance on the diagram of
                     a new feature—the sharing of a reverse die with a marriage of a previous year. DM 104 shares a reverse die with 1825—117; the 1825 was
                     struck first.</p>
                  <p>The 1826 mintage was only about 30% higher than 1825, but more than twice as many edges were used. The average edge die life in 1825 was
                     230,000 planchets; in 1826, only 140,000. No edge contains more than three die marriages—102 and 109 each exist with five different edges;
                     101 and 117, with four. It was difficult to find <pb n="49"/> an edge on these four marriages that matched another marriage for a link.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">1827</hi>: Although the diagram of the 49 marriages in 1827 appears difficult, it was one of the earliest emission orders
                     tentatively confirmed. Only five marriages are not die-linked to another and one of those—140—is die-linked to 1828-104. Most of the rest
                     of the marriages are linked together in large groups that could be aligned by obverse and reverse die state.</p>
                  <p>Most of the edges contain many marriages, although they are somewhat mixed. These two factors combined to make formulating the emission
                     order simple. Here is the last of the six missing edge die links. The dl denotes that 109 and 110 are die-linked to each other. The other
                     four missing edge links occur in 1811, 1819, 1820 and 1825.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">1830:</hi> In this year the mint began experimenting by adding various types of reeding to the edge dies resulting in three
                     types of edges being found in this year. The first five edges are a continuation of the plain-lettered edge used since 1814. The next two
                     edges bear fine diagonal lines slanting down to the right. The rest all have lines slanting down to the left. These lines were not merely
                     engraved into the die, rather rectangular areas were removed from the die leaving the grooves. The 1830 edges should be called
                     —experimental,— not those of 1809. <ref target="#fig-71">Fig. 14</ref> exhibits the plain edge of the first five edges, the slanted to
                     right reeding of the sixth and seventh, and the slanted to left reeding of the eighth through the sixteenth.</p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-71">
                     <graphic url="COAC3_049.jpg"/>
                  </figure>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">1831</hi>: In this year there are also three distinct edge types, but only one is the same as in 1830. The first six edges
                     show the slanted down to the left type found on the later 1830s. The seventh edge <pb n="50"/> is a transitional one that exhibits the
                     former type, with the reeded areas relieved in all areas except at the beginning of the first bar. In front of FIFTY is a large area of
                     fine vertical lines from top to bottom that were engraved directly into the die without the hollowing out as previously done.</p>
                  <p>This rare edge type was used for a portion of five die marriages. The balance of the 1831 edges contain heavy vertical reeding engraved in
                     hollowed out rectangles. This edge type was adopted and all of the edges through 1836 exhibit these vertical grooves of varying placement,
                     depth and width, except edge 14 of 1836. <ref target="#fig-72">Fig. 15</ref> shows <figure xml:id="fig-72">

                     </figure> the slanted reeding of the first edges, the transitional edge, with slanted lines appearing in front of the star and the vertical
                     lines in front of FIFTY, and the adopted type with all vertical reeding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">1836</hi>: This is a very difficult year, but we think the emission order is correct. Many of the marriages are not
                     die-linked and they are quite scattered throughout the edges.</p>
                  <p>It appears the mint began to stockpile lettered planchets for the first time, causing the almost random appearance of many marriages. Edge
                     14 is the plain lettered edge referred to previously. <ref target="#fig-73">Fig. 16</ref> compares <figure xml:id="fig-73">

                     </figure> a normal reeded edge with edge 14. This plain edge, which is found on one 1834 and three 1836 marriages, has led many catalogers
                     to claim that these coins were struck on older planchets.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>The numbers in the first two columns—Die linked/state and Nondie-linked—are die marriages (DM) listed in Overton number order (except where
                     there is a master die change during the year).<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref> Those in the Die linked/State column are the DMs which share
                     either the obverse or reverse die with another DM of that year. The obverse die linkage and die state are represented by the numbers in
                     front of the O number; the reverse by those in back of the O number. Those in the Non-die-linked column are those DMs which do not share a
                     die with any other DM of that date, but may share the reverse die with a DM of another year. Edge dies have nothing to do with these two
                     columns.</p>

                  <p>A new edge hub was made this year. The letters are spaced differently and a star was added after DOLLAR. Edges 1 and 2 have no star. The
                     new hub was used for the others and for the rest of the series. The diagonal and vertical lines in the 1830s were hand tooled on each
                     working die.</p>
                  <p>The outside point of star 13 is scalloped on all.</p>

                     <p>The 103 in edge 3 is the coin mentioned earlier that was struck on older planchet. It is the only 103 seen with this edge. The EO was
                        impossible with this 103 included, but fell in nicely when it was removed.</p>

                  <p>DM 101 and 103 obverse was sunk early in 1817. It is from the second obverse hub, the outside point of star 13 is scalloped and the first 8
                     is large. All of the others use the third obverse hub; star 13 is not scalloped and all have a small 8.</p>

                  <p>There were three distinct edge types used this year: 1) the plain lettered edge used since 1814; 2) plaques between the words bearing light
                     diagonal lines down to right; and 3) plaques bearing diagonal lines down to left. Edge type 4, with heavier vertical lines, did not appear
                     in 1830; 109 and a few 108s have type 4 but they were struck in 1831. The diagonal lines on types 2 and 3 wore off the dies and the coins
                     very quickly so that many appear to be type 1.</p>

                  <p>Here again there were three edge types: 3) with diagonal lines, down to left; 4) with straight, vertical lines; and a transitional edge
                     displaying both types 3 and 4. The type 4 edge was adopted and all of the edge dies through 1836 exhibit the vertical grooves of varying
                     depth and width except edge 14 in 1836 which is plain.</p>

                  <p>The fifth and sixth obverse master dies were engraved this year. The fourth hub was used for 101-10, all of the large dates and one small
                     date; 109-10 was probably the first small date sunk but thought to be unaesthetic because of the large stars and therefore put aside. The
                     hub from the fifth master die was used for 113 and 114—the Abominable Bastards—and 116. This hub is noticeably different from the preceding
                     in the drapery line, a heavier chin and a double clasp. DM 116 was struck first and then the bust was reduced on the hub before 113 and 114
                     were struck. The hub from the sixth master die, the small bust type, was used for the others and through 1836.</p>
                  <p>A new reverse master die was engraved and the hub was used for 113 and 1 14 only. The E on the scroll was started too far right and the
                     ruined hub was soon discarded. The old reverse hub was used again and it too was used through 1836. Thus the —Mysterious Case of the
                     Abominal Bastards— is finally solved.</p>

            <p>As an engineer working in the metals industry for the past 20 years and a coin collector for the past 30 years, I have been constantly aware of
               the metallurgical and physical properties of the metals that dictate the mechanics of coinage, both in the early 1800s and now. This knowledge
               has helped me to comprehend the published information on early federal coinage. But the paucity of information concerning the edges of our early
               silver coins and the inaccuracies written about the Castaing machine have left a gap in our comprehension of the early <placeName>U.S</placeName>. silver mintage. This gap challenges me to search for additional clues.</p>
            <p>I find that one of the most important aspects of being successful (whether it—s your hobby or your business) is asking the right question at the
               right time. One may not necessarily have the right answer, but at least one generates the motions necessary to find such solutions. The reason
               that the edge is the least studied of the three dies is because there is no universal way to describe or document it. Even to the novice, it is
               apparent that photography can play a tremendous role in describing a particular coin or die variety. But what has been done to photograph the
               edge?</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-74">

            <pb n="95"/>
            <p>I decided to tackle the logistics of how to photograph the edge of a coin. I wanted an economical method that would lend itself to easy
               documentation and would be compatible with existing photography techniques. Ultimately I developed what I believe is a successful solution. I
               would like to share with you my experiments, experiences and thoughts on how the edge of a coin may be photographed accurately and inexpensively.
               Hopefully, as a result of this effort, students of the third die will use this technique to share their findings with others through numismatic
               publications.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Laws of Light</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Our high school physics class taught us that light behaves under some very predictable laws. The most famous, of course, is that light travels
                  in a straight line. Not as well known, but of paramount importance to this paper, is the fact that when light is reflected off a surface, the
                  angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This is best illustrated on a billiards table where it is essential to properly bank
                  the ball against two walls before hitting the target (see <ref target="#fig-74">fig. 1</ref>). The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
                  reflection in both instances.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-75">
                  <graphic url="COAC3_095.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>Now suppose the walls are mirrors and the ball is a ray of light (see <ref target="#fig-75">fig. 2</ref>). This is a two-dimensional analysis
                  of what we need to consider in three dimensions for viewing the coin edge. In our case, <pb n="96"/> the edge of the coin is not a straight
                  line, but rather a curved surface. If the edge of the coin is circular, why can—t the mirror also be circular? (See <ref target="#fig-76">fig.
                     3</ref>.) In this case, one would have a circular lens or mirror, which would surround the coin to be photographed with a 45 degree angle
                  between the edge of the coin and the camera.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-76">
                  <graphic url="COAC3_096.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>This configuration gives rise to two minor problems. When a mirror is used in photography, the image on the film will be reversed and,
                  therefore, the pictures will appear backwards. This is easily solved by printing the negatives in reverse. The second problem is a bit more
                  perplexing because it necessitates that the edge image be distorted since the top of the edge will appear to have a greater diameter than the
                  bottom. But on a scale of 1 to 10, I rate this problem as a —0— because I—ve become accustomed to the —halo— effect and think it adds some
                  mystique to —edge photography.—</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Prototype Design</hi>
               </head>
               <p>This was probably the most difficult part of this whole endeavor: how to select a material and/or process that would yield a mirror finish on
                  the 45 degree surface and cost less than $ 100 to manufacture. The first thought that passes one—s mind in dealing with this subject is
                  —mirrors.— Mirrors imply the use of glass backed by a thin layer of silver. After describing the theoretical —edge mirror— to a few engineers
                  at PPG and GE, I concluded that the glass would only compound the problem because it creates a double image due to its thickness, and would be
                  prohibitively expensive because of the labor required to grind the 45 degree surface to shape.</p>
               <p>I then decided to form the edge mirror by machining and then possibly grinding the edge from a piece of metal. But what metal? Silver seemed a
                  logical choice, but when I suggested that to my machinist, he informed me that silver machines very poorly. It does not —cut—; it tears and
                  smudges and will not grind to a suitable finish. I then visited an industrial grinder to ask him what I should use to obtain a mirror finish
                  on the beveled edge. He suggested aluminum, more specifically alloy 6061-T6. I vetoed that suggestion because I know what happens to the
                  surface of aluminum over a period of time: it turns to aluminum oxide—that fine, hard abrasive that is found on sandpaper.</p>
               <p>Realizing that I was losing the battle to achieve a 1 micro inch on a metallic surface unless I used something like tungsten carbide, I
                  changed my thinking. This time I visited an industrial plater and asked him what he required to achieve a mirror finish. To my surprise, he
                  said, —No problem, I—ll chrome plate your piece to a 0.0002/0.0004 thickness and then polish to a mirror finish.— He further suggested that a
                  flash chrome would be best, as it would not oxidize or distort the surface. After plating, he polished it again to achieve the mirror
                  finish.</p>
               <p>Armed with all this information, I returned to my machinist and was advised to use stainless steel for the edge mirror—Stainless 303.</p>

               </head>
               <p>In hindsight, I made my first error in calculating the inside diameter of the edge mirror in respect to the diameter of the coin. I reasoned
                  that there should be an 1/8th of an inch clearance between the outside diameter of the coin and the inside diameter of the edge mirror. This,
                  however, created too much diffusion and <pb n="98"/> resulted in a fuzzy image, despite the fact that I adjusted for focal length. I recommend
                  that a maximum of 0.025 inches separate the diameter of the coin from the smallest diameter of the edge mirror.</p>
               <p>Likewise, the thickness of the edge mirror should be slightly greater than the thickness of the coin. Because it is impossible to machine the
                  beveled edge without a radius at the ends, we must allow an additional 0.010 inches for each radius. Consequently, the thickness of the edge
                  mirror should be 0.020 inches greater than the thickness of the coin.</p>
               <p>For good machining practices and future handling considerations, it is advisable to make the outside diameter of the edge mirror 3/4 inch
                  diameter greater than its inside diameter (see <ref target="#fig-77">fig. 4</ref>). Unfortunately, this means that a different edge mirror has
                  to be fabricated <figure xml:id="fig-77">
                     <graphic url="COAC3_098.jpg"/>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="99"/> for every size coin. But the cost will still be less than one of those always-in-focus close-up lenses that sell for $4,500 and
                  only produce a fraction of the edge.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Because the light patterns are so drastically different from normal numismatic photography, I found it necessary to eliminate all sources of
                  glare, which, unfortunately, includes the obverse or reverse of the coin itself. By using an ink compass, which can usually be found in old
                  kits of drafting tools, and grinding the ink holder to a sharp edge, I was able to cut accurately coin-size circles out of some black kraft
                  paper. I then placed this disc on top of the coin in order to eliminate glare.</p>
               <p>I also experienced glare from the top surface of the edge mirror, but, in this case, I just used some artist—s dark paint to darken this
                  surface. I carefully applied an artist—s mixture of linseed oil with burnt umber with a small brush, often with the aid of a stereo microscope
                  to the top surface of the edge mirror until it was completely brown. After it had dried for a couple of days, the burnt umber was completely
                  dry and could be handled and stacked with other objects.</p>
               <p>By placing the whole assembly on a yellow sheet of paper, it was possible to outline the coin—s edge on the edge mirror. If your camera has a
                  fixed focal length, it should be adjusted by the thickness of the coin, plus the difference in diameter between the inside diameter of the
                  edge mirror and the outside diameter of the coin. In addition, a few paper shims under the coin helps to raise and center the image within the
                  edge mirror and avoid any optical aberrations (see <ref target="#fig-78">fig. 5</ref>). After finding the right diameter coin (a Mexican
                  Peso), I was able to make the initial edge mirror function as designed (see <ref target="#fig-79">fig. 6</ref>).</p>

               </head>
               <p>That this photography technique is needed is exemplified by three articles in the May 28 issue of <hi rend="italic">Coin World</hi>. There the
                  three articles not only discussed edges, but also photographed parts of them. All three articles showed only portions of the edge, with the
                  portions furthest from the lens out of focus. The first article concerned the Biathlon Olympic coin error without the lettered edge. The
                  second was <persName>Richard Doty—s</persName> article on steam presses, collars and counterfeiting. Finally, there was <persName>Marilyn Tiernan—s</persName> Collectors— Clearinghouse article on counterfeit <persName>Susan B. Anthony dollars</persName>
                  and <persName>Franklin</persName> halves.</p>
               <p>Other possible uses of this technique would be to establish and document an emission order on a given series of coins based on the obverse,
                  reverse and edge die usage. Elsewhere in this publication <persName>Dr. Leaman</persName> and <persName>Mr. Gunnet</persName>
                  present their very convincing arguments as to why it is possible to do just that.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, several well-known numismatists have written various articles and chapters in books about how the Castaing machine operates
                  and why all the —misfits— were made. A careful study of the edges by <persName>Dr. Leaman</persName> and <persName>Mr.
                     Gunnet</persName> has concluded that the coins never —slipped— in the Castaing machine, and abnormalities, such as the prized —FIFTY CENTS OR A
                  DOLLAR— (shown in <ref target="#fig-80">fig. 7</ref>), were created by operator error.</p>

               <p>Eric Newman in this publication sheds some new light on the famous 1804 dollars. How long does a conversation on 1804 dollars last before one
                  starts talking edges? What—s a —crushed lettered edge—? <ref target="#fig-81">Fig. 8</ref> is a photograph of an 1834 crushed lettered edge
                  half dollar, as described in Newman—s famous book, —The Fantastic 1804 Dollar.—</p>
               <p>Finally, there are the —open collar— (1809-1828) Bust dimes. Up until last year, we were convinced that these were reeded in the Castaing
                  machine, that is, until William Subjack called me one evening and asked me to look at the edge of any 1824 variety JR-1 dime in order to see
                  what was on the edge opposite the third arrowhead. I responded that my particular coin had a siamese-shaped reed there. —Funny,— said Bill,
                  —so does mine.— Worse than that, the same irregularity occurs on many varieties in that same few years. So much for the Castaing theory for
                  the early Capped Bust dimes.</p>
               <p>In this book John McCloskey discusses hub changes in the Seated series; he was one of the first numismatists of whom I—d ever heard, who could
                  prove the authenticity of a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> coin by the number of reeds on its edge. The articles
                  that have been written by McCloskey and others in <hi rend="italic">The Gobrecht Journal</hi>, which describe the reeding gauges used in the
                  Seated series, are significant contributions to the numismatic literature.</p>

               <p>With the ability to photograph inexpensively the edges of our coins, we can expect more documented information and published research
                  concerning emission orders, restrikes, etc. on our early silver, gold and copper issues. By no means do I expect this to be the last
                  dissertation on this technique; it should lead to many more in years to come.</p>
               <p>It is my hope that this technique will be accepted and used by the students and scholars in our discipline. Consequently, I wish to donate
                  this invention to the public domain. I further encourage anyone who may have questions to direct them to me either through the American
                  Numismatic Society or the John Reich Collectors Society.</p>

                     <persName>Adam Eckfeldt</persName> unsuccessfully tried to fill the role of engraver.<ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> Finally, in July
                  1793, <persName>Jefferson</persName> decided to hire local talent and appointed <persName>Joseph Wright</persName>, a skilled
                  artist, to be Chief Engraver.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref>
                  <persName>Wright—s</persName> 1792 pattern quarter dollar exhibits his talent for depicting the devices on a coin in a strong, classical
                  manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Wright</persName> probably began work at the mint in August, before his commission was issued, but in late September he died in
                  the yellow fever epidemic that ravaged <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> in 1793.<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref> In his brief period of service <persName>Wright</persName> engraved the dies for the attractive beaded-border
                  Liberty cap cents issued in September 1793.<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> His delicately modeled, thoroughly feminine Liberty and improved
                  reverse contrasts markedly with the earlier work of <persName>Voigt</persName> and <persName>Eckfeldt</persName>. The loss of
                  Wright—s talents was a severe blow to the fledgling mint.</p>
               <p>Shortly after <persName>Wright—s</persName> death, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> advised <persName>Jefferson</persName> that he would not object if Mint Director <persName>David Rittenhouse</persName>, with <persName>Jefferson—s</persName> concurrence, selected a new Chief Engraver.<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref>
                  <persName>Jefferson</persName> with splendid understatement wrote Rittenhouse, —It has been understood that <persName>Mr.
                     Wright</persName> our engraver is dead. If this be the fact, will you be so good as to recommend for the office such person as you think best
                  qualified to execute it?—<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> acted quickly, perhaps too quickly. Within two weeks he named and obtained <persName>Jefferson—s</persName> concurrence to the appointment of <persName>Robert Scot</persName> and, on November 23, <persName>Jefferson</persName> sent Scot his commission as Chief Engraver.<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> The speed with which the mint—s second Chief
                  Engraver was selected and appointed sharply contrasts with the 16 month, two continent search for <persName>Wright</persName>. Perhaps
                     <persName>Rittenhouse</persName> and <persName>Jefferson</persName> felt pressure to fill the post promptly because they wanted
                  to get the mint operating without delay, or profited from their earlier review of potential candidates, or, as <persName>Walter
                     Breen</persName> states, influential banker friends supported Scot.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref> Whatever the reason, <persName>Scot</persName> was appointed. In the view of many, this was not a happy day for the mint.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Scot</persName>, born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> about 1740,<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref> became associated with a watchmaker early in his career. His engraving experience was largely confined to etching intricate line
                  designs on the flat surfaces of watch cases.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref>
                  <persName>Scot</persName> came to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> before the Revolution and was employed by
                     <persName>Robert Morris</persName> in the mid-1770s to engrave plates for subsistence money and bills of exchange.<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref> Later <persName>Scot</persName>, as Engraver for the <placeName>State of Virginia</placeName>, made the
                  copper plates for its currency.<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> He also produced architectural plates for <persName>Dobson—s</persName>
                     Encyclopedia.<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> When <persName>Scot</persName> opened a shop in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> in 1781, he had no experience in medallic art or portraiture, but he
                  advertised himself as capable of executing the business of engraving —in all its branches.—<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref>
                  <persName>Scot</persName> was clearly not modest about his abilities.</p>
               <p>While his banker friends may have recommended him to Rittenhouse, <persName>Scot—s</persName> knowledge of watchmaking also may have
                  appealed to Rittenhouse, a noted clock and instrument maker. <persName>Scot</persName> probably had an ingratiating personality, which
                  helped him obtain and preserve his job despite his lack of skill as an engraver. There is no evidence that his competence in medallic art or
                  coinage was considered before his appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Scot</persName> was in his mid-fifties when he assumed the post of Chief Engraver. Taxay commented that at that time <persName>Scot</persName> was already advanced in years and thereafter his talents, never outstanding, showed a rapid decline.<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref> It is <persName>Scot—s</persName> incompetence as an engraver that makes the coins struck from the dies he
                  made a fascinating study.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Scot—s</persName> 1794 silver dollar design was criticized in the press because —...the touches of the graver are too delicate,
                  and there is a want of that boldness of execution which is necessary to durability and currency.—<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref> The delicate
                  touch of the graver and want of boldness in execution are characteristic of <persName>Scot—s</persName> work. His shortcomings were due
                  to hesitance and lack of experience in medallic art, a discipline which involves the skills of a sculptor working in three dimensions instead
                  of the two required for engraving currency plates.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Henry De Saussure</persName>, Rittenhouse—s successor as Director, was openly unhappy with <persName>Scot—s</persName>
                  dollar design which Scot had copied, with changes, from <persName>Wright—s</persName> Liberty cap design without the cap.<ref target="#CH7-n18">18</ref>
                  <persName>De Saussure</persName> engaged <persName>Gilbert Stuart</persName> to redesign Liberty—s head.<ref target="#CH7-n19">19</ref>
                  <persName>Stuart—s</persName> solution was a Liberty with neatly bound hair, thus changing her from an unkempt wench to a stately matron.
                  Pursuant to a commission from <persName>De Saussure</persName>, <persName>John Eckstein</persName>, a Philadelphia artist, revised
                     <persName>Scot—s</persName> reverse by shaping the eagle more boldly and reducing the cluttered appearance of the wreath.<ref target="#CH7-n20">20</ref>
                  <persName>Eckstein</persName> then created models in relief from which dies for the redesigned dollar were to be copied. <persName>De Saussure</persName> directed that all silver coins conform <pb n="106"/> to these models; clearly, the Director had little
                  confidence in <persName>Scot—s</persName> artistic abilities.<ref target="#CH7-n21">21</ref> Unfortunately, <persName>De
                     Saussure</persName> resigned as Director of the mint in October 1795 due to deteriorating relations with Congress.<ref target="#CH7-n22">22</ref>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName>, who replaced <persName>De Saussure</persName>, confirmed the directive that all silver coins
                  should have a design similar to the <persName>Stuart-Eckstein</persName> dollar. The task of engraving the dies for these coins fell to
                     <persName>Scot</persName>. <persName>Scot</persName> thus produced the hubs and the working dies for the 1796 dimes.<ref target="#CH7-n23">23</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Examination, particularly of the reverse dies of the 1796 and 1797 Small Eagle dimes, discloses <persName>Scot—s</persName> failure to
                  conform exactly to the ordained design. In a sense, <persName>Scot</persName> altered the design the way a composer creates variations on
                  a theme, but <persName>Scot</persName> was not a skilled artist. It is uncertain whether this was due to <persName>Scot—s</persName>
                  careless attention to detail, or a stubborn resolve to —fool around— with a competitor—s design, or, as Breen implies, a bureaucrat—s desire
                  to preserve his job by creating an aura of indispensability for his continued employment. Admittedly the implements available in 1796 and 1797
                  were crude, even compared to those available a generation later when the reducing pantograph was introduced. But coin dies engraved by <persName>Scot—s</persName> contemporaries show greater competence and consistency. <persName>Scot—s</persName> changes are
                  sufficiently great that they cannot be attributed solely to poor craftsmanship or to the difficulty of working on the comparatively small dime
                  dies.</p>
               <p>The striking of the first dimes in early 1796 from <persName>Scot—s</persName> dies was an important occasion in numismatic history. For
                  the first time a coin equal to one-tenth of the basic unit of currency was issued, thereby introducing decimal currency to the western
                  world—14,520 new dimes, all JR-1 variety, were delivered with Warrant No. 54 on January 18, 1796.<ref target="#CH7-n24">24</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Scot</persName> made a hub from the master die of the draped bust of Liberty, including her hair. This hub was used to create
                  all 1796 and 1797 working dies. The letters of LIBERTY, the date numerals, and the stars were then individually punched into the working die.
                  If the hub was not impressed into the working die with sufficient force, <persName>Scot</persName> strengthened the hair and other
                  details with his graver. The principal variations in the 1796 dime obverse dies are in the placement of the letters, date and stars which are
                  not design changes, but variations attributable to the difficulty of accurately placing punches on a small die.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>The outstanding feature on almost all 1796 JR-1 dimes is the large cud break at the first star. Only one specimen of 1796 JR-1 is known
                  without this defect. Illustrated are two obverses of the 1796 JR-1 dime: one is a late state dime with the cud and the other is without the
                  cud. The latter is a gem presentation piece which sold for $44,000 (Stack—s, October 22, 1985 [<persName>Jimmy Hayes</persName>], 16).
                  Although the <persName>Hayes</persName> coin does not have the cud, cracks at the first star indicate the outline of the cud as it first
                  developed. The extreme rarity of specimens of the 1796 JR-1 dime without the cud is evidence that the cud developed early in the life of the
                  die and then expanded. Dimes with a smaller cud than appears on the coin in the illustration can readily be located. Eventually the cud
                  obliterated the entire first star and the die was discarded. <table rows="8" cols="10">

                  <pb n="108"/> The reverse of 1796 JR-1 dimes with the cud show weakness in the rim denticles at 11:00 o—clock caused by the loss of metal due
                  to the obverse cud.</p>
               <p>In identifying the design details changed by <persName>Scot</persName> on the Small Eagle reverses, one must eliminate die differences
                  due to imprecise individual punching of the legend letters into the die. Table 1 lists the Small Eagle dime reverses where various letters of
                  the legend <placeName>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</placeName> overlap one or more leaves of the wreath. Such variations are attributable to
                  the difficulty of precisely punching each individual letter into the die and are not considered design changes.</p>

               <p>In making dies for Small Eagle reverses, <persName>Scot</persName> used a hub for the eagle—there is no variation in this device on any
                  Small Eagle dime. <persName>Scot</persName> engraved on the working die the leaves and branches of the wreath, the berries, and the rock
                  or cloud on which the eagle stands. The principal design changes were in the number of leaves and berries on the left laurel branch of the
                  wreath, the location of the berries, and the relationship of the eagle—s left wing to the rock. The palm branch which always has 13 leaves
                  shows differences in the <pb n="109"/> length of the leaves and their relationship to each other from die to die, but none are sufficiently
                  great to be considered a design change. However, this confirms that <persName>Scot</persName> used a graver to cut the wreath into the
                  working die.</p>
               <p>As shown in Table 2, on the 1796 Reverse A, the left or laurel branch has 17 leaves (five single and six double) and five berries. The two
                  outer berries are under E1 and the space left of S1 while the inner berries are located under T1, D and T2. The eagle—s left wing barely
                  touches the rock upon which the eagle stands.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>On the 1796 Reverse B, <persName>Scot</persName> reduced the number of leaves on the laurel branch to 16 (four single and six double),
                  the fewest laurel leaves on any Small Eagle reverse. Also, <persName>Scot</persName> placed the first inner berry above the left stem of
                  the laurel branch between the bow and the first leaf, instead of under T1. This berry placement is sufficiently different that it cannot be
                  attributed to slightly inaccurate placement. The two outer berries and the other two inner berries in Reverse B are in substantially the same
                  location as in Reverse A. On this reverse the eagle—s left wing tip is well below the top of the rock. Reverse B has one other distinction:
                  more legend letters (N, T1, E3 and A3) touch leaves than on any other small eagle reverse.</p>
               <p>On 1796 Reverse C, <persName>Scot</persName> increased the number of leaves on the laurel branch to 19 and reduced the number of berries
                  to four. The outer berries are under the letters T1 and the space right of D, compared to E1 and S1 on Reverses A and B. The two inner berries
                  are under D and the space between S1 and T2. The eagle—s left wing is well clear of the rock. Letters E3 and A3 touch leaves.</p>
               <p>A notable feature of many 1796 type C Reverses is the cuts along the rim in the lower left quadrant. These defects were not in the planchet
                  when placed in the coining press. They were caused by a foreign piece of metal resting on the reverse die. These defects <pb n="110"/> appear
                  on the specimens of Reverse C illustrated here, one at 7:30 just below the U and the other at the N. Specimens of Reverse C have been seen
                  with the cut as high as T1 in the legend and as low as 6:30 close to the left ribbon tip. Some specimens of the 1796 Reverse C do not have the
                  cut.</p>

               <p>Shown is 1796 Reverse D in an early state when used with 1796 Obverse 3 to produce the JR-4 variety. Here <persName>Scot</persName>
                  reduced the number of leaves on the laurel branch to 17 (two single, six double and one triple, excluding minor recuttings) and four berries.
                  The outer berries are under E1 and S1, the same as on Reverses A and B, but one inner berry is centered under the space between T1 and E1 and
                  the other is under S1. The wide variation in location of the berries indicates <persName>Scot</persName> did not follow a fixed pattern
                  in placing the berries. The eagle—s left wing touches the rock. Letters E3 and I2 touch leaves. This reverse has heavy clash marks. Though
                  marred, the die was considered usable since no cracks had developed. On the right is 1796 Reverse D after muling with 1796 Obverse 4 to <pb n="111"/> make variety JR-5. The reverse die was lapped to polish off the clash marks. JR-5 is the rarest 1796 dime because cracks soon
                  developed in both the obverse and reverse dies. As a result, only 1,435 were delivered with Warrant No. 63 on May 27, 1796, and the die was
                  discarded.</p>
               <p>The left branch on 1796 Reverse E shown here has 19 leaves (six single, five double and one triple) and four berries. The outer berries are
                  under the right side of T1 and left center of T2. The inner berries are under the right side of T1 and the space between the letters D and S1.
                  The eagle—s left wing is clear of the rock. A2, R and I2 touch leaves. This reverse was used to produce the 10,244 JR-6 dimes dated 1796
                  delivered in February and March 1797 with Warrants 81 and 84. The reverse die was used despite the development of major cracks 1) from the rim
                  between S1 and T2 across the tops of the wings to M and the rim; 2) from the center of the top of the right wing to the eagle—s head; and 3)
                  from the field right of F along the bases of AMER, as well some minor cracks.</p>

               <p>On the right is the reverse used on all 1797 dimes, the laurel branch has 17 leaves (four single, five double and one triple) and five
                  berries. The outer berries are located under D, the highest of any lower outer berry, and under the space left of S1. The three inner berries
                  are under the left side of T1, the right center of D and the left center of S1; the last location is the lowest of any top inner berry on a
                  Small Eagle dime reverse.</p>
               <p>Although there were no design changes in the 1796 Draped Bust obverses, there is one matter deserving comment. While coining 1796 JR-5 dimes,
                  the Obverse 4 die cracked at curl 2, was removed from the coining press, lapped, and then retooled so that the first star no longer touched
                  the curl. A coin evidencing this reworking of the die appeared in trade (Auction —82, Aug. 13-14, 1982, 1602, part). It was most unusual to
                  remove a die from the coining press, <pb n="112"/> repair the die, and then return it to the coining press to complete a short run of less
                  than 1,500 coins. Possibly the repair effort weakened the die which, when reinserted after retooling, collapsed after a few more
                  strikings.</p>
               <p>The principal design change made by <persName>Scot</persName> in the Draped Bust obverses was in the number of stars, which changed from
                  15 on the 1796 dimes to 16 on the 1797 JR-1 dime in recognition of the admission of Tennessee as a state and then to 13 on the 1797 JR-2 dime
                  to eliminate the crowded appearance.</p>

               <p>In 1797 several design changes in addition to the number of stars were made in the Draped Bust obverse. The 1796 dimes had between 105 and 109
                  obverse denticles; the 1797 dimes have 114 denticles on Obverse 1 and 119 on Obverse 2. The reverse denticles for both years range between 107
                  and 110.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Scot</persName> evidently had problems with the number punches in 1797. On Obverse 1 the 1 is large and rather crude. Two
                  different punches were used for the 7s; one being a rather sharply-angled 7 and the other being more upright. The 9 punch was crudely made;
                  the 9 has a pointed tail instead of a knob at the end of the tail as had all other dimes minted in the 1790s. Possibly this pointed tail 9
                  punch was manufactured by Scot. A pointed tail 9 did not reappear on a dime until 1809.</p>
               <p>On 1797 Obverse 2, in addition to reducing the number of stars to 13, Scot used a 1 punch that is smaller than any other used for dimes in the
                  1790s. The 9 has a knob at the tip of its curled tail similar to that used for the 1796 and 1798 dimes.</p>

               <p>The public did not readily accept the Small Eagle reverse. In 1796 <persName>Scot</persName> had designed a reverse for the quarter eagle
                  based on the reverse <pb n="113"/> of the Great Seal of the United States originally designed by Charles Barton in 1782. His design appears on
                  the current dollar bill. In 1798 the quarter eagle type of reverse was adopted for the dime.</p>
               <p>Consistent with his inclination to change another—s design, <persName>Scot</persName> made major modifications in Barton—s Great Seal
                  reverse. He interchanged the objects held in the eagle—s talons, so that, as one faces the reverse, the olive branch is held in the right claw
                  and the arrows are held in the left. The motto ribbon is less windblown. The stars are placed in an open pattern under six clouds instead of
                  being enclosed in a small circle as appears on the Great Seal.</p>

               <p>The hub for the Heraldic Eagle reverse contained the eagle, shield, ribbon, motto and clouds. Because of the size of the devices on the hub,
                  great force was required to impress the hub into the working die. Consequently, many Heraldic Eagle reverse varieties consistently <pb n="114"/> show weakness of strike in the upper shield, the eagle—s breast and wing feathers and the motto ribbon. The arrows and olive branch were
                  engraved into the working die by hand, and the stars and legend letters were individually punched. On all Draped Bust Heraldic Eagle dimes
                  there are between 110 and 119 rim denticles on both the obverse and the reverse.</p>
               <p>On the Heraldic Eagle reverses used from 1798 to 1807, there are four or five berries on the olive branch and between 8 and 11, but usually
                  10, arrows in the left claw. The arrows are difficult to count unless the coin is about uncirculated or better. The number of stars on the
                  Heraldic Eagle reverses changed from 16 to 13 to 14 and back to 13, and two different sizes of star punch were used.</p>
               <p>Shown here is 1798 Reverse A, the only known 16 star reverse used for the dimes, although several 16 star reverses were used for quarter
                  eagles. Note that there are only 8 arrows and four berries.</p>
               <p>The stars on Heraldic Eagle reverses were arranged in a curved row pattern or in a diagonal line pattern. In the curved row pattern used for
                  the 16 star reverse shown below there are seven stars in the curved top row under the six clouds, then seven stars in a curved row underneath,
                  and finally one star on either side of the eagle—s head. The curved row pattern was also used on 10 of the 13 star reverses, with six stars in
                  the top row, five in the second row and then one star on either side of the eagle—s head.</p>

               <p>In the diagonal line pattern as exemplified by 1798 Reverse B, the stars are in straight rows to form a diamond pattern. This pattern was used
                  on three reverses, 1798 Reverse B, the 14 star 1804 Reverse B, and 1805 Reverse B. All of these diagonal line patterns have four berries on
                  the olive branch, narrow As in the legend, and 10 arrows in the left claw.</p>
               <p>The 1798 Reverse C is difficult to classify, since it is a combination of both the curved row and the diagonal line pattern. Although <pb n="115"/> the lines of stars are not perfectly straight, the second row of stars is not curved either. <persName>Scot</persName> may
                  have been experimenting with the positioning of the stars and thus created a transitional reverse. Possibly the 14 star reverse later used in
                  1804 was a result of these same experiments. The 1798 Reverse C has four berries, narrow As and 10 arrows.</p>
               <p>The principal design variations in the Draped Bust obverses from 1798 to 1807 were in the size and number and star punches. 1798 Obverse 1 was
                  used with both the 16 star Reverse A to produce 1798 JR-1 and the 13 star diagonal line Reverse B for 1798 JR-2. The small 8 over the large 7
                  is diagnostic for this obverse.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>For 1798 Obverse 2 <persName>Scot</persName> sunk a new die, but used the same numeral punches as on Obverse 1. The left foot of the 1
                  punch was broken; and the punch was discarded after this use. Obverse 2 was muled with Reverse C to produce 1798 JR-3.</p>
               <p>There were several punch changes on the obverse of 1798 JR-4. The 1 in the date has a flat top instead of a slant top as previously used on
                  all dimes. The 7 punch is smaller, and <persName>Scot</persName> used a mediumsized 8 punch in place of the small 8. The flat top style
                  for the 1 and the medium 8 were used for all later Draped Bust dime obverses with only slight variations in shape, possibly due to variations
                  in punching.</p>
               <p>The dies for the 1797 to 1807 quarter eagle and the Heraldic Eagle reverse dimes were the same diameter. Since the Heraldic Eagle reverse did
                  not indicate the denomination, it was an easy matter to use the same reverse for both denominations. This appealed to <persName>Scot</persName>, who was a notoriously slow worker and was frequently required to replace cracked and shattered dies. The die failures were
                  due largely to inadequately hardened steel, improper annealing of the working dies, or striking problems due to poor coin design or to clashed
                  dies.</p>
               <pb n="116"/>
               <p>Of the 15 Heraldic Eagle reverses used for dimes, seven were used to strike quarter eagles. The first reverse used for both denominations was
                  the 16 star reverse of the 1797 B-1 quarter eagle and the 1798 JR-1 Reverse A dime previously discussed.</p>
               <p>The second reverse die used in common for quarter eagles and dimes was for the 1798 B-2 quarter eagle and the 1798 JR-4 and 1800 JR-1 dimes
                  illustrated here. On this die there are 10 arrows in the claw, narrow As in the legend and five olives on the branch. All later dime reverses,
                  except 1804 JR-2 Reverse B and 1805 JR-2 Reverse B, have five olives. Note the crack on the dime reverse from the tip of the second feather of
                  the left wing to the rim and the incipient rim crumbling over E2, S2, O and F.</p>

                  from the rim to the right center tail feather. A specimen of 1800 JR-1 with a bisecting reverse die crack has been reported. The progressive
                  deterioration of the reverse die can readily be seen when the 1798 B-2 quarter eagle reverse and the reverses on the 1798 JR-4 and 1800 JR-2
                  dimes are compared together.</p>

               <p>Illustrated here are the obverse and reverse of the only known specimen of the 1802 JR-1 dime. It was first identified by <persName>Bill Subjack</persName>
                  <pb n="117"/> from a photograph (Stack—s, April 27, 1967 [<placeName>Copeland</placeName>], 469). The coin later appeared in a 1982 auction
                  (Superior, June 7-10, 1982 [<persName>Miguel Mu—oz</persName>], 58). Its chief claim to fame, in addition to its great rarity, is that it
                  is the only Heraldic Eagle reverse die used to strike a dime before being used for a quarter eagle. The second use of this reverse die was for
                  the 1802 B-4 quarter eagle. The third use was for Reverse A of the 1803 JR-1 dime.</p>
               <p>Shown here is the reverse of the 1802 B-3 quarter eagle. The same die was later used to strike Reverse C for the 1802 JR-3 dime. The most
                  unusual feature of this reverse is that the left claw holds nine arrows instead of the usual 10. Cracks on the dime reverse developed 1) from
                  the C to A3 and the rim; and 2) from cloud 6 through the stars, shield, left claw and arrows to the rim.</p>
               <p>The same die was later used for Reverse B on the 1803 JR-2 dime. The cracks, enlarged and multiplied, now run 1) from I2, C and A3 to the rim;
                  2) from cloud 6 through the stars, shield, left claw and arrows to the rim; 3) from the rim to the top of F and the right wing; and in a late
                  die state 4) from the rim at D through the stars to S2 and the rim.</p>

               <p>In much the same way a common reverse die was used to strike in order the 1802 B-4 quarter eagle, the 1802 JR-3 dime, then the 1804 B-2
                  quarter eagle and finally the 1804 JR-1 dime.</p>
               <p>The 1802 B-1 quarter eagle reverse is known only from its marriage with the 1802/1 quarter eagle obverse. Four different reverse dies were
                  used for the 3,035 quarter eagles minted with the same obverse die dated 1802/1. All specimens of this second rarest 1802 quarter eagle
                  reverse show little wear, and no major cracks have been noted. Yet the die, so far as is known, was never remarried to any other obverse die,
                  while other reverse dies with incorrect designs or prior-use defects were used with one or more obverse dies. Collectors should carefully
                  examine the reverses of their <pb n="118"/> Heraldic Eagle dimes. They may discover a new variety from the marriage of a known dime obverse
                  with this or another —merry widow— quarter eagle reverse.</p>
               <p>Illustrated are the two uses of the popular, and not very rare, 14 star reverse. The legend has narrow As from the punch Scot used in 1798,
                  there are 10 arrows in the claw and only four olives on the branch, and the stars are arranged in the diagonal line pattern.</p>

               <p>Perhaps the effort to achieve a line pattern similar to the neat and compact 1-4-3-4-1 star-shaped pattern on the Great Seal was too much for
                  Scot, and he lost count of the stars. Many numismatists believe that this die was set aside when made and later given new life when an acute
                  Heraldic Eagle reverse die shortage, possibly due to <persName>Scot—s</persName> slow production habits, necessitated its revival.</p>

                  but <persName>Jefferson</persName> hesitated to pressure <persName>Boudinot</persName>.<ref target="#CH7-n28">28</ref>
                  <persName>Breen</persName> speculates that <persName>Scot</persName>, as a good bureaucrat, had convinced <persName>Boudinot</persName> that matters in the engraving department were under control.<ref target="#CH7-n29">29</ref> Not so with <persName>Robert Patterson</persName> who became Director of the Mint in July 1805.<ref target="#CH7-n30">30</ref> In March 1807 <persName>Patterson</persName> wrote <persName>Jefferson</persName> —Our present Engraver, <persName>Mr. Scot</persName>, though indeed a
                  meritorious and faithful Officer, is yet so far advanced in life, that he cannot very long be expected to continue his labors.—<ref target="#CH7-n31">31</ref>
                  <persName>Patterson</persName> then suggested that <persName>John Reich</persName>, who was threatening to return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>, be retained on a small salary, <pb n="119"/> and continued with the opinion that —the
                  beauty of our coins would be greatly improved by the assistance of his [<persName>Reich—s</persName>] masterly hand.— Despite <persName>Patterson—s</persName> misgivings, the mint produced the 1807 dimes using Draped Bust and Heraldic Eagle dies prepared by <persName>Scot</persName>.</p>
               <p>Illustrated is the last Heraldic Eagle reverse die used in common for quarter eagles and dimes. It proved to be a real work horse. It was used
                  for all quarter eagles dated 1805, 1806 and 1807 and was then used to produce well over 110,000 dimes dated 1807. Shown are the reverses of
                  the 1805 B-1, 1806 B-1 and 1807 B-1 quarter eagles and the 1807 JR-1 dime reverse. There are 11 arrows in the eagle—s claw, five olives on the
                  branch, and wide As in the legend. The dime reverse evidences substantial wear on the die at the denticles and the E in the motto and many
                  clash marks.</p>

                  <persName>Robert Scot</persName> did not retire at age 67 in 1807 despite his failing physical powers. Interestingly, his tenure at the
                  mint was extended greatly by an indentured German immigrant, <persName>John Reich</persName>, who was brought on as Assistant Engraver on
                  April 1, 1807. No stranger to the mint staff, <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> had done contract work for the mint as
                  early as 1801. His lowly background led to official caution toward his acceptance as permanent staff, at least, that is, until the mint itself
                  felt a critical need.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> made his presence felt almost immediately with his new Capped Bust design for the
                  obverse and a much stylized variation of the Heraldic Eagle in the reverses, used for dimes beginning in 1809.</p>
               <p>But these were troubled days for the mint in many ways. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold and dollars were
                  either exported or melted, rarely circulating anywhere. Neither the banks nor the public were very receptive to small silver <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> coins—quarters, dimes, or half dimes. Mint Director <persName>Patterson</persName> wrote to <persName>Jefferson</persName> in April 1807 that over 100,000 dimes lay unwanted in Mint vaults, while
                  small Spanish silver circulated plentifully.<ref target="#CH7-n32">32</ref>
                  <persName>Reich—s</persName> design was therefore first implemented in 1807 for the only readily accepted silver coin, the half dollar.
                  (Half eagles with a variation of the <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> design also appeared in this year.) Efforts at
                  reintroducing the dime had to wait two more years. Ironically, while the mint had great difficulty in getting its output accepted by the
                  country, it was continually and severely criticized for not producing enough coinage to satisfy public needs. Every few years from 1793 on,
                  Congress had to renew a temporary law permitting selected foreign coins to circulate legally in the <placeName>United States</placeName>.
                  The act was not renewed in 1806, however, and was allowed to expire by Congress in the hope that the mint had finally solved its production
                  problems. Apparently not so, for in 1815 <placeName corresp="#geonames_4361885">Maryland</placeName> bankers appealed to Congress to
                  reinstate foreign coins to permit lawful distribution of the swelling bank inventory.<ref target="#CH7-n33">33</ref> All this while, the
                  public held less than one <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> silver coin for each living person. For months Congress
                  resisted this request.</p>
               <p>A major fire at the mint on January 11, 1816, destroyed a wooden building housing the rolling and drawing machines, as well as the melting
                  house. According to the letter from Mint Director <persName>Patterson</persName> to <persName>President Madison</persName>, no open
                  flame was permitted in the area <pb n="121"/> where the fire broke out, nor were any workmen there for several days. He said, —...The manner
                  in which the fire originated is perfectly unaccountable.—<ref target="#CH7-n34">34</ref> Relation of these two events may only be
                  circumstantial, but within a few weeks of the fire, Congress renewed the foreign coin act, as it would do periodically until 1857.</p>
               <p>These events laid the framework for mint activity for the remaining bust coinage period. There was almost continual pressure to increase mint
                  output, not through additional labor, but through new technology. There was also need to turn out an attractive product acceptable to commerce
                  and to the general public. These problems were addressed jointly through the efforts of the resourceful coiner and general <persName>handyman Adam Eckfeldt</persName> and through the engravers <persName>Robert Scot</persName> and his assistant <persName>John
                     Reich</persName>. There may also have been engraving support from a contract employee, <persName>Moritz Furst</persName>, who is known to
                  have designed certain Congressional medals from 1808 to 1828.<ref target="#CH7-n35">35</ref>

               <p>A new steam engine was installed in June 1816 to improve the operation of rolling and drawing of ingots, and at least some planchet cutting.
                  The new equipment enabled the mint to produce blank planchets that were smoother, rounder and flatter. This explains in good measure why file
                  or adjustment marks (used to reduce excess <pb n="122"/> weight of faulty planchets) are more prevalent before 1816. The new steam engine
                  apparently did not aid coin striking.</p>
               <p>Both <persName>Scot</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> remained active in this period, as the basic
                     <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> design was extended to all denominations. In each side by side comparison between
                  the two, <persName>Reich—s</persName> workmanship noticeably surpasses that of his superior.</p>
               <p>Note in particular the denticles around the perimeter of the coin. To ease his burden, the near-sighted <persName>Scot</persName>
                  broadened the size of these triangular-shaped spacers, greatly decreasing their number, giving the coin a crude and sloppy look. The <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> coin has 93 denticles, while <persName>Scot</persName> has 78. It is easy, however,
                  to see that <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> also had limited artistic vision. Legend has it that mint employees 50
                  years after <persName>Reich—s</persName> departure referred to the portrait of Liberty as that of <persName>Reich—s</persName> —fat
                     mistress.—<ref target="#CH7-n36">36</ref> The comparison between the work of <persName>Scot</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> extends to the reverses as well, since one notes the shallowness of the <persName>Scot</persName>
                  central figure in contrast to the <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> effort of 1809.</p>
               <p>Mint morale must have reached crisis depths after the mint fire of 1816. But by early 1817 repairs and improvements to the establishments were
                  nearly complete, and <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> requested a long-awaited increase in wages. This request was
                  denied, and <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName> in disgust-some say in ill health—resigned. This left a now 77-year-old
                     <persName>Robert Scot</persName> as the only permanent mint engraver. Dimes were not struck again until 1820, but judging from the
                  quality, and sometimes lack of quality of certain 1820 issues, <persName>Scot</persName> most assuredly was assisted with die
                  preparation, perhaps by the aforementioned <persName>Moritz Furst</persName>. The 1820 JR-2 reverse, for example, is a veritable jumble
                  of letter recuttings and errors, such as a U punched between D of UNITED and S of STATES.</p>

               <p>In 1820 mint dime output increased to 942,000, a figure nearly as great as the total output for the prior 21 years. This was followed in 1821

                  level that would give the nation an ample supply of its own coinage. The coin striking process comprised multiple events. After good quality
                  planchets were prepared, reeding was applied to the edge with a milling or Castaing machine, named after its inventor. This consisted of two
                  grooved, parallel bars, one fixed and one movable. The distance between the bars was adjustable, depending on the denomination of the planchet
                  to be reeded. The operator placed blank planchets between the bars, sliding the movable bar past the fixed bar, thus squeezing the reeding
                  into the rotating planchet. The obverse and reverse dies were then impressed into the reeded planchet to produce the finished coin. An obvious
                  productivity gain would be to combine the reeding and design stamping operations.</p>

               <p>It is customary to think of Capped Bust coinage (dimes, quarters, quarter eagles and half eagles) as large or small size. The size difference
                  is usually attributed to the use of a closed collar die process. <pb n="124"/> With a closed collar, the stamping force expands the planchet
                  diameter radially until it hits a corrogated collar die, which imparts the familiar reeded edge. Since the collar limits the outward expansion
                  of the planchet, the coins are assumed to have a smaller diameter with this process. The closed collar is known to have been used with half
                  dollars in 1836, with quarter dollars in 1831, and is thought to have initiated with dimes in 1828. Judging striking technique from planchet
                  size is misleading. Recent research proves that —large size— dimes dated as early as 1821 are known to have used a closed collar die reeding,
                  and the practice was widespread with dimes by 1825. In this regard, the dime was a role model for some of the more popular coinage series.</p>
               <p>Of interest is the reeding on these dimes. Opposite the lowest arrowhead, the edge shows an unusual doubled reed, barely separated by a fine
                  line. This curious defect is the only flaw in the reeding. It appears on every specimen at exactly the same place on each coin (indicated by
                  arrows on the photographs). The only conclusion that can reasonably be drawn is that each of the coins was struck using a closed collar
                  process, that each used the same collar die, and that each was struck at the same time. Since it is most unlikely that 1824 dimes were struck
                  before 1824, and it is known that the mint produced no dimes that year, the conclusion is reached that all of the coins were struck in 1825.
                  This position is reasonable since other collar die fingerprints (but not the same as the set above) are common to all 1825 JR-1, JR-3, and
                  JR-4 dimes. Further evidence of early collar die use is the exact diameter for the set of 1821-1824 coins, a feature also shared by the second
                  set of 1825 varieties above.</p>
               <p>Implementation of the closed collar process may also have had favorable effects on obverse and reverse die life as well. Note the cuds on the
                  1831/33/34 reverses (indicated by arrows). A true cud occurs when a piece of either die falls out. As new coins are struck with the broken
                  die, the two dies force metal above the planchet surface as a blob of silver in the shape of the defect. Of the 21 bust dime varieties with
                  reported cuds, 19 of these were struck with the closed collar die process. Perhaps the support of the collar device held the damaged die
                  together longer. The die failure can also occur in the collar die itself. Note the edge of the 1832 JR-3 with edge die failure opposite the
                  first T in STATES. The open collar dies also seem particularly susceptible to warping, evidenced by a noticeable bulging on many coins so
                  struck. These defects unfortunately are not as evident in photos as on the coins themselves.</p>
               <p>As seen in Table 4, the mint succeeded in steadily improving the life of its dies. The largest jump occurred about 1805, probably due to
                  improvements in steel tempering techniques about that date. <pb n="125"/>

                  The real differences in the coins are the smaller stars and smaller date of the modified coin on the left. A second design change is the
                  return to the 1793-style beaded border, replacing the wide triangular denticles introduced by <persName corresp="#viaf_2349137">Reich</persName>, and exaggerated by <persName>Scot</persName>. The overall impact is a much neater and refined impression of Liberty,
                  although the central device has not been changed at all, since <persName>Kneass</persName> probably used the same hub punch.</p>
               <pb n="127"/>
               <p>The first of two transition years, 1828, is a time during which <persName>Kneass</persName> introduced his design changes one by one. It
                  is not known whether he had any assistance from <persName>Christian Gobrecht</persName> in this project. Although not a permanent mint
                  employee until mid-1835, there is a record of payment to <persName>Gobrecht</persName> for modeling and executing die designs as early as
                  August 1825.<ref target="#CH7-n37">37</ref> Note on the 1828 JR-1, the old style reverse with 101 denticles is combined with the small date
                  obverse. On the JR-2, the large date obverse is now combined with 133 narrowly-spaced but still triangular denticles.</p>
               <p>The second year of dramatic design transitions is 1829. <persName>Kneass</persName> apparently never did decide how to handle the
                  denticle problem. He began the year with the old style triangular denticles for the first two varieties, but switched to a uniformly-beaded
                  edge for the other 10 varieties. The number of reverse denticles varies from a high of 159 for JR-7 and JR-8, to a low of 89 for JR-2. The
                  latter die has much in common with the two 1823 reverses and may be left over from that period.</p>

                  style used 1820-28. Although attractive, it is not as neat and sharp <pb n="128"/> as <persName>Kneass</persName> wanted. He next reduced
                  the size, adding a curved neck and a squared base. This variation probably came across as too top heavy, for <persName>Kneass</persName>
                  then tried the sole variety with a curled base 2. This rare variety is more vertical and trim than either of the two previous styles, and it
                  resembles the curled base 2 he used on nearly every other denomination. <persName>Kneass</persName> finally opted for an angular, yet
                  neat 2.</p>
               <p>Other than the number of denticles, the most obvious reverse design change is the size of the 10 C denomination.</p>

               <p>From left to right, the first reverse has an extra large 10 C, being used a second time after 1828 service. The second is JR-2 with a large
                  and thick 10 C. The third is a small 10 C, the most common size in this year. The fourth represents a small 10 C punched over a large 10 C.

               <p>The vertical bundles in the heraldic shield are termed gules. Prior to 1829 hubs contained three-pale gules. In this year both two- and

                  returning to the two-pale gules 1832-37, when the Bust design was replaced.</p>

               <p>From the time of <persName>Reich—s</persName> resignation in 1817, <persName>Scot</persName>, <persName>Kneass</persName> and
                  later <persName>Gobrecht</persName> all seemed to experiment with the design of the 8 in the date. The two basic designs are referred to
                  as fancy 8 and block 8. It is not certain which engraver fashioned each individual die in the various denominations from 1817 to 1839. This
                  remains an issue which deserves further study. For the dimes, all dates before 1835 use a block 8 exclusively. In the period 1835-37, both
                  fancy and block 8s are employed. What does seem likely is that <persName>Kneass</persName> is responsible for one design, while <persName>Gobrecht</persName> produced the other variant during this period. Dimes manufactured in 1835, the year of <persName>Kneass—s</persName> stroke and <persName>Gobrecht—s</persName> full employment, have a broader variation of planchet sizing than any
                  other Bust dime date.</p>
               <p>There was almost constant change in planchet diameter throughout the 41-year history of Bust dimes (see Table 5). For the Draped Bust period,
                  1796-1807, all coins are in the 20 mm diameter range. The size changes seem random with respect both to variety and to individual coins within
                  a variety. <persName>John Reich</persName> made a distinct reduction to the 19.0-19.25 mm range with his Capped Bust design. The
                  experimentalist <persName>Kneass</persName> never did settle on an optimum size for his coins, gradually reducing the size from 19.0 mm
                  in 1827 to a minimum of 18.3 in 1835, then increasing again as high as 18.8 mm in the 1837 closing year. Of interest is that by 1823 all coins
                  of a given date and variety are the same diameter, again supporting the closed collar die theory for these —large size— coins.</p>
               <p>Bust dimes for several reasons have not enjoyed the same popularity as some of the other series. One of the major reasons may be their
                  unappreciated rarity. Table 6 shows the relative frequency of appearance for each of the Bust dime dates compared to other early <pb n="130"/>
                  <placeName>U.S</placeName>. coins of more or less known rarity. It is based on analysis of 419 public auctions over three distinct time
                  periods from 1858 to 1978. This approach should minimize trends in collector interest. As shown in the table, 1804 is the rarest date Bust
                  dime, but it is only marginally scarcer than any of its 1800-1803 counterparts. None of the Capped Bust issues is as rare as these, although
                  1822 is genuinely scarce, with 1809 and 1811 uncommon. <figure xml:id="fig-137">

                  </figure> Of interest is the rarity of many of the dime dates compared to 1793 cents of any design. The great difference in value of the dimes
                  compared to, say, the 1793 chain cent can only be attributed to the current popularity <pb n="132"/> of the copper issue. Similar conclusions
                  can be drawn with highly-priced 1796 quarters and the 1795-98 small eagle $5 gold. On the other hand, none of the dimes can be considered as
                  rare as any of the early quarter eagles, the 1796-1797 half dollars or the 1838-O half dollar. Auction records don—t provide exact indicators
                  of extant populations, but they do put into perspective how scarce the Bust dime series really is.</p>
               <p>Despite all the problems with the mint regarding productivity, die life and the artistic merit of their designs, one area of which they could
                  be proud was quality control with respect to releasing error or defective coins. Unlike copper coinage, which regularly appears double struck,
                  overstruck on other coinage, or off-center, silver or gold coinage errors of any type are extremely scarce.</p>

               <p>Perhaps even more interesting is the reverse brockage shown with the four reverses with which this die was used. Although the brockage has no

                  the left wing and the rim.</p>
               <p>The story of the Bust dime could end here, but much work remains to clarify the picture. Note, for example, the 1797 JR-1 dime with the crude
                  pointed 9 in the date. This coin may have utilized the same 9 punch that was used on the 1797 low head half cent, which was proven by <persName>Roger Cohen</persName> and <persName>Walter Breen</persName> to have been struck in 1800. No other pointed 9 coins seem to
                  have been struck between 1794 and 1799. Could the 21,760 dimes delivered at the end of March 1800 really have been dated 1797? The half cents
                  in question were all delivered between April and early June of that year.</p>

               <p>Note also the 1815 and 1825 Browning-3 quarters<ref target="#CH7-n40">40</ref> counterstamped over the head with E or L. Consider that only
                  one E and one L punch seems to have been used. Of many E counterstamps, <pb n="134"/> all seem placed at the top front of the cap, while all
                  Ls are placed above the peak of the cap. Consider that nearly all extant specimens of the counterstamped coins are in extremely fine to
                  uncirculated condition, whereas most all uncounterstamped Capped Bust quarters are in wretched condition. It is easy to speculate that both of
                  these issues were produced not as dated 10 years apart, but at the same time in 1825. Could the Es and Ls represent changes in minting
                  technique, such as the closed collar die which was introduced for the dime in that same year of 1825? Perhaps these were not released to the
                  public until years later, when they would not readily circulate with coinage of a new design? Could the E stand for —edge collar die reeding—?
                  Could the L mean —lathe— application of the same reeding?</p>

               <p>No, the real story of the Bust dime will not be answered until many more comparisons are made with other denominations, as these all were
                  produced by the same people operating in the same time and place. The human nature evident in the variability of each die is the very reason
                  why the entire series of Bust United States coinage has been such a favorite of collectors over the past century.</p>

            <p>Liberty Seated silver coins were minted for circulation during a 55-year period from 1837 to 1891. Design changes, such as the addition of stars
               to the obverse in 1838 and the addition of arrows next to the date in 1853 and 1873, are well-documented modifications and known to all
               collectors of Seated coinage. But other design changes took place during the production of the Seated series which have never been
               well-documented and are unknown to most collectors today. Many of these hub changes are clearly visible on the silver coinage that we collect,
               but are not mentioned in many of the standard reference books on nineteenth century coinage. The significance of these modifications is that they
               have created many interesting, unusual and rare varieties that have not gotten the attention they deserve. This paper will attempt to describe
               the hub changes that were introduced into the Liberty Seated coinage and to identify varieties where they are known to exist.</p>
            <p>Major revisions in the design of nineteenth century silver coinage took place during three periods. These will be identified as the Gobrecht era
               1839-1842, the Civil War era 1858-1862, and the Centennial era 1875-1878. During these periods nearly all of the silver denominations went
               through design modifications that are not well-documented in the numismatic literature. Design revisions will be examined for each of these
               periods for the different denominations.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Christian Gobrecht</persName> was appointed Assistant Engraver of the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint in 1835 and
                  was immediately put to work designing a series of patterns for a new silver dollar. Over the next five years his Liberty Seated design was
                  adopted for all the silver denominations from the half dime to the dollar. <persName>Gobrecht</persName> was appointed Chief Engraver of
                  the Mint on December 21, 1840, and continued to serve in this position until his death on July 23, 1844. The adoption of the Liberty Seated
                  design to each denomination, however, did not signal an end of the work on the dies of that denomination. A series of revisions in the designs
                  were made during the early years, presumably to enhance the beauty of the design or to correct weaknesses in the design encountered during the
                  striking process.</p>
               <p>Liberty Seated half dimes and dimes were first struck in 1837 without stars in the obverse field. Thirteen stars were added in an are around
                  the obverse in 1838 to fill the open areas in the field. <pb n="139"/> Furthermore, the obverse of the half dime, dime and quarter were
                  modified by the addition of drapery folds from the right elbow in 1840. In addition to these well-known revisions, a variety of other
                  modifications were made during this era, which have not been sufficiently documented. The rarities of many of the resulting varieties are yet
                  to be determined and the potential for the discovery of new varieties is still very real.</p>
               <div3 xml:id="d1e14829" type="subsection">
                  <head>1.1 HALF DIMES</head>
                  <p>The numismatic literature states that a new design was adopted for the half dime in 1840 with drapery at the elbow. While it is true that
                     drapery folds were added to the design, this statement doesn—t reflect the fact that the entire obverse was completely redone at this time.
                     The rock on which Liberty is seated was reduced in size and the shield was turned to a more upright position. The lettering LIBERTY on the
                     ribbon is bolder and now runs in a more diagonal manner across the shield. The right hand was moved up the pole and the index finger now
                     points up to the cap. The head of Liberty has been completely redone and the 13 stars are bolder. The rock to the left of the shield has
                     been reduced in size and the folds in the gown completely changed—in reality a completely new obverse for the half dime.</p>

                  <p>With a major revision in the obverse of the half dime in 1840 it would seem reasonable that the reverse did not escape the designer—s
                     attention. And this was indeed the case. The reverse modifications are much less noticeable, but nonetheless detectable upon examination.
                     The most obvious change was in the leaves in the wreath on either side of the lettering DIME on the reverse. On the old reverse <pb n="140"/> the leaves on both sides appear in clusters of four. On the new reverse the leaves are in clusters of three. Furthermore, each of the 12
                     buds in the wreath has been opened, each now showing a slit in the end. The lettering in the new reverse is slightly larger, but this is
                     difficult to detect unless both reverses are held side by side.</p>

                  <p>The dates 1840 and 1840-0 are known to exist with the old obverse and reverse and with the new obverse and reverse. The With Drapery
                     varieties are more difficult to locate for both dates of this year. One important feature of the new dies is that there is the potential
                     for transitional varieties for the years 1840 and 1841. It is possible that one of the old dies was used with one of the new dies to create
                     a transitional variety of this period. None of these transitional varieties have been discovered as yet, but the existence of such
                     varieties for other denominations indicates that they are a distinct possibility.</p>

                  <p>The obverse of the dime was extensively revised in 1840 in a way similar to that of the half dime. The drapery folds were added below the
                     elbow, the shield was moved to a more upright position, the right hand was moved up the pole and the index finger pointed to the cap, the
                     rock reduced in size and the features of Liberty completely changed. The obverse is distinctly different from that used in the previous two
                     years. The reverse was also modified in 1840, but the revisions are not immediately evident. The one identifiable feature that
                     distinguishes the two reverses is that each of the 12 buds in the wreath of the new design have been opened with a slit.</p>

                     without drapery and with the old closed bud reverse. With Drapery dimes are not known for the 1840-0 date. Of importance here is that two
                     varieties of the 1841-0 dime are known With Drapery, but with the old closed bud reverse. Both of these transitional varieties are rare and
                     represent significant discoveries in the Liberty Seated series. The 1841-0 transitional dime with the large O mint mark has been known for
                     about 12 years and has proven to be an elusive variety to obtain even with extensive searching. This variety would have an R-6 rarity
                     rating with perhaps 20 pieces known. The 1841-0 transitional dime with the small o mint mark was discovered no more than five years ago and
                     still remains an R-7 rarity with perhaps no more than five examples of this variety identified. Other transitional varieties might exist.
                     Only extensive study of the pieces of this era will determine if others are yet to be identified.</p>

                  <p>Liberty Seated quarters were first struck in 1838 with a No Drapery obverse. The obverse of the quarter was also revised in 1840, but not
                     as extensively as the obverse of the half dime and dime. For the quarter obverse, drapery folds were added to the gown below the right
                     elbow and the hand was moved up the pole with the index finger pointing up to the cap. The lettering LIBERTY was enlarged on the ribbon,
                     but the shield itself was not moved to an upright position.</p>
                  <pb n="142"/>
                  <p>The reverse of the quarters of 1838 has an eagle with open talons on both claws. In 1839 the reverse was revised to show an eagle with
                     closed talons on each claw. The significance of this revision is that the old reverse was also used in 1839 creating the transitional
                     variety known as the 1839 quarter with the Reverse of 1838. This variety has been known for several years now and the transitional variety
                     does not seem to be particularly rare.</p>

                  <p>The two reverses of 1838 and 1839 both show an eagle with a tongue. The quarter reverse was modified again in 1840 to present an eagle
                     without a tongue. The 1840-0 No Drapery quarters have a large O mint mark and very shallow denticles around the edge of the obverse and
                     reverse. The 1840-0 With Drapery quarters have a small o mint mark and broader denticles that reach in much closer to the lettering <placeName>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</placeName> and QUAR. DOL. The reverse design itself remained unchanged, but the broader reverse
                     denticles match the new denticles used on the With Drapery obverses of this year. There is little doubt that the new obverse and reverse
                     dies with the broad denticles were meant to be used together. With this point in mind, there is one transitional variety that has <pb n="143"/> drawn a lot of attention from Seated collectors. This variety is an 1840-0 With Drapery quarter with a large O mint mark that
                     has a double row of crudely-engraved denticles around the edge. The large O mint mark and the nature of the denticles would suggest that
                     the reverse was once a shallow denticle reverse that was intended for use with the No Drapery obverses. It appears that this reverse was
                     modified by hand to be used with the new obverse dies. The double row of reverse denticles make the variety interesting to study, and one
                     can only speculate as to why it was considered necessary to modify an old reverse die. The 1840-0 With Drapery quarter with the large O
                     mint mark is a rare variety and would have to carry an R-6 rarity rating with perhaps 20 pieces known to exist.</p>

                  <p>Half dollars of the Liberty Seated design were first struck for circulation in 1839 from a No Drapery obverse. During this first year of
                     production the obverse design was modified by decreasing the size of the rock and by adding three small lines of drapery below the right
                     elbow. It is worth noting that the obverse design for the half dollar was modified a year earlier and not so extensively as the obverse of
                     the three smaller denominations.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>It does not appear that any revisions were made in the design of the reverse of the Seated half dollar during the first three years of
                     production, but one very unusual variety does exist for the year 1840. All reverses of the first three years of Seated half production have
                     small letters on the reverse, except one variety known as the 1840 with the Reverse of 1838. This reverse is actually a leftover Bust half
                     reverse used with a Liberty Seated obverse. The differences in the Bust design are very striking. The letters on the reverse are <pb n="144"/> much larger and the shield on the eagle—s breast is much larger. This is the only Seated half with three feathered shafts and
                     the only reverse where the eagle has a tongue. The talons on both claws are open and the upper bud in the olive branch is in a different
                     position. There is little doubt that this variety was struck from a Bust half reverse, but no explanation as to why this was done has ever
                     surfaced. The 1840 half with the Reverse of 1838 is a scarce variety with a rarity rating of R-6. It is an extremely interesting variety
                     that is in demand by half dollar collectors and worthy of numismatic study. Several large die cracks on the reverse make for easy
                     identification of the variety and an emission sequence for the pieces struck from this die is easy to develop.</p>
                  <p>The reverse of the half dollar was changed in 1842 with an increase in the size of the lettering. All halves of 1842 have the large
                     lettering except for the 1842-0 Small Date variety. The rare 1842-0 Small Date variety is therefore easily distinguished from the Large
                     Date varieties by the size of the reverse lettering. Any attempt at adding a mint mark to an 1842 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> half could therefore be easily detected.</p>

                  dramatic, but others were minor and have been ignored for over 100 years. Interestingly enough, the old and new dies were used side by side
                  for several years, in some cases without much attention being noted of this fact in the numismatic literature. Identifying features will be

                  <p>The stars obverse with the upright shield for half dimes was modified in 1859 to create a one-year type issue. The 1859 obverse had hollow
                     stars with larger lettering in the word LIBERTY on the ribbon. The features of Liberty were changed and the index finger no longer points
                     up the pole. The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> half dimes of 1859 continued to use the old design
                     without modification. In 1860 additional changes were made in the obverse and the reverse of the half dime. The stars on the obverse were
                     removed and the legend <pb n="145"/>
                     <placeName>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</placeName> took their place. The small wreath on the reverse around which the legend had appeared
                     was replaced by a much larger cereal wreath with only the denomination HALF DIME running through the center of the wreath. This design
                     continued in use through the end of the half dime series in 1873.</p>

                     are rare today. The 1859 transitional half dime would rate an R-6 rarity with perhaps 15 known to exist, while the 1860 transitional half

                  <p>The stars obverse for dimes was used through pieces dated 1859. In 1860 the legend <placeName>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</placeName> was
                     removed <pb n="146"/> from the reverse and added on the obverse in place of the 13 stars. The new reverse of 1860 had a much larger cereal

                  <p>The legend obverse first appeared on the dimes in 1860, but a year later the obverse design was modified again. In 1860 there was only a

                     is known for the date 1861 and all following dates in the series. The small segment obverse is much rarer for the 1861 dime, the only date

                  <p>The reverse die of the quarter was also modified slightly during this period. For all quarters of 1858 and before, the eagle—s eye is
                     negative or concave. In 1859 a new reverse die was introduced where the eagle—s eye is positive or convex. The numismatically interesting
                     point to this change is that both reverse hubs were used at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> mint to strike pieces dated 1859, 1860 and 1861. All pieces of 1862 and later were struck from the new reverse with
                     the convex eye. At the branch mints it was a completely different story. In New Orleans the old design was used to strike the 1860-O and
                     all pieces prior to that date. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> the old design with the concave
                     eye continued in use through 1865. One consequence of this information is that a different reverse design was used to strike quarters
                     during the Civil War in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> than at the branch mint in

                  <p>A new reverse was introduced into the half dollar series in 1858. The changes are only minor, but the revisions significant enough to
                     detect without magnification. For all half dollars dated 1857 and before, the lower right edge of the letter L in the word HALF extended
                     only slightly beyond the upper right edge of the letter. For the new hub introduced in 1858, the lower right edge of the letter L extends
                     well beyond the upper edge of the upper serif of the letter. Both reverses are known for the dates 1858, 1859 and 1860 with only the new
                     reverse appearing at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> mint in 1861 and after. The
                     new reverse was not introduced into production in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> until 1862. Both
                     reverses are known for the 1862-S and the 1864-S halves with only the new reverse known for the 1863-S and 1865-S dates. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> we have both reverses known for the 1860-O half with only the new reverse
                     known for the 1861-O date. It is possible that additional reverse varieties exist. Additional study will be needed to establish reliable
                     rarity estimates for the known varieties of this period.</p>

                  improve the quality of the designs then in use and each silver denomination underwent minor changes. Some of the resulting varieties are very
                  rare and many different varieties are known to exist. The numismatic literature has shown very little interest in these modifications, so that

                  <p>The reverse design of the dime was modified slightly in 1876. The old reverse hub had a split ribbon end on the left ribbon below the
                     wreath. The new hub had a pointed ribbon end on the left ribbon below the wreath. Other minor modifications can be noted in the new
                     reverse, but the left ribbon end is the most distinct change that was made. The numismatically important fact about this change is that the
                     two reverses were used side by side for a period of three years. Both reverses are known for the dates 1876, 1876-S, 1876-CC, 1877,
                     1877-CC, 1878 and 1878-CC. Some of these varieties are scarce, but the only one that can be considered rare is the new pointed ribbon
                     reverse on the 1876-CC date. This variety is very rare and would rate as an R-7 rarity with perhaps 10 pieces known to exist. At least one
                     gem uncirculated example of this rarity has been seen. A few circulated specimens of the rarity have been identified during the 12 years
                     that the variety has been known.</p>

                  <p>The Centennial era also produced a modification in the reverse of the quarter, but, surprisingly enough, the new reverse first appeared in
                     1875. While several minor changes have been noted, the key to identification of the new reverse is in the shape of the letter A in the word
                     STATES. For the old reverse used before 1875, the letter A in STATES has wide serifs. For the new reverse that first appeared in 1875, the
                     letter A in STATES has short serifs. Here, again, the two reverses were used side by side, but this time for a period of only two years.
                     Both reverses are known for the dates 1875, <pb n="150"/> 1875-S, 1876, 1876-S and 1876-CC. Only the new reverse with the short serifs is
                     known for the 1875-CC quarter. The 1875-CC quarter is a scarce date, and so far none of the pieces examined have turned up with the old
                     reverse.</p>

                  <p>The 1876-CC quarter is known to have been struck with fine reeding, the only year in which quarters were struck with the 153 reeds around
                     the edge. It is interesting to note that the fine reeding appears with both reverse designs for this year.</p>
                  <p>The most surprising thing about the introduction of the new reverse is that the old reverse with the wide serifs on the letter A in STATES
                     was used to strike some quarters of 1879 and 1880. It is not known why one of the old reverses was used so many years after the
                     introduction of the new design.</p>

                  <p>The reverse of the half dollar was modified in 1876. The old reverse used on all halves of 1875 and before has an open bud in the branch
                     over the letter H in HALF. The new reverse introduced in 1876 has a closed bud. Again, the two reverses were used side <pb n="151"/> by
                     side for a period of two years. Both reverses are known for the dates 1876, 1876-S, 1877, 1877-S and 1877-CC. The new closed bud reverse is
                     very rare for the 1876-S half and unknown for the 1876-CC half.</p>
                  <p>The old reverse hub did not disappear, however, in 1877. The old open bud reverse is known to exist for some proof specimens of 1879, 1880
                     and 1881. The appearance of these old reverse dies for the low mintage dates of 1879 and later is quite surprising, since the small
                     mintages of this period did not warrant the use of extra dies.</p>

                  <p>The design of both the obverse and the reverse of the Trade Dollar was changed slightly in 1875. Many minor revisions were made in the
                     obverse, but the key to identification of the two dies is in the ribbon end below the word LIBERTY. For the old obverse used on Trade
                     dollars of 1874 and before, both tails of the split ribbon end point sharply to the left. For the new obverse introduced in 1875, the right
                     tail of the split end points down toward the date. All pieces dated 1877 and later appear to be of the new obverse. Pieces dated 1875 and
                     1876 seem to be a mixture of the two obverse dies. While studies have been made, it is too early to determine just what varieties might
                     exist and just how rare they might be for the different dates.</p>

                  <p>More well known to the collector is the revision in the reverse die that first appeared in 1875. For all Trade dollars of 1874 and before,
                     there is a closed bud below the olive branch within the right claw. For the reverse die introduced in 1875, the bud has been removed from
                     within the claw. All pieces dated 1877 and after appear <pb n="152"/> to have the new reverse. For pieces dated 1875 and 1876, there seems
                     to be a mixture of the two reverses. Both reverse dies are known for the dates 1875, 1875-S, 1875-CC, 1876, 1876-S and 1876-CC.</p>
                  <figure xml:id="fig-178">

                  <p>With both obverse and reverse dies being revised during the same time period the possibilities for transitional varieties seem very real. A
                     study reveals the existence of many transitional pieces with the most common being the old obverse being paired with the new reverse die.
                     Such transitional varieties are known for the dates 1875-S, 1876, 1876-S and 1876-CC. New discoveries are bound to be made in this series
                     as more collectors examine their pieces once they have become familiar with the keys to identifying the dies in the series.</p>
                  <p>Recent research has revealed that the dies of the Liberty Seated silver coins were modified a number of times during the striking of the
                     series from 1837 to 1891. The significance of these revisions is only now being appreciated, as new varieties are being identified and
                     studied by numismatic scholars. Studies of the beautiful silver coins of the nineteenth century will continue to uncover facts surrounding
                     the manufacture of our early silver coinage and add to a better understanding of the minting process.</p>

                  subject of the 1804 dollar had been greatly stimulated by articles by <persName>Alfred J. Ostheimer</persName>, 3rd, published in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> for June 1961 and elsewhere entitled —Contemporary 1804, 1805 Silver Dollars Authenticated.—<ref target="#CH8-n3">3</ref> I had been asked to give a talk before the Educational Forum of the American Numismatic Association—s 1961 annual
                  convention in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4180439">Atlanta</placeName> for which I was seeking a suitable topic. I felt it would be
                  worthwhile to study these 1804 and 1805 dollars in depth in the hope of finding a basis for the talk. In checking the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi> for prior references, I failed to locate at that time an article by <persName>David F. Spink</persName> written in 1939
                  entitled —More Information on the 1804 and 1805 <placeName>U.S</placeName>. Dollars.—<ref target="#CH8-n4">4</ref> It contained a detailed
                  opinion of <persName>Burdette G. Johnson</persName> that the coins were alterations. If I would have known in 1961 of that 1939 opinion
                  by my friend and mentor, I would have dropped the topic as already solved. In 1939 <persName>Johnson—s</persName> office in <placeName>St. Louis</placeName> was one block away from mine, but in 1961 <persName>Johnson</persName> was no longer alive.</p>
               <p>When the 1939 Spink article was indexed in 1959 the title was listed as —More Information on the 1904 and 1905 <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Dollars— and accordingly placed under the heading —Morgan Dollars— instead of under the heading
                  —Early Dollars, Including the 1804 Dollar.— This might be called the mistake of the century! Although <persName>Ostheimer</persName> had
                  written in his articles that <persName>Johnson</persName> had seen the pieces and had concluded the coins could not be genuine, I was
                  totally unaware that <persName>Johnson</persName> had given a written opinion when I gave the talk. The indexing error was a stroke of
                  good fortune for me because it stimulated me to recognize the extreme importance of doing extensive additional research on what was then the
                  most controversial subject in American numismatics—the 1804 dollar.</p>

                  1805 dollar. This is due to the recent availability of the correspondence file of the late <persName>Louis S. Werner</persName>, a
                  professional numismatist of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. These dollars are very high in
                  contention for being the most deceptive alterations of genuine coins. The confusion and disappointment of parties who owned them can be better
                  understood by a review of the new data.</p>
               <p>Dollars dated 1804 had been the basis of discussion since 1842 when they were first publicly disclosed in the <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> and <persName>Du Bois</persName> manual.<ref target="#CH8-n5">5</ref> At the same time there was no discussion as to
                  an 1805 dollar, even though that manual contained the inaccurate notations, —Dollar, 1797-1805— and —No dollars were coined from 1806 to
                  1835.— The 1805 dollar was referred to by <persName>Edward Cogan</persName> in 1871 as a non-existent date.<ref target="#CH8-n6">6</ref>

               </p>
               <p>The first appearance of an 1805 dollar was in 1939 when it and an 1804 dollar were mailed together from the —<placeName corresp="#geonames_3571219">West Indies</placeName>— to the British Museum in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> for
                  verification, appraisal and sale. Their actual source has not yet been identified. They were casually shown to an American numismatist, <persName>Samuel Friedenberg</persName> of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, who was then
                  visiting <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> as a tourist. <persName>Friedenberg</persName> at first concluded
                  that the pieces were genuine, but then felt uneasy and wished that he could reexamine them promptly. He did not arrange to return to the
                  British Museum before going home, but reported his experience in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi>.<ref target="#CH8-n8">8</ref> The
                  Museum turned the coins over to Spink &amp; Son, Ltd., the well-known London coin firm. Spinks selected <persName>Burdette G.
                     Johnson</persName> of <placeName>St.Louis</placeName> as the best person to give them an opinion and dispatched the coins to him. <persName>Johnson—s</persName> conclusion was that they were altered and that the field around the date had been lowered in order to rework
                  the date. These observations (without <persName>Johnson—s</persName> name) were submitted to <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> by
                  Spinks and published as stated above.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Spinks instructed <persName>Johnson</persName> to send the coins to <persName>Miss M.A. Dunn</persName>, <placeName>44
                     Monroe Street</placeName>, <placeName>Brooklyn</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. She
                  might have been associated with the party attempting to sell them, but said that she knew nothing about the coins and that they belonged to
                  someone in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. <persName>Dunn</persName> took the unopened package she
                  received from <persName>Johnson</persName> to <persName>Vernon L. Brown</persName>, assistant curator at the Chase National Bank
                  Money Museum. <persName>Farran Zerbe</persName>, the curator whose collection <pb n="156"/> had been sold to the museum, opened the
                  package on November 30, 1939, and told her the coins were alterations. <persName>Dunn</persName> then sold them to <persName>Zerbe</persName> personally, that action showing that she had instructions from the owner to do so. On March 15, 1941, <persName>Zerbe</persName> sold the coins as alterations to <persName>Werner</persName> for what <persName>Werner</persName> describes as —an
                  undisclosed sum.— In 1941 and in 1944 <persName>Zerbe</persName> exhibited the coins as alterations and spoke about them at the <placeName>New York City</placeName> Numismatic Club, although they belonged to <persName>Werner</persName> in 1944. <persName>Fred C.C. Boyd</persName>, a member of the club, offered <persName>Werner</persName> the opportunity to trade the alterations for some
                  genuine paper money, but <persName>Werner</persName> refused because he felt that the coins were genuine.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Werner</persName> sent rubbings of the 1805 dollar to <persName>M.H. Bolender</persName>, a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> dollar specialist and professional numismatist of <placeName>Freeport</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4896861">Illinois</placeName>, and <persName>Bolender</persName> in a September 1, 1950 reply to <persName>Werner</persName> indicated that the 1805 could well be an alteration from an 1803 <persName>Bolender</persName> variety 1,
                  but wished to see the coin. <persName>Bolender</persName> had just written his book on die varieties of dollars of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, but did not include any detail on 1804 or 1805 dollar matters. <persName>Werner</persName> did not send the
                  1805 dollar to <persName>Bolender</persName> at that time because of the risk of loss and placed an all-risk insurance policy on it for
                  $10,000.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Werner</persName> was convinced that the 1805 dollar was —the numismatic find of the century— and exhibited it at the 1951
                  annual convention of the American Numismatic Association in Phoenix, causing much excitement. The 1805 dollar was unique in that no other
                     <placeName>U.S</placeName>. dollar of that date, whether genuine or false, had ever appeared. <persName>Werner</persName> claimed
                  his 1805 dollar —passed all the —tests of genuineness— including the heat test.—<ref target="#CH8-n10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In 1952 <persName>Werner</persName> brought the 1805 dollar to <persName>Bolender—s</persName> home in <placeName>Freeport</placeName> and <persName>Bolender</persName> to his own surprise said that the coin appeared to be genuine and not altered.
                     <persName>Werner</persName> apparently did not bring the 1804 dollar along to show <persName>Bolender</persName> at that

               <p>
                  <persName>B. Max Mehl</persName>, a professional numismatist of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4691930">Fort Worth</placeName>, <placeName>Texas</placeName>, on December 16, 1955, answered a collector inquiring about the 1805 dollar, saying that he had heard of the coin
                  and recalled <persName>Johnson—s</persName> opinion that it was an alteration. <persName>Werner</persName> initiated minor publicity
                  thereafter for the 1805 dollar, but a sarcastic remark appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Coin Collector</hi> (<placeName>Anamosa</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4862182">Iowa</placeName>) for January 20, 1960, as follows: —While all the official
                  records state no dollars were minted in 1805, the great authority on numismatics, <persName>Mr. L. S. Werner</persName> of <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> claims at least one was minted, as he owns it!—</p>
               <p>By 1960 <persName>Werner</persName> began to consider a sale of the two coins and determined to hire two metallurgical chemists to give
                  him their opinions as to the authenticity of the coins. He first delivered the coins <pb n="157"/> to Academy Testing Laboratories, <placeName>350 West 31st Street</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, to be examined. On
                  March 10, 1960, a report signed by <persName>Stephen A. Montanaro</persName>, managing director of that firm, stated that both coins had
                  been examined under 25 to 1150x magnification, that both were die struck, and that no evidence of alteration of the dates by addition, removal
                  or tooling was found.</p>
               <p>In June 1960, Lucius Pittein, Inc., with laboratories at <placeName>47 Fulton Street</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, was asked by <persName>Werner</persName> to test and photograph the coins.
                  The coins were examined under a Bausch &amp; Lomb metallographic microscope with 30 to 500x magnification. The report dated June 24, 1960,
                  signed by <persName>F.H. Wright</persName>, stated that both coins were genuine and die struck with no indication of distortion or
                  replacement of the dates. A hardness test was also made on the coins. <persName>Werner</persName> asked for permission to publish the
                  content of the reports of the metallurgical chemists, and received approval from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Werner</persName> first offered to sell the 1805 dollar to <persName>Louis Eliasberg</persName>, a numismatist of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName>, on August 3, 1960, with the right of <persName>Eliasberg</persName> to have
                  the coin tested at <persName>Werner—s</persName> expense. <persName>Eliasberg</persName> turned down the proposal with the abrupt
                  comment that there was —no record of its existence other than your communication.—</p>
               <p>Then <persName>Werner</persName> contacted <persName>Bolender</persName> again, sending him both coins and asking for his opinion.
                     <persName>Bolender</persName> wrote an opinion dated December 8, 1960, as to the 1804 dollar and a separate opinion dated December 10,
                  1960, as to the 1805 dollar, stating that each piece was authentic, struck at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName>
                  Mint and not altered.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Werner</persName> then increased his insurance coverage, the 1804 being valued at $10,000 and the 1805 being revalued at
                  $15,000. He wrote <persName>Alfred J. Ostheimer</persName>, 3rd, of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> that —I was as I feel today that both coins were the genuine strikings when I bought them.— Then in a letter dated
                  December 12, 1960, addressed —To whom it may concern,— <persName>Werner</persName> outlined both the prior opinions that the coins were
                  alterations and the then current opinions of <persName>Bolender</persName> and the metallurgists that the coins were genuine. <persName>Ostheimer</persName> was sent a copy of that December 12, 1960 letter.</p>
               <p>By December 21, 1960, a contract entitled —Option and Custody Agreement— was prepared by <placeName corresp="#geonames_5368361">Los
                     Angeles</placeName> attorneys (for a fee of $25 which <persName>Werner</persName> paid) in which <persName>Ostheimer</persName> had
                  the option until July 1, 1961, to buy the 1804 and 1805 dollars for $30,000, with $8,500 payable as a deposit, an additional $8,500
                  installment payable on both January 15, 1962 and January 15, 1963, and the $4,500 balance payable January 15, 1964. If the option was not
                  exercised the deposit was to be refunded. <persName>Ostheimer</persName> was to have custody of the coins <pb n="158"/> until the option
                  date and ownership thereafter if the option was exercised. There was no guarantee of authenticity—only a guarantee of title or ownership.</p>
               <p>The option was exercised on or about June 20, 1961, and <persName>Werner</persName> wrote on that date to the Ostheimers saying: —I am
                  just as pleased in selling you the 1804-1805 as you were in purchasing them. I am sure the coins will bring to you, besides the monetary
                  rewards, a reward of satisfaction of the ownership and the happiness that your collection contains the only known genuine coins.—</p>
               <p>By this time <persName>Ostheimer</persName> had written and published in the various numismatic media previously referred to his detailed
                  articles asserting the authenticity of the coins. On reading the articles, I determined either to become convinced of or to condemn the
                  findings but not to stay in limbo. After extensive study of the photographs which <persName>Ostheimer</persName> had kindly sent to me, I
                  concluded that the coins were alterations and asked him for permission to examine them. When I went to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> for that purpose he showed the coins to me and asked for my opinion. I
                  told him the pieces were definitely alterations and that <persName>Bolender</persName> had written to me on July 12, 1961, changing his
                  prior written opinions and now agreed with me. In the course of that conversation I mentioned the superb alterations of early <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> cents made by the alleged —Smith of Ann Street.— <persName>Werner</persName> was
                  promptly told what I had said and wrote letters to <persName>Abe Kosoff</persName>, <persName>George Fuld</persName> and <persName>Art Kagin</persName> urgently requesting information about <persName>Smith</persName> of <placeName>Ann Street</placeName>
                  and his work, never mentioning the 1804 or 1805 dollars. <persName>Werner</persName> offered to pay any expenses incurred in providing
                  information. The replies are truly classic-<persName>Kosoff</persName> suggested asking <persName>John J. Pittman</persName>; <persName>Fuld</persName> suggested asking <persName>Walter Breen</persName>; and <persName>Paul Kagin</persName> suggested asking
                     <persName>Eric P. Newman</persName>.</p>
               <p>I was informed that <persName>Ostheimer</persName> had brought his lawyer and a metallurgist to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4180439">Atlanta</placeName> to hear my talk. <persName>Ostheimer</persName> and <persName>Werner</persName> must
                  have disclosed to some extent what my opinion was going to be. The talk was the last of four presentations and when my turn came the seats
                  were all occupied and people were standing and sitting in the aisles, some dealers having temporarily closed their bourse tables to be
                  present. The talk also included an unequivocal opinion that the normally recognized 1804 dollars and their dies were not made in 1804.<ref target="#CH8-n11">11</ref> After the talk I was asked by <persName>Ostheimer</persName> to attend a breakfast the next morning to
                  discuss the question with other numismatists. At that breakfast there was a lively commentary by others while I just listened. I was told at
                  the conclusion that suit would be filed against me. Since the news media thrives on controversy there was a quick publication of the written
                  version of my <pb n="159"/> talk by those who published <persName>Ostheimer—s</persName> article.<ref target="#CH8-n12">12</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Nine years after his purchase, <persName>Ostheimer</persName> wrote <persName>Werner</persName> a letter dated August 7, 1970, that
                     <persName>Werner</persName> should refund the money and take back the coins, noting that <persName>Werner</persName> —led us to
                  believe that these were bonafide pieces.— Thus it appears that the installment payments due after the date of the talk had been completed. The
                  return and refund never took place and those coins remained in the <persName>Ostheimer</persName> collection until most of the primary
                  collection (but not the altered dollars) was sold at the August 9, 1975 auction of Superior Stamp and Coin Co., Inc. Some of the <persName>Ostheimer</persName> collection coins (including the altered dollars) were sold to an undisclosed client of Superior about that
                  time where they remain.<ref target="#CH8-n13">13</ref>
                  <persName>Werner</persName> had never guaranteed authenticity and had shared with <persName>Ostheimer</persName> the facts which
                     <persName>Werner</persName> knew.</p>
               <p>The purpose of this detailed discussion is to emphasize the importance of guarantees of authenticity; the danger of relying on testing results
                  by numismatically-inexperienced people; the risk of reliance on the opinions of people who have a conflict of interest; the frequency of
                  opinions being changed; and the reappearance of non-genuine coins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Other Fake Matters</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1973 the <persName>Federal Bureau</persName> of Investigation recovered on —1804 half dollar— from an alleged burglar in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4164138">Miami</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</placeName>. The coin was an
                  alteration of an 1805 over 1804 half dollar into an 1804 half dollar made by cutting away the parts of the 5 which were not over the 4. It
                  seems unfair for an unsuspecting burglar to have been saddled with this deceptively altered coin just because the real owner might be too
                  ashamed to claim its ownership and to explain why and how it was originally acquired by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Coin World</hi> of September 3, 1969, reported the recovery of a stolen du Pont 1804 dollar by the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</placeName> Bureau of Law Enforcement. A sting had been arranged to purchase the coin for $ 10,000. The
                  operation was successful but the coin turned out to be a routine alteration instead of a du Pont piece.</p>
               <p>Electrotypes of the 1804 dollar were described on page 107 of <hi rend="italic">The Fantastic 1804 Dollar</hi>. Most of these pieces seem to
                  have been made from the Class II example and the Idler Class III example by mint employees. The modern auction record of such electrotypes is
                  described in the McIntire Numismatic Auctions, Inc. catalogue for the 1985 National Silver Dollar Sale, Nov. 14-16, 1985, where one <pb n="160"/> was sold as lot 806. The number of electrotypes is there estimated as between 5 and 10. It would seem exceedingly difficult to
                  determine which Class II or Class III coin served as the electrotype master as edges are customarily not a part of the reproduction. Unless
                  there is other evidence, it is difficult to assign an electrotype as being made from a specific piece. <persName>Edward Cogan</persName>
                  in describing an electrotype as lot 509 in his September 16, 1878 sale, thought it was produced from a die made in 1858, but in his December
                  16, 1878 sale, corrected his comment to indicate it was made from an 1804 dollar struck in 1858.</p>
               <p>A major distinction held by an 1804 dollar electrotype made from a Class II or Class III piece is that it is a fake of a fake of a fake, or to
                  be more explicit, an electrotype copy of a restrike of a fantasy.</p>

                  <p>1. 1802 over 1801 Dollar (Bolender 9) altered into 1804 Dollar.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>In 1961 <persName>Louis Goldsmith</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, purchased a <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> dollar with an 1804 date
                  from the collection of <persName>W.C. Wilson</persName> through his daughter-in-law, <persName>Mrs. M.M. Wilson</persName>. <persName>Goldsmith</persName> promptly commissioned Warnoch Hersey Company, Ltd., a Montreal laboratory, to test it for authenticity. X-ray
                  examination revealed no voids. Ultrasonic multiple-echo techniques indicated solid metal without voids, cracks or laminations. The thickness
                  between the field surfaces on each side of the coin ranged from .076 to .080 inches or a maximum deviation of .004 inches. The field thickness
                  around the 4 in the date was only slightly above average and an opinion was given that if the date had been altered the field would have been
                     <pb n="161"/> lower than average. An X-ray fluorescence analysis showed the metal on the 4 was identical to the metal on the reverse.
                  Canadian General Electric Co. conducted X-ray diffraction and fluorodescent analysis tests. These tests were made available when the coin was
                  finally scheduled for auction on January 24, 1971 in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6077243">Montreal</placeName>. The coin, however, had
                  radial dentils and an unbroken curl tip, different from all other —recognized— 1804 dollars. There was little delay in calling attention to
                  the fact that the coin was an alteration and it was withdrawn. The coin was an alteration of an 1802 over 1801 Bolender 9 variety. It was
                  almost as fine an alteration as the Zerbe-Werner-Ostheimer pieces causing the customary confusion and differences of opinion. There is nothing
                  like a superb alteration to start a superb altercation.</p>
               <p>The process by which alterations are made is called chasing or tooling. The metal constituting raised portions of the coin is moved along the
                  surface of the field by tapping the metal sidewise and thus creating a new shape. Sometimes the field surface is lowered somewhat to make more
                  material available. When needed some minor amounts of metal can be removed. This delicate work is done with engraving and polishing tools and
                  the coin can be heated to make the metal more easily reshaped. No solder is necessary. No additional metal needs to be added from another coin
                  or other source. No voids are created if the work is skillfully done. The coin is uniformly cleaned and polished to remove discoloration and
                  unevenness, followed by a new patina if desired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Challenges</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1980 <persName>Robert P. Hilt</persName> published some startling assertions about the 1804 dollar and the proof dollars dated 1801,
                  1802 and 1803.<ref target="#CH8-n14">14</ref> He took the position that in 1802 two obverse dies for the dollar had been completed with only
                  the last numeral of the date lacking; that these dies were put in storage as they were not needed; that in 1834 their diameters were machined
                  down on a lathe to the proper dimension; that a 4 was punched into one to produce the 1804 obverse die; that a 2 was punched into the other to
                  produce the obverse die for the 1802 proof dollar; that an incomplete obverse die without legend, stars or date was also left over from 1802
                  and was in 1834 converted into the obverse die for the 1801 proof dollar; and that an 1803 obverse die left over from 1803 was first used in
                  1834 without modification and became the obverse die for the 1803 proof dollar. No substantiation was given to support these assertions and no
                  comment made as to the reverse dies used <pb n="162"/> for any 1804 dollars or for the proof dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803.</p>
               <p>These theories fail because the dentilation on the perimeter of both the obverse and reverse dollar dies made during or prior to 1803 are
                  quite different from the dentilation and border band used in 1834 and appearing on the 1804 dollars and the proof dollars dated 1801, 1802 and
                  1803. To machine off dentilation and replace it with another dentilation pattern and a border band would leave the diameter of the dies too
                  small for striking the known coins. In addition if the bust on the obverse die of the dollar dated 1801 was cut in 1802, then an unbroken curl
                  could not appear on top of the hair of a coin struck from a die made in 1803 with a defective bust punch on which the curl was already broken
                  off.</p>
               <p>In 1969 <persName>James C. Risk</persName> asserted that <persName>President Andrew Jackson</persName> had the power to issue a
                  directive ordering antedated coinage to be minted despite a law to the contrary. We had argued that <persName>Jackson</persName> had no
                  such power. <persName>Risk</persName> said, —To accuse the president of the <placeName>United States</placeName> of breaking the law
                  is no light thing.—<ref target="#CH8-n15">15</ref>
                  <persName>Robert W. Julian</persName> initially and then <persName>Don Taxay</persName> and I wrote replies to Risk—s comments in
                     1970.<ref target="#CH8-n16">16</ref>
                  <persName>Risk</persName> continued the challenge<ref target="#CH8-n17">17</ref> and was answered again by <persName>Julian</persName> in addition to my second response.<ref target="#CH8-n18">18</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Jackson</persName> did not order any dollar or eagle denomination to be struck with a prior date, but only directed that —a
                  complete set— was to be prepared as a gift. The dollar and the eagle were not then in circulation and had not been minted in over 30 years
                  prior to that time. The inclusion of the antedated dollar and antedated eagle in the sets was not part of the President—s directive, but was a
                  decision made by <placeName>U.S</placeName>. Mint officials. It might have been justifiable for the mint to have created dies for a dollar
                  dated 1834 and an eagle dated 1834 with which to strike coins of the then official weight and fineness, but that was not done. It would also
                  have been justifiable to locate for the sets choice examples of a one dollar and an eagle of the normal coinage of any earlier year as the
                  dates on the coins included in the actual presentation sets were not uniform, consisting of both 1804 and 1834.</p>
               <p>Some comments in <hi rend="italic">The Fantastic 1804 Dollar</hi> were challenged by <persName>Stack—s</persName> in 1982.<ref target="#CH8-n19">19</ref> Our book had stated as to the proof dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803 that the evidence pointed to a striking in
                  1858, but that the dies were prepared in the 1834-35 period.<ref target="#CH8-n20">20</ref> The primary reasons given were that the coins have
                  characteristics of the 1858 restrikes of the Class II and Class III 1804 dollars; that the existence of 1801, 1802 and 1803 proof dollars was
                  not revealed until 1876; and that a small area in the 1803 obverse die had <pb n="163"/> rusted before being used for striking. <persName>Stack—s</persName> disagreed and asserted that the 1801, 1802 and 1803 proof dollars were struck in the 1834-35 period. <persName>Stack—s</persName> stated that the 1803 obverse die could have rusted within a few weeks —in a hot and damp <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> climate,— which ignores the fact that the 1801 and 1802 obverse dies for
                  the proof dollars did not rust under identical conditions. <persName>Stack—s</persName> went on to say that the 1801 and 1802 obverse
                  dies for proof dollars would have rusted if they had not been used until 1858, which ignores the fact that when the 1804 dollar was restruck
                  in 1858 the obverse die did not show any rust blemishes. In our opinion, <persName>Stack—s</persName> arguments are too speculative to be
                  the basis for assigning a new date of coinage when other data are more reliable.</p>

                  <persName>Stack—s</persName> also challenged the assertion in the book that the activities of the mint officials were illegal and
                  clandestine, using the argument that current [1982] moral thinking should not be applied to nineteenth century mint practices. If the mint
                  officials did not think they were doing wrong, why did <persName>Eckfeldt</persName> and <persName>Du Bois</persName> deceptively
                  select for publication an illustration of an 1804 dollar in 1842 knowing that it and its dies had been prepared in the 1834-35 period and
                  describe that picture as a type coin with the words —Dollar, 1797-1805—?<ref target="#CH8-n21">21</ref> Why did mint officials cover up their
                  own activity and that of their predecessors by false statements and false affidavits if they did not believe a wrong had been done? In fact
                  they compounded the illegality by conniving to conceal and falsify what had been done. Even <persName>Haseltine</persName> was afraid his
                  1801, 1802 and 1803 dollar proofs and his Class III 1804 dollar would be confiscated by the government for —illegal origin— as some of his
                  restruck patterns were.<ref target="#CH8-n22">22</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Finally <persName>Stack—s</persName> challenged the number of existing proof dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803. Our estimate in 1962 was
                  that there were about a dozen of each. <persName>Stack—s</persName> on the basis of subsequent auction records, estimated in 1982 that
                  there existed an aggregate of 10 or 12 for all three dates combined. Even though this is a blanket estimate covering three separate dates, we
                  have no hesitancy in accepting this view pending an exhaustive survey.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As reported in the book, a Class I 1804 dollar was included in the set of coins presented in October 1835 by the <placeName>United
                     States</placeName> to <persName>Sayyid Sa—id bin Sultan</persName>, the Imam of <placeName>Muscat</placeName>. Our country—s
                  relationship with <placeName>Muscat</placeName>, now the Sultanate of <placeName corresp="#geonames_286963">Oman</placeName>, has
                  continued to be most friendly. When I had the opportunity to visit <placeName corresp="#geonames_286963">Oman</placeName> as a tourist <pb n="164"/> in 1983 I endeavored to find out if there were any remaining records of the <placeName>United States</placeName> coin gift,
                  since the coins themselves had long since found their way to a pawn broker. Since reciprocation of courtesies is also a well-established <placeName>Arab</placeName> custom, I was presented with a modern proof set of Omani coins. The coins I received bore the date of their
                  mintage, the Islamic year 1390. Unfortunately I was much too early for the Islamic year 1804 as that will not occur until A.D. 2371.</p>
               <p>Only one of the presentation cases for the coin sets containing the 1804 dollar remains in existence of the four which were originally made.

               <p>To the die detail presented for the proof dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803, an additional observation can be made as to the obverse stars and
                  the word LIBERTY.<ref target="#CH8-n25">25</ref> The 1801 obverse die has heavy stars with 60 degree points as on the Star of <persName>David</persName>, whereas on the 1802 and 1803 proof dollars as well as on the 1804 dollar, the obverse stars have narrower, more
                  delicate points. On page 50, we distinguished the letters in LIBERTY on the 1801 proof dollar as having serifs with right angle corners
                  instead of sweeping curves; it should be added that the letters in LIBERTY are smaller and their elements narrower on the 1801 proof dollar
                  than on the 1802 and 1803 proof dollars or on the 1804 dollar.<ref target="#CH8-n26">26</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Further comment on the striking of Class II (Plain edge) 1804 dollars has come to light in a May 21, 1908 letter written by <persName>Charles Steigerwalt</persName>, a professional dealer of <placeName>Lancaster</placeName>, <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, to <persName>H.O. Granberg</persName>, a numismatist of <placeName>Oshkosh</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5279468">Wisconsin</placeName>. <persName>Granberg</persName> was seeking information during his pending negotiations with <persName>John
                     W. Haseltine</persName> for the purchase of the Idler example of the Class III (second reverse and lettered edge) 1804 dollar. <persName>Steigerwalt</persName> wrote that about 1883, <persName>William Jenks</persName>, a numismatist of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, learned from Haseltine that after <persName>George J.
                     Eckfeldt</persName>, foreman of the <placeName>U.S</placeName>. Mint engraving department, had made restrikes of the 1804 dollar in 1858,
                     <persName>Eckfeldt—s</persName> son <persName>Cater</persName> —stole them from his father and tried to dispose of them. Such a
                  fuss was made at the time that several <pb n="165"/> were returned - one had gone to <persName>Major Nichols</persName> of <placeName>Springfield</placeName>, <placeName>Mass.</placeName> through Randall - one, however, was taken abroad and the purchaser would
                  not return it even when requested by <placeName>U.S</placeName>. officials - <persName>Haseltine</persName> says it is now in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2644210">Liverpool</placeName>. This piece has a <hi rend="italic">plain edge</hi> and the one in the Mint
                  cabinet with plain edge is supposed to have been from this striking.—</p>
               <p>This third-hand hearsay is not inconsistent with the data we presented in 1962.<ref target="#CH8-n27">27</ref> Whether <persName>Cater</persName> is a nickname of <persName>Theodore Eckfeldt</persName> (1837-93) or the name of another son has not yet been
                  ascertained. The comments do indicate the possible existence of an unknown Class II (plain edge) 1804 dollar. The alleged theft is far beyond
                  the act described in the book as that of a —wayward son.— The restriking by the father had put the matter in motion.</p>
               <p>The letter also stated that —<persName>Mr. Haseltine</persName> thinks the edge lettering on the old planchets were lettered first or it
                  was done by some wheel process.— This second alternative probably means lettering after striking.</p>
               <p>Though <persName>Haseltine—s</persName> and <persName>Steigerwalt—s</persName> comments are sometimes unreliable even when they
                  attempted to be candid, this reinforces the conclusion that Class II 1804 dollars had their plain edges lettered at a later date than 1858
                  whether unreleased or returned in the 1858 period.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>William Elliot Woodward</persName>, a prominent Boston professional numismatist, was not willing to accept the actions of the
                  son of <persName>George J. Eckfeldt</persName> as relieving the father and other <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint officials of blame for the sale of restrikes. In 1880, <persName>Woodward</persName> derisively commented on the
                  restrikes as follows: —I believe that the purchasor (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) of an 1804 dollar, or any one of many of the rarest of
                  American coins, has no guarantee that the son of some future director or chief coiner of the Mint will not, at an unexpected moment place a
                  quantity on the market....As Government is fond of illustrating its reports, as a frontispiece, is suggested a view of a son of a late
                  official of the Mint, as he appeared at the store of the writer, when on a peddling expedition from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>....—<ref target="#CH8-n28">28</ref> No names were mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Woodward</persName> then wondered if there would be an investigation of the —stupid humbug and stupendous swindle— that the
                  mint officials had engaged in. Obviously no official inquiry took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="bold">Conclusion</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seems reasonable to conclude that the <placeName>U.S</placeName>. Mint officials in 1834 believed from the mint records that dollars
                  dated 1804 had been <pb n="166"/> struck in 1804, but that for some reason none had been retained by the Mint. When in the 1834-35 period
                  those in charge decided to include a dollar coin in the diplomatic gift sets they felt that they should include the most recent date on
                  dollars which they thought was 1804.<ref target="#CH8-n29">29</ref> They had available many of the device punches, letter punches, numeral
                  punches, star punches, collar dies, edge dies and planchet cutting tools of the early nineteenth century. The temptation to make up new 1804
                  dollar dies was too great. There was an opportunity to fill in the presentation sets and to add to the mint collection. After the dies were
                  prepared a few extra dollars could be struck for reserve or otherwise. Thus the devilment began, and once commenced, subsequent restriking was
                  a later consequence. They had no thought that anyone would find reason to or be able to expose or criticize their impropriety and
                  illegality.</p>
               <p>This thinking and action was also followed in the illegal coinage in the 1834-35 period of the <placeName>U.S</placeName>. gold eagle dated
                  1804, but in that situation the most recent date on genuine eagles was actually 1804 and genuine 1804 eagles did exist.</p>
               <p>It is of interest to compare these conclusions with the following comment by <persName>George G. Evans</persName> in his <hi rend="italic">History of the United States Mint</hi>, which was sold extensively from 1885 through 1898: —The confidence reposed in the
                  officials of the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint has never been violated, as, for nearly a century of its operations, no shadow
                  of suspicion has marred the fair name of any identified with its history.—<ref target="#CH8-n30">30</ref>

               <p>The amount of writing on the subject of the 1804 dollar has been enormous. <hi rend="italic">The Fantastic 1804 Dollar</hi> contained 191
                  footnote references, some of which were multiple. There were very many additional references in the text. In subsequently published material
                  and updates there were many more and each auction catalogue containing an 1804 dollar has included extensive descriptive data. These resources
                  now number about 400 items and are almost a specialized numismatic library in itself. The authors appreciate all the research, thinking,

                     <persName>Garrett</persName> family, was sold by Bowers and Ruddy Galleries (The Garrett Collection Sale II), Mar. 26-27, 1980, 698,
                  to Larry Hanks of Pullen and Hanks for $400,000.<ref target="#CH8-n39">39</ref> On April 17, 1980, it was again sold, this time to <persName>Sam Colavita</persName> of <placeName>Trenton</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>,
                  for a sum reported to be close to $500,000. <persName>Colavita</persName> subsequently offered it for sale through <placeName>Texas</placeName> dealer <persName>Ed Hipps</persName>, but later placed it in a Pullen and Hanks Sale, Feb. 6, 1982, 1076, where an agent
                  for <persName>Colavita</persName> bought it back for $190,000.<ref target="#CH8-n40">40</ref> Immediately thereafter, the piece was sold
                  privately to an unnamed western collector who held it until it was sold at the Bowers and Merena Sale, June 24-25, 1986, 1736, for $187,000
                  including buyer—s fee, to <persName>Martin Paul</persName>, a principal of The Rarities Group, Inc. It was soon advertised for sale at
                  $240,000. In November 1986, the piece was purchased for an unreported amount by American Coin Portfolios, Inc. for a person identified only as

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Adams Specimen</hi> It has now been determined that this piece was originally offered for sale by <persName>John W.
                     Haseltine</persName> in his auction of Mar. 30, 1876, 194, where it was guaranteed genuine and original. <persName>Haseltine</persName>
                  himself purchased the coin for $395 and later that same year sold it to <persName>Phineas Adams</persName> for $550. In more recent
                  times, <persName>Amon Carter, Jr.</persName>, inherited this piece from his father and the 1804 dollar remained in the <persName>Carter</persName> family after <persName>Amon Jr.—s</persName> death in 1982 until it was sold at the Stack—s Sale Jan. 18-21, 1984, 241,
                  for <pb n="170"/> $198,000.<ref target="#CH8-n42">42</ref> It was purchased by dealer <persName>John N. Rowe</persName> acting as agent
                  for an unidentified west Texas collector who also owns examples of the proof —restrike— dollars dated 1801, 1802 and 1803.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Davis Specimen</hi> The 1804 dollar purchased by <persName>Samuel Wolfson</persName> was from the so-called —Fairbanks
                  Collection— (a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> collector named <persName>Ben H.
                     Koenig</persName> who had investments in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5879092">Alaska</placeName>). <persName>Wolfson</persName> sold
                  his dollar in 1963 to <persName>Norton Simon</persName> who held it until 1971. It was then sold through Stack—s in 1971 to <persName>James H.T. McConnell, Jr.</persName>, who earlier had been the underbidder at the sale of the Mickley Class I specimen from the
                  Massachusetts Historical Society. <persName>Mrs. Fullerton</persName>, who was included in the original pedigree listing as an owner in
                  1950, was the daughter of <persName>H.P. Graves</persName> and had acted as his agent in purchasing the coin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Linderman Specimen</hi> The Linderman 1804 dollar owned by <persName>Willis H. du Pont</persName> along with his Cohen
                  Class I 1804 dollar were stolen together when a major portion of the du Pont numismatic collection was taken at gunpoint by five masked men
                  during the October 5, 1967 robbery at the Cocoanut Grove, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</placeName>, residence of <persName>Willis H. du Pont</persName> and his wife <persName>Merin</persName>. The aggregate loss was reported to be $1,500,000,
                  principally in rare coins including the two 1804 dollars and the Mikhailovitch collection of Russian numismatic pieces. During the period up
                  to 1974, approximately 34 of the coins were recovered through aggressive action by investigators and payment of ransom and rewards. One of the
                  recovered pieces was a Brasher doubloon.<ref target="#CH8-n43">43</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In July 1980, a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5506956">Las Vegas</placeName> card player learned that an 1804 dollar was available there
                  and promptly informed a Salt Lake City friend about the matter. The friend was an investor and asked <persName>Thomas K.
                     DeLorey</persName>, the senior certifier at the American Numismatic Association Authentication Service (ANACS) in Colorado Springs to go to
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_5506956">Las Vegas</placeName> where <persName>DeLorey</persName> was to attend a meeting between the
                  person who possessed the coin and the card player. <persName>DeLorey</persName> was asked to give a prompt oral opinion about the coin to
                  the gambler after an examination. <persName>DeLorey</persName> and the Las Vegas gambler kept the appointment but the possessor of the
                  coin failed to appear with it. The gambler hinted that the coin might be a du Pont piece. <persName>DeLorey</persName> was reimbursed for
                  the expenses of his trip and returned to Colorado Springs.</p>
               <p>In May 1981, <persName>Mark Koenigsberg</persName> of the El Paso numismatic firm of Pullen &amp; Hanks received a telephone call from a
                  woman who said she had an 1804 dollar and, although believing at first that it <pb n="171"/> was just another fake, he was open-minded enough
                  to suggest it be brought in to the store. The firm had received many such calls after purchasing the Berg 1804 dollar earlier that year. In
                  June 1981, the woman with a man she identified as her son came to the store with the dollar. <persName>Hanks</persName> also looked at it
                  and originally felt the coin was a fake, but finally agreed with <persName>Koenigsberg</persName> that it was —genuine— although neither
                  recognized it as the Linderman 1804 dollar. <persName>Hanks</persName> advised the man (who apparently was <persName>Paul
                     Quinn</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5506956">Las Vegas</placeName>) to have the coin authenticated. <persName>Hanks</persName> called ANACS and advised <persName>Edward Fleischman</persName> about the incident. <persName>Koenigsberg</persName> went to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5506956">Las Vegas</placeName> later that month and advised <persName>Quinn</persName> to have the coin authenticated at ANACS.</p>
               <p>On July 20, 1981, <persName>Quinn</persName> brought the <persName>Linderman</persName> dollar to ANACS for authentication and
                  grading and paid a $525 fee. Apparently the robbers, their fences or transferees believed that after a 14-year interval they could dispose of
                  the Linderman 1804 dollar for a substantial sum after it had a certification of —genuineness.— The piece was immediately recognized by <persName>DeLorey</persName> who alerted ANA executive vice-president <persName>Edward C. Rochette</persName> of its provenance. <persName>Quinn</persName> left the coin at ANACS for its review and study.<ref target="#CH8-n44">44</ref> The FBI was alerted and du Pont
                  was contacted after the piece had been positively identified through photographs, research data and records which had been assembled about 20
                  years before in the course of writing <hi rend="italic">The Fantastic 1804 Dollar</hi>. <persName>Quinn</persName> was given a date to
                  pick up the coin after the FBI set up a sting by arranging for an agent to pose as an attorney for a potential buyer who wished to acquire and
                  donate the coin to the American Numismatic Association. Listening devices were set up on the telephone, on persons and in rooms at the ANA. On
                  September 1, 1981, <persName>Quinn</persName> came to pick up the dollar and an attempt was made by the FBI to get <persName>Quinn</persName> to offer it for sale. <persName>Quinn</persName> received a local telephone call from an associate warning him that the
                  place was —crawling with Feds.— When this message was overheard, the FBI seized the stolen coin as Quinn attempted to leave with it. <persName>Quinn</persName> was not arrested, but served with papers to appear at the grand jury investigation of the matter. The coin was
                  first returned to <persName>Harold Gray</persName>, du Pont—s attorney, on March 16, 1982, and then placed on display in the ANA museum
                  in <placeName>Colorado Springs</placeName> by du Pont in appreciation for the recovery of the coin.<ref target="#CH8-n45">45</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Quinn</persName> and another Las Vegas resident, Salvatore Manarite, were indicted on charges of interstate transportation of
                  stolen property. <persName>Quinn</persName> was a relative of Manarite. The case was tried in September 1983 in Denver in Federal
                  District Court. The trial, with Judge <persName>John P. Moore</persName> presiding, lasted two and a half days. <persName>Quinn</persName> had claimed <pb n="172"/> that the coin was given to him by his grandfather. The identity and ownership of the Linderman
                  specimen were established by witnesses from the ANA, including the writer, and other numismatic experts, so that there was little dispute that
                  stolen property was involved. At the conclusion of the case, the judge dismissed the action against Manarite because the prosecution had
                  failed to prove that the coin had been transported by Manarite across state lines. The jury, after 16 hours of deliberation, found <persName>Quinn</persName> not guilty.<ref target="#CH8-n46">46</ref>
               </p>
               <p>At the conclusion of the trial <persName>Gerald S. Rafferty</persName>, Assistant <placeName>U.S</placeName>. Attorney for <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, left the coin on the table for du Pont. <persName>Quinn</persName>, of course, had no right to it
                  despite his acquittal; the FBI and federal prosecutors were all anxious to relinquish their custody of the coin; even du Pont after his
                  experiences and the results of the trial seemed to feel that the piece was jinxed—so it was agreed that the coin would be lent to the ANA for
                  safekeeping, study and display, where it remains.<ref target="#CH8-n47">47</ref>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rosenthal Specimen</hi> When the Chase Manhattan Museum of Moneys of the World was disbanded in 1978, a 10-year loan gift
                  arrangement was made for transferring the Rosenthal dollar (also known as the Zerbe dollar) from the Chase to the collection of the American
                  Numismatic Society in <placeName corresp="#numismatics_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>.<ref target="#CH8-n48">48</ref> The gift
                  was completed in 1979. The coin was exhibited in November 1986 at the Coinage of the Americas Conference on —America—s Silver Coinage— at the
                  ANS and is clearly in extremely fine condition rather than very fine as previously classified. In reviewing the published pedigree, it should
                  be mentioned that <persName>Farran Zerbe</persName> purchased this piece through <persName corresp="#viaf_75915787">Wayte
                     Raymond</persName> in 1924 rather than in 1925.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Idler Specimen</hi> The <persName>Edwin Hydeman</persName> coin was sold at auction by <persName>Abe
                     Kosoff</persName>, Mar. 3-4, 1961, 994, for $29,000 to an undisclosed buyer. The ownership from 1961 to 1972 remains a mystery, but may have
                  been a joint venture of <persName>Kosoff</persName> and <persName>Sol Kaplan</persName>. In 1972 it was advertised for sale by <persName>Abe Kosoff</persName> on behalf of the owner for $ 100,000 and was sold to World Wide Coin Company for a reported $80,000. The
                  next purchaser was Bowers and Ruddy Galleries who bought the piece in October 1972 for a price in excess of $ 110,000 and reported as $
                     150,000.<ref target="#CH8-n49">49</ref> It was then offered for sale at $ 165,000 in January 1974, and eventually sold in September 1974,
                  to <persName>Mark Blackburn</persName> for $200,000.</p>
               <p>The piece was subsequently shown for sale by Continental Coin Galleries at $225,000 and later rumored to have gone to the Swiss Bank
                  Corporation in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2657896">Zurich</placeName>. Superior Stamp and Coin Company acquired <pb n="173"/> it in
                  February 1979, and sold it the same month for $200,000 to <persName>Jerry Buss</persName>, who held the piece until the sale of his
                  collection by Superior Galleries, Jan. 28-30, 1985, 1337.<ref target="#CH8-n50">50</ref> It realized $308,000 and was purchased by <persName>Aubrey Bebee</persName> of <placeName>Omaha</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, the illustration shown for the Idler piece in <hi rend="italic">The Fantastic 1804 Dollar</hi> was actually that of the <persName>Adams</persName> specimen from Mehl—s 1950 Golden Jubilee Sale, rather than the Idler coin. The correct photograph did appear in

               <p>
                  <persName>Robert Morris</persName>, Superintendent of Finance, formulated a brilliant coinage plan for the Congress of the Confederation
                  in 1782. By shrewdly valuing the new coinage unit to facilitate conversions of circulating foreign coins, especially British and Spanish, he
                  increased the likelihood that the new coinage unit would be accepted in domestic trade and for the eventual retirement of the foreign coinage.
                  These domestic considerations motivated the choice of a silver standard. From among the many names for crown genre coins, he fixed upon the
                  name —dollar— and for a decimal system he coined the name —cent— that appears on the lettered edge.</p>
               <p>It is a peculiarity that he did not envision a need for a dollar coin; only —that the value of the unit be precisely known.—<ref target="#CH9-n1">1</ref> He may have been a visionary. A dozen years later the ill-fated early dollar series commenced and still another
                  dozen years later it concluded. But that—s ahead of the story.</p>
               <p>Recognizing the limitations of <persName>Morris—s</persName> plan, <persName corresp="#viaf_41866059">Thomas Jefferson</persName>
                  and <persName>Alexander Hamilton</persName>, Secretaries of State and Treasury respectively, also collaborated with <persName>Morris</persName> to report to the Congress in 1791. That Report became the basis for the fundamental Coinage Act of April 2, 1792. In
                  addition to a bimetallic standard (gold was included to foster international trade), a pure silver weight of 371.25 grains (an average of the
                  popular circulating Spanish issues) and a gross weight of 416 grains (again, to better match the Spanish coin) were proposed. The resulting
                  fineness, an awkward 0.892 (as contrasted to the 11/12 or 0.916 British standard) has a role in our story.</p>
            </div2>

                  <hi rend="bold">Early Obstacles</hi>
               </head>
               <p>If these were the beginnings, next came the early obstacles. <persName>David Rittenhouse</persName>, then in his later years, became
                  Director of the Mint. <persName>Henry Voight</persName> became the first chief coiner and <persName>Albion Coxe</persName>, the
                  assayer/refiner. <persName>Voight</persName> was to remain chief coiner for many years and throughout the early dollar series. <persName>Coxe</persName> was to die in 1795 leaving an incredible legacy. The financial bonds Congress initially specified for these posts
                  proved unrealistically high and had to be reduced to facilitate getting on with precious metal coinage. The Senate passed a bill that a
                  likeness of <persName corresp="#viaf_31432428">George Washington</persName> appear on the coinage. The House countered with an insistence
                  that an emblematic —Liberty,— as well as the word, appear on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. Denomination was omitted, consistent
                  with the British practice for precious metal coinage. Other aspects <pb n="179"/> of the design were left to the Chief Engraver, <persName>Robert Scot</persName>. The available coining press was considered less than ideal for minting dollars and the results confirm
                  that judgment.</p>
               <p>The trying preludes to the early dollar coinage continued. Assayer Coxe may have persuaded Rittenhouse that silver coinage of less than 0.900
                  fineness could darken in circulation. With —all eyes— on the impending coinage, that had to be a disturbing prospect. Additional delays
                  resulted from difficulty in refining the French billon coinage, which comprised much of the first silver deposit. Soon after this Bank of
                  Maryland deposit, Rittenhouse deposited some silver.</p>

                  criticism of the mint and its products. A congressional investigation headed by <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName> was largely favorable
                  to the mint. A proper coining press had arrived in the spring, so that quality and quantity could improve. The reverse eagle was replaced by a
                  more natural one and the —young— Liberty obverse by a —matronly— one. <persName>Gilbert Stuart</persName>—the country—s leading
                  artist—was enlisted in the quest for a —world class— coinage. And in November 1795, <persName>Boudinot</persName> became the third
                  Director of the Mint, as well as the third in that year.</p>

                  ordered a halt to precious metal coinage. An accounting was made of all precious metal handled by the mint from its start. Depositors
                  apparently received the full measure of bullion they had deposited. However, they received slightly less in face value coinage than their
                  silver should have commanded. Congress settled at least one suit by a depositor when the practice became public.</p>

                  adding obverse stars for newly admitted states ends. Subsequent obverses bear 13 stars, all but one variety in a 7/6 arrangement.</p>
               <p>The year 1798 marks the appearance of the Heraldic Eagle reverse. Although it is an adaptation from the Great Seal, at least one peculiarity

               <p>The Liberty Seated half dollars comprise a series of federal silver coinage for which numismatic exposure to date has been limited to the
                  point that I refer to it as the —dark ages— of numismatics. I believe that the lack of knowledge in this series can be mainly attributed to
                  the following three factors: the extensiveness of the Liberty Seated series, the stabilization of the Liberty Seated design, and the half
                  dollar denomination as compared with other smaller denominations.</p>
               <p>The first factor, extensiveness of the Liberty Seated series, is the most apparent. Seated half dollars were struck each year at the <placeName>U.S</placeName>. Mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> (1839-91), and at the
                  Branch Mints, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> (1840-61), <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> (1855-78) and <placeName>Carson City</placeName> (1870-78). Accordingly, a
                  collection of seated half dollars by date and mint without regard to any other die varieties would span 53 years and 4 different mints and
                  would contain 108 coins. Assembling a basic set of these half dollars would be a formidable challenge for any collector. Additionally, with a
                  total seated half dollar coinage of more than 155 million pieces and an average expected die life of about 155 thousand coins per die, it is
                  reasonable to expect that about 1,000 different obverse dies and 1,000 different reverse dies were used to strike these coins. Likewise, since
                  a single reverse die was often paired with more than one obverse die and vice versa, it is reasonable to expect that several thousand
                  different die pair combinations exist for the series. For example, I have identified three different obverse dies and three different reverse
                  dies used to strike five different die pair combinations of the rare 1870-CC half dollar which has a reported mintage of 54,617. Accordingly,
                  identifying and assembling a complete set of die varieties for each date of the seated half dollar series appears to be impossible.</p>
               <p>The second factor, stabilization of the Liberty Seated design, is a consequence of the progress made in the development of federal coinage
                  between the Turban Head half dollar type of the early 1800s and the seated half dollar type introduced in 1839. Preparation of working dies to
                  be used for coinage of Turban Head half dollars involved hand punching of individual stars, letters in the legend, and numerals in the date.
                  Accordingly, a multitude of small individual punches were used in conjunction with a working hub or puncheon <pb n="189"/> which impressed the
                  main design of the coin into the working die. This process made it fairly easy for numismatic scholars to identify later a variety of
                  individual Turban Head half dollar dies used to strike a particular date. Conversely, working dies used for seated coinage were prepared from
                  hubs which incorporated much more of the details of the final design of the coin. In fact, individual punches were limited to letters for mint
                  marks and numerals for dates, and, in the latter case, multiple numerals (2, 3 or 4 digits) were often incorporated into a single logotype or
                  ganged punch which was used to impress the date into the working die. Advancement of federal coinage in this era was facilitated by the
                  development of more powerful and precise machines and was desirable not only from a standpoint of manual work reduction, but also because
                  design stabilization was a deterrent to the evil of counterfeiting. However, this boon of the 1800s ultimately compounded the difficulty of
                  individual die identification for the numismatist as it left him only with dates, mint marks, and die imperfections as —fingerprints— for die
                  identification. To get an impression of how the difficulty of die identification was compounded, one need only look at Beistle, which is the
                  only published work with individual die descriptions for seated half dollars.<ref target="#CH10-n1">1</ref> Beistle took 113 pages to describe
                  the Turban Head half dollars (1807-39), but his description of only the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> minted seated half dollars (1839-91) was limited to 41 pages. In other words, Beistle said much less about seated half
                  dollars than he did about earlier types.</p>
               <p>The third factor, half dollar denomination, is not so apparent. The seated dime and quarter dollar series are almost as extensive as the half
                  dollar series, and design stabilization equally affected all denominations of seated coinage. However, there are two aspects of the half
                  dollar denomination that have further restricted variety identification of this series as compared to smaller denominations. One aspect is die
                  life. Larger denomination coins are physically bigger, and the dies used to strike them have a larger diameter and require a higher striking
                  pressure. This results in a shorter die life. I would estimate that during the Liberty Seated era, the die life for quarter dollar dies was
                  about double that of the half dollar, and the die life for dimes was four times as great. A shorter die life led to smaller mintages for each
                  half dollar die variety, and made variety identification more difficult; especially when combined with the second aspect that I associate with
                  different coin denominations— monetary value. The practice of placing a substantial monetary premium on a coin because of condition and/or
                  rarity is a trend that has experienced much of its growth over the past few decades. Prior <pb n="190"/> to modern times, coin collecting was,
                  among other things, an interesting way to save money, and the value of many coin collections was restricted to the approximate face value of
                  the coins contained. For this reason, a collector would encounter an accumulation of half dollars less often than quarters, dimes or half
                  dimes, and half dollar accumulations would generally consist of a smaller number of coins than those of smaller denominations. Thus, the
                  likelihood of discovering a seated half dollar die variety by direct comparison of two coins of the same date was not as great, and the
                  likelihood of being able to afford to keep a half dollar variety if discovered was also not as great. In short, collecting goals were
                  substantially limited by the face value of the collection, and this factor was to the detriment of collecting half dollar die varieties. It
                  should be noted that both aspects of the third factor affect seated dollars even more so than half dollars, but the basic seated dollar series
                  (44 pieces) is not even half as extensive as the half dollar series such that the overall effect of the three factors is not as great.</p>
               <p>All three of the above factors contributed to the —dark ages— stigma I have associated with Liberty Seated half dollars. However, there is
                  still hope for the numismatist who is patient, determined and resourceful. My approach to keep from being overwhelmed by the extensiveness of
                  the seated half dollar series was to break down my collecting goals into smaller areas. For example, the first area I researched was S-Mint
                  varieties. By concentrating on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> half dollars (1855-78), the basic
                  collection was reduced from 108 pieces to a more manageable 24 pieces. If I had chosen to concentrate on only —No Motto— reverse varieties of
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> half dollars, my basic set would have been further reduced to 12
                  dates (1855-66). Perhaps the old saying —divide and conquer— best describes this approach.</p>
               <p>My interest in exploring die varieties of seated half dollars and S-Mint varieties in particular was kindled by my exposure to the Liberty
                  Seated Collectors Club and articles by <persName>John McCloskey</persName> and <persName>David Brase</persName> in some early issues
                  of the <hi rend="italic">Gobrecht Journal</hi>. Accordingly, I set a goal to identify every individual S-Mint reverse die used for coinage of
                  seated half dollars. My approach to attaining this goal was to establish a reference collection from which to examine coins by direct
                  comparison, and to expand the reference set as I discovered new varieties. In most cases, different reverse dies for a particular date were
                  identified by comparing just the size and location of the mint marks. In a few cases, two dies of a given date with mint marks which seemed to
                  be identical in size and location were determined to be different by die imperfections or different <pb n="191"/> die crack patterns which
                  usually developed in later die states.</p>
               <p>As my reference collection grew and new discoveries became few and far between, I decided that I needed to put some limits on the number of
                  die varieties I could expect to find. The solution to this problem was to be found in Bureau of the Mint records contained at the National
                  Archives where I examined correspondence files between the Director of the Mint in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> and the Superintendent of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> Branch Mint. Within these files, which consisted of loose correspondence sorted by
                  date, I found letters relating to die shipments from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> to
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>. These die shipment records were fragmented and dispersed
                  throughout the file and had to be extracted laboriously and pieced together. Unfortunately, my records are presently incomplete, but they
                  still have been very helpful in quantifying the varieties that might be expected to exist for a certain date or era. Also, the value of the
                  die shipment records is greatly enhanced if the shipment records can be coordinated with other mint operational correspondence, such as
                  monthly coinage records, which can be used to break down the familiar annual mintages reported in standard reference books.</p>
               <p>In contrast to the record of die shipments to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> in this era, the record
                  of die shipments to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Branch Mint in the 1840s was very well documented
                  and self-contained. Minting of federal silver coinage of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint began
                  in 1838. An analysis of correspondence files and operating procedures in effect at the time indicate that the Mint Director, <persName>R.M. Patterson</persName>, was very concerned about the evil of counterfeiting and felt that strict control over working dies was
                  essential to deter counterfeiting.</p>
               <p>Some steps taken to control working dies are described in the following list:</p>
               <list rend="numbered">
                  <item n="1.">All working dies were totally prepared at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>
                     Mint, except for final die hardening which was done at the branch mint.</item>
                  <item n="2.">All reverse dies prepared for seated coinage at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint
                     were identified with a mint mark; the letter O being punched into the working die just prior to shipment. I believe that one distinct
                     original purpose of the mint mark was to affix responsibility in the event that branch dies were misused and counterfeit coins
                     surfaced.</item>
                  <item n="3.">All die shipments were forwarded to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint under the frank
                     of the Secretary of the Treasury.</item>
                  <item n="4.">Dies were supplied to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> in small quantities for fear that a
                     surplus of dies in the coiner—s vault would result in one or more dies being lost or stolen without immediate recognition. This practice
                     resulted in dies often being used in a broken condition and <pb n="192"/> being used for several months into the next calendar year beyond
                     the one for which they were dated. For example, I know of three varieties of 1841-O half dollars which I believe were struck after the rare
                     1842-O small date, and they are accounted for in the coinage reported for February and March 1842.</item>
                  <item n="5.">The Superintendent of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint was instructed by Director
                        <persName>Patterson</persName> to be particular in acknowledging receipt of all dies.</item>
                  <item n="6.">The Superintendent of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint was given specific
                     instructions regarding disposition of dies. Early each calendar year, dated obverse dies of the previous year and worn out reverses were to
                     be cancelled at the branch mint in the presence of the Superintendent by cutting a cross or —X— across the face of each die. A detailed
                     list of dies cancelled was to be sent to Director <persName>Patterson</persName> when accomplished.</item>
                  <item n="7.">A formal Register of Die Shipments was maintained by the Engraver of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint (1839-54). This self-contained record documented on a yearly basis in checkbook fashion each die shipment during a
                     given year as well as reports received from the branch mints regarding annual die cancellations, along with a list of any unused dies which
                     were reserved for the next year.</item>
               </list>
               <p>At <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName>, the process concerning die shipments during the period starting
                  1855 was somewhat different than that just described for the 1840s. Several months prior to the start of a new calendar year, the Chief Coiner
                  at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> Mint would make a requisition to his Superintendent for dies
                  needed for the coming year. The Superintendent would enclose the Coiner—s requisition with his next general correspondence to the Mint
                  Director in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, who would pass the requisition to the
                  Engraver of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint with instructions to prepare dies. These requisitions were not
                  usually filled with a single die shipment, but rather with two or more partial shipments, and sometimes the total shipment would vary slightly
                  from the requisition due to error or instructions from the Director. Die shipments were made by steamer or overland express coach and later by
                  rail under contracts to companies, such as Freeman Express Company and Wells Fargo. The contents of each die shipment were invoiced by the
                  Engraver and forwarded to the Superintendent at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> by the Director under
                  a separate cover letter. Receipt of die shipments was usually acknowledged by the Superintendent in the next piece of general correspondence
                  back to the Director. These acknowledgements were usually not specific, but rather referred to the Director—s letter. If additional dies <pb n="193"/> were required during the course of a year, a separate requisition was made and filled in the same manner. Because the
                  completeness of the correspondence file is questionable, it is possible that special requests were made and filled in this era of which I am
                  not aware. There are also a few instances where I have found forwarding letters describing an enclosed requisition for dies or an invoice of a
                  die shipment, but the actual requisition or invoice was not attached to the letter and the detailed die shipment information is lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">S-Mint, —No Motto— Half Dollars</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having established a good general understanding of the complexities of identifying and collecting die varieties of Liberty Seated half
                  dollars, I should now like to follow through on my —divide and conquer— approach by presenting some very specific information on one
                  particular example, the —No Motto— half dollars of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> Mint
                  (1855-66). A basic set of seated half dollars in this era would consist of 12 coins (one each 1855-S through 1866-S). Counting reverse die
                  varieties only, my reference set now contains 46 coins. Four of these coins are transitional; meaning that the same reverse die was paired
                  with two different obverse dies having —different— dates. Therefore, at least 42 different reverse dies were used for coinage in this era. How
                  does this number compare to the die shipment records for this same period?</p>
               <p>Table 1 is an extract from my die shipment records. It shows only the die shipments made to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> Mint during 1855-66 which contained half dollar reverse dies of the —No Motto— type.
                  It should be noted that there were many other die shipments in this period containing half dollar obverses and dies of other denominations,
                  but they are not included in Table 1. The next shipment of reverse dies to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San
                     Francisco</placeName> after those listed in Table 1 was in March 1866 when 6 dies of the new —With Motto— type were shipped. Based on Bureau of
                  the Mint records, I can verify 9 shipments and estimate a 10th shipment for a total of 42 reverse dies of the —No Motto— type shipped to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</placeName> during 1855-66. This total agrees exactly with the number of actual
                  coins identified and contained in my reference collection.</p>
               <p>Table 2 lists the 46 coins in my reference set and correlates them with the 10 die shipments listed in Table 1. Following Table 2 are reverse
                  detail enlargements of the 46 coins listed.<ref target="#CH10-n2">2</ref> Specific details contributing to the uniqueness of 42 out of 46 of
                  these dies will not be addressed in this paper. Rather, the purpose of the photographs is to expose the reader to the concept of die variety
                  identification and the collectability of these die varieties.</p>

                  <p>Mint mark descriptions are speculative rather than absolute. Mint marks for a given date were usually the same type because the dies were
                     prepared in batches. Starting with S7, all dies were from a new hub.</p>

                  <p>The quantity of dies in this shipment is not known since the invoice listing the individual dies was not enclosed with the forwarding
                     letter. It is my belief that 12 pair of half dollar dies were requested and shipped for 1857, as was done in 1856. This would place the
                     quantity of reverses shipped in Dec 1856 at 4 and increase the total quantity shipped to 42, which exactly matches the number of pieces in
                     my reference collection. I believe these 4 dies were 2 large S, 1 medium-large S, and 1 medium S. (I believe the smaller size punches were
                     selected because the mint mark from the large S punch was often punched into the olive stem.)</p>

                  <p>I believe these 5 dies were 2 small wide S (partially broken), 2 small wide S (broken) and 1 small thin S. The small thin S was the first
                     die marked from a new punch, the old punch now broken beyond further use.</p>
               </note>
               <p>Hopefully, the reader will be able to identify most of these dies based on some general criteria. The first criterion is mint mark size. The
                  average height of the mint marks, measured in thousands of an inch, are: Large (.065), Medium-Large (.061), Medium (.055), and Small
                     (.040).<ref target="#CH10-n3">3</ref> The second criterion is mint mark position. Many variations in position can be seen from the
                  illustration; the most <pb n="195"/> dramatic example is 1865-S (coins 41-45), where the small thin S type mint marks for shipment S 10 were
                  punched to the far left, left, center, right, and far right. Other criteria for die identification include mint mark orientation (1858-S coins
                  11 and 12 have mint marks which are very similar in size and location, but the S on coin 11 leans to the right and the S on coin 12 leans to
                  the left), diagnostic die imperfections (1864-S coin 35 has a tine on the top of D in DOL), and diagnostic die cracks often seen in late die
                  states (1862-S coin 30 and 1865-S coin 39 have similar mint mark sizes, descriptions, and locations, but each has a unique die crack pattern

               <p>As a general rule, when examining two coins with the same date and mint marks of the same size and position, I consider the two reverses to be
                  the same reverse unless I can find some specific diagnostic difference. Conversely, when two coins with different dates have mint marks which
                  appear identical in size and position, I consider the two reverses to be different unless I can find some specific diagnostic link between the
                  two dies indicating that they are transitional. An example of one such transitional pair is 1856-S coin 5 and 1857-S coin 6, which are linked
                  by a raised die scratch line which cuts perpendicularly across the tail feathers in the area between the two arrow feathers.</p>

               <p>This paper presents four interesting Seated Liberty half dollar issues—three of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New
                     Orleans</placeName> Mint and one of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint. The early
                  years at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> were troubled times. Mint officials were being replaced for
                  incompetency and corruption and the mint was trying to establish itself as a reliable source of coinage. To that end, the object was to
                  produce coinage to meet public demand. All available dies were used as long as possible (halves struck from cracked dies are typical of this
                  period). In keeping with the policy of the times, dies were received from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint ready for use, except for final hardening; the mint marks and dates were already punched into the dies. These
                  1840 circumstances gave birth to a unique opportunity for the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint to
                  unknowingly create a major numismatic blunder.</p>

               <p>Every knowledgeable seated half dollar collector is familiar with the 1840 bust reverse half dollar as depicted in <ref target="#fig-239">fig.
                     1</ref>. This variety has been a source of interest and mystery for many years. It has been identified as being everything from a pattern
                  to a regular issue of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint, yet it can be shown to be
                  a regular issue of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint. This variety is unlike the more recent
                  S-less proof sets where the mint mark was unintentionally omitted from the die. This is a branch mint regular issue with the mint mark omitted
                  due to an error of transition.</p>
               <p>The Registry of Dies in the National Archives contains the die shipment information for the branch mints from 1839 until 1854 when the book—s
                  use was discontinued. At that time, dies were often shipped <pb n="202"/> over hostile, unsettled <placeName>U.S. territory</placeName> and
                  mint officials were concerned that these dies would fall into the hands of counterfeiters. This book was used to track branch mint die
                  shipments. It is a matter of record that 3 pairs of half dollar dies were shipped to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New
                     Orleans</placeName> Mint for use in 1839. On hand from previous shipments (probably from 1838; the book does not say) were two other reverse
                  dies. It must be assumed that the three obverses were of the Turban Head (Reeded Edge) type and the five reverses were of the Bust/Eagle type.
                  In February 1840 a total of 3 obverse dies dated 1839 and 4 reverse dies were cancelled, as was the custom of the time by cutting a deep X
                  across the face of the die to prevent further use in later years. It is also a matter of record that the Superintendent of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint reported that one reverse die, the fifth of these 5, was reserved for
                  use in 1840. As this one die was intended to have been used in 1839, it would have been of the bust design; seated half dollar design coinage
                  did not begin at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> until 1840. It is important to note that the bust half
                  dollar issue of 1839-O had the mint mark on the obverse above the date; the reverse was used to annotate mint of issue starting in 1840.</p>
               <p>If this one reverse die reserved from 1839 was later used with the seated obverse design, the variety would have the 1840 date with a bust
                  reverse without a mint mark. I theorized that this could account for and may be the well-known 1840 with bust reverse half dollar always
                  assumed to have been a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> issue. When I recently speculated
                  on this to <persName>Randall Wiley</persName>, he noted that my theory could be proven correct if, by chance, the 1840 obverses paired
                  with the bust reverse were transitional with the other known obverses of the 1840-O half dollars, which was quickly verified. The 1840 bust
                  reverse half dollar is actually an 1840-O no mint mark bust reverse of 1839. This makes sense for another reason. The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint issue half dollars of 1839-42 have a slightly smaller diameter than the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> issues of the same years. This was probably due to
                  differences in the collars used. The 1840 with the bust reverse is of the same diameter as the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> issues and this alone would lead one to believe it was struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName>.</p>
               <p>This interesting variety actually has two 1840 dated obverses paired with the one bust reverse die (see <ref target="#fig-239">fig. 1</ref>).
                  Those two obverses are also paired in combinations with three 1840-O reverse mint-marked dies.</p>
               <p>Obverse 1 of this no mint mark variety was struck from a very rusty die. There are heavy die polish lines on the denticles and die lines run
                  horizontally from the TY of LIBERTY into Liberty—s skirt slightly slanting upwards toward her shin as shown in <ref target="#fig-240">fig.
                     2</ref>. There are many less obvious die lines throughout this obverse, This same obverse is paired with 1840-O reverse varieties 7 and 3
                  where the exact same die lines are prominent as shown in <ref target="#fig-240">fig. 2</ref>.<ref target="#CH10-n4">4</ref>

               </figure>
               <pb n="204"/>
               <p>Obverse 2 paired with this bust type reverse was struck from a heavily polished die. The lower obverse shield is weak, all stars are recut,
                  the die is only slightly rusty, and die lines run southwest from Liberty—s sandal into the foot support, as shown in <ref target="#fig-242">fig. 3</ref>. This same obverse was paired with 1840-O reverse variety 6 with the same die lines below Liberty—s sandal (see <ref target="#fig-242">fig. 3</ref>). It is interesting to note the extensive die polishing that ground away the lowest arrow, the lower portion
                  of the olive branch—s stem and the eagle—s tail feathers, as shown in <ref target="#fig-243">fig. 4</ref>. <figure xml:id="fig-241">
                     <graphic url="COAC3_204.jpg"/>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="205"/> By close scrutiny of the die pairings, a striking order can be ascertained. Table 3 displays the die pairings and the emission
                  sequence. The numbers on the connecting lines for obverse and reverse dies indicate the striking order. Die pairing obverse 1 and reverse 3
                  was struck some time after number 2, but its relation to later die pairings cannot be estimated.</p>

               <p>So ends the mystery of the 1840 with bust reverse, more appropriately named the 1840-O No Mint Mark Bust Reverse of 1839 (1840-O NMMBR39).
                  Perhaps the only connection left to finalize is this reverse paired with either the 1838-O or 1839-O halves. I have seen the 1839-O paired
                  with two reverses different from this noted die.</p>
               <p>The second issue is the 1842-O small date. This expensive rarity is high on the want list of many seated half dollar collectors. Few specimens
                  come on the market, and when they do, often command high prices. There is only one obverse die dated 1842, but it is paired with two different
                  reverses (see <ref target="#fig-240">fig. 5</ref>). Table 4 depicts these pairings with emission sequence annotated on the connecting lines.
                  The date is small (.064 inches high as compared to the .081 for the medium date), but it has telltale die lines by Liberty—s right hand that
                  rests on the obverse shield, as shown in <ref target="#fig-241">fig. 6</ref>. These die lines are plainly visible on low grade as well as high
                  grade specimens and were on the obverse die when used to strike both reverse pairings. All 1842-O small date obverses I have seen have these
                  die lines. In its later die state paired with the second reverse, the foot support is weak and there is a die crack at the left of the date
                  from the rim to the base of the rock. This die crack appears on later die states of the first pairing and all of the second.</p>
               <p>Reverse A has a large O set left, small letters, and is usually weakly struck, as depicted in <ref target="#fig-240">fig. 5</ref>. Reverse B
                  in <ref target="#fig-245">fig. 5</ref> also has a large O, but set right. The legend also has small letters, but is usually fully struck.
                  There are die cracks, the most prominent of which is from the rim between AL in HALF to the eagle—s right claw. There are also die clash marks
                  in the reverse shield. Interestingly enough, <persName>Randall Wiley</persName> discovered this reverse to be transitional with 1841.</p>

               <p>The third <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> issue is the 1846/5-O half dollar. <persName>M.L.
                     Beistle</persName> lists an 1846/5 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> Mint issue and describes the obverse as
                  such: —1846 O 2 B. Over 1845. Weakly struck date. Upper serif of 1 is a straight, light line, and 6 is recut over 5. No drapery at the elbow.
                  Six heavy akcidefect [clash marks] lines are across the legs at the knees.—<ref target="#CH10-n5">5</ref> He lists it paired with three
                  different reverse dies. The obverse and three reverses are depicted in <ref target="#fig-247">fig. 7</ref>. The obverse has weakly struck
                  stars and has a medium date (.081 inches high) as opposed to the tall date (.091 inches high). The reverses have medium letters with a large
                  mint mark (.054 inches high).</p>
               <p>I have to take issue with <persName>Beistle—s</persName> conclusion that this is an overdate issue. His descriptions are of later die
                  states, but I—m still mystified as to why he thinks this is a 6 over a 5.</p>
               <p>The prominent features of the obverse are easy to distinguish without magnification: clash marks across Liberty—s knees and no drapery. Both
                  these features also appear on other dated varieties of the seated half design. An enlargement of the 46 on the latest die state I have (the
                  B-2aE) shows the die crack along the base of the date beginning to develop and the knob of the 6 slightly doubled (see <ref target="#fig-248">fig. 8</ref>). This doubled knob is visible on all three die pairings. Does this appear to be a 5 under the 6? I don—t believe so. Next to
                  it is an enlargement of an 1845-O triple date for comparison. One can conjecture either that the dies clashed so hard that what <persName>Beistle</persName> thought was a 5 was actually clash marks, or <persName>Beistle—s</persName> coin may have indeed had a 5
                  but its remnants were removed when the die was <pb n="209"/> polished to remove the clash marks. He then wrote up the later die state. Perhaps
                  the specific coins <persName>Beistle</persName> studied have more visible characteristics of a 5. My research of the Archives— records
                  has not helped to prove or disprove the use of 1845 obverse dies in 1846.</p>

               <p>The last issue to be discussed is the 1846/5 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> Mint half.
                  This also is described by <persName>Beistle</persName> with one obverse die paired with two different reverse dies, as depicted in <ref target="#fig-249">fig. 9</ref>. The enlargement of the obverse date (<ref target="#fig-250">fig. 10</ref>) shows what this overdate looks
                  like. The tip of the 5 appears to be inside the loop of the 6, as indicated by the arrows. In late die states a fine die crack joins the base
                  of the date and another joins the foot of Liberty with the rim.<ref target="#CH10-n6">6</ref>
