            <p>Coins commemorative of special events date from ancient times as attested by the many striking examples in the Roman series. It was but natural
               that countries should desire to perpetuate victories, anniversaries and other happenings of note in a form that was easily scattered broadcast.
               Consequently these coins are often more elaborate than the regular issues in subject matter as well as being larger ill size.</p>
            <p>Since the XVth Century, with the advent of the larger size coinage, there has been a revival of those special and commemorative issues which had
               lapsed during the decadence of coinage arts in the early Mediæval period. This revival took place in certain countries only, <pb n="2"/> but most
               notably in Germany. With a few exceptions these pieces were put into circulation in the same manner as the regular coinage, but for a limited
               time and often in a limited territory. Some were made as souvenirs purely, and some as presentation pieces.</p>
            <p>It is our purpose, however, to treat only of the commemorative and souvenir coins issued by the <name type="place">United States</name>. The
               general public, though never wholly conversant with them, has become more familiar with these special issues on account of the number of
               commemorative half-dollars issued in the past few years. These souvenir coins are not as well known as they should be because they were issued in
               limited quantities and sold at an enhanced price. In consequence, they did not pass into circulation.</p>
            <p>For this reason our commemorative coins do not fall into the same category as those of other nations. They are really souvenirs, and are to be
               considered as mementoes and keepsakes. Again, they were placed before the public by <pb n="3"/> private enterprises, the Government having
               nothing to do with them except to make and to legalize them by Acts of Congress.</p>
            <p>Our first commemorative or souvenir coin was issued in conjunction with the World's Columbian Exposition held in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name> in 1893, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the discovery of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. Two different pieces were issued in this connection—the Columbian half-dollar and the Isabella
               quarter.</p>
            <p>These coins were the forerunners of other pieces issued later in connection with other events in our history. The precedent, good or bad, of
               charging at least double their face value was instituted with the first commemorative coinage. This policy has brought considerable revenue to
               the enterprises connected with their issues, and has also been an economical reason for the Government's making the necessary appropriations, but
               the people in the end pay the bill. This procedure of charging a premium has been the subject of much <pb n="4"/> comment by the press,
               numismatic societies and collectors, especially at the time of the Columbian issues. Many caustic remarks appeared in the papers. The Exposition
               management was blamed for resorting to such expedients to obtain money. One sarcastic suggestion was that they go a step further and make the
               pieces of base metal. Criticisms were offered as to whether the Government, even indirectly, should be a party to a scheme for making a profit by
               selling to the people the work of their servants.</p>
            <p>In defense of the decision made at the time—one which has formed a precedent. ever since, it may be said that without the incentive of added
               revenue this country would not have had the number of special issues it now has. The variety of our coinage would not be what it is and the
               interest in collecting coins would not have been so great. It is noteworthy that every issue of commemorative coins has made a number of new
               collectors.</p>
            <p>By some it has been said that the Government should have issued these coins, <pb n="5"/> and put them in circulation during the period of the
               event commemorated sc that everybody could see and use them The Post Office Department has done this on many occasions with special issues of
               stamps. With coins, however, it is extremely doubtful if the desired purpose of popularizing the special issue would have been accomplished. The
               coins would have been hoarded, and later, coming out at infrequent intervals would have caused trouble through being refused by the ignorant as
               well as by a younger generation unacquainted with them. This has been demonstrated by the remainder of the Columbian half-dollars that were put
               into circulation after the close of the World's Fair at <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name>. Many of us have
               experienced difficulty in trying to pass one of these coins, especially if tarnished through having been laid away.</p>
            <p>In connection with the first commemorative issue, an interesting question arose among certain collectors. Were they, or were they not, legal
               coins? If <pb n="6"/> they were, they should be included in the regular proof-sets of the year; and in that case, those pieces should be sold at
               the slight advance that was charged for proof-sets. The Trade Dollar, whether rightly or wrongly, had been included in the proof-sets. The
               Government in its own way, probably in order not to embarrass the World's Fair management by charging less than the market price for better
               struck and finished coins, omitted them from the proof-sets.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The first suggestions for a commemorative coin came from the managers of the World's Fair with a proposal to the Government that a special issue
               amounting to $20,000,000 in fifty-cent pieces be coined for use at the Exposition. This proposition met with the approval of the Secretary of the
               Treasury and the Director of the Mint. Apparently, the original intention was that they be used for admission primarily, and also as souvenirs of
               the Fair. The idea of selling them at twice their value was an additional consideration in view of the need for help in financing the vast
               undertaking of the Fair. This plan was placed before Congress and the following Act was the result: <q>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Act of August 5, 1892</hi>

            </p>
            <p>A number of designs were made. At first there was some doubt as to which portrait of Columbus would be used. The reverse also was the subject of
               discussion. It was first given out to the press that the Administration building at the Fair would be used; other accounts stated that the
               reverse would depict the three vessels of Columbus.</p>
            <p>On November 19, 1892, the first piece was struck at the <name type="place">Philadelphia Mint</name>. When the coins appeared, their reception by
               the public—as is always the case with a new coin design, was unfavorable. The flatness of the head was much criticised. <hi rend="italic">The
                  Philadelphia Ledger</hi> was undecided as to whether the portrait was intended for <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_4944460">Daniel

            <p>950,000 of these with date 1892 were struck, and 4,052,105 with date 1893, making a total of 5,002,105 pieces in all, or $2,501,052.50 in value.
               The designs were by <name type="pname">C. E. Barber</name>, of the <name type="place">Philadelphia Mint</name>.</p>
            <p>The first specimen struck was sold at a substantial premium. The Remington Company purchased it for $10,000 and it <pb n="11"/> was presented to
               the new Columbian Museum (now the Field Museum of Natural History) in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name>. The 400th,
               1492nd and 1892nd pieces were reserved and were sold at high prices. The rest were offered to the public at one dollar each. Entirely too many of
               these pieces were struck, and at the close of the Exposition about 3,000,000 were still unsold— about 1,400,000 being in the Treasury at <name

               141,700 in the <name type="place">Philadelphia Mint</name>. This large remainder became the subject of discussion between the Exposition managers
               and Secretary of the Treasury Carlisle. The Fair managers did not care to have these pieces put into circulation as this would be manifestly
               unfair to those who had purchased them at one dollar each. Nevertheless, they were subsequently thrown into circulation at face value. Today they
               are the only souvenir coins that are in any way familiar to the average person.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">THE COLUMBIAN OR ISABELLA QUARTER-DOLLAR</hi>
            </head>
            <p>At a suggestion made to the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives by <name type="pname">Mrs. Potter Palmer</name> in January,
               1893, $10,000 of the appropriation for the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition was given in the form of souvenir silver
               quarter-dollars under the following Act of Congress: <q>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">March 3, 1893</hi>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sundry Civil Appropriation Law</hi>
               </q>
               <q>World's Columbian Commission; ... and ten thousand dollars of the appropriation for the Board of Lady Managers shall be paid in souvenir coins
                  of the denomination of twenty-five cents, and for that purpose there shall be coined at the. mints of the <name type="place">United
                     States</name> silver quarter dollars of the legal weight and fineness, not to exceed forty thousand pieces, the devices and designs upon
                  which shall be prescribed by the Director of the <name type="pname">Mint</name>, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and said
                  silver coins shall be manufactured from uncurrent sub- <pb n="13"/> sidiary silver coins now in the Treasury; and all provisions of law
                  relative to the coinage, legal-tender quality, and redemption of the present subsidiary silver coins shall be applicable to the coins herein
                  authorized to be issued.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This piece is our only souvenir quarter-dollar and was sold through the Board of Lady Managers at $1.00 each. It was about as much heralded in
               the press as the Columbian half-dollar, and on the whole the idea received favorable comment. The pieces were greeted with much criticism when
               issued, the more so when the beautiful work in design and sculpture at the Exposition itself was taken into consideration.</p>
            <p>In April, designs were submitted by the Treasury Department to the Board of Lady Managers. Two models of the obverse were sent, one with the
               profile of <name type="pname">Isabella</name> as a young queen (which was the one selected), and the other with the facing head of the mature
               queen. The reverse shows the kneeling figure of a woman holding a distaff, emblematic of woman's industry. The design first <pb n="14"/>
               considered was the Women s building at the Fair.</p>
            <p>The coinage was begun on June 13, 1893, and like the Columbian half-dollars, the first, 400th, 1492nd and 1892nd impressions were picked out, and
               certificates stating the facts were forwarded to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</name>. In all, 40,023 pieces were
               coined. It is reported that some pieces remained unsold at the close of the Exhibition. These pieces were not nearly so well known as the
               half-dollars.</p>

            </head>
            <p>In 1900, there was erected during the period of the Exposition in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name> a monument to General
                  <name type="pname">Lafayette</name>, the gift of the American people. About $50,000 of the funds needed were contributed by the pennies of the
               school children of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</name>. The planning, financing and erecting of this statue was
               undertaken by the <name type="pname">Lafayette</name> Memorial Commission. The statue itself was the work of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_24873594">Paul Bartlett</name>.</p>
            <p>In the early part of 1899 the Commission asked Congress to have its monument appropriation in the form of 100,000 souvenir half-dollars. This
               idea was soon changed to a silver dollar for a souvenir, and the <name type="pname">Lafayette</name> Souvenir Dollar came into being by the Act
               of March 3, 1899, as follows: <q>
                  <name type="pname">Lafayette</name> Monument: For the purpose of aiding in defraying the cost of a pedestal and completing in a suitable man-
                     <pb n="16"/> ner the work of erecting a monument in the <name type="place">city of Paris</name> to General <name type="pname"

                     type="place">United States in the Paris</name> Exposition of nineteen hundred, the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be, and is hereby,
                  authorized to purchase in the market twenty-five thousand dollars worth of silver bullion, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the
                  purpose herein provided for, from which there shall be coined at the mints of the <name type="place">United States</name> silver dollars of
                  legal weight and fineness to the number of fifty thousand pieces, to be known as the <name type="pname">Lafayette</name> dollar, struck in
                  commemoration of the erection of a monument to General <name type="pname">Lafayette</name>, in the <name type="place">city of Paris</name>,
                     <name type="place">France</name>, by the youth of the <name type="place">United States</name>, the devices and designs upon which coins
                  shall be prescribed by the Director of the <name type="pname">Mint</name>, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and all
                  provisions of law relative to coinage and legal-tender quality of the present silver dollars shall be applicable to the coins issued under
                  this act, and when so coined there is hereby appropriated from the Treasury the said fifty-thousand of souvenir dollars, and the Secretary of
                  the Treasury is authorized to place the same at the disposal of the <name type="pname">Lafayette</name> Memorial Commission, a commission
                  organized under the direction and authority of the Commissioner-General for the <name type="place">United <pb n="17"/> States</name> to the
                     <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name> Exposition of nineteen hundred.</q>
            </p>
            <p>According to the report of the Director of the <name type="pname">Mint</name> for 1900 the silver for this issue, consisting of 38,675,875 ounces
               of fine silver, was purchased in the open market for $23,032.80. This provided for the striking of 50,000 of those coins at the <name
                  type="place">Philadelphia Mint</name>. In all, 50,026 pieces were struck.</p>
            <p>These coins were to be sold for two dollars, and again there were comments in the papers about the ulterior motives of Congress in making the
               people pay.</p>
            <p>While the designs were in progress some difficulty arose over the date. The Commissioners desired the delivery of these pieces as soon as
               possible in 1899, and yet have the coins bear the date 1900. It was contrary to the practice of the mint to anticipate the dating of a coin. The
               difficulty was happily avoided by the wording on the coin, "Erected by the youth of the <name type="place">United States, Paris</name>, 1900."
               This date does not therefore refer to the year in which the coin was struck. The <pb n="18"/> coinage took place on December 14, 1899, the one
               hundredth anniversary of the death of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</name>. The first coin struck was forwarded to

            </p>
            <p>With the precedent set by the World's Columbian Exposition, the management of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, held at St. Louis, 1904,
               requested Congress to make part of the general appropriation of $5,000,000 into commemorative gold dollars, the issue to be limited to 250,000
               pieces. The special Act of Congress dated June 28, 1902, authorizing these pieces reads as follows: <q>That upon the approval of this act the
                  Secretary of the Treasury shall cause to be coined at the mints of the United States two hundred and fifty thousand gold dollars of legal
                  weight and fineness, to be known as the Louisiana Exposition gold dollar, struck in commemoration of said exposition. The exact words, devices
                  and designs upon said gold dollars shall be determined and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and all provisions of law relative to
                  the coinage <pb n="21"/> and legal-tender quality of all other gold coins shall be applicable to the coin issued under and in accordance with
                  the provisions of this act. And in payment of so much of the five million dollars appropriated by said act of March third, nineteen hundred
                  and one, to aid in carrying forward said Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay said two hundred and fifty
                  thousand gold dollars so coined as aforesaid to the said Louisiana Purchase Exposition Company, subject to all the provisions of said act,
                  except that payment of said gold dollars may be made at any time upon the request of said exposition company, and upon said company filing
                  with the Secretary of the Treasury a bond in a sum sufficient to protect the Government and satisfy him as to the future performance of all
                  the conditions under which said five million dollars so appropriated is to be paid to the said exposition company; ...</q>
            </p>
            <p>These pieces, the first of our souvenir coins to be struck in gold, were of the value of one dollar and were sold for three dollars each. They
               were especially adapted for mementoes, as regular gold dollars had not been struck since 1889 and for many years had been treated more as
               souvenirs and keep-sakes than <pb n="22"/> coins. There are two varieties—one with the head of <name type="pname">Thomas Jefferson</name>, the
               President, who made the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</name> purchase from <name type="place">France</name>; the
               other, with the head of the martyred President <name type="pname">McKinley</name>, who signed the bill giving the sanction of the Government to
               the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_4331987">Louisiana</name> Purchase Exposition. 125,000 of each variety were struck and deposited in the
               Sub-Treasury at <name type="place">St. Louis.</name> The dies were engraved by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_24873594">Charles E.
                  Barber</name> and are most excellent examples of die cutting. The <name type="pname">Jefferson portrait</name> was taken from an old mint
               medal engraved by <name type="pname">John Reich</name> who during the <name type="pname">Jefferson</name> period was employed at the Mint. The
                  <name type="pname">McKinley portrait</name> was taken from another medal for which the President gave special sittings.</p>
            <p>According to mint records, exactly 250,258 pieces were struck at the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania"
                  >Philadelphia</name> mint and 250 of this excess were later melted down. As on the Lafayette dollar, the date was partly an anticipated one as
               75,080 pieces were struck in 1902 and the remaining 175,178 were struck <pb n="23"/> early in the year following. All, however, bear the date
               1903.</p>
            <p>This issue did not attract public attention as did the previous commemorative issues, and it is safe to say that they are unknown to most people.
               Only about 35,000 out of 250,000 coins were sold and the remainder were destroyed about 1914—an undeserved fate considering the general
               excellence of the piece.</p>

            <p>The Act of Congress of April 12, 1904, authorizing these reads as follows: <q>An Act to authorize the Government of the <name type="place">United

            <p>Although the <name type="place">mint</name> records state that 60,069 pieces were struck—25,028 dated 1904, and 35,041 dated 1905, these figures
               do not tell the true story. Of the 25,000 struck in 1904, 10,000 were sold and 15,003 melted down at the San Francisco mint. 10,000 pieces dated
               1905 were struck at the <name type="place">Philadelphia mint</name> on order from the Fair management. This mint, prior to its summer closing,
               struck an additional 25,000 to meet possible orders and as none of these were needed subsequently, the entire 25,000 were melted. In other words,
               about 10,000 of <pb n="26"/> each date were distributed, and 40,000 of the 60,000 pieces were returned to the melting pot.</p>
            <p>The coins are unattractive and commonplace, having a portrait on each side. On account of the small size of the coin as well as the smallness of
               the heads, the portraits themselves are insignificant.</p>
            <p>Almost no notice of these pieces appeared in the press at the time and only one short account of them appeared in the numismatic journals, so

            <p>The issue included more denominations than had been made heretofore in connection with an exposition, so that this set of coins is the most

            <p>The fifty-dollar gold piece or five eagles was the work of <name type="pname">Robert Aitken.</name> It was issued in round and octagonal form.
               1510 of the former and 1509 of the latter shape were struck off, 3019 in all, during the months of June, July and August. A special hydraulic
               press used for striking medals at the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</name>
               <pb n="31"/> Mint was sent to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco</name> to do this work. The first coining took
               place before a number of notable guests on June 15, 1915, the octagonal variety only being coined. The first 29 "slugs" were struck by officials
               and guests, and the remainder of the first 100 pieces were struck off by the various employees of the mint. A very complete account of the
               ceremony is in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> for August, 1915.</p>
            <p>The description of the pieces is as follows:</p>

            <p>10. Same, but on round flan and with the dolphin omitted.</p>
            <p>Much disappointment was felt by critics and the Exposition authorities that the two shapes of the quintuple eagle were of identical design.
               Disappointment was also expressed that the design did not "rise to the occasion," especially with two such promising subjects as the old gold
               mining days and the completion of the Panama Canal. The often-heard criticism was that the artist in working out a purely American theme had
               borrowed from classical symbolism, and that the only thing American about the coin was the inscription.</p>
            <p>The quarter eagle or two-and-a-half-dollar gold piece was the work of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_24873594">Charles E. Barber</name> of the

            <p>Like the Lafayette dollar, this commemorative coin was issued to help defray the cost of erecting and endowing a memorial building at Niles,
               Ohio, the birthplace of the martyred President <name type="pname">William McKinley</name>. Congress aided this undertaking only to the extent of

               That the piece is commonplace in design is due to no fault of the artist, as the specifications were furnished him.</p>

                  >Philadelphia</name> mint, and were distributed from <pb n="44"/> the office of the Treasurer of the State at $1.00 each. The original
               intention was to have these pieces placed on sale at the Centennial Celebration at <name type="place">Portland</name>, but they were received too
               late to do so. At least 30,000 were sold fairly promptly. The balance held by the State Treasurer is slowly being distributed and it is claimed
               that less than 4000 were in the State Treasury in 1922. These may be had in small quantities at face value.</p>

            <p>The three hundredth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims was the occasion of ceremonies in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131"

            <p>In commemoration of this historic event in our history, a special half-dollar was struck and turned over to the Pilgrim Tercentenary Commission
               for distribution through the National Shawmut Bank of Boston. These were placed on the market at $1.00 each and bear dates of 1920 and 1921.</p>

               the "Mayflower." The coin met with a fair measure of praise, though objection was made to the vessel's flying a jib, a sail which had not come
               into use in 1620. The sail should have been the square water-sail hung under the bowsprit.</p>

               were carried on throughout the State in 1919 and 1920. The Centennial Commission decided it would be fitting to have a commemorative half-dollar
               struck. This was provided for by the Act of Congress, dated May 10, 1920: <q>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">An Act To</hi> authorize the coinage of 50-cent pieces in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of the admission

            </p>
            <p>Although Congress passed this Act at the same time that it passed the Act for the Maine Centennial coin, the Alabama pieces were not struck until
               the close of the year 1921, two years after the event it commemorated. The coin was designed by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_7296946">Mrs.

               <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, from suggestions by the Alabama Commission.</p>
            <p>The pieces were first put on sale at Birmingham, Alabama, on the morning of October 26, during the visit of President Harding to that city. They
               were later distributed by the various banks in the State at $1.00 each. The profit from the sale will be used for historic and monumental
               purposes. Although the Act called for 100,000 pieces but 70,000 were struck.</p>
            <p>As in the case of the Missouri half-dollar, there are two varieties. 6006 pieces were struck in October with the Saint <name type="pname"
                  >Andrew's Cross</name>, and the figure 22 back of the head of Governor <name type="pname">Kilby</name>. The St. <name type="pname">Andrew's
                  Cross</name> is the emblem on the Alabama State flag, which in turn was taken from the Confederate battle flag. The "22" connotes that <name

            <p>In December, 1921, 64,038 of these pieces without the special mark were struck at the mint.</p>

            <p>The chief celebrations were held in Ohio, the State in which General <name type="pname">Grant</name> was born. In 1921 an organization was
               incorporated in that State under the name of "The Ulysses <name type="pname">S. Grant</name> Centenary Memorial Association," to conduct
               appropriate celebrations in <name type="place">Clermont County</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</name>. It was also

            <p>The original bill called for 200,000 gold dollars, but it met with decided objections on the ground that too much gold would be drawn away from
               more useful purposes. Therefore 10,000 gold coins were authorized, and 250,000 silver half-dollars were added. Also the word "memorial" was
               substituted in the bill for "souvenir" in describing the coins.</p>
            <pb n="60"/>
            <p>The design, which is the same for both the gold dollar and the silver half-dollar, is the work of <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_7296946"
                  >Laura Gardin Fraser</name>, of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>. The mint at Philadelphia struck
               during March 10,016 of the gold dollars, and 100,061 of the half-dollars, and these were put on sale early in April, two months after the bill's
               passage.</p>
            <p>As with most of the previous issues of souvenir coins, the purpose is raising money. Not only is it regrettable that a single design was employed
               for the two denominations, but the precedent of creating minor varieties established for the Missouri and Alabama issues was adopted with the
               Grant coins. A small incuse star was placed on a limited number of the dollars and half-dollars to be sold at a further increased price, making |
               four varieties of coins instead of two. i In the case of the Missouri and Alabama coins, there was some meaning to the added symbols, but in this
               case there is apparently no significance. Had four stars been placed on it, they would at least have shown the rank of Grant as <pb n="61"/>
               General. The placing of the star on the half-dollar was not originally contemplated. It was brought about by a request for two varieties of
               half-dollars when the gold dollars were ordered. Five thousand of both the dollar and half-dollar were struck with the star impressions.</p>

            <p>The inscriptions on these coins make no direct reference to the purpose of their issue, the only instance of such an omission on our
               commemorative coins.</p>
            <p>It is likely that the coming years will see a continuation of the precedent established and recorded in the foregoing pages—that of striking a
               Memorial piece to celebrate the Centenary of each respective State into the Union. Consequently, our series of Commemorative coins will grow in
               size, and should develop in interest. It is to be hoped that the succeeding ones will improve on those which have gone before and, in some
               measure, free the series from the unavoidable criticism which has greeted so many of the issues which have already appeared.</p>
