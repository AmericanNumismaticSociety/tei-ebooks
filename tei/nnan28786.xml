            </head>
            <p>This is the third and unhappily the last of Dr. <persName>Ives'</persName> contributions to the literature of numismatics. His previous publications were a monograph on imitations of the English noble, published in 1941 as No. 93 in <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Notes and Monographs,</hi> and an article contributed to <hi rend="italic">Museum Notes</hi> in 1952 on the design of the Florentine florin as an aid to its dating. His main interest was that branch of comparative numismatics which involves the study of the spread and imitation of important commercial currencies, and his strength as a scholar lay in his talent for observing and analyzing the incidence of small details of design which could be used as evidence for classification and dating. It was only a short step from the florin to the ducat, and he had virtually completed the sketch for this monograph when he died suddenly on 13 November 1953.</p>
            <p>In the previous summer, on the eve of his last visit to Europe, Dr. <persName>Ives</persName> asked me to read his rough draft and discuss it with him. Since he was one of the most modest of scholars, he always assumed that others were likely to know more about a subject than he did himself. The book seemed to me to fulfil very adequately the purposes he had in mind, and beyond urging that certain sections required expansion, I had not many suggestions to make.</p>
            <p>Dr. <persName>Ives</persName> returned from Europe with some fresh material, but had scarcely begun the revision of the text and notes for the printer before he died. I was asked by The American Numismatic Society to complete the work, and was only too happy to perform this service to the memory of a distinguished collector and scholar. I first met Dr. <persName>Ives</persName> when he
<pb n="viii"/>
was visiting England in 1951. We subsequently corresponded on problems of later medieval coinage, and he showed me every kindness when I was in <placeName>New York</placeName> for the first time in 1953.</p>
            <p>The manuscript of the book, in the form in which it reached me, consisted of the text as I had originally seen it, accompanied by rather sketchy notes and partially mounted plates. Full indications were available as to how Dr. <persName>Ives</persName> intended to complete the latter.</p>
            <p>The text as printed here is basically as Dr. <persName>Ives</persName> left it, but I have systematized the spelling of proper names, checked the dates and cross-references, and added sections on points which I had discussed with him and on which I knew he intended to work. I have not called attention to small changes I have made in his wording, whether for literary reasons or in correcting trivial errors of fact, but I have put all substantial additions of my own in brackets. This does not apply to the footnotes, which are almost entirely my work, since I had only rough jottings regarding his chief authorities and few references in detail. The general plan of the plates is that devised by Dr. <persName>Ives</persName>, but some have had to be slightly adjusted either to include additional material or to utilize more satisfactorily the space available.</p>
            <p>The majority of the coins illustrated formed part of Dr. <persName>Ives</persName>' own splendid collection and are now in the possession of The American Numismatic Society. I am indebted to the keepers of the coins in the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum for permission to publish several specimens in their respective collections, and to Sig. Tommaso Bertel√® for sending me a photograph and description of a coin die in his possession and giving me permission to include it here.</p>

            </head>
            <p>In the second half of the thirteenth century two important gold coins were introduced in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>, the florin of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName> (1252) and the ducat or zecchino of Venice (1284). Of virtually the same size and value, and of high purity, these coins were issued, with little change in design, for a period of several centuries: in the case of the florin, up to 1533, after the institution of <persName>Alessandro de Medici</persName> as first Grand Duke of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3165361">Tuscany</placeName>; in the case of the ducat, up to the suppression of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q4948">Venetian Republic</placeName> by the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797 and even beyond, into the nineteenth century. Both had a wide circulation<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> and were extensively imitated, but the imitations followed a somewhat different course in the two cases.</p>
            <p>The florins of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName> were copied almost exclusively in western Europe: in Germany, the Low Countries, France and Aragon, where over a hundred rulers, states, and cities issued florins bearing the lily for obverse, and St. John the Baptist as reverse, with the FLORENTIA of the original replaced by FRANCIA, FLAD, or other identifying place or ruler's name. These florin imitations flourished in the fourteenth century, but had practically ceased by 1400 except in Aragon, where they persisted well into the fifteenth century. The goldgulden, derived from the florin, lasted longer, but with the lily and <persName>St. John</persName> superseded by other types. The
<pb n="2"/>
florin imitations have been very fully listed and described by <persName>Dannenberg</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>

                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> and others.</p>
            <p>The imitations of the Venetian ducat, in contrast to those of the florin, were produced almost entirely in regions south and east of Venice :<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> in the eastern Mediterranean, the Levant, and out as far as <placeName corresp="#geonames_1269750">India</placeName>. Unlike the florin imitations they were not a phenomenon of a few decades, but continued during the whole period of the ducat, that is, up until the nineteenth century. It is the purpose of this essay to give an account of the spread of these ducat imitations, which it has heretofore been possible to comprehend only by consulting widely scattered sources.</p>
            <p>[It must be remembered that imitations of the ducat throw light on only one aspect of its influence. The weight and intrinsic quality of the coin were as important as its external appearance, and the manner in which it was taken as a model by rulers who in the fifteenth century were reforming or creating a gold coinage is most revealing. This was equally true of the Christian west and the Muslim east. <persName corresp="#viaf_290606108">Afonso V</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2264397">Portugal</placeName>, establishing in 1457 the new cruzado
<pb n="3"/>
with the guinea gold which Portugese exploration of the coast of <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729885">west Africa</placeName> was for the first time bringing to his kingdom, made this coin of the weight and fineness of the ducat,<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> and Ferdinand and Isabella, in carrying out their great monetary reform by the Pragmatic of Medina del Campo of 13 June 1497, took the value of the ducat as that which their excelente should follow.<ref target="#CH1-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> In the early years of the century, when the Venetian ducat circulated in great quantities in Egypt under the name of <hi rend="italic">ƒ´franty,</hi> the Mamluk ruler An-NƒÅ·π£ƒ´r Faraj (1399‚Äì1412) made his new gold coin, called after him the <hi rend="italic">nƒÅsery,</hi> identical in weight with the ducat,<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> and so a few years later did Al-Ashraf (1422‚Äì38),<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref>
               <pb n="4"/>
while even <persName>Muhammad</persName> the Conqueror took the ducat as the standard for his <hi rend="italic">altun,</hi> the gold coin of the Ottoman Empire, struck for the first time in 1478.<ref target="#CH1-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Equally significant is the way in which during the fifteenth century the word <hi rend="italic">ducat</hi> came to displace <hi rend="italic">florin</hi> as the common expression for a gold coin. To a writer of the fourteenth century, every gold coin was a "florin" of some particular-sort, even if it bore no physical resemblance to the Italian coin and was of quite a different weight. The French masse d'or was a <hi rend="italic">florenus ad sceptrum,</hi> the chaise d'or a <hi rend="italic">florenus ad cathedram,</hi> and so on. But in the fifteenth century the common word was ducat; people spoke of ducats of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q39193">Bohemia</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_719819">Hungary</placeName>, and in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2750405">Holland</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, and even in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName> itself, the florin was termed "ducat of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName>."<ref target="#CH1-n10">
                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> The fundamental reason for the change was the fact that the Venetian coin had been so little copied in <placeName corresp="#geonames_9408659">western Europe</placeName>. The Florentine florin had been widely imitated, many of these imitations were seriously debased, and the bad reputation they earned reflected quite unjustifiably upon their prototype.]</p>

               <p>The relatively small circulation of the Venetian ducat in <placeName>northern Europe</placeName> is reflected in the composition of the Bretzenheim hoard. Of the 1005 coins it contained, 451 were Florentine florins, 549 were florin imitations or derivatives, and only 5 were Venetian ducats.

Num.,</hi> 4th series, I (1897), 373‚Äì81, 494‚Äì508. The esteem in which the ducat was held was due to its uniformity of weight as much as to its purity, the gold coins of the Mamluks in the fourteenth century being struck to no weight standard at all. The appearance of the ducat in quantity in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName> is stated by a contemporary historian to date from about 1388, but seems to have been earlier, since the Florentine Niccol√≤ Frescobaldi found it in common use in Cairo in 1384. An-NƒÅ·π£ƒ´r Faraj's predecessor Saif-ed-dƒ´n (1382‚Äì99) attempted to drive it out of circulation by reviving the old dinar of traditional weight, but had no success. Although the <hi rend="italic">nƒÅsery</hi> was of the same weight as the ducat, it was not of such fine gold and so was valued at less (Raug√© van Gennep, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, 499‚Äì501).</p>

            <p>The ducat of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName> was struck in pure gold, of weight 3.56 gm.;<ref target="#CH1-n12">
                  <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
               </ref> its diameter was at first 20 mm., but increased later to about 21 mm. The uniform design, which varied only in small details through the centuries, is illustrated by the large, infrequently struck ten-ducat piece shown in <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 1. The obverse displays <persName>St. Mark</persName> standing at the left; at the right the doge kneeling, holding a staff or banner, alongside which is the word DVX. The inscription around the border is the doge's name to right, and to left <persName>S. M. VENET</persName>(VS or I). On the reverse is the figure of Christ, surrounded by stars, in a pointed oval technically known as a mandorla. The legend is SIT.T.XPE.DAT. Q. TV.REGIS.ISTE.DVCAT <hi rend="italic">(Sit tibi Christe datus, quem tu regis, isle ducatus,</hi> 'Let this duchy which thou rulest be dedicated to thee, O Christ'.)</p>
            <p>[According to most works of reference, the name of the coin is derived from the last word of the legend. This is a
<pb n="6"/>
popular derivation which is not correct. The word ducat was first applied to the silver grossi of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n13">
                  <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
               </ref> coined from 1202 onwards, on which no such legend occurs, and when the new gold coins came into existence eighty years later they were called <hi rend="italic">ducati auri,</hi> to distinguish them from the current <hi rend="italic">ducati argenti,</hi> and ultimately the word "ducat" came to be applied solely to the gold coins. The evolution was precisely similar to that of the word "florin," which was used first of silver coins of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName> and subsequently of the <hi rend="italic">fiorini d'oro,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fiorini</hi> for short. The word ducat originally meant the silver coins struck by <persName>Roger II</persName> (1102‚Äì54) and <persName>William I</persName> (1154‚Äì66) of Sicily from 1140 onwards for the duchy of Apulia, and their name <hi rend="italic">(ducatus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ducalis)</hi> came from the <hi rend="italic">ducatus Apuliae.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH1-n14">
                  <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
               </ref> It was presumably applied to the Venetian ducat because of a general resemblance in design,<ref target="#CH1-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref> and because no other word existed at that time to denote a silver coin of higher value then a penny.]</p>
            <p>Various changes in design occur, in the character of the doge's cap, in the lettering, in the disposition of the figure of Christ and the nimbus in the oval, in the number and arrangement of the stars. These changes, which often offer a means of identifying the prototype of an imitation, are
<pb n="7"/>
exhibited, with descriptive notes, on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plates</hi> II to VI, alongside the complete list of doges. [The changes are not always exactly coterminous with the rule of the doges indicated, for there was a certain amount of overlap between some of the types, and particular details, such as the presence or absence of a beard on the doges of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, evidently depended upon the actual appearance of individual sovereigns. There are also occasionally quite inexplicable variations from the normal type. A ducat of <persName corresp="#viaf_2823619">Andrea Dandolo</persName> (1344‚Äì54) in the collection of <persName corresp="#viaf_41840969">Philip Grierson</persName> has the cruciform nimbus of Christ on the reverse replaced by a nimbus containing three small crosses, one above and one on either side of the head. In every other respect it is quite normal (wt. 3.51 g.), and there is no doubt that it is a product of the Venetian mint.]</p>
            <p>The method of coining the ducats was not changed throughout their history; they were all hammered coins, with the exception of a milled pattern (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI,2) made under <orgName type="ethnic">Austrian</orgName> rule with the name of <persName>Francis II.</persName> [The earliest ducats had their dies adjusted ‚Üë‚Üì or more rarely ‚Üë‚Üë, this practice, which was very unusual in the middle ages in the West, being no doubt derived from Byzantium.<ref target="#CH1-n16">
                  <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
               </ref> In the second half of the fourteenth century this regularity was abandoned, but it seems to have been revived in the fifteenth century, at least so far as the majority of the coins were concerned, though irregularity is found from time to time in every reign.</p>
            <p>The issue of the ducats did not end with the dissolution of the Venetian Republic in 1797, though it is not easy to discover exactly how much longer their minting continued. Coins in the name of the last doge, <persName corresp="#viaf_71422333">Lodovico Manin</persName> (1789‚Äì97),
<pb n="8"/>
are believed to have been struck down to 1823,<ref target="#CH1-n17">
                  <hi rend="sup">17</hi>

               <p>The order of the Grand Council of 31 October 1284 which created the ducat prescribed that it should be "tam bona et fina per aurum vel melior ut est florenus" (Papadopoli, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> I, 123). Authors like Pegolotti regularly take it as being 24 carat gold, and modern assays have found it to be 997/1000 fine <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.,</hi> p. 124). The coin was struck at 67 to the mark of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>. This has been variously estimated at between 237.52 g. and 238.453 g.; at the latter figure the weight of the ducat works out at 5.559 g.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
               </ref> in the fourteenth and early fifteenth century.<ref target="#CH2-n23">

            <p>[These ducats are usually dated 1350‚Äì1439.<ref target="#CH2-n24">

scribes the ducat of Pope Eugenius IV bearing his arms, which replaced the ducat of Venetian type, as a <hi rend="italic">ducato nuovo.</hi> The date of origin is based on the assumption that the ducats were first issued on the occasion of the Papal Jubilee of 1350, since it was on this occasion that the Sudario, the cloth showing the face of the Saviour, was exhibited in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3169070">Rome</placeName> and first came into prominence, and the Sudario is very frequently used as a symbol in the legends of the ducats. Such reasoning does not exclude the possibility of some of the ducats being earlier than 1350, and we have good evidence that they were, for the Florentine merchant Pegolotti, writing <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1340, includes <hi rend="italic">romanini d'oro a carati 23 e</hi> ¬æ, which can only mean these ducats, in the list of gold coins current in his day.<ref target="#CH2-n25">

               </ref> They did not yet exist in 1317, since the chapters relating to coinage in the <hi rend="italic">Statuti dei Mercanti di Roma</hi> of this year refer only to money of silver and billon.<ref target="#CH2-n26">

               </ref> in the history of the senatorial ducat are illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi>VII. They differ according to the obverse legend. The first is that closest to the Venetian original, with S. PETRVS (corresponding to <persName>S. M.

The second series is identical with the first save that SEN reads
<pb n="11"/>
vertically upwards, making the sequence <persName>ATOR.VRBIS</persName> a more natural one. The third continues this arrangement, but S. PETRVS now reads outwardly upwards, following the circumference of the coin. Within these broad divisions there are many varieties of moneyer's or issue marks (crossed keys, Sudario, Moor's head, rose, etc.), some of which are also found on silver coins which bear the names of individual popes and thus allow groups of ducats on which they occur to be given an approximate date.<ref target="#CH2-n28">

            <p>These coins were followed by the regular papal coinage of ducats, retaining the old size and weight but with designs in which all traces of the Venetian type are lost.

The bestowal of the keys was an obvious theme on a papal coin, and the design is one of a remarkable series of novel types produced towards the middle of the fifteenth century by an enterprising and talented moneyer and die-engraver, Miliano Orfini of Foligno, who worked for a number of years in the papal mint.<ref target="#CH2-n29">

            <p>The existence of this Roman series of imitation ducats is at first sight an anomaly, since the only other large group of Venetian imitations was situated in the eastern Mediterranean area, and there is no reason to suppose that Venetian

coinage was particularly important in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3169070">Rome</placeName>. The most likely explanation is that since the economic life of the city revolved around the financial operations of the papal curia and the entertainment of visitors, in either case being concerned with the subjects of every European state, it was desirable to have a gold coinage which approximated in value and appearance to one or other of the best known coinages of the day. The florin was out of the question, for the Roman mint was largely controlled and administered by Florentines, and the magistrates of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName> took strong exception to the imitation of the coins of their city and endeavored to prevent it where they could. If the florin could not be imitated, the Venetian ducat was the next best thing, and the moneyers had no scruples in making the resemblance as close as they reasonably could.]</p>

               <p>Though the coins are called "senatorial" because they refer to the Senate and not to the Pope, they were issued by the city authorities with papal approbation, and after the return of the popes to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3169070">Rome</placeName> from their sojourn at Avignon there was only a single mint in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3169070">Rome</placeName> striking both "papal" and "senatorial" coins.

               <hi rend="bold">III OTHER WESTERN EUROPEAN IMITATIONS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The further imitations of the Venetian ducat in <placeName corresp="#geonames_9408659">western Europe</placeName> are, unlike the copies of the Florentine florin, relatively few, and never occur far afield from <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>. No considerable coinages took place, and specimens of such as exist are rare.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176219">Genoa</placeName>, the great maritime rival of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>, adopted the type of standing saint and kneeling ruler in the middle of the sixteenth century for some of its silver coinage, but not for any extensive gold coinage. There occurs, however, a gold ducat (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 1)closely resembling the Venetian piece, with obverse inscription DVX.ET.GVB REIP.GEN and reverse inscription DEO.OPT.MAX.GLO. This ducat, in the former King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</placeName>'s collection,<ref target="#CH3-n30">
                  <hi rend="sup">30</hi>
               </ref> is not listed in any of the principal works on the coinage of Genoa, and should perhaps be classed as a pattern, [though the only recorded specimen shows considerable signs of wear. Its style, and the fact that a similar Venetian type was introduced on the silver testone in 1554, permits us to assign it to the mid-sixteenth century.]</p>
            <p>In the same category of pattern is to be placed a unique silver piece of Duke Ferdinand Gonzaga of Mantua (1612‚Äì26), illustrated on Plate VIII, 2, which shows <persName>St. Andrew</persName> standing, holding a long cross and a monstrance, with the kneeling and bare-headed duke to the right.<ref target="#CH3-n31">
                  <hi rend="sup">31</hi>
               </ref> The obverse inscription
<pb n="14"/>
is FER. D. G. DVX. MAN. VI. E. M. F. with IIII, i. e., his number as duke of Montferrat (MF) beneath. On the reverse is the figure of the Virgin in a mandorla surrounded by the inscription PRAESIDIVM NOSTRVM.</p>
            <p>Belonging also to the group of imitations of the Venetian ducat is the piece issued by Amadeus VIII of Savoy (1416‚Äì39)<ref target="#CH3-n32">
                  <hi rend="sup">32</hi>
               </ref> shown on Plate VIII, 3, which, however, illustrates the breaking away from the design of the prototype which is common in imitative coinages and which will be seen again in the coins of Malta. In this case the reverse shows instead of the figure of Christ the arms of Savoy. The obverse has the standing saint and the kneeling ruler, but the <persName>saint (Maurice)</persName> is a figure in armor. The inscriptions are AMADEVS.DVX.SABAVDIE and SIT.NOM.DIN (<hi rend="italic">sic)</hi> BN. DTM <hi rend="italic">(sit nomen Domini benedictum).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next two continental European imitations to be noted are of interest as being the most northerly excursions of the Venetian type. The first is the ducat issued by the principality of Dombes in Burgundy in the seventeenth century. This (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 5) has the type of <persName>St. Mark</persName> and the kneeling ruler, with DVX alongside the standard. The inscription is FRANC. PRINC on the right and SM TREVO upwards on the left. On the reverse the inscription is SIT XI ADIVTO REGIS TE DOMBA.</p>
            <p>[These ducats were first ascribed by numismatists to <persName>Francis II</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3021220">Dombes</placeName> (1582‚Äì92), as the name FRANC seemed to imply. But the design of the reverse, with stars above and below the figure of Christ, corresponds to that of Venetian ducats of the mid-seventeenth century, and it is now agreed that they must be assigned to <persName corresp="#viaf_76337397">Anne Marie Louise</persName> de Montpensier, princess of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3021220">Dombes</placeName> (1650‚Äì93). <persName>Boucher d'Argis,</persName> who was a member of the sovereign council of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3021220">Dombes</placeName> and had
<pb n="15"/>
access to its records, wrote of the exploitation of the right of coinage by the mint of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3021220">Dombes</placeName> during her reign:
<q>Mademoiselle de Montpensier fit travailler longtemps √† la monnaie de Tr√©voux; on y fabriqua des pi√®ces de 15, 30 et 60 sols, mais surtout beau-coup de pi√®ces de cinq sols dont il se fit un grand commerce dans le Levant et des sequins d'or au coin de saint Marc. Les V√©nitiens s'en plaignirent hautement; mais la souveraine de <placeName corresp="#geonames_3021220">Dombes</placeName> leur r√©pondit que saint Marc √©tait le patron de Tr√©voux comme il l'est de Venise.</q>
The name FRANC was used to preserve the resemblance to the Venetian coins, on none of which the name <hi rend="italic">Marie</hi> appears, and was probably specifically intended to recall the ducats of Francesco Erizzo (1631‚Äì46), FRANC <hi rend="italic">(iae)</hi> PRINC <hi rend="italic">(eps</hi> or <hi rend="italic">essa)</hi> being not very remote from FRANC.ERIZZO.<ref target="#CH3-n33">
                  <hi rend="sup">33</hi>
               </ref>]</p>
            <p>Of the same period are the ducats issued in 1650‚Äì72 and 1679‚Äì86 by <persName>William Henry</persName>, Prince of Orange and later <persName>William III</persName> of England (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 6),bearing for obverse inscription GVIL.HENR.D on the right, and on the left, reading vertically upwards, GPRAV.E.S. The reverse legend reads SOLI.DEO.HONOR.SIT.GLORIA.<ref target="#CH3-n34">
                  <hi rend="sup">34</hi>
               </ref> These, like the
<pb n="16"/>
ducats of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3021220">Dombes</placeName>, were issued for the Levant trade. In both of these ducats a V of the obverse inscription is arranged to fall in the position of the V in the <persName>S. M. VENETI</persName> of the prototype, so that on casual inspection the piece would appear to be a Venetian ducat.</p>
            <p>The last European ducat imitation to be noted is of peculiar interest because it was issued in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176959">Florence</placeName>, whose florin was for centuries the chief rival of the Venetian ducat. It was not an official issue, but was put out in 1805 as a commercial venture for use in the Levant. It bears on the obverse a standing saint and a kneeling bishop holding a crozier; the inscription is S. M. FLOR. <persName>D. ZEN</persName>. E.P.F. (i. e. <hi rend="italic">Divus Zenobio episcopus Florentiae).</hi> To the left of the crozier, reading vertically downwards, is AL‚àÄX. On the reverse, surrounding the figure of <persName>St. John</persName> in a mandorla, is the inscription S. IOAN. BAPT. F. ZACHAR (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, 7). [These ducats, which were known as <hi rend="italic">Zenobini</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Zanobini,</hi> were struck at the Tuscan mint for a banker named Cesare Lampronti, and were made deliberately crude in style so as to resemble more closely the last coinages of Lodovico Manin. The venture was not a success and many of the coins were withdrawn and remelted, which accounts for their present rarity.<ref target="#CH3-n35">

               <p>The first gold ducat was struck by Dieudonn√© de Gozon (1346‚Äì53), with the obverse of the Venetian type: the Grand

Master kneeling, receiving a banner from the hands of <persName>St. John</persName> the Baptist. The reverse has the distinctive design of an angel seated on the tomb of Christ. The obverse legends are S. IOhES.B vertically downwards on the left, MGR <hi rend="italic">(Magister)</hi> vertically downwards in the center, and F<hi rend="italic">(rater)</hi> DEODAT downwards on the right. The reverse legend is +hOSPITALIS QVENT.RODI, the Q being an abbreviation mark for <hi rend="italic">con,</hi> so that QVENT stands for <hi rend="italic">conventus.</hi> This type was also struck by the next Master, Pierre de Cornillan (1354‚Äì55).</p>
               <p>The next appearance of the ducat is under Antoine Fluvian (1421‚Äì37), who issued extremely close imitations of the Venetian coin, with the inscription <persName>S.M.VENET</persName> and DVX, differing only in the name of the "doge," <persName>F.ANTONIVS</persName>. These pieces were protested by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>, and the Grand Master issued a second series on which the reference to <persName>St. Mark</persName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName> was replaced by one to <persName>St. John</persName> the Baptist and MRO was sometimes substituted for DVX. The next ducats known, those of Jacques de Milly (1454‚Äì61), followed essentially the same pattern, with the reverse of the Venetian ducat, and on the obverse the kneeling Grand Master, bareheaded, with the cross of the Order on the shoulder of his robe, and the name of <persName>St. John</persName> instead of <persName>St. Mark</persName>.</p>
               <p>The ducats of the last six Grand Masters at Rhodes, from Jean Ursino (1467‚Äì76) to Philippe Villiers de l'Isle d'Adam (1521‚Äì22), are close copies of the Venetian ducat (including the doge's cap), differing only in the obverse inscription. This has F<hi rend="italic">(rater)</hi> and the Master's name on the right, S. IOhANIS to the left, and, in place of DVX alongside the staff, M.P. <hi rend="italic">(magister Petrus)</hi> or another Master's initial. The introduction of the exergual line at about 1500 in the Venetian ducat is reflected in the ducat of Emery d'Amboise (1503‚Äì12).</p>

               <p>The coinage of ducats by the Knights of <persName>St. John</persName>, interrupted by the expulsion of the Order from Rhodes in <hi rend="bold">1522,</hi>was resumed at Malta after 1534with pieces still closely copying the contemporary Venetian designs. Certain changes, however, were made at this time, to continue for nearly a century. The obverse inscription no longer mentions <persName>St. John</persName>, but gives the name of the Grand Master in full, around the circumference of the coin. In the case of one ruler, Jean d'Hom√®des (1536‚Äì53), the date appears beneath the exergual line. The reverse design is still Christ surrounded by stars in a mandorla, but the inscription is changed to DA ‚Ä¢MIHI‚Ä¢VIRTVTEM‚Ä¢CONTRA‚Ä¢HOSTES‚Ä¢TVOS.</p>
               <p>Early in the seventeenth century, with <persName>Antoine de Paule</persName> (1623‚Äì36), the kneeling Grand Master again begins to be represented bare-headed, and <persName>St. John</persName> is depicted in a short skirt.</p>
               <p>At the end of the seventeenth century a major change of design was introduced with the abandonment of the figure of Christ on the reverse in favor of the arms of the Grand Master, and the date reappears. Under the two Grand Masters issuing these pieces, Gr√©goire Caraffa (1680‚Äì90) and Adrien de Wignacourt (1690‚Äì97), there were also struck four-ducat pieces of the same general style (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> I, 2), on which, however, the kneeling figure on the obverse is no longer robed, but appears in contemporary costume.</p>
               <p>Under the last three rulers who issued ducats of the Venetian type (1697‚Äì1736) the obverse figures are again changed. <persName>St. John</persName> appears in a tattered costume, the Grand Master in ornamental knee-breeches, and the staff carries a large flag bearing a cross. The inscription is VINCES PIETATE. On
<pb n="21"/>
the reverse appear the arms of the Grand Master with his name and title.</p>
               <p>This series ended in 1725. After it the ducat continued for a time as a monetary denomination, but with the portrait of the Grand Master on the obverse, thus losing all resemblance to the Venetian coin so long imitated.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">V OTHER EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN IMITATIONS</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Concurrently with the coinage of ducats by the Knights of <persName>St. John</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_281184">Jerusalem</placeName> and with the wide circulation of the Venetian ducat in the Latin kingdoms and principalities of the eastern Mediterranean, there occurred a number of imitative coinages in that region. The ducats in this category are all close imitations of the Venetian type, with the substitution of local rulers' names for those of the doges and other saints for <persName>St. Mark</persName>. They are frequently of base gold and crude workmanship.</p>
            <p>The most complete series of these pieces was issued on the island of Chios,<ref target="#CH5-n38">
                  <hi rend="sup">38</hi>
               </ref> under <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176219">Genoa</placeName>, starting with the coinage of Tommaso di Campofregoso (1415‚Äì21), which bears the obverse inscription T.DVX.IANVE and S. LAVRET (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 1).<ref target="#CH5-n39">

               </ref> After 1436until 1443 <persName>Tommaso di Campofregoso</persName> again coined ducats, and the series is continued by five Campofregosi until 1458, with a return to <persName>St. Laurence</persName> as the patron saint. In this period the staff for the standard commonly rests on a large S for <hi rend="italic">Sius,</hi> one of the ways in which the name of the island was spelled (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 3). The last of this series is a ducat issued in 1458‚Äì61 by <persName>Charles VII</persName> of France during his rule at <placeName corresp="#geonames_3176219">Genoa</placeName>, with CLI in place of DVX alongside the standard, and COMVN.IAN and S. LAVRETI for inscription (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 4). [The initial L of <hi rend="italic">Laureti</hi> is written like a V to recall the word <hi rend="italic">Veneti</hi>.]</p>
            <p>To be included in the Chios series also are the ducats issued by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName> under the doge Leonardo Loredan (1501‚Äì21) which were known as Scioti and were intended for the Levant (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XI, 5)<ref target="#CH5-n41">

               </ref>. They are of rather crude workmanship, with the obverse inscription entirely encircling the figures.</p>
            <p>In this same general category are the ducats coined for the island of Mytilene by its rulers, the Gattilusi, between 1376 and 1462, with the ruler's name and D. METELI[NI] (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII, 2‚Äì3).<ref target="#CH5-n42">

            </head>
            <p>The Venetian ducat circulated widely in the eastern Mediterranean or Levant; this we know from the written records,<ref target="#CH6-n46">
                  <hi rend="sup">46</hi>
               </ref> and it is confirmed by the frequent occurrence of ducats with a Turkish counterstamp (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 1) meaning "standard" or "genuine."<ref target="#CH6-n47">
                  <hi rend="sup">47</hi>
               </ref> In addition to the Venetian and other "official" issues of Rhodes, Malta, Chios, etc., there was a very wide circulation of imitations, often of poor workmanship, with jumbled or illegible inscriptions, of metal of varying degrees of baseness. These can only be attributed to a place of origin if their provenance happens to be known; usually they are merely described as "Levantine imitations." A few selected specimens are shown in <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII, which together with the impressions from dies described in Sec-
<pb n="26"/>
tion VIII and shown on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI will serve to illustrate the whole series.</p>
            <p>[The first and second specimens are imitations of ducats of Andrea Dandolo (1344‚Äì54), the legends in both cases being perfectly recognizable. The first of the two is of the same size and style as the original, and clearly a contemporary imitation. They are fairly common,<ref target="#CH6-n48">
                  <hi rend="sup">48</hi>
               </ref> and it is probable that one of their chief centers of manufacture was in Chios. The second coin, which belongs to the class ascribed conjecturally to <persName>Robert</persName> of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q107426">Anjou</placeName>, is of silver and of good style, though the legend is badly blundered. It was no doubt originally gilded, and the spread fabric, which makes it decidedly larger than the normal ducat, was necessary in order to bring it up to full ducat weight.]</p>
            <p>The third specimen is typical of very large numbers with semi-legible inscriptions cut by illiterate engravers. In this case the character of the doge's cap, the occurrence of the exergual line, and the nimbus of Christ projecting beyond the oval, date the prototype as of about 1500, but the doge's name cannot be deciphered or identified with any doge of this period. Other specimens of this kind can be identified by their more legible inscriptions as copies of doges through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<ref target="#CH6-n49">

            <p>The fourth specimen is of extreme crudity in the rendering of the figures, and the inscription can be recognized as a bungled PAVL.RAINER (1779‚Äì89). [No. 5 is an imitation of some unidentifiable eighteenth century doge, but its aberrent weight (2.95 g.) makes one suspect that it is a trinket made by a jeweller and was not intended as a coin at all.</p>
            <pb n="27"/>
            <p>No. 6 is a nineteenth century imitation of a ducat of the last doge, Lodovico Manin (1789‚Äì97). The counterstamp is of a type which during the past half-century has, at least in theory, been placed on all gold objects passing through the hands of goldsmiths in <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. It has three panels: the left one contains the fineness, the center one the name of King Faruk, and the third Roman or Arabic letters indicating the date. The more usual occupant of the central panel is an ibis, the international goldsmith's symbol for <placeName corresp="#geonames_357994">Egypt</placeName>. In this particular case the fineness is 21 carats and the date letter is Ã°, which represents a period running from 11 February 1951 to 8 January 1953.<ref target="#CH6-n50">

            <p>The last two coins illustrated belong to a different class. No. 7 is an imitation ducat of Marino Falier (1354‚Äì5). This doge ruled for only seven months, and his short reign makes his ducats among the rarest in the Venetian series. It is in the highest degree improbable that they would have been imitated in the Levant, and it seems likely that this piece is a crude modern forgery produced with the interests of the collector in mind.<ref target="#CH6-n51">

               </ref>]</p>
            <p>The final specimen, No. 8, is of peculiar interest in the domain of imitations, because it copies not one current gold piece but two. It is of base gold and scyphate, like the later Byzantine nomismata, and the obverse type is that of two standing figures clearly derived from Byzantine models; the figures in fact closely resemble those appearing on the coins of such twelfth century sovereigns as <persName>Manuel I</persName> (1143‚Äì80) and <persName>Isaac II</persName> (1185‚Äì1204). The inscription is Greek in appearance,
<pb n="28"/>
but quite meaningless. The reverse type is the figure of Christ in a mandorla, surrounded by stars, with a blundered inscription. From the fact that the stars completely surround the figure, it is evident that the prototype for this coin was of the seventeenth century or later. [The piece came from <placeName corresp="#geonames_146669">Cyprus</placeName>, and its abnormal type and weight (3.75 g.) suggest that it is a jeweller's ornament and not a coin.]</p>

Two such pieces are shown on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV, 1, 2. They are well struck, of good workmanship, but both figures and inscriptions are mere caricatures of the originals.

The inscription is <graphic url="NNM128_042.jpg"/> MEI, which is obviously a degraded ALOY.MOCEN S.M. VENETI; alongside the staff are the letters OCY. On the reverse the figure of Christ in the pointed oval has become a device resembling an inverted anchor; the inscription is ‚Ä¢DIOESIMIVOœΩ A–òIV‚àÉOATOV, in perfectly clear well-cut letters, defying interpretation.<ref target="#CH8-n59">

            </head>
            <p>Interesting evidence regarding the places of origin of ducat imitations is furnished by dies which have been discovered and recorded from time to time. The first to be noted is a die described in the <hi rend="italic">Indian Antiquary</hi> for 1873.<ref target="#CH9-n60">
                  <hi rend="sup">60</hi>
               </ref> This die, which is of bronze, was found at <placeName corresp="#geonames_1253805">Umreth,</placeName> a town in the Kaira Zilla, north of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1275339">Bombay</placeName>, and after cleaning yielded the inked impression shown on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 1. The figures are fairly close copies of the standard Venetian type; the inscriptions are blundered, but that of the obverse is recognizable as one of the doges named <persName>Alvise Mocenigo</persName>. The date of fabrication of the die is not known, but, from the name of the doge it must be of the eighteenth or nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>The second die is described and illustrated in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Chronicle</hi> for 1952,<ref target="#CH9-n61">
                  <hi rend="sup">61</hi>
               </ref> and an impression from it is shown on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 2. In this the figures are of poor workmanship and the inscriptions somewhat blundered, but recognizable as those of <persName corresp="#viaf_71422333">Lodovico Manin</persName>, the last doge of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>. The die was found in the region of the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q20642458">Persian Gulf.</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>The third die to be noted is in the possession of the American Numismatic Society, which secured it from a visitor who
<pb n="34"/>
bought it in the bazaar at <placeName corresp="#geonames_170654">Damascus</placeName>. The die, of bronze, is illustrated on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 3 and an impression from it is shown on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 4.The figures are of neat but barbaric workmanship; the inscriptions are meaningless, but obviously blundered from those of a ducat of Paolo Renier (1779‚Äì89). The similarity of this impression to certain of the imitations shown in <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIII is quite close.</p>
            <p>[These three dies are of the traditional medieval type, being simply bars or blocks of metal which in striking would be aligned by the eye of the workman without further mechanical aid.

               </ref> It consists of two blocks of iron into which steel dies had been fitted. The blocks were held in place, when a coin was being struck, by projecting iron pegs on the upper block fitting into corresponding holes in the lower one. In view of the good style of the coins which these dies would have produced, Mr. <persName>Grierson</persName> concluded that they were genuine instruments of the Venetian mint and were used for striking ducats of <persName corresp="#viaf_89431668">Alvise IV</persName>Mocenigo (1763‚Äì78). This opinion must be discarded, for a similar pair of dies is in the possession of <persName>Signor Tommaso Bertel√®</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3169070">Rome</placeName>, who obtained it in the bazaar at Istanbul and sent a description and cast to Mr. <persName>Grierson</persName> for publication (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XVI, 5). This pair of dies, which would strike ducats of the same doge, is of a slightly different pattern from the ones found in Crete, having four pegs instead of two, but was clearly intended to be used in the same way.]</p>
