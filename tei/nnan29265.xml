            <head>Forword</head>
            <p>The commercial relations of <name type="place">Byzantium</name> with the West during the early mediaeval period have been the subject of many
               historical studies such as those of <name type="pname">Henri Pirenne</name> and <name type="pname">Alfons Dopsch</name>. As the older view of a
               catastrophic break in the stream of civilization during the period of the barbarian invasions was relegated to the history of historiography, the
               importance of the economic changes of the early Middle Ages assumed greater and greater significance. It is, of course, true that most of the
               scholars who have attempted discussions of the history of this period have made some use of the numismatic material available to them, but they
               have in no sense exhausted the information that may be derived from that source. In the study of the early Middles Ages numismatics has been used
               largely as illustrative material to support conclusions based primarily upon the literary sources. The archaeological and numismatic studies have
               therefore not served their true function as ancillary sciences of history. Many reasons for this situation are immediately evident, if a summary
               perusal is made of the secondary literature in those fields and the training of most mediaevalists is considered.</p>
            <p>This book is not designed to cover this tremendous gap in historical scholarship, but it is an attempt to indicate that certain facts which may
               be derived from the numismatic and archaeological data are vital to a complete synthesis of the historical material. It is no longer possible for
               a mediaevalist, anymore than for an ancient historian, to relegate the vital ancillary sciences to the field of antiquarianism. From the
               deductions based on the results of archaeological and numismatic study of the remains of the early mediaeval period a new view of that epoch may
               be constructed which will encompass the literary evidence as well.</p>
            <p>This book itself, however, did not begin as an attempt to correct this woeful lack of utilization of numismatic evidence. While I was working on
               a much larger study on the subject of <name type="place">Byzantine</name> monetary policy from <name type="pname">Diocletian</name> to <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>, it soon became evident that the <pb n="viii"/> light weight gold currency, which
               had received passing interest from numismatists but was generally ignored by historians, was really deserving of a much more intensive treatment.
               No successful attempt had been made to integrate this unique series of gold coins into the economic history of the sixth and seventh centuries.
               The amount of material at the disposal of a researcher had grown considerably in recent years, and several men of stature in numismatic studies
               had begun to collect data on these pieces. A fair number of site finds and hoards were known which had a direct bearing on the problem, and the
               general situation had never been so favorable for an attempt at a solution. In addition the American Numismatic Society was very fortunate in
               securing the participation of <name type="pname">Mr. Philip Grierson</name> of <name type="place">Gonville and Caius College</name> of Cambridge
               University for the Summer Seminar in Numismatics of the year 1954. The opportunity to discuss the many problems which naturally arose in
               connection with this study with a man of <name type="pname">Mr. Grierson's</name> stature in numismatic studies was most fortunate. <name
                  type="pname">Mr. Grierson's</name> help was invaluable for a number o reasons not the least of which was the fact that he placed all of the
               photographs of the gold coins in his own collection as well as those of the light weight solidi which he had encountered in the course of his own
               studies at my disposal. <name type="pname">Mr. Grierson</name> also analyzed his own coins by the specific gravity technique, and thus he made
               available data which was previously unknown. For all of these things and most importantly for his willingness to discuss individual problems, I
               wish to acknowledge a deep sense of gratitude to <name type="pname">Mr. Grierson</name>.</p>
            <p>Since my own training has been in history, it was, of course, vital that there be some scholar who would aid me in the purely technical aspects
               of numismatics. In this capacity <name type="pname">Mr. Louis C. West</name> of Princeton University and President of the American Numismatic
               Society has been of invaluable assistance. The most technical aspects of this work have been perused by <name type="pname">Mr. West</name>, and
               many of his suggestions have been incorporated into this book. If there is any merit to be found in that aspect of this work, it is largely the
               result of the aid and counsel of my teacher, <name type="pname">Mr. West</name>, who introduced me to the value of numismatic study while I was a
               graduate student and has done so very much to encourage my researches.</p>
            <p>Sole responsibility for the hypotheses and historical explanations put forward in the course of this book must rest with me, but the debt <pb
                  n="ix"/> which is owed to my teachers, <name type="pname">Professor Theodor E. Mommsen</name> of Cornell University and <name type="pname"
                  >Professor Joseph R. Strayer</name> of Princeton University, cannot be calculated. Both of them very kindly consented to read the manuscript,
               and their suggestions have been incorporated into the finished product. The techniques and methods which were utilized in the work were learned
               in the seminars conducted by them, and my interest in this field of historical research is the result of many most enjoyable hours spent stuying
               under their tutelage.</p>
            <p>This book, however, would have been impossible without the aid of so many scholars who sent me casts or photographs of coins and notes regarding
               these pieces. Among these should be numbered <name type="pname">Dr. Theodore V. Buttrey, Jr.</name> of the Classics Department of Yale University
               who secured photographs of the coins in the Hermitage through the help of <name type="pname">Dr. L. Belov</name> of the staff of the Hermitage,
               and who also managed to obtain photographs of the coins in the Poltawa Museum of Regional Studies from the manager of that museum, <name
                  type="pname">Dr. V. T. Shevtshenko</name>. <name type="pname">Dr. Buttrey's</name> kind efforts, however, extended even further, and with his
               help and the assistance of <name type="pname">Dr. Maria R. Alföldi</name> and <name type="pname">Dr. L. Huszár</name>, Keeper of Coins and Medals
               of the collection in Budapest, casts of all of the light weight pieces in that collection were also secured. In addition the aid and assistance
               of <name type="pname">Mr. R. A. G. Carson</name> of the Department of Medals and Coins of the British Museum, <name type="pname"

            <head>THE STATE AND NATURE OF THE PROBLEM</head>
            <p>It is to the unusual specimens in coinage that the historian is most often drawn in his search for new information regarding the past. The
               continued repetition of older types without any seemingly significant alteration is not likely to catch the eye of the scholar, nor is it
               probable that it will excite a great deal of discussion or interest. Perhaps this is in part the explanation for the fact that a rather
               surprising series of solidi which are to be distinguished primarily on the basis of the marks in the exergues have received only passing
               numismatic comment and have never been adequately studied from the historical point of view.</p>
            <p>When it is remembered for how long a period of time the study of coinage has fascinated men of culture it is strange to note that it was only in
               1910 that a scholar commented upon the series of light weight solidi with unusual exergual markings. <name type="pname">Dr. Arnold Luschin von
                  Ebengreuth</name>, in his study of the denarius of the Salian Law, made use of the fact that such a series of light weight solidi marked BOXX
                  existed.<ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> He was, however, aware of the existence of only a few of these pieces, and the entire scope of the
               problem was not evident to <pb n="2"/> him. Only a few emperors, <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, <name
                  type="pname">Phocas</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> during his sole reign, and <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius Constantine</name> during their joint reign, were represented
               on the solidi that he studied.</p>
            <p>It is, of course, true that a certain number of these light weight Byzantine gold pieces had been reported in sale catalogues on several
               occasions prior to the date of <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth's</name> study, and also it is true that <name type="pname"
                  >Sabatier</name> as well as <name type="pname">Wroth</name> had noted the existence of a few specimens of this series, but there was still no
               body of material collected which warranted any study of the series itself. <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth</name> could use these coins
               in his study of Frankish coinage and the Salian Law to indicate a Byzantine adumbration of the subsequent decline in the weight of the Frankish
               solidi and trientes, but he could derive nothing from them regarding the policies of the Byzantine emperors whose names appeared on these strange
               pieces.</p>
            <p>By 1923, however, enough material had been collected to make it possible for <name type="pname">Ugo Monneret De Villard</name> to write the first
               numismatic study devoted solely to the light weight solidi.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> In the intervening period a series of finely written and
               well illustrated sale catalogues which included a number of such coins had appeared, and the monumental Byzantine coin catalogue of Count Tolstoi
               had been published. Thus it was possible for <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> to discern the true limits of this series of solidi,
               and though the catalogue which is included with the present study is more than three times as long as that of <name type="pname">Monneret De
                  Villard</name> nonetheless the first truly significant collection of the numismatic data was made by him.</p>
            <p>From a search of all of the literature available to him and from research in the various major museums of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>, he discovered that there was not one series of light weight solidi, but rather that there were
               several series of such coins each bearing a different set of markings <pb n="3"/> in the exergue on the reverse. It was also evident, when the
               material had been gathered, that these light weight coins were not issued intermittently by several emperors of the sixth and seventh centuries,
               but rather that they formed a series which extended in unbroken fashion from the reign of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian</name> to that of

            <p>As a result of this numismatic inquiry into the nature of these coins <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> concluded that there were at
               least seven different varieties of markings that appeared in the exergue on the reverses of Byzantine solidi which would indicate that the coins
               in question were light. Unfortunately he did not distinguish between the authentic Byzantine gold pieces and those of barbarian manufacture. His
               list of markings would therefore be somewhat smaller if it were devoted only to the genuine Byzantine coins. The marks as he listed them,
               however, were i) OB⁕+⁕, 2) OB XX or OB·XX, 3) OB<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/> or OB+⁕, 4) BOXX, 5) BOГK, 6) CXNXU, and lastly 7) CX+X÷. The
               weights of almost all of the coins bearing these marks in the exergue were clearly below the lowest weights which one might reasonably expect
               from solidi which had originally been struck at full weight. Of all the markings listed, however, <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>
               felt that only two series could be grouped in which he was possessed of a sufficient number of weights to postulate any hypothesis regarding the
               theoretical weight at which these coins had been struck. The forty-two coins which were contained in groups two and four he considered as one
               series. This he might logically do because there was nothing more than a transposition or metathesis of the first two letters of the exergual
               mark involved in distinguishing them from one another. These coins when considered as a single series showed an average weight of 3.657 grammes
               according to his calculations. A second series of coins, he felt, might be constructed of those coins which had the exergual marks in groups one
               (OB⁕+⁕) and three (OB+⁕).<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> The three coins that were listed with the mark OB⁕+⁕ had a mean weight of 3.866 grammes,
               while the nine coins with the mark <pb n="4"/> 0B+⁕ had an average weight of 3.96 grammes according to the calculations of <name type="pname"
                  >Monneret De Villard</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The three mean weights which had been obtained by this process were all well below what might be expected of solidi which had originally been
               struck at full weight. Theoretically and actually the solidus had been struck <hi rend="italic">al-pezzo</hi> at 1/72nd of a Roman pound. This
               fact was attested from the legal texts in the Theodosian and Justinian Codes as well as from the marks of value which were found on certain of
               the earlier solidi. <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth</name> had also demonstrated most scientifically that one could hardly expect a
               weight of less than 4.35 grammes for any undipped solidus. This is in accord with our knowledge concerning the weight of the Roman pound. It is
               now generally conceded among numismatists that the solidus must have been struck at a theoretical weight of 4.55 grammes and that the <hi
                  rend="italic">siliqua ami</hi> was theoretically 0.1895 grammes.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref>
               <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>, however, had adopted the weight of the Roman pound which Naville had calculated<ref
                  target="#CH1-n6">6</ref>. According to the system set forth by Naville the Roman pound weighed 322.56 grammes, and the <hi rend="italic"
                  >siliqua ami</hi>, which it is quite certain was 1/1728th of a pound, was 0.1867 grammes. Since there were twenty-four siliquae or four
               scruples in the normal solidus of 1/72nd of a pound, the theoretical weight of the solidus, according to Naville, would be 4.48 grammes. It can
               be seen immediately that there is only the slight difference of seven-hundredths of a gramme between the theoretical weight of the <pb n="5"/>
               solidus as calculated by <name type="pname">Naville</name> and that according to the traditional view.</p>
            <p>Sixty coins were listed in the article by <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> according to the rulers and with notations regarding the
               peculiar markings in the exergue on the reverses. When, however, the coins were grouped according to the marks in the exergues it was found that
               only in one instance, those inscribed BOXX and the like, was there really a sufficient number of coins to warrant an attempt at a scientific
               treatment. In another case, that of the coins marked OB+⁕, only some hypotheses could be put forward.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> did not make use of the frequency curve method of statistical analysis of the
               metrological data which he had accumulated, but he resorted to the less scientific, and therefore more uncertain, practice of calculating mean
               weights. As a result he was only able to discuss with any degree of confidence those coins which he had assembled in his first group, a total of
               forty-two specimens.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> concluded that the solidi of this first series, i.e., those with a mean weight of 3.657 grammes
               were struck at twenty siliquae to the solidus (theoretical weight according to Naville's system of 3.734 grammes). He was aware of the fact that
               the siliqua was mentioned several times in the <hi rend="italic">Edictum Rothari</hi> as well as in the <hi rend="italic">Capitula
                  Extravagantia</hi> of the Lombard laws,<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> and he found, as Brunner had noted much earlier, that in the <hi
                  rend="italic">Glossarium Matricense 63</hi> it was stated that <hi rend="italic">Siliqua vicesima pars solidi est</hi>, while the <hi
                  rend="italic">Glossarium Cávense 104</hi> and <hi rend="italic">163</hi> asserted <hi rend="italic">Siliquas. Id. vicesima pars solidi</hi>
               and <hi rend="italic">Silicuas, id est vicesima pars solidi, ab arbore, cuius semen est, vocabulum tenens</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref>
               <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> held that since the glossators themselves believed this valuation of the solidus at twenty siliquae
               it indicated quite clearly that they knew that it corresponded to the actual worth of the solidi which circulated during the reign of <name
                  type="pname">Rothari</name> (636–652 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>). The reign of Rothari, moreover, was roughly contemporary with that of
               Heraclius, and the greatest number of light <pb n="6"/> weight solidi were struck with the name of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> imprinted on them. From these facts and premises <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>
               concluded that the light weight solidi of twenty siliquae were actually referred to in contemporary texts and probably were a part of the
               monetary system.</p>
            <p>In doing this, however, he erred most seriously, probably because of the fact that his training was that of a numismatist and not ahistorian. His
               use of the legal texts does not meet the requirements of historical technique. The <hi rend="italic">Edictum Rothari</hi>, it is true, was issued
               in 643 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> during the reign of that Lombard king, and the <hi rend="italic">Capitula Extravagantia</hi> are attributed
               to either the reign of Grimoald (662–671 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>) or Luitprand in the first half of the eighth century. The word siliqua
               does occur in both cases, but it is not defined within the text but only in the two glosses that have been quoted. The glosses which are cited by
                  <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> in support of his position that these siliquae were the twentieth part of the solidus are more
               recent than the legal texts themselves. They may safely be put into Carolingian times or later, when the solidus in <name type="place">western
                  Europe</name> was uniformly valued at twenty siliquae. The two manuscripts in which these glosses occur are related in the <hi rend="italic"
                  >stemma.</hi> They come from a common source.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> That source seems to be a relatively late one, and these texts are
               more valuable for the later period of Lombard law. The <hi rend="italic">Codex Matritensis regius D 117</hi> was probably written in the region
               of Beneventum or Salerno in the tenth century.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> While the <hi rend="italic">Codex Cavensis</hi> was most likely
               produced in the region of Beneventum about the year 1005 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> It is probable that the glossator himself was a Beneventan of about the same period.<ref target="#CH1-n12"
                  >12</ref> The actual text of the glosses is apparently derived from Isidore of Seville (<hi rend="italic">ca. 560–636</hi>
               <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>), but <name type="pname">Isidore</name> retains the older valuation of the solidus at twenty-four siliquae.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> Perhaps, as is most <pb n="7"/> likely, the influence of the Frankish monetary system was the stimulus for the
               lower valuation of the solidus among the Lombards.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> When this change was accomplished, however, must remain
               uncertain. It is quite definite that the glossators referred to by <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> were not giving us exact
               information regarding conditions in the time of <name type="pname">Rothari</name> and <name type="pname">Grimoald</name>, but rather that they
               were utilizing the valuations known in their own time. The glossators’ knowledge of the monetary system in force during the reign of Rothari was
               very likely much less than that available to numismatists and historians today. In addition these glosses can hardly be used to prove that the
               Byzantine government issued such light weight solidi for normal circulation within the Empire during the seventh century, since they are derived
               from a later period and they comment on a matter of Lombard and not Byzantine law.</p>
            <p>In studying the second group of coins, those marked OB⁕+⁕ and OB+⁕, <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> found himself seriously
               hampered by an insufficiency of data. Three coins marked OB⁕+⁕ had an average weight of 3.866 grammes, and the nine pieces marked OB+⁕ had a mean
               weight of 3.96 grammes. This seemed to indicate a theoretical weight of approximately twenty-one siliquae which should have corresponded to 3.92
               grammes according to the system worked out by <name type="pname">Naville</name> and accepted by <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>. If
               this were so, then <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> suggested that the mark which he transcribed as-⁕ might be explained as — +⁕,
               and that the two X's would thus be combined into the single sign ⁕. The total would then be twenty-one. Unfortunately such an explanation is
               hardly satisfactory because, as will be shown, there are no solidi marked -⁕, and, furthermore, the coins marked OB⁕+⁕ and those marked OB+⁕ or
                  OB<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/> all belong to a single group. The marks OB+⁕ and OB<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/> are merely
               abbreviations of OB⁕+⁕. These asterisks cannot therefore be taken as the combination of two X's or the total would be in excess of forty rather
               than twenty-one.</p>
            <p>These solidi, however, were supposedly struck at approximately 3.92 grammes or about 1/84th of a Roman pound.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref>
               <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>, following <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth</name>, pointed out that some of the
               pseudo-imperial solidi struck in Gaul during the early Merovingian period were issued at approximately the same average weight.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> Some of these Frankish gold pieces were issued with <pb n="8"/>
               <pb n="9"/> imperial portraits and they bore marks of value, XXI in the case of the solidi and VII in the case of the trientes. These Frankish
               coins will be examined more closely at a later point, but it should suffice for the present merely to indicate that the existence of such coinage
               from mints in southern Gaul is well attested.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>There was also a certain amount of literary evidence that bore on the question of such light solidi which weighed less than 1/72nd of a pound,
               and <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> dealt with a small portion of that evidence. He cited a <hi rend="italic">Novella</hi> of the
               Emperor <name type="pname">Majorian</name> in which that Emperor required that all solidi of full weight be accepted by the tax collector with
               the one exception of the Gallic solidi, the gold of which was of lesser value.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> This legal text was issued in 458
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> and therefore precedes the issuance of the peculiar series of light weight soUdi in which we are interested by
               at least eighty years and possibly as much as a century. That the Romans had certain problems connected with the unofficial striking of solidi of
               light weight during the fourth and fifth centuries cannot be doubted in view of the extant laws regarding gold coins, but these laws cannot be
               used to indicate that an imperial gold coin was struck at a lighter standard. The entire body of literary evidence will be discussed at a later
               point, but it should suffice for the present merely to point out that the particular <hi rend="italic">Novella</hi> just cited <pb n="10"/>
               cannot refer to the light weight solidi which form the subject of this book.</p>
            <p>In addition to that <hi rend="italic">Novella</hi>, however, <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> refers to several other documents
               which should be treated in connection with a critique of his work. One of the documents to which reference is made is the so-called <hi
                  rend="italic">Formula Lindenbrogiana</hi> LXXXII, but this can easily be shown to be a spurious reference because of the variants.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> Two other instances in which the so-called <hi rend="italic">solidus Gallicus</hi> is mentioned are known from the
               correspondence of Gregory the Great, and <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> also makes reference to them. In one letter <name
                  type="pname">Gregory</name> speaks of the <hi rend="italic">solidi Galliarum, qui in terra nostra expendi non possunt, apud locum proprium
                  utiliter expendantur</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> In another letter of <name type="pname">Gregory</name> to <name type="pname"
                  >Dynamius</name>, the Patrician of the Gauls, the sum of four hundred <hi rend="italic">Gallicanos solidos</hi> is mentioned.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> These references to the <hi rend="italic">solidi Gallici</hi> can easily be explained on the basis of the Frankish
               coinage which was truly light weight in the last decade of the sixth century and could not be used within the confines of the Byzantine
               Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>, however, recognized that his case was all too weak when bolstered only by references to the
               coinage of Gaul which <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth</name> had already proven to be of light weight in <pb n="11"/> the last two
               decades of the sixth century. This Frankish coinage had been adopted after <name type="pname">Justinian</name> had instituted the striking of
               light weight solidi. As a final bit of literary proof that light weight solidi of approximately 1/84th of a Roman pound were issued by the
               Byzantine government <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> cited a law of Valentinian I of the year 367. This law, he maintained, stated
               explicitely that a solidus of 1/84th of a Roman pound was known to the Romans. That law may be translated as follows:</p>
            <p>On account of the mining tax, for which the custom peculiar to it must be retained, it is determined that fourteen ounces of gold dust be brought
               for each pound (of metal).<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p>This law clearly does not mention the striking of solidi at 1/84th of a Roman pound. It simply insists that mine operators in the fulfillment of
               their leases should continue an older practice of remitting to the Treasury fourteen ounces of gold for each pound. This law was inserted into
               the chapter because it formed part of a longer law which in another section established the fact that in payments made in gold bullion a pound
               was to be valued at seventy-two solidi. Since such a regulation would have meant that the treasury would lose money on its gold leases, a
               specific exception was made in the case <pb n="13"/> of the mine operators. In the fulfilling of mine leases a heavy pound of fourteen ounces was
               to be used as in the past, but in all other cases seventy-two solidi were to be accepted as equivalent to a full pound of gold.</p>
            <p>The acceptance of such a heavy fourteen ounce pound, of course, requires somewhat more proof than has just been set forth, and we must therefore
               diverge slightly from the central theme of this chapter. A situation in which two pounds of different weights, both recognized legally, existed
               need excite no surprise, but great care must be taken in citing passages in this connection to distinguish the second variety of pound (i.e. that
               of fourteen ounces) from the mere use of heavy weights. This latter practice was common in the early mediaeval period, and there was a good deal
               of legislation against it.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref>Some passages are capable of an even wider interpretation. On the estates of the Church
               in 591 A.D., it would appear as if 73 ½ solidi were exacted for a pound, but that Gregory the Great considered this sinful and ordered that the
               rustics pay only a pound of seventy-two. In doing this, however, he states, "and there ought to be exacted neither any farthings (siliquae)
               beyond the pound, not a <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> pound, nor charges above the <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> pound, but each according to
               your assessment there should be an increase of the rent in proportion as the resources suffice, and so a shameful exaction may never be
                  made."<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="14"/>
            <p>It is clear that the pound was not eternally the same weight, and just as we may speak of the pound Troy or the pound avoirdupois but in common
               parlance understand one pound to be meant, so it must have been among the Romans. A gift of 1,600 pounds of gold for the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Decennalia</hi> of the emperor was voted by the Senate in 385 A.D., and that it was to be paid in the urban standard, i.e. a different one
               from the normal one, is carefully stipulated.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="15"/>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>, on the basis of the passages which have been discussed, wrongly concluded that he had
               demonstrated, both from the texts and the coins themselves, that different solidi struck on three different standards were in use in the
               Byzantine Empire during the sixth and seventh centuries. There was the normal solidus of twenty-four siliquae or 1/72nd of a pound, a lighter
               solidus of twenty-one siliquae or approximately 1/84th of a pound, and the lightest solidus of twenty siliquae or approximately 1/86th of a
                  pound.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref> He even went so far as to suggest that there might be still other solidi of different standards and that
               the study of Greek papyri from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> revealed the existence of a number of different solidi.
               The very apparent difficulties that would have arisen in the economic life of the empire as a result of such a virtually haphazard system of
               coinage were ignored by <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>. Of course, it is now clear as a result of the work of <name type="pname"
                  >Johnson</name> and West that the calculations in the Egyptian papyri do not support the existence of solidi struck on different standards,
               but that they make use of a system of accounting which is now comprehensible.<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In evaluating the work done by <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> one might, as a result of the rather loose use of texts, easily
               overlook the significance of the fact that his was the first attempt at establishing the true limits of the problem and applying historical data
               to it. A substantial catalogue of the light weight solidi had been prepared, and the problem of explaining and interpreting the significance of
               their existence was now clear to all. The years immediately following witnessed a growth in interest in these strange coins, and even the famed
                  <name type="pname">Professor Regling</name> spoke of doing some work on them.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> Unfortunately <name type="pname"
                  >Regling</name> never did manage to produce the article or book, but it was a clear sign of growing interest. Hoards of these pieces and
               individual coins <pb n="16"/> from stray finds began to appear with some frequency. The entire subject of the quantity of gold in circulation and
               its movements came under scholarly survey in 1933 when <name type="pname">Professor Marc Bloch</name> wrote a stimulating article on the problem
               of gold in the Middle Ages.<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref>

            <p>In 1937 another study devoted to these light weight solidi appeared in which the author, <name type="pname">Friedrich Stefan</name>, put forth a
               new interpretation.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> A hoard of coins was found at <name type="place">Hoischhügel</name> (Maglern-Thörl) which
               contained one solidus of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> which weighed only 4.07 grammes, and was therefore apparently only equivalent to
               twenty-one siliquae instead of the more normal twenty-four. This coin bore in the reverse exergue the mark COX+X which Stefan interpreted as
               meaning twenty siliquae (XX) plus one siliqua (I). The CO he expanded as Constantinople.<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The existence of this singular piece in a hoard that he was studying led Stefan to survey the entire problem. He proceeded to collect the
               locations of the known finds of these light weight solidi, and from that data he concluded that all of these solidi fell into two groups.
               Firstly, there were those coins which had been found, according to <name type="pname">Stefan</name>, in <name type="place">southern France</name>
               and in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, and, on the other hand, there were those coins which were found in the <name
                  type="place">Balkan peninsula</name> and <name type="place">southern Russia</name>. Unfortunately <name type="pname">Stefan</name> did not
               publish a list of the find spots upon which this conclusion was based, but he indicated very clearly that he believed that there was such a
               series of finds in <name type="place">southeastern France</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> Intensive and determined research has failed to
               yield any <pb n="17"/> of the finds of light weight solidi of clearly imperial origin from <name type="place">southern France</name>. No support
               can therefore be found for the basis of <name type="pname">Stefan's</name> contention.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless <name type="pname">Stefan</name> believed, on the basis of his examination of the extant material, that all of the coins which might
               have been included in the western group were imitations of the solidi of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_ravenna">Ravenna</name> which had been struck in the reigns of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_justinian_i">Justinian I</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_justin_ii">Justin II</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice
                  Tiberius</name>, <name type="pname">Phocas</name>, and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>. He maintained that
               they showed the characteristic stylistic marks of Ravenna and that the lightness of the coins was usually indicated by either a sloping cross (X)
               or a standing cross (+) in the reverse exergue. Many of them he thought could be identified by their thinness or the smaller module or smaller
               portraiture. The exergual marks on these coins would be COX+X or CONX+X or OBXX or rarely BOXX, and in some cases they were unmarked. The COX+X
               and CONX+X pieces he thought were of twenty-one siliquae and weighed about 3.78 grammes. He did not distinguish any of the solidi as being
               barbarian imitations, and it therefore seems likely that he never examined the coins themselves. Many of them, particularly those marked COX+X
               and CONX+X, are clearly of barbaric origin. <name type="pname">Stefan</name>, however, as has been said, merely ignored this feature and pointed
               out the fact that solidi of twenty siliquae issued in the names of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, <name type="pname">Justin II</name>,
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>, etc., were known from Gaul, and that there was even a series of royal
               Frankish solidi which bore the mark XX to indicate a value of twenty siliquae. The hoard of Wieuwerd, which contained two light weight solidi of
               imperial origin, he contended showed that such light weight solidi circulated in the lands west of the Rhine while the fact that the use of these
               coins spread across the Rhine to the other Germanic tribes could be shown from the find of a barbaric imitation of a light weight solidus marked
               X+X and struck in the name of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> which was found in Grave no. 1 at Munningen in Bayrisch-Schwaben.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> He admitted, however, the he could not determine whether or not the southern Gallic mints were the source of all
               so-called western type solidi of the light weight series.</p>
            <p>Turning his attention to the series which he had denominated as eastern in origin, <name type="pname">Stefan</name> said that though this latter
               series showed <pb n="18"/> great similarity to the western coins they were more characteristic of the Constantinopolitan productions. The typical
               marks of the coinage of the Exarchate of Ravenna were lacking on this eastern series. It was also a more extended series in that it began with
               Justinian and extended through the reigns of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, <name type="pname">Tiberius Constantine</name>, <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>, <name type="pname">Phocas</name>, <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> as sole ruler as well as in his joint reign with his son <name type="pname">Heraclius
                  Constantine</name>, and so on through the reigns of <name type="pname">Constans II</name> and <name type="pname">Constantine IV
                  Pogonatus</name>. Another point of distinction between the two series lay in the fact that all of the coins of eastern origin bore marks of
               value in the exergue on the reverse while some of those in the West did not. Those in the East of twenty-one siliquae of the period from <name
                  type="pname">Justin II</name> through the reign of <name type="pname">Phocas</name> were marked ⁕+⁕ or+⁕ (⁕–⁕ or –⁕).<ref target="#CH1-n34"
                  >34</ref> The pieces of this eastern series which Stefan thought were of twenty silique occurred only for the reigns from Heraclius through
               that of Constantine IV Pogonatus and bore marks similar to those found in the West, i.e. OBXX, BOXX, or BOГK. The most numerous group of coins of
               the light weight type was that composed of those pieces of supposedly Constantinopolitan fabric of twenty siliquae with the marks of value OBXX
               and BOXX which were struck in the names of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius
                  Constantine</name>. <name type="pname">Stefan</name> maintained that these coins, since they showed the head of <name type="pname">Heraclius
                  Constantine</name> in smaller size than that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>, could be distinguished from
               the Ravennese series which showed both heads in approximately the same proportions. <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> had listed
               nineteen such pieces while twenty-seven solidi of the three emperor type of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> had
               been found in the hoard of Pereschtschepino in 1912, and in that of Novo Sandsherovo or Zatschepilovo, found in 1928, seven more had been
               recovered. Both places were in the district of <name type="place">Poltawa</name> in <name type="place">southern Russia</name>.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">N. Bauer</name> in presenting the material from these finds in 1931 had suggested that perhaps the coins had been struck in a
               mint in southern Russia on the northern coast of the <name type="place">Black Sea</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref> He was, however, very
               cautious in proposing this and made certain to <pb n="19"/> indicate that it was based solely on the location of these hoards and one other from
               the Dnieper Delta and not on a stylistic study of coins from other collections. <name type="pname">Stefan</name> went somewhat further and
               contended that since the solidi of the eastern series which he had classified were struck in imitation of coins of Constantinopolitan
               manufacture, they must have been issued at a site which was clearly under the influence of the capital. Two finds from the Balkan peninsula were
               used to support his view. The Sadowetz hoard in the district of <name type="place">Plevna</name> had yielded a coin of <name type="pname">Justin
                  II</name> of twenty-one siliquae which, in addition to the eastern mark OB⁕+⁕ in the exergue, bore the letters ΘS at the end of the reverse
               legend while another similar coin which was marked CO⁕+⁕ had appeared in another find from an uncertain location in the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name>. <name type="pname">Tolstoi</name> had described still another solidus of the same variety as the
               last in his catalogue. <name type="pname">Stefan</name> put forth the hypothesis that the S at the end of the reverse legend stood for the sixth
                  <hi rend="italic">officina</hi> and that the Θ was the mark of the mint of Thessalonica. This suggestion was not a wholly original one, for it
               was discussed by several compilers of earlier catalogues.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> Since the <hi rend="italic">theta</hi> was seen to occur
               only on those coins which <name type="pname">Stefan</name> recognized as of eastern origin and those same pieces supposedly showed strong signs
               of Constantinopolitan influence, <name type="pname">Stefan</name> felt that his conclusion that Thessalonica was one of the sources of the coins
               of the so-called eastern series was assured. In the course of a later discussion of these pieces it will be demonstrated that this is in error
               and that these pieces were actually struck in Antioch.</p>
            <p>Just as the coins of the western series were carried through the channels of commerce, those of eastern origin, according to <name type="pname"
                  >Stefan</name>, found their way into Germany and were used as money or as pieces of jewellery and were even subject to imitation. In support
               of this he listed evidence from funerary deposits collected by <name type="pname">Joachim Werner</name> from <name type="pname">Mullingsen</name>
               in the district of <name type="place">Soest</name>, from <name type="pname">Wonsheim</name> in the district of <name type="place">Alzey</name>,
               from <name type="pname">Sinzig</name> in the district of <name type="place">Ahrweiler</name>, and from <name type="pname">Pfahlheim</name> near
                  <name type="place">Ellwagen</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> In all of these instances pieces of twenty <pb n="20"/> siliquae marked
               OBXX or BOXX struck in the names of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius
                  Constantine</name> were found. Finally, <name type="pname">Stefan</name> viewed a ece of barbarian origin from an Alemannic grave with the
               mark XVOX in the reverse exergue as an imitation of these light weight solidi of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine.<ref target="#CH1-n38"
                  >38</ref>
            </p>
            <p>As a result of <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth's</name> study of the light weight Frankish solidi it was clear that the Byzantine light
               weight gold pieces were in circulation in the West by 582 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> By referring to two passages from the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Anecdota</hi> of Procopius in which that author speaks of the lowering of the value of the gold coins by <name type="pname"
                  >Justinian</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref>Stefan concluded that the Emperor struck his newer gold pieces appreciably lighter as a
               measure to bolster his fading finances. These two passages, as well as the coins themselves, sufficed to prove to <name type="pname"
                  >Stefan's</name> satisfaction that the issuance of light weight solidi went back at least as far as 565 A.D., the date of <name type="pname"
                  >Justinian's</name> death. In this matter of dating, however, he was not exacting enough. A closer date for the start of this series of light
               weight solidi can be established, if they are to be connected with the passages from the <hi rend="italic">Anecdota.</hi> Certainly the fact that
               all of the light weight solidi are of the full-face portraiture is a clear indication of a <hi rend="italic">terminus post quern</hi> of 539
               A.D., the twelfth year of the reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, which the dated bronzes indicate as the start of that style of
               portraiture. But even greater accuracy is possible. Had <name type="pname">Stefan</name> been more careful he would have noted that one of the
               passages from Procopius connects the monetary change with the period during which Peter Barsymes was in office as <hi rend="italic">Comes
                  Sacrarum Largitionum</hi> after he had recovered the favor of the Emperor <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, and that as a result the first
               issue must have occurred at some time between 547 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> and June 1, 555 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>

            </p>
            <pb n="21"/>
            <p>The detailed explanation for the existence of these solidi proposed by Stefan was a simple one. The emperors of the sixth and early seventh
               centuries paid large sums of money to the Avars to secure peace.<ref target="#CH1-n41">41</ref>
               <name type="pname">Stefan</name> believed that the fact that the majority of the light weight solidi found in the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_719819">Hungary</name> and <name type="place">South
                  Russia</name> might be seen to have been struck during the reigns of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and his
               successor added strength to his general thesis that this light weight coinage formed a part of the enormous tribute payments to the Avars. The
               emperors, he contended, had mixed the light weight coins in a given percentage with the solidi of full weight in these payments. He also pointed
               out as further proof of his hypothesis that the eastern series of coins which he had constructed came to an end during the reign of Constantine
               IV Pogonatus. Thus they covered almost exactly the period during which large scale tribute payments were made to the Avars. This coincidence of
               the period of issue of light weight solidi with the time of the tribute payments to the barbarians of the Hungarian plain, he maintained,
               confirmed his hypothesis that the light weight solidi were mixed with the mass of good coinage which was used for these subsidies, and they were
               thus passed along to the barbarians with a resultant saving for the Byzantine government. As an instance that the practice of issuing poorer
               currency with better coinage was not unknown to Roman governments of an even earlier period, he cited the so-called <hi rend="italic">nummi
                  subaerati.</hi> These <hi rend="italic">nummi subaerati</hi> are sometimes found to be as much as two-thirds of the total content of hoards of
               an earlier period, and <name type="pname">Stefan</name> believed that they were issued by the Roman government in an attempt to avoid the
               economic consequences which would have resulted from a general depreciation of the currency.<ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="22"/>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Stefan</name> concluded his argument by pointing out that the western finds of these light weight solidi were largely
               resticted to the coins of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and his son <name type="pname">Heraclius
                  Constantine</name>. The hoards of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> and <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> supposedly showed only these coins. The reason, according to <name type="pname">Stefan</name>, was a
               simple one. These coins arrived in the West via the commercial transactions of the western peoples with the Avars through the Lombards. It was
               therefore not surprising to <name type="pname">Stefan</name> that the hoard of <name type="place">Hoischhügel</name> showed none of the coins of
               the eastern series which he had collected but only a single piece of what he had denominated as the western type. The coins of the western type
               were clearly in circulation among the Lombards prior to the inauguration of their own coinage. The light weight solidi had supposedly travelled
               through the channels of commerce from <name type="place">southern France</name> into <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>
               as shown by the Lombard graves at <name type="place">Udine</name> and <name type="place">Cividale</name>. Coin no. 2 of the Catalogue of this
               monograph was found in a Lombard grave at <name type="place">Udine</name>, and Coin no. 74 was found in still another Lombard grave at <name
                  type="place">Cividale</name>.</p>
            <p>The basic argument put forth by <name type="pname">Stefan</name> has now been traced in some detail through the chain of reasoning set forth by
               that author. His was really the first serious attempt at understanding the significance of these solidi in connection with the history of the
               period during which they were issued. There are, however, several weak spots in the chain, and some serious reservations must be made with regard
               to this thesis. Several of these weak links have been indicated in the course of the exposition of <name type="pname">Stefan's</name> thesis, but
               a more complete critique is certainly warranted by the fact that <name type="pname">Stefan's</name> article is so often cited. The stylistic
               differences which <name type="pname">Stefan</name> speaks about in distinguishing the eastern from the western solidi are by no means as obvious
               and certain in the case of light weight solidi as he seems to indicate.<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref> The western series erected by <name
                  type="pname">Stefan</name> is largely composed <pb n="23"/> of solidi which can be shown to be of barbaric origin. That some of the light
               weight solidi were struck in the West and others in the East is clear enough in itself from a stylistic examination of the coins themselves, but
               unfortunately the division of these coins into these two groups is not exactly that which <name type="pname">Stefan</name> proposes. The
               inclusion of the barbaric pieces in the western series without any clear distinction necessitates a complete restudy of this aspect of the
               problem. The barbaric quality of most of the pieces in <name type="pname">Stefan's</name> classification willbe demonstrated in the next
               chapter.</p>
            <p>It is in connection with the treatment accorded to the hoards and finds, however, that the most serious doubts must be retained, and this is the
               main prop for <name type="pname">Stefan's</name> hypothesis. He speaks of hoards containing such light weight solidi from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_719819">Hungary</name>, <name type="place">southern France</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395"
                  >Italy</name>. Unfortunately he cites no evidence to substantiate this claim for the existence of hoards of authentic light weight Byzantine
               solidi in those places, nor can they be found listed in the hoard catalogue compiled by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_166694544"
                  >Mosser</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref> In <name type="place">southern France</name> no trace of them can be found in the secondary
               literature, while in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> only the two coins from the Lombard nécropoles of <name
                  type="place">Udine</name> and <name type="place">Cividale</name> are noted. The crux of the situation, however, lies in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_719819">Hungary</name>, and in this case two recent studies of the finds of that region give a clear account of the
               picture. <name type="pname">L. Huszár</name> has prepared a study of the finds from the middle Danube region, and <name type="pname">D.
                  Csallány</name> reviewed the evidence of the coin finds for a survey of the circulation of Byzantine currency among the Avars.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n45">45</ref> Only a single light weight solidus of these series noted <pb n="24"/> by <name type="pname">Stefan</name> dating
               from the reigns of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius Constantine</name>, that
               from Szentes, is reported to have been found in the area. The existence of coins of this type in the Budapest Museum cannot be taken as overly
               significant in view of this fact and the extreme mobility of these little bits of metal in the hands of coin dealers. It is a fact well attested
               by the number of hoards and finds recorded by <name type="pname">Csallány</name> that the great period of influx of Byzantine coins into the Avar
               kingdom was just the same as the time span covered by the light weight solidi issues, i.e., from the reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>
               through that of Constantine IV Pogonatus. In the eighth and ninth centuries Byzantine currency is not found in any appreciable quantity <pb
                  n="25"/> within the borders of the Avar kingdom. The high point of the penetration or introduction of Byzantine coins into that area was
               attained during the reigns of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius
                  Constantine</name>. The defeat of the Avaro-Slavonic army before Constantinople in 626 A.D., however, really weakened the Avar kingdom, and
               its importance declined steadily until its final extinction by the Carolingians.</p>
            <p>That Byzantine coins continued to enter the region in some numbers as late as the reign of Constantine IV Pogonatus (668–685 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                  >A.D.</hi>) and ceased to do so afterwards is a surprising fact for which no completely satisfactory explanation has yet been proposed. Still
               this coincidence in time between the introduction of Byzantine coins into the Hungarian plain and the striking of light weight solidi cannot be
               used to indicate that the light weight solidi were part of the tribute payments. The virtual absence of such light weight solidi from that region
               militates most strongly against such a hypothesis particularly when one remembers that the concentration of Byzantine coins entering the entire
               central and <name type="place">western half of the European</name> continent fell off rather sharply at approximately the same time.</p>
            <p>Still another point must be made in connection with this basic feature of <name type="pname">Stefan's</name> hypothesis. If the premise is
               accepted that these coins were used as a part of the tribute payments to the Avars, but their absence from sites on the Hungarian plain is to be
               accounted for by the fact that they circulated freely in trade, then there can be no doubt that numbers of them would be found in the region of
               Thessa-lonica and other Byzantine emporia which were involved in the Avar and Slavonic trade of the middle Danubian basin. The Avars must have
               made a great number, if not almost all, of their foreign purchases from Roman traders in exactly the same way that other barbarians did.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n46">46</ref> If these things were true, however, the Avars would have very quickly become aware of the fraud that had been
               practiced upon <pb n="26"/> them. The Roman merchants could only have accepted this clearly marked light weight gold at a discount. There is
               clear evidence indicating that the use of such light weight solidi was proscribed within the boundaries of the Byzantine Empire, and the passages
               leading to such a conclusion with respect to the light weight gold coinage of Gaul have already been cited in connection with the work done by
                  <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>. The hoards and finds support that conclusion, as will be shown in chapter three. It can hardly
               be seriously maintained that the Romans issued light weight solidi which were clearly marked and sent them to the Avar khan as part of their
               subsidy agreement, but that the use of a part of the coinage so dispatched <pb n="27"/> and clearly marked at the mint was proscribed within the
               borders of the Byzantine Empire. How can one use such a theory to explain the chain of finds extending all along the northern boundary areas of
               the empire? Any interpretation of these light weight solidi must serve to explain them within the general framework of history. On this last
               point the theory proposed by <name type="pname">Stefan</name> is not satisfying. The first of these light weight solidi were issued in the reign
               of Justinian, probably within the period 547–555 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> A glance at the Catalogue will reveal that a respectable number
               of such light weight solidi and barbaric imitations of them were struck during the reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>. The Avars,
               however, can only be said to have achieved real prominence after the death of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>. The most important period of
               tribute payments to the Avars was the latter half of the sixth century and the first quarter of the seventh century. The initiation of the light
               weight solidi cannot have been directly connected with the payments to the Slavs and Avars which largely follow the death of Justinian. For all
               these reasons, which might be expanded to greater length, the hypothesis put forward by <name type="pname">Stefan</name> must be categorically
               rejected.</p>
            <p>In 1941, however, still another very ingenious suggestion was put forth by a numismatist of note. Goodacre, on the basis of his study of a unique
               solidus of this series containing two imperial busts (Coin no. 79), put forth the view that these light weight solidi were issued at the mint of
               Thessalonica so as to accord with the peculiar bronze monetary system which was used in that city during the reign of Justinian.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n47">47</ref> The evidence concerning the meaning of the mint mark 6S, however, will be shown to yield a different conclusion.
               The unusal bronze denominations found at the mint of Kherson during the reign of Justinian were found to be in conformity with the normal
               Byzantine monetary system.<ref target="#CH1-n48">48</ref> Suggestions have been put <pb n="28"/> forward for integrating the bronze denominations
               current at Alexandria at the same time into the imperial system.<ref target="#CH1-n49">49</ref> The coinage of Thessalonica is another instance
               where such agreement must exist though the coins are too rare to make this immediately evident.</p>
            <p>The works already discussed were not treated critically in the most recent of the large studies devoted to the coinages of this period, and their
               effect on the historians is therefore excessive. <name type="pname">Le Gentilhomme</name>, in his masterful synthesis of the numismatic evidence
               concerning the barbarian coinages of the West, supported the hypothesis proposed by <name type="pname">Stefan</name> and accepted the view that
               at least some of these solidi were struck at Thessalonica.<ref target="#CH1-n50">50</ref> The solidi, according to <name type="pname">Le
                  Gentilhomme</name>, were struck for the purpose of using them to pay the tribute money to the barbarian Avars who, when striking their own
               currency, imitated the light weight solidi of Heraclius and Constantine IV Pogonatus. To prove his point <name type="pname">Le Gentilhomme</name>
               referred to the discussion by <name type="pname">Jónás</name> of the supposed Avar currency found in Hungary.<ref target="#CH1-n51">51</ref> The
               supposed Avar coins, however, cannot be shown to be imitations of the light weight solidi even though the weights are far below the Byzantine
               limits. Where prototypes can be discerned they are clearly not the light weight pieces. In some instances the emperor is dressed in consular
               garb, but none of the light weight solidi show such portraiture. In the few cases in which the inscription in the reverse exergue can be
               deciphered it contains the inscription CONOB or a corruption of that Byzantine formula. Even the weights are not uniform, and no determination of
               the standard is possible. <name type="pname">Jónás</name> felt that a weight of approximately twenty siliquae was possible, but the evidence is
               very weak. It is, however, certain that the Avars, if <pb n="29"/> they ever issued coins, could not have begun striking them before the third
               decade of the seventh century and that most of their currency is in imitation of pieces struck in the second half of the seventh century.</p>
            <p>The excavations in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_719819">Hungary</name>, however, clearly show a higher degree of civilization among that
               barbarian people than had previously been assumed. The existence of the balance type of weighing mechanism among them was well attested by the
               excavations, and since their coins varied widely in weight they probably passed by weight. The expression "<hi rend="italic">sans doute</hi>"
               which <name type="pname">Le Gentilhomme</name> used in stating that the light weight solidi were primarily used in the tribute payments is
               perhaps too strong in view of the evidence. <name type="pname">Jónás</name> article does not add materially to the solution of the problem of the
               light weight solidi even though it is a very significant contribution to any study of the Avars. No authentic Byzantine solidi of the light
               weight series were reported by <name type="pname">Jónás</name>.</p>
            <p>In 1947 <name type="pname">Leo Schindler</name> and <name type="pname">Gerhart Kalmann</name> studied the light weight solidi.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n52">52</ref> Unfortunately their work did not take into account all of the material available. They maintained that the coins
               marked OBXX or retrograde BOXX had a theoretical weight of twenty siliquae, those marked OB⁕+⁕ or OB+⁕ a theoretical weight of twenty-two
               siliquae and those marked BOГK a theoretical weight of twenty-three siliquae because the inscription was retrograde. The coins which did not bear
               the letters OB or BO they wisely separated from the remainder and excluded as probably barbaric imitations. The conclusion regarding twenty-carat
               solidi was based on the fact that such coins showed an average weight of 4.069 grammes and the theoretical weight of coins at twenty-two carats
               was 4.169 grammes.</p>
            <p>In their discussion of the bronze coins from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name> marked ΛГ (33), however,
               they reverted to the problem of the light weight solidi. They pointed out that the number of nummi that equalled a follis remained constant and
               was indicated by a mark of value. Whether 210 folles or 180 folles were equivalent to a solidus would not have changed the relationship of the
               nummus to the follis. <name type="pname">Procopius</name>, however, tells of a change in the valuation of the solidus from 210 <pb n="30"/>
               folles to 180 folles. Thus the number of folles which could be exchanged for a solidus was subject to an imperial decree. Since this change in
               the relationship between the follis and the solidus is not reflected on the follis by different marks of value, it would be logical to presume
               that it indicates a change in the value of the gold coins by one-seventh of their intrinsic value.</p>
            <p>Therefore <name type="pname">Schindler</name> and <name type="pname">Kalmann</name>, on the basis of the two passages in Procopius regarding the
               exchange value of the solidus, arrived at the conclusion that <name type="pname">Justinian</name> had reduced the intrinsic value of the
                  solidus.<ref target="#CH1-n53">53</ref> Five hundred of the older solidi would have sufficed for the striking of 583 newer ones, but the newer
               ones must have been given the same valuation as the older ones or the government would have derived no benefit from the change. Edict XI of the
               Emperor <name type="pname">Justinian</name> was wrongly interpreted by these two scholars as indicating that in the year 559 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                  >A.D.</hi> the Emperor used all of the means at his disposal to maintain the fiat value of his debased currency. This, of course, does not
               accord with the latest interpretation of that edict by <name type="pname">West</name> and <name type="pname">Johnson</name>.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n54">54</ref>
               <name type="pname">Schindler</name> and <name type="pname">Kalmann</name> viewed this edict as reproaching <pb n="31"/> the Egyptian officials
               because they evaluated gold, whether in the form of coins or bullion, solely in terms of fineness and weight. Thus the Alexandrian mint masters
               were diverging from the practice of the Constantinopolitan mint which in accordance with the imperial will had lessened the intrinsic value of
               the gold currency. The authors therefore assumed that gold was struck in Alexandria, and that the coins which resulted differed from those issued
               at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</name>. It was then noted that the light weight solidi were derived from <hi rend="italic">officinae</hi>
               nine and ten which had previously been attributed only to the mint of <name type="place">Constantinople</name>. It was a difficult feat to
               attribute these two <hi rend="italic">officinae</hi> to the Alexandrian mint, but there were no other coins which could have been attributed to
               that mint, and according to their interpretation of Edict XI there must have been solidi issued there. Even though the numbers of the <hi
                  rend="italic">officinae</hi> were such that the mint of <name type="place">Constantinople</name> was indicated still the usual formula CONOB
               had been replaced by the OBXX exergual mark. It was proposed therefore that what Procopius had reported was an actual debasement of the metal
               carried out at the capital, but that at Alexandria pure gold coins approximately one-seventh lighter were issued. The debased solidi and the
               lighter solidi would be equivalent in value. Perhaps the peculiar conditions in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and the
               fact that foreign trade required pure gold necessitated this peculiarly Egyptian solution of the imperial proposal.</p>
            <pb n="32"/>
            <p>The issuance of f olles marked ΛГ or thirty-three nummi, however, in place of those of M or forty nummi would seem to be an attack on the
               imperial monetary policy. It would at the same time be a reflection of the peculiar Egyptian solution of the problem.</p>
            <p>This hypothesis is very ingenious but far from convincing. There is not the slightest evidence that the light weight solidi were struck in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, and the fact that none of them have ever been found in that province would seem to
               militate against such a premise. The passages from Procopius on which a debasement of the normal twenty-four siliquae solidi is based cannot be
               used to support that contention. A careful scrutiny of the passages at a later stage will show that the wording supports a light weight coinage
               and not a debasement. Studies of the coin alloy are few and in many cases inconclusive, but they all support the belief that the normal solidi
               were of relatively fine gold whereas in the few instances in which the light weight solidi have been subjected to such analysis it is clear that
               some debasement had been determined upon. This alone, of course, would demolish the thesis put forward by <name type="pname">Schindler</name> and
                  <name type="pname">Kalmann</name>, but to proceed a bit further, Edict XI cannot be used in the manner suggested by these two scholars. The
               work of <name type="pname">West</name> and <name type="pname">Johnson</name>, which has already been cited several times, seems conclusive. The
               interpretation supported by <name type="pname">Schindler</name> and <name type="pname">Kalmann</name> is therefore no longer tenable. Even the
               view that ΛГ indicated thirty-three nummi on the Alexandrian bronzes is open to suspicion in the light of the new proposed reading of three <hi
                  rend="italic">lita</hi> which may have equalled thirty-six nummi.<ref target="#CH1-n55">55</ref> The hypothesis suggested by <name
                  type="pname">Schindler</name> and <name type="pname">Kalmann</name> must be discarded.</p>
            <p>In 1948, however, <name type="pname">Marcel Jungfleisch</name> wrote an excellent article on the subject of isolated letters found on Byzantine
               solidi of the seventh century, and his work bears a direct relationship to that of <name type="pname">Schindler</name> and <name type="pname"
                  >Kalmann</name> though it was completely independent.<ref target="#CH1-n56">56</ref>
               <name type="pname">Jungfleisch</name> made some interesting observations that are applicable to the problem of the light weight solidi though he
               did not offer a <pb n="33"/> complete treatment of the question. He interpreted the exergual formula CONOB as meaning "gold of the quality of
               Constantinople" rather than "struck at Constantinople." Then he noted that many mints of the Byzantine Empire were used for the striking of gold,
               and that they often did so in the names of other mints. This freed Byzantine numismatics from the rigid bonds which had largely impeded its full
               development. The isolated letters which are sometimes found in the field of Byzantine solidi were to be interpreted as either dates or
               indications of mints striking coins for other mints. As just pointed out, this novel thesis required a completely new approach to Byzantine gold
               currency in particular. The legend in the exergue now became purely an indication of the fineness of the alloy of the gold coins. On that basis
                  <name type="pname">Jungfleisch</name> suggested a table of fineness which was based on findings utilizing the touchstone to determine the
               actual gold content of the solidi. In the next chapter this table of fineness will be discussed in detail, but it can be stated at this point
               that certain objections might be leveled against the methods used by <name type="pname">Jungfleisch</name>. Unfortunately no series of chemical,
               spectroscopie, or specific gravity analyses was given to support the table, but according to <name type="pname">Jungfleisch</name> himself the
               use of the touchstone indicated that solidi rarely attained what he considered their theoretical fineness but showed perhaps an extra half-carat,
               and sometimes more, of debasement. The precision of the results seem somewhat excessive in view of the technique employed, but only tests by
               other methods can resolve any doubts. Perhaps the peculiar code used in the exergual markings of the solidi to indicate the standard of purity
               was designed so that the baser coins could be used in foreign trade ? Only a long series of analyses or the chance finding of a new text could
               resolve the problem.</p>
            <p>It is hardly possible at this time to evaluate the implications of the thesis propounded by <name type="pname">Jungfleisch</name> in all of its
               aspects, but it should suffice for our purposes to point out that it can hardly be considered a complete solution of the problem of the light
               weight solidi. It is only for the sake of completeness that the work done by <name type="pname">Jungfleisch</name> and <name type="pname">Philip
                  Grierson</name> can be included in this chapter. These men in no way attempted a complete study of the problem. They merely sought to indicate
               some suggestive paths based upon their acute observations, <pb n="34"/> and it will be shown in the course of this study just how astoundingly
               acute their observations and suggestions were.</p>
            <p>In the course of studying the <name type="pname">St. Martin's</name> hoard of Frankish and Anglo-Saxon coin-ornaments, <name type="pname">Mr.
                  Grierson</name> noted that the light weight system of gold coins in use in Gaul in the late sixth century represented "the victory of a
               traditional Germanic weight, originally based on the Roman Republican denarius, over the slightly heavier solidus which the invaders had found in
               use in the imperial provinces which they had occupied—but regarding the circumstances of the change and the methods by which it was carried out
               we are almost entirely in the dark." He further suggested that the light weight solidi were "apparently for use of the merchants trading with the
               Germanic world."<ref target="#CH1-n57">57</ref> These statements will be expanded upon greatly in later sections of this study because they seem
               to indicate particularly fruitful channels of investigation. They should, however, also be judged in the light of <name type="pname">Mr.
                  Grierson's</name> latest statement regarding the light weight solidi. In the course of studying a hoard of Byzantine solidi from <name
                  type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> in which a light weight solidus occurred, <name type="pname">Mr. Grierson</name>
               stated that it was most probably some local demand within the Empire which called for the issuance of these solidi.<ref target="#CH1-n58"
                  >58</ref> Again there is not very much that can be done to evaluate the validity of such a statement which is in the nature of an <hi
                  rend="italic">obiter dictum</hi>, but it can be pointed out that it will not serve to explain the fact that of all of the light weight solidi
               which have been found throughout the length and breadth of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> only twice have they been
               found in clearly Roman sites.</p>
            <p>In fine, it may be stated clearly that the situation with regard to these light weight solidi is more fluid than is generally supposed. There has
               up to the present moment been no explanation put forward which can be shown to have a firm historical background and which can explain both the
               light weight of the coins and the location of the finds as well as the time period within which they are found. Absolutely <pb n="35"/> no work
               has been done on the iconography of these coins, which indeed shows some interesting features, as well as upon the alloy of thes pieces, though
                  <name type="pname">Jungfleisch</name> does indicate that he believes them to be of worse alloy than the normal Byzantine solidi. It is because
               of these reasons that the current work has been taken in hand. But to a historian, of course, the coins themselves can only be of interest
               insofar as they give us some new information concerning the period to which they refer. It may well be impossible to give an explanation of some
               of the numismatic aspects of the problem. The texts are not sufficiently explicit to yield absolutely certain conclusions. Rather we should
               attempt to use the coins as documents with which to study the world at the time of their issuance.</p>

                  4.50 grammes, and therefore it was within the range of true full weight solidi. He also omitted the one coin marked OB<graphic

                  42–60. It must be stated that there is no unanimity concerning the weight of the Roman pound, but the consensus of scholarly opinion seems to
                  favor the traditional weight of 327.45 grammes. All of the figures quoted in this discussion of <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>
                  would therefore have to be adjusted to accord with this, if they were to be used in any further discussion of the problem. Since this is not

                     Numismatica</hi>, XXXVI (1923), p. 38, suggests also that the miliarense or large silver coin prior to the reign of Justinian was struck at
                  1/84th of a pound. It would thus be a silver counterpart of the light weight solidus. Actually he is in error, for the silver coins were not
                  struck at a standard of 1/84th of a Roman pound at any time during at least a two hundred year period before the reign of <name type="pname"
                     >Justinian</name>, nor did <name type="pname">Justinian</name> himself strike such silver coins. Heavy silver coinage is noticeably absent
                  in the fifth century. When the quantity of silver coins issued began to rise in the first quarter of the sixth century it seems that a heavy
                  coin of 1/72nd of a pound, the counterpart of a full weight solidus, was struck, but none of 1/84th of a pound were issued. A solidus at
                  1/84th of a pound would actually be equivalent to 20.57 siliquae. <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> has apparently rounded this
                  off to twenty-one siliquae. Twenty-one siliquae would weigh 3.9207 grammes according to Naville. A solidus of twenty siliquae would actually
                  be struck at about 1/82nd of a pound while one of twenty-one siliquae would be struck at about 1/86th of a pound. See also <name type="pname"

                  rapidly fell to twenty-one siliquae to the solidus. Prior to 580 A.D., he maintained, the Merovingians had struck their gold on the
                  Constantinian standard of twenty-four siliquae to the solidus. A further reduction in the weight of Merovingian gold coins to twenty siliquae
                  probably took place in the first decade of the seventh century, but in any event, it was an accomplished fact during the reign of <name

                  the Theodosian Code which would indicate light weight solidi has been preserved in two separate fragments which are recorded in both the
                  Theodosian and Justinian Codes, and whose order is indicated in the Theodosian recension. <hi rend="italic">C. Th.</hi>, XII, 7, 1; XII, 6, 2
                  (ed. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_12435825">Mommsen</name> and <name type="pname">Meyer</name>, <hi rend="italic">Codex
                  Theodosianus</hi>, I, pt. II, pp. 722–33; 713) = <hi rend="italic">C. Just.</hi>, X, 73, 1; X, 72, 1 (ed. <name type="pname">Krueger</name>,
                     <hi rend="italic">Corpus Iuris Civilis</hi>, II, pp. 427; 426). In the later recension the important statement regarding the weighing of
                  solidi has been omitted. Whether or not anything intervened between the two fragments as received cannot be ascertained, but the text as it
                  stands forms an intelligible whole. It is a law concerning the collection of taxes, and penalties for improper performance in the process of
                  collection are attached to the latter portion of the law. The first part of the law gives the weight of the solidus as four scruples, i.e.,
                  the exact theoretical weight of the normal solidus, but it then goes on to say that if anyone, presumably a taxpayer, should wish to weigh out
                  solidi, he should weigh out seven solidi for one ounce and fourteen solidi for two ounces. The latter portion of this first fragment of the
                  law therefore contradicts the given weight of the solidus. Mommsen, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la monnaie romaine</hi>, trans. <name
                     type="pname">Duc de Blacas</name>, III, pp. 64–5, says that the law of Valentinian (<hi rend="italic">C. Th.</hi>, XII, 6, 13) which
                  specified that there were seventy-two solidi to the pound was a restatement of the Constantinian law of 325 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> It
                  was therefore necessary to emend the reading of the Constantinian law. Since the law of 325 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> occurs in only one
                  manuscript, and that one is of Frankish origin, Mommsen supposed that the VII and XIV were inserted to accord with the Frankish system of
                  coinage in place of VI and XII. The fact that the solidus was still quoted at four scruples, he maintained, was the typical scribal error.

                  French summary of this work entitles "L’importance de la circulation monétaire byzantine pour les legs archéologique des Avares," published on
                  pages 245–255 of the same journal. On the coin from Szentes, which is cited by both of these authors, see Chapter three of this monograph.
                     <name type="pname">Csallány</name> notes that during the fifth to the seventh centuries Byzantine artifacts are found in the same region
                  and that they disappear at the same time as the coins and only reappear, as do the Byzantine coins, during the time of the Magyar conquest.
                  The Byzantines had active commercial relations with the Avars, as shown by the finds, at least as late as the year 668/70, and in the year
                  676/7 there was still direct contact between these peoples as shown by the Avar embassy which visited Constantinople at that time. Since no
                  coins of Justinian Rhinotmetus were, however, found in the area, the break must have come between 677 and 685. No coins of Constantine IV
                  Pogonatus that can be dated later than 681 have been found either, so that the period in question can be narrowed to the years 678–681. <name
                     type="pname">Csallány</name> suggests that the event which caused the sharp break in Byzantine-Avar relations was the Bulgarian invasion of
                  679 which created a barrier along the lower Danube. An interesting analogy can be made for the belief that the rise of the Avar kingdom itself
                  during the middle years of the sixth century resulted in the sharp break in the <name type="place">Scandinavian</name> trade of the Byzantines
                  at the same time as shown by the hoards from <name type="place">southern Scandinavia</name>. <name type="pname">Joachim Werner</name>, "Zu den

                  the other. This money is regarded with admiration by all men to whatever kingdom they belong, since there is no other country in which the
                  like of it exists," Cosmas tells us also that only the best gold coins were used in foreign commerce. It is, of course, well known that Cosmas
                  is most accurate with respect to the eastern trade of the Empire, but merchants are likely to have been equally careful in the western trade.

                  not only prohibits the supplying of gold to the barbarians in the course of trade, but it even states that if any is found among them, subtle
                  skill is to be used to bring it away. Merchants who traffic in gold among the barbarians are to be subject not only to fines but also to

            <head>THE COINS</head>
            <p>Probably the most important of the characteristics of the solidi under discussion is their weight. The treatment accorded these coins in the past
               has always been something less than scientific with respect to metrology. Pieces of poor condition or of doubtful origin have been confused and
               grouped with those of a single authentic series, and there has been an almost universal dependence upon the calculated average weights in the
               determination of the standards and the accuracy of minting.</p>
            <p>The brilliant Finnish numismatist and economic historian, <name type="pname">Gunnar Mickwitz</name>, before his untimely death, demonstrated
               conclusively the value of proper statistical technique in the use of the frequency curve for grouping and studying metrological data.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> His description of the technique is sufficiently complete to require little elaboration. Basically the methods of
               statistical analysis do not differ from one field of learning to another, but the conclusions derived may well be different.<ref target="#CH1-n2"
                  >2</ref> In numismatics it has been shown that in grouping metrological data according to the tally or frequency table, the step interval must
               be determined by the weight standard that was in use at the mint. Thus, if the tally were made on the basis of a step interval of
               three-hundredths of a gramme while the mint could only determine weights to two-tenths of a gramme accuracy, the frequency curve would be lower
               vertically and would show an unusual degree of multimodalism which might serve to obscure the actual theoretical standard at which the coins were
               struck as well as the measure of <pb n="37"/> accuracy of the mint. This will be graphically demonstrated at a later point.</p>
            <p>The graphic representation of the frequency table is most correctly given in the form of a histogram or skyline type of bar graph in which the
               frequencies are plotted on the vertical bar and the steps on the horizontal bar. If the laws of probability were the sole operating factors, the
               curve drawn through the histogram following the frequencies would be bell-shaped and symmetrical. As a result of the fact that coins which are
               struck <hi rend="italic">al-pezzo</hi> are adjusted as to weight and the heavier pieces are returned to the melting pot much more frequently than
               the lighter pieces, the frequency curve in numismatics commonly shows a higher degree of skewness than would normally be expected. Such skewness
               is not statistically a serious matter, but it is a graphic representation of the accuracy with which the weight of individual coins was adjusted
               at the mint. A more serious defect of great significance would be a bimodal curve or one which resembled the Asiatic camel in showing two humps
               or zeniths. If such a figure should result from the distribution of the metrological data, it would serve as visual evidence that the data was
               not homogeneous and that more than one standard of weight was involved. It would then be necessary to distinguish and separate the two series or
               denominations before treating the material further.</p>
            <p>The next step, of course, must be to measure in arithmetic terms the central tendency of the weights to gather around a single point with
               increasing frequency. This figure will give some indication of the theoretical weight at which the coins were struck. Clearly whatever value is
               determined will be below the theoretical weight by reason of wear and possibly seigniorage. The first of such measures of central tendency is
               simply the mode (Mo) or point of highest concentration on the frequency table. Manifestly this is a very crude measure because the modal point
               does not take into account the mass of metrologica! data which deviates from the modal step. Still another measure of central tendency is the
               mean (M) or average weight which, of course, is simply the result of the division of the sum of all of the weights by the number of instances or
               coins. This is a much finer measure of central tendency for metrological data, but it has the drawback that it weights the few coins which
               deviate widely from the central point <pb n="38"/> much more heavily than those which are nearer that point. Thus just a few coins which diverge
               widely from the central point of concentration can affect the result to a degree far out of proportion to their actual significance. The third
               measure of central tendency is the median (Mdn) which is nothing more than the mid-point in an array of weights or more exactly that point above
               which and below which fifty percent of the weights fall. The median value is more representative than the mean in that all weights enter into its
               calculation with exactly the same stress. It can be used with a greater degree of confidence in those instances in which a few atypical cases
               would distort the picture of the central tendency as measured by the mean.</p>
            <p>If the frequency curve were bell-shaped and perfectly symmetrical as in the case of the normal probability distribution, the mode, mean and
               median would all fall at the same point. In numismatics, as has been shown, this is not to be expected, particularly in the case of coins struck
                  <hi rend="italic">ai-pezzo</hi>, therefore the three values should be calculated, and the conclusions which are drawn from them must take the
               different values into account in terms of the natural or expected results of the minting process and the state of the coins.</p>
            <p>Next, the numismatist must calculate the measure of deviation or variability evident in the series of weights. Arithmetic expressions which will
               indicate the extent of variability are an absolute necessity for the numismatist. The simplest of all such numerical values, of course, is the
               range which is nothing more than the difference between the highest and lowest weights. It is without question the crudest of all such
               measurements because it is calculated solely on the basis of two weights and excludes the vast majority of the weights collected. The mean
               deviation (MD) is a much more useful measure for the numismatist because every single weight in the frequency table enters into its
               determination. It may be briefly defined as the mean of ZIDI the sum of all the deviations from the mean. The formula MD = <graphic
                  url="NNM138_038.jpg"/> is used to determine its value where Σ indicates the sum, N the number of weights, and D the deviation from the mean in
               each individual instance while the plus and minus signs are ignored. It will result in a value expressed in the same metrological units as the
               frequency table step interval, and that value when added to and <pb n="39"/> subtracted from the mean will cover the majority of the cases
               involved in the construction of the frequency curve. When calculated for the normal probability curve the value of the mean deviation will
               indicate a range within which approximately fifty-seven percent of the total area under the frequency curve will be included. If the value of the
               mean deviation were high, it would serve as a clear indication that either the coins were struck with very little or no adjustment of weight, as
               in the case of <hi rend="italic">al-marco</hi> minting, or else that more than one denomination or series of coins was involved in the collection
               of the data. Where two theoretical weights that were relatively close were involved there is the possibility that bimodalism would not be
               immediately evident from the frequency curve by visual inspection, but a high value for the mean deviation would certainly indicate that closer
               study was advisable.</p>
            <p>A further measure of deviation or variability is the so-called standard deviation (σ) which is usually too refined for use in numismatics. In
               calculating the standard deviation the formula σ = <graphic url="NNM138_039.jpg"/> which may be expressed as the square root of the mean of the
               squares of all deviations from the mean, is used. When the number of weights is small there is no need for such refined calculations. The value
               of σ is always larger than the mean deviation, and when measured off above and below the mean delimits the area for approximately the central
               sixty-eight percent of the cases on a normal probability curve.</p>
            <p>These measures of deviation or variability are not directly comparable with other measurements of deviations for other data. There is a definite
               need for an arithmetical expression to indicate relative variability. Since the means of two different series of coins are likely to be
               different, and this will often affect variability, the coefficient of variation (V) has been proposed to make allowance for the difference in the
               means. The formula to calculate the coefficient of variation is a simple one <graphic url="NNM138_039a.jpg"/>, and it makes comparisons possible.
               It is best to compare different series of coins or denominations to determine the accuracy of the minting process in terms of coefficients of
               variation rather than standard deviations or mean deviations. The coefficient of variation yields a numerical value in terms of a scale beginning
                  <pb n="40"/> with a zero point, and since metrological data is involved in the numismatic use of the frequency table it can be employed with
               confidence.</p>
            <p>The use of the frequency curve is, of course, covered in much greater detail in the work of <name type="pname">Gunnar Mickwitz</name> which has
               already been cited, and many of the examples which are given there for gold coinage can be used for comparison. <name type="pname"
                  >Mickwitz</name> plotted the frequency curves of gold coins during several periods in most scholarly fashion. The number of coin weights
               involved can be indicated by the letter N and the step interval by the lower case letter w. It is really unnecessary to construct the histogram
               to show the numerical values, and therefore only the tally and the results of <name type="pname">Mickwitz's</name> calculations will be
               reproduced. The curves themselves are readily accessible in <name type="pname">Mickwitz's</name> work.</p>
            <p>The gold issues from the period of Gallienus yielded some interesting results in that it was evident from the calculations that more that one
               standard of weights was involved.</p>

            <p>It is immediately evident that the frequency curve constructed on the basis of the distribution given above would be multimodal and that the
               average weight of 3.23 grammes would be a meaningless figure. The standard deviation of 1.324 grammes is better than a third of the mean weight
               of the coins and the coefficient of variation of 40.99 is so high that it cannot possibly be true for a single standard. A frequency curve
               constructed on the basis of 278 Roman denarii of the period from Nero to Septimius Severus yielded a coefficient of variation of only 6.94 while
               the silver was probably struck <hi rend="italic">al-marco</hi> and the gold must have been struck <hi rend="italic">ai-pezzo</hi>.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> The value of the frequency curve for detecting non-homogeneous gold coinage can be clearly seen in this example. Even
               though the step interval of 0.3 grammes is not very fine and Mickwitz may have used the method for calculations from grouped data, which is not
               as accurate as for ungrouped data, the character of the material stands out.</p>
            <p>Another example of a frequency curve based on gold coins was plotted by <name type="pname">Mickwitz</name> with the data published by <name
                  type="pname">Cesano</name> from the Via Po hoard of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> The
               373 gold coins in that hoard yielded results showing the accuracy of the minting of gold coins at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome"
                  >Rome</name>.</p>
            <p>It is immediately apparent that <name type="place">Mickwitz</name> has refined his calculations too much in the light of his data. It is possible

               of ± 0.0057 grammes is quite meaningless when referred to ancient mint practices. Such refined calculations can only give a distorted sense of
               accuracy, but the results are nevertheless quite revealing.</p>

            <p>Even though the coinage involved extends in time from the reign of Nero to the time of Lucius Verus inclusive, and the range from 7.6 grammes to
               6.5 grammes as a result of wear, the coefficient of variation is still only 2.26 as compared with 40.99 for the gold coinage of the period of
               Gallienus and 6.94 for the denarii from the reign of Nero through the reign of Septimius Severus. These coins were clearly struck <hi

               of symmetry which <name type="pname">Mickwitz</name> quite properly attributes to the fact that the hoard covers a full century of time and the
               more recent coins in the find were in excellent condition and had not been worn while others were quite worn. The more typical skewness is

            <p>All of the characteristics of the curve are accentuated by such a step interval. The very sharp decline in frequency on the positive side is now
               most evident. If a very large number of coins were involved this could eliminate a seeming bimodalism. Such bimodalism could, of course, be
               discounted on the basis of the arithmetic or numerical values calculated to measure the deviations, but if it appeared on the tally or frequency
               table without such calculations it, could be most disturbing.</p>

            <p>A frequency curve constructed on the basis of the weights of 459 solidi weights gathered by <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth</name> may
               be used to demonstrate this (Fig. 1), and at the same time it provides us with the finest basis of comparison for the frequency curves of the
               light weight solidi.<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> These coins cover the period from the reign of Anastasius through that of Constans II and are
               therefore directly comparable with the solidi studied in this book. Unfortunately each of the three <pb n="45"/> sources involved contained some
               of the light weight solidi, but since <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth</name> limited the range of the solidi included in his frequency
               table to those above 4.20 grammes but below 4.55 grammes, this difficulty is largely eliminated. Only in the rarest instances do any of the
               solidi in the several light weight series rise to weights of 4.20 grammes or better. The same may be said for the number of normal solidi which
               show weights above 4.55 grammes. Thus of the 150 solidi in the frequency curve from the Weber Collection and the Dortmund hoard only five weighed
               more than 4.55 grammes, and three of those five weighed 4.56 grammes. The overwhelming bulk of all of the solidi issued in the period 491-668 <hi
                  rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> certainly must fall into the range of 4.20-4.55 grammes. The few that are excluded could <pb n="46"/> not affect
               the results appreciably. A number of coins in the group, however, have been pierced, but even in this instance less than five percent of the
               coins are involved, and since in many instances the weights remained fairly high, it may be that the coins were punched rather than drilled or
               filed. In any event the exclusion of these pierced coins would only serve to bring the few coins in question into even greater alignment with the
               measurements of central tendency.</p>
            <p>The distribution as given by <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth</name> is multimodal with peaks at 4.47, 4.45, and 4.40 grammes.</p>
            <p>N = 459 w = 0.01 grammes M = 4.40 grammes Mo = 4.45 and 4.40 grammes with still another peak at 4.47 grammes Mdn = 4.41 grammes MD = 0.052
               grammes σ = 0.249 grammes V = 5.657</p>
            <p>Since the coefficient of variation is only 5.657 and the majority of the coins lie within 0.05 grammes of the mean, there is no question of a
               non-homogeneous group, and the multimodalism is the result of an improper step interval. Changing the step interval to 0.03 grammes will reduce
               the multimodalism even futher while the numerical values calculated to measure the central tendency and deviation remain constant (Fig. 2). The
               two histograms show this graphically as do the frequency tabulations.</p>

            <p>In the period following Constantine the <hi rend="italic">siliqua ami</hi> or <hi rend="italic">keration</hi> seems to have been the smallest
               weight used though it is probable that the Romans could detect and adjust weights to within half of a siliqua.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> In
               view of that fact we may assume that in the minting of gold the coinage was adjusted to the nearest half-siliqua.</p>

            <p>Since the <hi rend="italic">siliqua auri</hi> was valued at 0.1895 grammes of gold, the coinage would then have been adjusted to within 0.095
               grammes of the theoretical weight. If that is taken as the step interval, the bimodalism disappears completely and the accuracy of the Roman mint
               is immediately evident (Fig. 3).</p>

            <p>If the step interval used in the construction of the histogram is the same as the standard of accuracy at the mint, all of those characteristics
               which have been noted in the frequency curves studied thus far are accentuated. Thus the modal step of this distribution is that from 23–23½
               siliquae (4.36–4.45 grammes). The sharp decline in frequency on the positive side of the curve and the skewness of the curve towards the negative
               side are most clearly seen. More than fifty percent of the coins fall into the modal step which, however, is slightly larger than the mean
               deviation while the coefficient of variation (5.657) is low enough to indicate good adjustment of the coinage.</p>
            <p>That these coins were meant to circulate at a theoretical weight of twenty-four siliquae cannot be doubted. Solidi were defined in law as coins
               of four scruples or twenty-four siliquae.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> The deductions for <pb n="49"/> seigniorage and the wear that the coins
               have undergone account for an actual weight some two percent below the theoretical weight. The gold coins in the collections from which these
               weights were taken are generally in good condition, they are collectors’ pieces in the fullest sense of the word and have not undergone quite as
               much wear as might be expected. It may therefore be presumed that the major portion of the two percent weight differential can be accounted for
               as the charge for seigniorage. Undoubtedly the Byzantines did not calculate this as a percentage of the theoretical weight of the coin but simply
               issued their gold solidi about one-half of a siliqua light. This observation may be confirmed by reference to the fact that the frequency table
               for the solidi of the period 307-408 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> from the Dortmund hoard and Weber Collection shows approximately the same
               weight loss. They are also approximately half of a carat lighter than the theoretical weight.</p>
            <p>It is now possible, on the basis of the frequency curves that have already been reviewed in some detail, to study the frequency curves for the
               solidi of the light weight type. The Catalogue at the end of this book contains notes and descriptions concerning 183 coins. Some of these
               pieces, such as Coins nos. 13, 17, 22, 32, 37, 38, 53, 92, 100, 101, 102, 118, 125, 126, 136, 139, 141, 146, 153, 154, 155, 161, 162, 163, 164,
               167, 168, 169, 174, 176, 178, and 179, must be excluded from a frequency table because they are either pierced, mounted, looped, or clipped.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> With the possible exception of Coins nos. 125, 126, and 166 all of these operations affect the weight of the piece
               appreciably, and as a result these thirty-two solidi must be excluded from the <pb n="50"/> frequency table. In addition Coins nos. 19, 27, 31,
               35, 41, 43, 47, 48, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 76, 77, 84, 91, 94, 98, 108, 109, 113, 121, 123, 124, 131, 135, 147, 151,
               165, 173, 180, 181, and 182, are of unknown weight. These forty-two pieces must of necessity be excluded from the calculations. Thus the
               frequency curves can deal with only 109 coins. Certain of these 109 solidi, however, can be identified as barbaric in origin, and this reduces
               the number even further. Coins nos. 31, 32, 33, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 159, 181, 182, 183, are barbarian or derived from western mints of
               the Empire and not part of the light weight series under discussion, and of these Coins nos. 32 (clipped), 33, 72, 73, 74, 75, 78, 159, and 183
               have known weights. Thus the number of coins for the frequency table is reduced even further to only 101 pieces. The reasons for identifying
               these fifteen coins as barbaric or as not belonging to the light weight series will be discussed somewhat later. The 101 coins that remain may be
               divided according to the exergual marks and presented in the form of grouped data for a frequency curve. The weights are calculated to the
               nearest hundredth of a gramme.</p>

            <p>As far as can be determined there is no evident relationship between the so-called <hi rend="italic">officina</hi> marks at the end of the
               reverse inscriptions and the weights except that the mark ΘS does not occur for this series. All of emperors of the period from Justinian through
               Constantine IV Pogonatus struck coins of this type except Tiberius Constantine. Almost eighty-two percent of the coin weights are within o.o5ths
               of a gramme of the mean weight, and the coefficient of variation is only 4.978. Only two of the coins equal the weight of twenty siliquae fully,
               but if the same type of deduction of half a carat is made for seigniorage and wear, then we might assume an actual weight of 19½ siiiquae for
               these coins when they left the mint. Of course, the theoretical weight of the coins was meant to be twenty siiiquae, and the interpretation of
               the inscription OBXX is probably OB (<hi rend="italic">ryzum</hi>) XX (<hi rend="italic">viginti</hi>) (<hi rend="italic">siiiquae</hi>).</p>

            <p>Obviously there are not enough weights for a scientific treatment, but they extend between twenty-two and twenty-three and one half carats. Two
               of the four recorded weights are between twenty-two and one half and twenty-three carats. The determination of the standard on which these coins
               were minted, however, rests most decisively on the expansion of the ligature ГК or ГК. One of the letters of that ligature is clearly a <hi
                  rend="italic">kappa</hi>, but is the other one to be read as a <hi rend="italic">pi</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">gamma</hi>? Numismatists have
               read the inscription in both ways, with a <hi rend="italic">gamma</hi> as well as with a <hi rend="italic">pi.</hi> It seems fairly certain that
               the ligature in both forms was intended to stand for a single group of two letters, and from the position of the letters BO in relation to each
               other the inscription is retrograde. It is also to be noted that the first retrograde exergual markings on the light weight solidi are to be
               found during the joint reigns of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine and just precede the reign of Constans II. Other light weight solidi from
               the reign of Constans II (Coins nos. 176 and 177) have clearly discernible retrograde inscriptions, BOXX. If the ligature is read in retrograde
               fashion as <hi rend="italic">kappa-gamma</hi>, it would be in conformity with the few weights that we possess and would indicate coinage issued
               at twenty-three siliquae. If, on the other hand, the ligature is read as <hi rend="italic">kappa-pi</hi> in retrograde fashion the anomalous
               numerical value is twenty plus eighty or 100, which could only be taken to indicate coinage at 1/100th of a Roman pound. The practice of
               indicating the relationship of the solidus to the pound by the figure LXXII in the field is known for the Constantinian period, but 1/100th of a
               Roman pound is 17.28 siliquae, and all of the weights for these coins would then be <pb n="55"/> extremely high. Perhaps even more striking is
               the fact that since it has been shown that the inscription is retrograde, it should follow the Greek practice of arithmetical notation which <hi
                  rend="italic">kappa-gamma</hi> does, but which <hi rend="italic">kappa-pi</hi> does not. The Greek letter <hi rend="italic">rho</hi> would be
               used to indicate ioo. In writing Greek numerals the larger number usually precedes the smaller one. The <hi rend="italic">kappa-gamma</hi>
               expansion of the ligature satisfies that requirement, whereas even if we presume that the addition of eighty plus twenty (ПК) was used to
               indicate 100 (P), which in itself would be a source of surprise, the retrograde character of the inscription would show the unusual form of
               twenty plus eighty (KΠ).<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> Only the reading ВОГК or “twenty-three carats of gold of the Constantinopolitan standard"
               will satisfy the requirements, if this exergual mark is taken to be a notation of the weight or standard of the coin as seems to be indicated by
               the letters BO. The only other possibility is that the ligature ГК stands for some phrase which is otherwise unrecognizable in relation to coins.
               One cannot presume the existence of such a phrase, and as a result "twenty-three carats of gold of the Constantinopolitan standard" seems fairly
               certain.</p>
            <p>The third and last series of coins to be discussed from the metro-logical standpoint are those marked OB⁕+⁕, OB+⁕ or BO<graphic
                  url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/>. The range of these coins is from 4.21 to 3.35 grammes, and the two coins marked OB<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/>
               and CO<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/> are at the lower end of the scale, but they appear to be badly worn. It seems certain that the mark
                  CO<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/> is an error for OB<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/>. The coins marked OB⁕+⁕ are distributed in such fashion
               that it is possible that <name type="pname">Justin II</name> began this series somewhat above the indicated weight for the coins marked OB+⁕, but
               it hardly seems likely that there are two separate denominations so close to one another that the series of weights for the heavier one merely
               continues that of the lighter one. In addition, as will be shown, the measurement of deviation in the case of these coins leads to the conclusion
               that a single series is involved and that the individual exergual marks are simply abbreviations or fuller versions of the same mark.</p>
            <pb n="56"/>
            <p>In this case the coins cover only the reigns from <name type="pname">Justinian</name> through the joint reigns of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius Constantine</name>. The striking of these coins must have cerne
               to an end before 630 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> when Heracleonas was raised in rank. It should also be noted that the marks in the exergues
               are found in all forms during the reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, but that in the reign of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> only
               OB⁕+⁕ occurs and that afterwards only OB+⁕ was used. Also the mint mark ΘS is strongly associated with these coins and only with these coins. In
               the reign of Justinian one of these coins is found with the mint mark Θ. After that the mint mark is always given as ΘS save for one instance
               where as a result of a double striking the mark is ΘSS. Certainly the obverse die of Coin no. 79 which on the reverse bears the mint mark ΘS and
               the exergual inscription OB⁕+⁕ was used to strike another coin with the mint mark A on the reverse and the normal exergual inscription CCNOB.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n13">13</ref> Either one must suppose the unlikely possibility that the obverse die was sent frcm one <hi rend="italic"
                  >officina</hi> or mint to another or that one mint or <hi rend="italic">officina</hi> used used more than one mint mark for the purpose of
               striking coins in the name of another mint or for seme other purpose. This latter suggestion would be in accord with the <name type="pname"
                  >Jungfleisch</name> hypothesis which was explained in the previous chapter.</p>

            <p>The measurements of central tendency fall about twenty-one siliquae (mean = 4.00 grammes; mode = 4.03 grammes; and median = 4.06 grammes), but a
               relatively large number of coins are twenty-one and a half siliquae or more, so the theoretical weight of these coins must be above twenty-one
               and a half siliquae, or the adjustment of weight for this particular series of gold coins must be assumed to have been very poor. The poor
               condition of some of these pieces can be seen reflected in the broad range of the weights, but the fact that the coefficient of variation is only
               4.255 indicates quite clearly that the frequency table was composed of a homogeneous <pb n="58"/> group of coins in varying states of condition
               or wear. With this in mind, it may be stated that the coins were actually struck at twenty-one and a half carats, which, when the half carat is
               added to cover seigniorage and wear, as seems to be normal in the case of solidi, would yield a theoretical weight of twenty-two carats. This is
               in accordance with the findings of <name type="pname">Schindler</name> and <name type="pname">Kalmann</name>. Fully twenty-five of the thirty-two
               coins have weights falling above twenty-one and below twenty-two carats.</p>
            <p>The theoretical and actual weights of the ninety-seven Byzantine solidi that could be discussed in terms of a frequency table have now been
               covered in some detail, but fifteen additional coins were earlier referred to as barbaric or not belonging to the light weight series, and in the
               case of nine of these coins (one of which was clipped) the weights were known. These coins were excluded because of their barbaric origin which
               must now be shown to be decisive. This issue is most properly argued on grounds of style, fabric, and numismatic epigraphy. The authentic
               Byzantine solidus is generally better modelled than the barbarian imitations and the letters of the inscription show a greater degree of care. As
               an example of a clearly barbarous piece Coin no. 33 may be studied. The bust of Justinian on the obverse is so poorly done and the legend is so
               garbelled that there can be no doubt of its origin. Close observation will show that the form of the letter <graphic url="NNM138_sym2.jpg"/> in
               the exergue on the reverse is western and probably Italic. The С in the reverse legend is sharply angular while true Byzantine solidi show a more
               rounded variety of С On the reverse the head of the Victory is scarcely more than a slight swelling with no modelling while the wings and drapery
               of the same figure are scarcely more than lines, and the upper edge of the wings form a continuous arc with the upper edge of the body of the
               Victory. These qualities stand in sharp contrast the normal Byzantine figure on the solidus. Lastly, but by no means least important, the Victory
               holds a globe surmounted by a cross whereas only very rarely do the authentic light weight Byzantine solidi display the <hi rend="italic">globus
                  cruciger</hi> though the solidi of normal weight always show it. <name type="pname">Stefan</name> suggested that this coin might have been
               struck in Pannonia by the Lombards at some time around 560 A.D., but definitely prior to 584/85. The location of the spot where this solidus was
               found is unknown.</p>
            <pb n="59"/>
            <p>Coin no. 32 shows many of the same traits with the added feature that the eyes of the Victory are in reality rondules in annulets. For purposes
               of comparison 126 separate dies for obverses of authentic Byzantine solidi known from actual handling, photographs, casts, or rubbings are
               gathered in the plates to this volume. A total of 121 reverse dies from the same sources are also gathered there. Unfortunately three sets of die
               impressions have been badly mutilated and should really be excluded from this study, so that the figures are reduced to 123 and 118 respectively.
               The line drawings, of course, must be excluded from any such study. The peculiar exergual marks of coins no. 31, 32, 33 in the Catalogue merely
               confirm the conclusion arrived at from a study of the letter forms and style as compared with the authentic Byzantine pieces. Even though Coin
               no. 31 is only known from a line drawing and description, it is so similar to Coin no. 32 that it seems obvious that it must be barbaric as well.
               The exergual marks (OBX+X and OBXT) prove conclusively that they are imitations of the light weight solidi.</p>
            <p>The light weight solidi of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> were also imitated as shown by six coins of that group (Coins nos. 72-77) which
               are known from photographs. Still a seventh may be added, if the exergual mark of Coin no. 78 may be taken as any indication. Once again, in the
               case of the six coins which are known from photographs, the <hi rend="italic">globus cruciger</hi> appears on the reverse in the hand of the
               personified Constantinople wearing the mural crown. The authentic light weight series, it should be remembered, usually lack the cross which,
               however, is always present on the normal Byzantine solidi. Coin no. 75 (<ref target="#fig-67">PLATE VI, 75</ref>) displays the garbelled
               inscription as well as the poor modelling which hardly stands comparison with the authentic pieces. The exergual markings (CXNXU, COX+<graphic
                  url="NNM138_sym3.jpg"/>, COИX+<graphic url="NNM138_sym4.jpg"/>, CONX+ CONX+<graphic url="NNM138_sym5.jpg"/>, CONX+x, and CX+X÷) can only be
               composed of a combination of the normal CONOB and the light solidus markings OBXX or more likely OB⁕+⁕.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> In the
               matter of the coin weights and the authenticity of the coins <name type="pname">Schindler</name> and <name type="pname">Kalmann</name> have been
                  <pb n="60"/> proven to be correct as opposed to the other authors who have accepted the views of <name type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name>
               and <name type="pname">Friedrich Stefan</name>.</p>
            <p>Since the reverses of the solidi of the reign of Tiberius Constantine are distinguished from those of preceding reigns by the fact that the type
               is simply a cross potent on four steps, the discussion of style, not fabric, of course, largely hinges upon the obverse. Portraiture on most, if
               not all Byzantine coins, is conventional, and, as a result, opinions can only be expressed with greath reserve. Coins nos. 180, 181, and 182 of
               the reign of Tiberius Constantine with the exergual mark C+N+B, however, can be connected with Coin no. 183 of the reign of Maurice Tiberius with
               the same exergual mark and the reverse of the standing Victory facing front which was restored by that ruler. No reproductions of Coins nos. 181
               and 182 were available, and only a very poor reproduction in a sale catalogue of 1886 could be secured for the study of the remaining coin of
               Tiberius Constantine with that exergual mark. Coin no. 183, however, is in the posession of the British Museum which very kindly furnished a cast
               of the piece and a statement of its weight, the only one available for solidi with that mark. It should be noted that though the mint mark ΘS is
               very strongly associated with at least one series of light weight solidi, so strongly in fact that all of the solidi of that group struck in the
               reign of Tiberius Constantine bear it, it is not found on solidi with the exergual mark C+N+B. The only weight available, however, is that of the
               coin in the British Museum which is in excellent condition but weighs only 4.04 grammes. The four coins in question are clearly of western
               origin, if any judgement may be made on the basis of the two reproductions available. A sharp almost incised quality of portraiture and lettering
               with a raised circular border is the most characteristic trait of such pieces, and it is very marked on the coins in question. In addition the
               letter forms are decisively western, for on the coin of Tiberius Constantine we find Dო and on that of Maurice Tiberius DNო. The reverse of the
               solidus of Maurice Tiberius also shows the western form of the long cross ending with the letter <hi rend="italic">rho</hi>, a form which
               resembles a bishop's crozier with a cross bar. This piece also displays the Victory holding a <hi rend="italic">globus cruciger</hi> which is
               further reason for eliminating it from the light weight series under discussion despite the fact that it does not approach the normal weight of
               the solidus. <pb n="61"/> This last fact, of course, is not at all decisive. From the evidence presented it may be concluded that the solidi with
               C+N+B are of western origin and not part of the light weight series of coins that form the subject of this book.</p>
            <p>Before leaving these pieces, however, it should be noted that certain changes in the matter of imperial portraiture were introduced during these
               two reigns. <name type="pname">Tiberius Constantine</name> was the first of the emperors to discard the traditional helmet head-dress found on
               solidi showing the emperor in armor in favor of a crown surmounted by a cross while retaining the cuirass and horseman device shield. <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name> reverted to the helmet with plume but discarded the horseman device shield
               which only reappeared during the reign of Constantine IV Pogonatus. He also added the imperial <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> with the strands of
               pearls suspended. This <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> had not been represented on solidi of the full-face front type before, but it had been shown
               on some of the earlier solidi and on the fractional gold coinage. Solidi of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>
               in military dress with cuirass and horseman device shield but wearing a helmet surmounted by a cross and without the <hi rend="italic"
                  >fibula</hi> are known both in the normal series of solidi and in the light weight group.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> Dated bronzes of the
               type with the cross instead of the plume occur for several years scattered throughout the reign of <name type="pname">Marice Tiberius</name>, and
               it would therefore be unsound to regard a piece such as Coin no. 99 as an intermediate type before the revival of the helmet with plume type.</p>
            <p>Still another solidus of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name> (Coin no. 90, <ref target="#fig-82">PLATE VII,
                  90</ref>) must be discussed. This coin shows the authentic exergual mark OB+⁕, but it depicts the Victory on the reverse with a <hi
                  rend="italic">globus cruciger</hi> in the left hand and the weight of the solidus is 4.05 grammes. The reverse type would be sufficient for a
               critical examination of the coin. It is a solidus of western origin as shown by the quality of the sharp relief and the mint mark P at the end of
               the reverse inscription which is normally, at an earlier date, attributed to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_ravenna">Ravenna</name> though this piece does not appear to be of that mint. The
               obverse of this solidus does not seem to be of the fine caliber which is normally expected of <pb n="62"/> solidi of this period. This is most
               noticeable in the drapery and on the cuirass, but it can also be seen in the helmet and face. A circular or rather semicircular ornament is found
               on the front of the other solidi which depict the Emperor wearing a helmet with a plume. It is most noticeably absent on this coin. These
               features would point towards a barbarian origin for this coin. It is, however, most difficult to decide the origin of a solidus such as this.
               Certain features of the gold piece are unique, but the general appearance of the coin may well be too fine to accept it as an imitation. It is
               probably an authentic Byzantine piece, but it certainly has some unusual features. In any event it has been included in the frequency table
               despite this unique character.</p>
            <p>The last of these solidi (Coin no. 159, <ref target="#fig-141">PLATE XII, 159</ref>) omitted from the distribution is a quite obvious barbaric
               imitation of a piece of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius Constantine</name>. In
               the exergue of the reverse the inscription XVOX can be read. This solidus really requires very little discussion because it is so clearly
               barbaric in style, inscription and over-all character.</p>
            <p>The forms of the frequency tables have therefore been adequately justified, and the results must be considered conclusive. Solidi of twenty
               carats theoretical weight were issued marked OBXX or BOXX in the exergue of the reverse. Still others of twenty-two carats theoretical weight
               were issued marked OB<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/>, OB+⁕, or OB⁕+⁕. The first series was issued in the reigns of <name type="pname"
                  >Justinian</name>, <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>, <name
                  type="pname">Phocas</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> sole reign, <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius Constantine</name> joint reign, Constans II, and Constantine IV
               Pogonatus. A gap occurs in this series during the reign of <name type="pname">Tiberius Constantine</name>, but this lacuna was then filled with
               solidi of twenty-two carats theoretical weight which had also been introduced by <name type="pname">Justinian</name> (see Coins nos. 1, 28, 29,
               and 30), but which became prominent during the reign of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and continued to be struck with some frequency
               through the reign of Phocas. Only a single coin of that type is known for the reigns of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius"
                  >Heraclius</name> and <name type="pname">Heraclius Constantine</name>. Finally coins of approximately twenty-three carats marked BOГK were
               struck in the reign of Constans II. These last pieces occur only for that reign.</p>
            <p>Solidi of reduced weight were not as rare during the sixth and seventh centuries as has usually been assumed. Bauer reports that Zograph had seen
               a hoard of coins and other utensils from the Dnieper <pb n="63"/> Delta, and that the hoard contained six pieces of Heraclius and one of Constans
               II. All of the solidi of the three emperor type were marked BOXX.<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> He also tells of sixty-one gold coins found
               together with gold and silver utensils discovered by <name type="pname">herdsmen</name> in 1912 not far from Pereschtschepino. Only four of the
               coins had not been used in the manufacture of ornaments. Thirty-six of the coins were of the three emperor type of Heraclius, and of these only
               one coin had the usual CONOB marking in the exergue. Twenty-seven of these coins were marked BOXX, and it should be noted that only two obverse
               dies and four reverse dies were used to strike the entire twenty-seven pieces. Four separate die combinations occur because seventeen of the
               coins were struck with one set of dies, six with another combination, two with a third, and two with still a fourth. The same hoard from
               Pereschtschepino yielded eight more solidi of the three emperor type, in addition to the twenty-seven marked BOXX, which were marked BOXX+. All
               eight were struck from the same pair of dies, but since no examples of this type are known outside of the <name type="place">Soviet Union</name>
               at least one more reverse die may be added to the list of die impressions studied. The same author reports that the Pereschtschepino hoard
               contained sixteen coins of Constans II marked BOXX struck from two obverse dies and four reverse dies. Eight were struck with one combination,
               five with a second pair, two with still a third set of dies, and one with a fourth.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> Some of these dies from the
               eastern hoards may well be represented in the plates of this monograph, but there is no certainty of this.</p>
            <p>A close study of the solidi listed in the catalogue reveals that there are a number of die identities. Of the twenty-five sets of die impressions
               of Byzantine solidi of the light weight series issued by <name type="pname">Justinian</name> only twenty-one obverse dies and twenty reverse dies
               could be distinguished.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> Twenty-nine obverse and twenty-eight reverse <pb n="64"/> dies of light weight solidi of
                  <name type="pname">Justin II</name> are known as well as one set of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and <name type="pname">Tiberius II
                  Constantine</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> Of the eight light weight series coins of Tiberius Constantine alone which were studied
               only two were struck from the same pair of dies.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> Eleven more sets of dies of this series are known for the reign
               of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>. During the reign of Phocas seven coins were struck from three sets of
               dies, and the other seven coins showed no die identities.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> Thus there were ten separate die impressions for the
               obverse and ten for the reverse for the reign of Phocas. <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> sole reign is
               represented by two more sets of dies. But the joint reign of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> and <name
                  type="pname">Heraclius Constantine</name> presented only thirty-two authentic solidi that could be studied accurately, and three of these were
               too multilated for die analysis. Twenty-seven separate obverses were recognizable as were twenty-four reverses.<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref>
               There were five specimens of the three emperor type that might be studied, and from these there was one die identity of the reverse.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> Eight sets of dies of Constans II might be distinguished because four of the solidi of that Emperor were evidently
               struck from two sets of dies.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref> Two sets of dies of Constans II, Constantine IV Pogonatus, Heraclius and Tiberius,
               and two more sets of Constantine IV Pogonatus, Heraclius and Tiberius complete the series. Thus 123 obverse dies and 118 reverse dies, excluding
               those too mutilated for <pb n="65"/> study, can be set as a minium figure. The obverse dies can be omitted from further calculation because as
               was shown in the case of Coin no. 79 the same obverse might be used for the normal solidi and for the light weight series. Light weight solidi,
               however, in the light of the 118 separate reverse dies known, cannot have been too rare. Even if the six reverse BOГK dies are excluded there
               still remain in dies of authentic light weight solidi which may be studied.</p>
            <p>It is also obvious that these light weight solidi must have been well known to the barbarians. Most of the barbaric imitations from the West are
               imitations of the earlier phase of this coinage while the hoards from the <name type="place">Ukraine</name> are sufficient to demonstrate that in
               the seventh century at least, light weight solidi were moving up the great eastern <name type="place">European rivers</name>. Two sets of die
               impressions of the barbarous imitations of light weight solidi of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> are known. Six more for the reign of <name
                  type="pname">Justin II</name> with still another for the joint reigns of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine prove this beyond question. The
               meaning of the exergual mark was not clearly understood, but it was associated among the barbarians with light weight currency as shown by the
               weights of the imitations.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> There can be no doubt of the western origin of these imitations for the characteristic
               features of such coinage are plainly visible. The authentic Byzantine light weight solidi, however, were struck chiefly in the East. Solidi of
               such undoubted eastern origin with a flat fabric such as those at the end of the series must be compared with Coin no. 22 which shows western
               style. This is a point of some importance which will be recalled when a solution to the riddle of these solidi is given in the last chapter.</p>
            <p>Still one further factor regarding these coins remains to be treated. The metallic content or alloy of precious metal coinage is of importance at
               least equal to the weight. There is no question but that changes in the weight of coins of such widespread distribution as the solidus would be
               detected very rapidly as the coin changed hands. This is not as true of the alloy particularly among the western barbarians. The <pb n="66"/>
               Byzantine government by use of the formula CONOB on its gold coinage had indicated "gold of the standard or quality of Constantinople." <name
                  type="pname">Jungfleisch</name> suggested that the imperial government, however, also issued gold at less than twenty-four carats of purity,
               and though he gives no series of analyses to support that contention he proposes the following relationship between the exergual marks and the
               gold content.</p>

            <p>In the time of Valentinian I the letters OB were applied to solidi to indicate that they were made of refined gold. It was also during the reign
               of Valentinian that the first of a series of laws required that gold payments to the imperial treasury be reduced to bullion and tested for
               purity as a result of the numerous forgeries of solidi that were of improper alloy.<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> There also seems to have been
               an official known as the <hi rend="italic">Comes auri</hi> in the West whose duty it was to certify that the gold was of the proper degree of
                  fineness.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="67"/>
            <p>Thus the literary evidence that the Byzantine government took cognizance of solidi of less than the proper alloy is decisive. But imitations of
               gold could also be produced that were difficult to detect. Procopius speaks of the bronze (χαλкòς) equestrian statue of Justinian in the
               Augusteum at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</name> and says that this brass was softer in color than pure gold and was valued not much below
               an equivalent weight of silver.<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> It was probably bronze of this sort which was used in the production of
               counterfeits such as those of gilded copper (<hi rend="italic">aereum deauratum</hi>) with which Clovis bribed the <hi rend="italic">leudes</hi>
               of Ragnacher.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> The fraud was only discovered sometime later, after the damage had already been done. Nor is this
               the only example of such a fraud perpetrated upon supposedly intelligent people during the early years of the Byzantine Empire. In a later
               passage Gregory of Tours tells of the Saxons paying many thousand pieces of gold to King Guntram for the privilege of crossing the <name
                  type="place">Rhone</name>. Having crossed the <name type="place">Rhone</name>, the Saxons came into Auvergne in the springtime, and there they
               produced, instead of gold, stamped bars of bronze (<hi rend="italic">regulae aeris incisas pro auro</hi>). The people who saw these bars did not
               doubt that they were tested and proven gold because of the fine color that had been given to the metal by some clever process. Many persons were
               tricked by this device and gave their good money for the bronze and were reduced to poverty.<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> This bronze is very
               reminiscent of the equestrian statue of Justinian.</p>
            <p>The fact that the Dortmund hoard contained pale colored coins of what was apparently bad alloy confirms that such poor coinage <pb n="68"/>
               passed in the West. Plated coins were known to have been struck in the names of several rulers of the later fourth century.<ref target="#CH1-n32"
                  >32</ref> Such coins were most probably forgeries because the debasement of gold was specifically prohibited by the <name type="pname">Emperor
                  Tacitus</name>, and proscriptions against it are contained in the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> Many decrees
               refer to the counterfeiting of solidi, and several of these use the phrase <hi rend="italic">adulterina nomismata</hi> or the like.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> Clearly it was against the interests of the Byzantine state to have such debased solidi circulate within the <pb
                  n="69"/> empire, but there can be no question but that they did circulate in the West. In 458 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> the Emperor <name
                  type="pname">Majorian</name> issued a <hi rend="italic">Novella</hi> which has already been cited in connection with the work done by <name
                  type="pname">Monneret De Villard</name> and <name type="pname">Blanchet</name>: <hi rend="italic">Praetera nullus solidum integri ponderis
                  calumniosae improbationes obtentu recuset exactor, excepto eo Gallico, cuius aurum minore aestimatione taxalur; omnia concussionum removeatur
                  occasio</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This passage can only be taken as referring to Gallic solidi of full weight (<hi rend="italic">integri ponderis</hi>) which were of less value
               because of poor alloy. Solidi which were not of full weight did not fall under the provisions of this law, and the phrase <hi rend="italic">cuius
                  aurum minore aestimatione taxatur</hi> must be taken as referring to the alloy.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> Solidi of improper gold alloy
               were circulating in Gaul in sufficient quantity so that the imperial government took cognizance of the fact in its laws. This is undeniable.</p>
            <p>In addition to the passages already cited and the debased solidi which were mentioned, a barbarian law code contains a passage which is most
               easily interpreted as referring to such debased gold coinage. The Burgundian Code includes such a passage which has excited much comment : <hi
                  rend="italic">De monetis solidorum [iubemus] custodire, ut omne aurum, quodcumque pensaverit, accipiatur praeter quattuor tantum monetas, hoc
                  est: Valentiani [Valentiniani</hi> in another MS.) <hi rend="italic">Genavensis prioris et Gotici qui a tempore Aland regis adaerati sunt et
                  Ardaricianos. Quod si <pb n="70"/> quicumque praeter istas quattuor monetas aurum pensantem non acceperit, id quod vendere volebat, non
                  accepto pretto perdat</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The date of this passage has been a matter of some dispute among the various editors, but it is sufficient for our purposes to point out that it
               cannot be later than 534 A.D., which year witnessed the extinction of the independent Burgundian kingdom. De Salis has dated it in the first
               years of Godomarus, the last Burgundian king, who ascended the throne in 524 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref> This passage, however, says that all solidi regardless of weight are to be accepted except four groups which are
               specifically excluded. The four groups of solidi excluded are clearly not omitted from the law by reason of weight but for some other cause. This
               other cause can only be the purity of the metal.</p>
            <p>The first class of such solidi barred from usage are those called <hi rend="italic">Valentiani</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Valentiniani</hi>,
               depending upon the reading. Here it should be recalled that it was during the reign of Valentinian I, in 366/7 A.D., that it was ordered by
               imperial decree that all solidi submitted to the Fiscus be melted down so that the metal could be tested for purity. The number of so-called
               adulterated coins in circulation required drastic measures. At the same time, in the <hi rend="italic">Notitia dignitatum occidentalis</hi>, the
                  <hi rend="italic">Comes auri</hi> was recorded as an official of the Empire in the West. Imperial solidi began to be marked OB to signify the
               purity of the metal. Indeed the coins themselves bear out the literary evidence. In the Dortmund hoard certain pale gold imitations of Byzantine
               solidi occur.<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> These coins of pale gold, <pb n="71"/> however, have a weight not below 4.30 grammes and thus fall
               within the range of the solidus. They occur most numerously struck in the names of <name type="pname">Valentinian I</name> and <name type="pname"
                  >Valens</name>, but are also known bearing the name of <name type="pname">Magnentius</name> and <name type="pname">Valentinian II</name>. They
               are clearly barbaric imitations of the coins of those rulers. The mint marks are those of Lyons and Treves. Dortmund, where they were found, is
               not very far from the Rhine, so that it is likely that these strange pieces could have passed up and down the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6941859">Rhine Valley</name> and across the Rhine into the fourth century Empire and even into the later Burgundian realm
               to be memorialized in the manner that has been set forth.</p>
            <p>These pieces are clearly not the products of an official mint of the Empire. The style is much inferior to the imperial coinage of the period. In
               at least one instance the obverse die of a solidus, bearing the name of Valentinian, mint marked Lugdunum was used to strike another imitation
               with a reverse borrowed from the types struck at Thessalonica. One solidus of Gratian is marked TRPS in the exergue. This mint mark indicates
               pure silver of the Treveran mint and cannot possible have been an error of an official moneyer.<ref target="#CH1-n40">40</ref>
               <name type="pname">Blanchet</name> would attribute these pale gold solidi to the Germanic peoples across the Rhine, most probably the Alemanni.
               There is no evidence to support this aside from the site of the Dortmund hoard which is not in itself conclusive. It might well be that the coins
               are the result of native Gallo-Roman forgers.</p>
            <p>The coins of Valentinian I (364-375 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>) are in no sense underweight as compared with solidi of other regions, and it
               seems fairly certain that the explanation given above is the correct one. In the <pb n="72"/> Dortmund hoard 112 solidi of this Emperor have a
               total weight of 494.73 grammes, and, therefore, an average weight of 4.42 grammes. In the Weber Collection five solidi (nos. 2719, 2722, 2724,
               2726, and 2729) have weights of 4.47, 4.46, 4.48, 4.40, and 4.41 grammes respectively.<ref target="#CH1-n41">41</ref> In the case of Valens
               (364–378 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>) forty-seven solidi in the Dortmund hoard, four of which are barbarian pale gold coins, have a total
               weight of 207.84 grammes and, therefore, an average weight of 4.42 grammes. The Weber Collection (nos. 2732, 2737,2739, and 2743) solidi have
               weights of 4.46, 4.48, 4.44, and 4.45 grammes respectively.<ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref> In the case of Valentinian II (375-392 <hi
                  rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>) forty-four solidi of the Dortmund hoard have a total weight of 195.35 grammes and an average weight of 4.44
               grammes. The Weber Collection (nos. 2760, 2761, 2763, and 2767) solidi weigh 4.46, 4.30, 4.50, and 4.53 grammes respectively.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n43">43</ref> The Dortmund hoard is of no use for the weights of the solidi of Valentinian III (425–455 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                  >A.D.</hi>). The Weber Collection solidi (nos. 2823, and 2826) have weights of 4.40 and 4.48 grammes. A hoard of fourth and fifth century
               solidi found near <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</name> contained seven coins of Valentinian III of which the maximum weight was
               4.51 grammes and the average weight 4.38 grammes.<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref>

            <pb n="73"/>
            <p>Other suggestions have been made in explanation of the passage cited from the Burgundian Code. Thus, for example, <name type="pname">Keary</name>
               would propose that <hi rend="italic">Valentiani</hi> is to be taken as indicative of coins struck in the town of Valence.<ref target="#CH1-n45"
                  >45</ref> This passage does mention those coins known as <hi rend="italic">Genavensis prioris</hi>, but this is not indicative of the fact
               that the other coins mentioned are also described by the mint. Indeed those called <hi rend="italic">Gotici</hi> quite obviously are not thus
               denominated. Furthermore, the Frankish mint of Valence was not opened before the late sixth century, and the mint of that name in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> was opened by the Visigothic rulers <name type="pname">Suinthila</name> (621-631 <hi
                  rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>), <name type="pname">Chintila</name> (636-640 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>), and <name type="pname">Egica</name>
               (687-700 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>), all of whom lived long after the promulgation of this law.<ref target="#CH1-n46">46</ref> Only the
               explanation suggested above seems to fit the facts.</p>
            <p>The second group of solidi, denominated as <hi rend="italic">Genavensis prioris</hi>, present a seemingly insoluble problem. None of the variants
               in the manuscripts are of any aid save for the fact that the word <hi rend="italic">prioris</hi> may not have occurred in the original text. This
               word <hi rend="italic">prioris</hi> has been taken by <name type="pname">Bluhme</name> to signify a group of coins which were supposedly struck
               by <name type="pname">Godegiselus</name>, the brother of <name type="pname">Gundobad</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n47">47</ref> But the Burgundian
               coinage, as far as can be determined, began only during the reign of Gundobad which, for the most part, follows that of Godegiselus. This
               explanation is clearly unsatisfactory. If the Burgundian coinage is post <pb n="74"/> 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> in origin, then this
               passage can hardly refer to native currency, and the word <hi rend="italic">prioris</hi> should be part of the text.<ref target="#CH1-n48"
                  >48</ref> The only explanation which might have some grain of truth in it is that of Keary. That author suggests that in the payment of taxes
               in the early Middle Ages the specie that was collected was often brought to the local moneyer who minted it with the distinctive mark of the
                  town.<ref target="#CH1-n49">49</ref> Possibly the town of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2660646">Geneva</name> was noted for the poor
               alloy of the coins struck there. This cannot be proved, and no Visigothic or Roman coins of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2660646"
                  >Geneva</name> are known, but no other explanation will fit. Some Genevan coins are attributed to the Frankish period which is later.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n50">50</ref> The meaning in this case still remains uncertain.</p>
            <p>The third group of solidi are the <hi rend="italic">Gotici, qui a tempore Alanci regis adaerati sunt.</hi> A letter of <name type="pname">St.
                  Avitus</name>, of the year 509 A.D., supports the contention that the passage refers to adulterated or debased coinage and specifically
               mentions the Gothic king, who must be Alaric II, who had very recently adulterated the coinage.<ref target="#CH1-n51">51</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The last of those solidi which are unacceptable are those called <hi rend="italic">Ardariciani</hi>, This single word has excited more comment
               than any other in the entire decree. <name type="pname">Bluhme</name> would suggest that the coins of <pb n="75"/> Aduris or Aturis, the town in
               which the <hi rend="italic">Breviary</hi> of Alaric was issued, are meant.<ref target="#CH1-n52">52</ref> A difficulty arises in this connection,
               however, for no Visigothic mint beginning with the letter A, let alone Aturis or Aduris, which is not listed at all, occurs before the reign of
               Reccared (586-601).<ref target="#CH1-n53">53</ref> A gold triens of the proper weight struck by the Frankish moneyer <name type="pname"
                  >Bautharius</name>, which cannot be dated, does bear the mint mark ATVRRE. This town of Aturre has been identified with Aire in the <hi
                  rend="italic">Department de Landest</hi> This <hi rend="italic">Department</hi> is in <name type="place">southwestern France</name> and might
               well come within the scope of the legislator of this Burgundian constitution because of commercial connections. Still the evidence is
               insufficient to permit of certainty.</p>
            <p>
               <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_7485941">Charles Lenormant</name> has proposed an emendation of the text so that the last group of solidi would
               be called <hi rend="italic">Armoricani</hi>.<ref target="#CH1-n55">55</ref> Numismatists have quite properly been wary of accepting such an
               emendation. The coin on which Lenormant reads the monogram for <hi rend="italic">Armoricani</hi> should most likely be expanded as <hi
                  rend="italic">Amalarte</hi>, the Visigothic King.<ref target="#CH1-n56">56</ref> There is no proof at all for the view that Armorica at this
               time issued currency in imitation of the imperial gold.<ref target="#CH1-n57">57</ref> On the other hand it is <pb n="76"/> perfectly conceivable
               that if an emendation were made it should be the name of some Germanic king. <name type="pname">Valesius</name> has suggested a king of the
               Gepidae, but this is most unlikely in view of the scant knowledge concerning that relatively minor tribe of which we have no definitely
               identifiable currency. The suggestion of <hi rend="italic">Alaricanos</hi>, i.e., Alaric II, is militated against by the fact that his coins are
               included in an earlier group.<ref target="#CH1-n58">58</ref> Coins of Amalaric, the Visigoth, who was approximately contemporary with this
               constitution, however, are known, and it would seem possible to emend the text to include his name. There is indeed a letter written by <name
                  type="pname">Cassiodorus</name> in which the moneyers of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> are accused of having
               made private profits out of the coinage even though they were originally in the service of the state.<ref target="#CH1-n59">59</ref> This letter
               has been dated by the editors to the period 523-526 A.D., and it may be that coins of bad alloy were issued at that time. The difficulty lies in
               the fact that insufficient evidence regarding the nature of some of the barbaric imitations is available. Valid results cannot be expected until
               a sufficient quantity of analyses of the barbarian imitative gold coinages is published.</p>
            <p>In the light of this situation in the West the conclusion drawn by <name type="pname">Jungfleisch</name> and the analyses of the light weight

            <p>These are the only five coins of the light weight solidi that have been analyzed, but because of the remarkable agreement in the results it would
               appear to be a safe conclusion that the metallic content of these coins as a whole is only approximately eighty-eight percent fine. This would
               have the effect of further lowering the intrinsic value of these coins though it is not distinguishable to the naked eye. The debased coins
               mentioned in the various passages cited may well have been of the same variety in that they were not readily detected by the naked eye and were
               therefore referred to as entire groups.</p>
            <p>Unf ortunately numismatists have not made many analyses of gold imitations of imperial coins. Chemical or spectroscopic analysis would
               necessitate damage to the coin. The specific gravity technique which is surprisingly accurate for binary alloys of gold requires expertness. It
               can yield very fine results, but a good deal of patience and experience is a prerequisite. For objects of high gold content it can be considered
                  reliable.<ref target="#CH1-n61">61</ref> Newer methods involving the use of X-rays are also available, but, of course, this requires the
               services of a technician. The published results of analyses of Byzantine gold during the period in question, on the basis of all of the
               techniques, would seem to indicate fineness generally above ninety-five percent. This makes it quite obvious that the light weight solidi were
               deliberately debased to a limited degree so that detection was extremely difficult, if not virtually impossible, in the early mediaeval
               world.</p>

                  physicians in the imperial period. It was certainly the smallest of weights in use as shown by many passages even though there is mention of

                  metrological systems were combined. The obol was made equal to one-half of the scruple and the <hi rend="italic">chalcus</hi> was equal to

                  the solidus which contained twenty-four siliquae was 1/72nd of a Roman pound. These texts, however, define the solidus in terms of its
                  relationship to the Roman pound and not to the siliqua. The texts from the various metrological sources do confirm the relationship between
                  the siliquae and the solidus. They can be easily found by reference to the indices of <hi rend="italic">Metrologicorum Scriptorum

            <head>FINDS, HOARDS AND MINTS</head>
            <p>Coins are essentially articles of commerce, and the area within which they circulate is vital information to any understanding of their
               significance for historical research. This area can be delineated in the case of ancient coins on the basis of the locations of stray finds and
               hoards as well as imitative copies. The area within which imitations of a specific series are known to have been manufactured must have been in
               commercial contact with the locality which produced the original pieces. The light weight solidi provide a case in point of particular
               importance.</p>
            <p>A table of finds of light weight solidi and imitations of that series presents some rather startling features. The imitative pieces can be
               considered together with the authentic coins for the moment. (See pages 80—81.)</p>
            <p>Actually the hoards from the Dnieper Delta and Pereschtschepino contained coins of both Constans II and the three emperor type of Heraclius. Thus
               only twenty-three separate localities are known where light weight solidi or imitations of those solidi occur. In the overwhelming majority of
               the cases the find spot was clearly in an area removed from effective Roman control.</p>
            <p>The coins from <name type="place">Udine</name> and <name type="place">Cividale</name> were from funerary deposits found in Lombard graves in
               those areas which antedate the inauguration of the national coinage of the Lombards in 584/85 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH1-n1">1</ref> They may, however, be treated together with the hoards from <name type="place">Hoischhügel</name> and <name
                  type="place">Munningen</name>. The hoard found at <name type="place">Hoischhügel</name> on the southern border of <name type="place"
                  >Carinthia</name> in the neighborhood of the railroad station of Thörl-Maglern is probably roughly contemporary with the <pb n="79"/> two
               Lombard graves. A barbarian imitation of a solidus of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, which is the latest coin in the hoard, and the absence
               of any coins of later Byzantine emperors or Lombard coins of the national variety aids in the dating of the find. The most probable date is
               sometime between 570/71 and 584/85.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> None of the coins had been used in the manufacture of jewellery, and it seems
               fairly obvious that it was simply a hoard of circulating medium.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <p>At <name type="place">Munningen</name>, near <name type="place">Nördlingen</name>, Bayrisch-Schwaben, a necropolis of about forty graves was
               discovered, and in the first of the graves a hoard of gold coins associated with a relatively long lance head, a small knife and a simple oval
               buckle was recovered.<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> These latter objects are of little aid in dating the funerary deposit, and, as a result, the
               coins are used for that purpose. Nine gold coins, eight of which are of clearly barbaric origin, were recovered. A solidus of Tiberius II
               Constantine was the only authentic Byzantine piece in the hoard. Thus the hoard cannot have been buried prior to 578 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                  >A.D.</hi> Numismatists have maintained that some of the barbarian imitations are even slightly later in date, so that the burial must be
               placed in the late sixth or very early seventh century, but the imitation of a solidus of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> marked CONX+ is
               probably somewhat earlier in date of manufacture. The composition of the deposit is such that it, as well as that of <name type="place"
                  >Hoischhiigel</name>, probably represents the currency that was in use in that area during the late sixth and early seventh centuries.</p>
            <p>These four finds can serve as direct proof that the light weight solidi were in circulation and were well enough known among the barbarians at
               that early date to give rise to a series of imitations. At <pb n="80"/>

                  type="place">Munningen</name> the barbarian imitations cannot be much later than their prototypes. This is probably true of the remaining
               imitations of light weight solidi of Justinian and Justin II. The surprising number of examples of the authentic light weight solidi and the
               number of different dies of these coins from those two reigns show quite conclusively that the issues of these solidi were not as small as had
               previously been supposed. The relative speed with which they were imitated serves to strengthen the conclusion that these unusual exergual marks
               were well known in the West even if they were not completely understood.</p>
            <p>The next group of coins stems from a single large hoard which was recently found in the neighborhood of <name type="place">Hama</name> in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>. Unfortunately the hoard fell into the hands of a dealer before it was scientifically
               studied with the result that much of it was dispersed. When rubbings were taken of the coins approximately 326 of them remained in the possession
               of the dealer while about 150 pieces had been sold. The original number of coins in the hoard therefore must have been in excess of 450 pieces
               and was probably about 475, but the fact that so little is known about the find because it is unpublished makes it difficult to assess its full
               significance. Until the hoard is studied and the material made available only some few observations can be made regarding mint attributions, but
               it is perhaps best to delay any such discussion until a later point in this chapter when the entire problem can be treated.</p>
            <p>The last two light weight solidi of Justin II which were found <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> were discovered in Balkan sites. The first of these
               pieces was in the collection of <name type="pname">Friedrich Stefan</name>, who merely describes the circumstances under which it was unearthed
               as "<hi rend="italic">Balkanfund unbekannten Ortes</hi>."<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> Neither the contents of the hoard nor its exact location
               can be discovered. The last piece was supposedly found at <name type="place">Sadowetz</name>, in the district of <name type="place"
               >Plevna</name>, in <name type="place">northern Bulgaria</name>, and is presently in the National Museum in <name type="place">Sofia</name>.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> This is probably the very same hoard as <pb n="83"/> the one described by <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_166694544">Mosser</name> as being discovered in 1934 at <name type="place">Sadowetz</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref>If so,
               it has not been published in final fashion, and all judgement must rest upon the information furnished by <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#viaf_166694544">Mosser</name>. It was a rather large composite hoard containing fifty-four gold pieces and fifty bronzes extending
               from the reign of Justinian I through that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>. Since there were fifty
               bronzes present it would have been interesting to note which mints were represented in the hoard, but under the circumstances that is impossible.
               It is, however, certain that a <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> for the burial of this hoard is fixed in 582 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                  >A.D.</hi> by the presence of five solidi, one tremissis and some bronzes of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice
                  Tiberius</name>. Since the site of the find lay within the ancient province of <name type="place">Moesia</name>, a province which was within
               the boundaries of the Byzantine Empire until 679 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> when the Emperor Constantine IV after an unsuccessful campaign
               was forced to cede it to the Bulgars, it seems most probable the the <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi> for the burial of the hoard must
               be set in 602 A.D., the last year of the reign of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>. Roman bronzes and solidi
               of the reigns of Phocas and Heraclius could logically be expected in a hoard of later date. If the bronzes were published it is more than likely
               that we should be able to date this burial with greater accuracy during the twenty year interval. One need not look far afield, however, for the
               probable circumstances which necessitated the deposit of this currency. Moesia, that area between the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</name> and the <name type="place">Balkan Mountains</name>, was in the late sixth century the scene of
               almost constant Avaro-Slavic pressure which was sometimes felt as far south as Thessalonica. The Byzantine forces which were at that time divided
               as a result of the Persian wars were unable to cope with this menace. The argument concerning the degree of Slavic settlement in <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</name> proper as an index of ethnographic changes in the area need not be discussed because all
               scholars are agreed that even the tremendous Avaro-Slavic attack which carried these barbarians to the very walls of Constantinople at the
               beginning of the last decade of the sixth century did not result in the complete elimination of the romanized population. In a word, Moesia was a
               frontier region where the barbarians and Byzantines clashed repeatedly and where representation <pb n="84"/> of each group were to be found.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> Hoards and stray finds of Byzantine coins of the period from this area are not uncommon. Perhaps the other solidus
               from an unknown Balkan site is merely another instance of this situation. In any event, when considered in conjunction with the single coin of
               Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine found at Szentes in the Middle Danube region, it is obvious that these few pieces from the Balkans as
               compared with the more numerous finds from elsewhere cannot be used to confirm the hypothesis proposed by <name type="pname">Stefan</name>. The
               coin from Szentes was simply a stray find.<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> How these coins arrived in the region cannot be determined, but the
               possibilities are innumerable in view of the constant military activity.</p>
            <p>Most of the remaining finds of light weight solidi were made at sites located in <name type="place">western Europe</name> or in <name
                  type="place">Britain</name>. Within this geographical grouping the coins from Müllingsen, Wieuwerd, Kent, Cornwerd, Wilton, Mons, Nietap,
               Sinzig, Wonsheim, and Pfahlheim as well as the imitation from <name type="place">southern Germany</name> must be treated. The first of this
               category of western finds from the post-Justinian period is a solidus of the sole reign of Heraclius which was found at Müllingsen, in the
               district of <name type="place">Soest</name>, in <name type="place">Westphalia</name>. It is described by <name type="pname">Bolin</name> as a
               Merovingian imitation, but close examination of the photograph of the piece leaves no doubt of its Byzantine origin.<ref target="#CH1-n10"
                  >10</ref> It is strikingly similar to a coin in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection though the two pieces are from different sets of dies.</p>
            <p>In the case of the light weight solidi found in hoards of coins in the West we are on much firmer ground. The hoard from Wieuwerd, <pb n="85"/>
               which contained two light weight solidi of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine, has been published in detail and is consequently better known
               than any which have already been discussed.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> At <name type="place">Wieuwerd</name> there were found three finger
               rings, the ornament of a buckle of a girdle, and thirty-five ornamental pendants which for the most part consisted of gold coins provided with
               loops for suspension. A total of twenty-nine coins were included in this hoard. The date of the hoard, of course, must be arrived at on purely
               numismatic grounds. <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_166694544">Mosser</name> gives a date of <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 612 <hi
                  rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> on the basis of the works on that hoard which had appeared by the time he published his bibliography. The older
               authorities generally date the actual deposit in the first half of the seventh century, but the later scholars have lowered the age of the hoard
               considerably. <name type="pname">Werner</name>, on the basis of the first edition of Boeles work on <name type="place">Frisia</name>, gave the
               date as <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 675 A.D.,<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> but in the last edition of his work <name type="pname">Boeles</name>
               again discussed this hoard. Since many of the coins had been used in the manufacture of jewellery, he held that they must have remained in
               circulation for some time. The latest of the coins in the find were two tremisses of Maastricht, one of which was struck by Ansoaldus of
               Maastricht. These coins could not have been struck before the middle of the seventh century because an older Ansoaldus type is known which was
               clearly issued as late as the third quarter of the century. On the basis of these facts and comparisons with other hoards, <name type="pname"
                  >Boeles</name> dated it merely in the second half of the seventh century.<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="86"/>
            <p>Very little can be said regarding the finds from <name type="place">Kent</name> and <name type="place">Cornwerd</name>. Both, of course, were of
               coins of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine. In both instances it would seem as though stray finds from the seventh century were recovered. The
               solidus from Kent was originally part of the Rolfe-Mayer Collection (No. 7383) and is presently in the Liverpool Museum. The solidus from
               Cornwerd which is presently in the Friesch Museum in Leeuwarden (Inv. No. 355) may have been recovered in 1887, but it doesn’t seem to have been
               noted until 1935, when <name type="pname">Werner</name> cited it simply as a solidus from Frisia because there was insufficient information
               regarding its provenance.<ref target="#CH1-n14">14</ref>
               <name type="pname">Boeles</name> has identified the actual locale of the find as <name type="place">Cornwerd</name>, but nothing substantial
               concerning the circumstances of the find is known.<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the Wilton Cross, which has been the subject of much comment, the circumstances of the find are known in more detail. The cross,
               which holds a coin of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine, was found as a stray object in a chalk pit at Wilton in <name type="place"
                  >Norfolk</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref>
               <name type="pname">Kendrick</name> felt that the Wilton pendant was a Merovingian work of the middle of the sixth century, and that the coin
               which is presently framed in the pendant and which dated from the seventh century was a later addition. It was his view that the cross originally
               enclosed a jewel which was lost in the course of time, and the aperture was then filled by the solidus. This is supported by the fact that such
               mountings are normally made to fit the object to be framed, but in the case of the Wilton Cross the coin is fully half a centimeter too small to
               fit the aperture and is therefore held in place by a double beaded band of 0.25 cm. in width. Bruce-Mitford, on the basis of a careful study of
               the Sutton Hoo find, claims that the entire Wilton pendant was a local East-Anglian product of the second quarter of <pb n="87"/> the seventh
                  century.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> In either event the coin must have been placed in the cross during the seventh century and probably
               during the actual reign of Heraclius. Like the coins from Kent and Wieuwerd it was used in the manufacture of jewellery or ornaments.</p>
            <p>The evidence regarding the find at Mons is not completely satisfactory because of the nature of the published sources. <name type="pname">Mr.
                  Philip Grierson</name> has informed me of his belief that a solidus of this type was found at Mons in a hoard which was discovered about 1820,
               but he quite properly indicated that he had not been able to check this data completely. <name type="pname">Mr. Grierson</name> believed, on the
               basis of the data available to him that this solidus was sold in the Leclerqz Sale at Brussels on April 2, 1839.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref>
               The mark in the exergue was misread on that occasion as SOXX. A pencil note in the copy of the Leclerqz Sale Catalogue in the possession of the
               Société Belge de Numismatique in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2800866">Brussels</name>, however, indicates that the coin was purchased
               by <name type="pname">M. Lacour</name>, and in the catalogue of the Lacour Sale which was held in <name type="place">Namur</name> on July 24,
               1848, several gold coins of Heraclius are listed but not specifically described.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> Since <name type="pname">J. P.
                  Meynaerts</name> was a purchaser at the sale of the collection of Frederic Lacour, and since such a light weight solidus was found in the
               Meynaerts Collection, it was more than possible that Meynaerts had purchased the piece in question. In his description of his own collection and
               in the sale catalogue of that collection such a solidus is listed.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> In the Berlin Collection there is a cast of the
               coin from the Meynaerts Collection (Coin no. 134) which, if this reasoning were correct would be identifiable as the coin of the Mons hoard. <pb
                  n="88"/> Such, however, is not the case for while the Lacour Sale did not take place until 1848, Meynaerts had reported such a coin in his
               collection some six years earlier.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> Only two possibilities remain, if the pencil notation in the Brussels’ copy of
               the Leclerqz Sale Catalogue is accepted as accurate. Either the coin from Mons is not to be identified with the piece formerly in the Meynaerts
               Collection or Lacour must have disposed of it to Meynaerts at some time between 1839 and 1842. This latter possibility must be taken into account
               because the gold coins of Heraclius are not specifically described in the Lacour Sale Catalogue.</p>
            <p>It seems fairly certain that the coin in the original Leclerqz Collection was derived from the Mons hoard. Unfortunately this hoard was neither
               adequately described nor scientifically treated, but two short notes by Lelewel do give us some idea of the contents. In addition to jewellery,
               some of which contained coins, there were some Merovingian tremisses, several of which were from the same dies, as well as some gold coins of
               Heraclius and two pieces of Suinthila, the Visigothic king. Lelewel, in his short notes concerning this hoard, adds that several of the coins as
               well as a ring were acquired by <name type="pname">M. Leclerqz</name> and passed from him to the Royal Collection in Brussels.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> The coins, however, do not actually seem to have accompanied the ring on that transfer, for <name type="pname">Mr.
                  Grierson</name>, who has a most complete knowledge of the collection in Brussels, informs me that only the ring is now in the Bibliothèque
               Royale.</p>
            <p>In the light of these facts it seems justifiable to suggest that the Meynaerts solidus, a cast of which is in the Berlin Collection is not
               identical with the coin found at Mons. The piece found at Mons was probable acquired by Leclerqz, and it passed from his collection to that of
               Frederic Lacour, since there is no reason to doubt the correctness <pb n="89"/> of the pencil note in the Brussels’ copy of the Leclerqz Sale
               Catalogue. From that point on its history is unknown.</p>
            <p>The hoard from Nietap naturally provides a compliment for those of Wieuwerd and Mons. At <name type="place">Nietap</name>, a town situated about
               two kilometers from <name type="place">Groningen</name>, a hoard of seventeen coins was recovered in 1901, and it is denominated as Nietap II to
               distinguish it from an earlier hoard found at the same site. The hoard contained a Frankish imitation of a gold piece of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>, a solidus of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine marked BOXX in the reverse exergue (Coin
               no. 150), a Merovingian coin of Chalons-sur-Saône (<hi rend="italic">Civitas Cdbilonensium</hi>), another Merovingian coin of Mainz, a Frankish
               coin of an unidentified mint, three coins of Maastricht or imitations of that type, one piece of the Dronrijp type C, two of the Dronrijp type D,
               three unidentified light weight tremisses, one Frisian coin, and two other pieces which are simply listed as missing.<ref target="#CH1-n23"
                  >23</ref> According to Boeles this Nietap hoard was buried a little later than those of Dronrijp. It should most probably be dated in the
               third quarter of the seventh century. Since it is most clearly a hoard of circulating medium and does not include jewellery, it forms a part of
               the general picture of the trade relationships in that corner of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> which will be
               discussed later.</p>
            <p>At <name type="place">Sinzig</name>, in the district of <name type="place">Ahrweiler</name>, in the Rheinprovinz, the double grave of a man and a
               woman was discovered, and in the funerary deposit there was a ring which enclosed a coin of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine. The coin showed
               absolutely clear indications of the fact that it had been fastened into another ring prior to being placed in its present setting.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n24">24</ref>
               <name type="pname">Werner</name>, on the basis of this fact and the worn condition of the coin, considered this as the most recent grave of his
               Group V. He felt that the coin could only have been put into the grave after a long period of exposure to the circumstances <pb n="90"/> making
               for wear. As a result he dated this grave towards the end of the seventh century.</p>
            <p>The finds from <name type="place">Wonsheim</name> and <name type="place">Pfahlheim</name> are logically connected with that of <name type="place"
                  >Sinzig</name>. At <name type="place">Wonsheim</name>, in the district of <name type="place">Alzey</name>, <name type="place"
                  >Rheinhessen</name>, another solidus of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine was found in a woman's grave, and once again it was set in a ring.
               It was accompanied by a triens from the region of Mainz which was struck in the period between <hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. 650 and several other
               objects which cannot be dated accurately.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> Since the solidus is quite worn and the other objects as well as the
               triens seem to indicate a date rather well along in the second half of the seventh century, this deposit may be a slightly earlier contemporary
               of that of Sinzig.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>At <name type="place">Pfahlheim</name>, in the district of <name type="place">Ellwangen</name>, in Württemberg, in Grave 4 of the necropolis,
               this time the burial of a man, another solidus of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine fastened into a ring was found associated with some other
               objects. These remains cannot be accurately dated. The coin is relatively unworn though it has been clipped. At least one other object in this
               funerary deposit aside from the solidus was an Italian import. The date of the burial, as determined by <name type="pname">Werner</name>, is in
               the second half of the seventh century, but somewhat earlier than those of Wonsheim and Sinzig.<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A barbaric imitation of this type was also found in an Alemannic grave in <name type="place">southern Germany</name>. The exact location of the
               site is not given, but the coin does seem to be Alemannic in origin.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> Even though the <pb n="91"/> exergual
               inscription in this instance is not exactly the same as the authentic Byzantine one, it is clear that the Alemanni did know these light weight
               solidi. Unfortunately it is impossible to date the deposit without further information.</p>
            <p>A most obvious omission in the discussion of these finds from the West up to this point has been the coin from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name>. This coin was part of a hoard which came to the attention of <name type="pname">Mr.
                  Grierson</name> while he was in <name type="place">Paris</name>. It was already incomplete at that time, and only
               fifteen of the coins were published by <name type="pname">Grierson</name>
               <ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref>. These fifteen pieces covered the period from the reign of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> through the joint
               reigns of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine. The light weight solidus included in the hoard is clearly not a product of <name type="place"
                  >North African</name> manufacture. In fact it is the only such coin found in that area, so it must be considered apart from the others. The
               hoard is evidently of the seventh century, but how it came to include the only light weight solidus from the region remains an unsolved puzzle.
               It would seem very improper to place too much weight on the existence of a single piece from a <name type="place">North African</name> hoard in
               view of the fact that the other finds fall into recognizable groups. Extreme mobility is one of the most evident features in the study of coins,
               and innumerable explanations could be proposed to give significance to the sole example of a light weight solidus from <name type="place"
                  corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name>, but they would all be hypothetical. Under the circumstances it would certainly seem best not
               to speculate too much concerning the exact significance of the single coin which found its way into the <name type="place">North African
                  hoard</name>.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the light weight solidi come from the region to the north of the <name type="place">Black Sea</name> and may well be considered
               apart from the other finds. Unfortunately these hoards have not been adequately described or treated and no photographs of their contents were
               available. <name type="pname">Bauer</name>, however, reported that in 1912 some herdsmen had discovered sixty-one gold coins which had been
               buried in a deposit containing gold and silver utensils as well not far from Pereschtsche-pino in the Government of <name type="place"
                  >Poltawa</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> Only four of these coins <pb n="92"/> retained their original appearance as coins while the
               remainder had been used in the manufacture of ornaments. This hoard contained one piece of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice
                  Tiberius</name>, two coins of Phocas, six of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine, thirty-six solidi of the joint reigns of Heraclius,
               Heraclius Constantine and Heracleonas, and finally sixteen gold coins of Constans II. Interestingly enough, of the thirty-six coins of the
               three-emperor type from the reign of Heraclius only one had the normal exergual mark CONOB; of the remaining thirty-five solidi twenty-seven were
               marked BOXX and eight bore the exergual inscription BOXX+. All sixteen of the coins of Constans II were marked OBXX. The fact that all of the
               twenty-seven coins bearing the mark BOXX were struck from two obverse dies and four reverse dies while all of the eight coins inscribed BOXX+
               were derived from the same pair of dies, and all of the sixteen BOXX pieces were produced with two obverse and four reverse dies is not without
               significance. Obviously these coins were collected and used in the manufacture of jewellery at some spot not too far removed from the place of
               issue, possibly at the mint itself, and at a period not too distant from the time they were struck. If these coins had been chosen by a random
               selection from those in circulation about 650 A.D., even if it occurred in an area which utilized coinage from a single mint to a far greater
               degree than coinage from other mints, it is hardly to be expected that the same restricted number of dies would occur. Even in an area which
               issues coins in quantity and subsists by importing other goods in return for its coins, the replacement of worn out dies would be rapid enough at
               the mint so that many more dies might logically be expected. These pieces must therefore have been used in the production of ornaments within the
               Byzantine Empire, possibly at official mints, and the finished articles must have been shipped into <name type="place">southern Russia</name>.
               Since no coins of Constantine IV Pogonatus were found with this hoard though he struck light weight solidi, it seems completely logical to
               suppose that the articles included in the Pereschtschepino find were exported from the Empire prior to 668 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> That
               the hoard was necessarily buried as early as 668 A.D., however, does not necessarily follow. It is certainly highly probable, but since the hoard
               was not actually composed of currency media, that is not a necessary conclusion.</p>
            <pb n="93"/>
            <p>
               <name type="pname">Bauer</name> further reports that his colleague Zograph, while spending the summer in <name type="place">southern
                  Russia</name> in 1927, was shown seven Byzantine solidi that were ostensibly found associated with other valuable utensils in the <name
                  type="place">Dnieper Delta</name>. There were six coins of Heraclius and one piece of Constans II. All of the coins of the three-emperor type,
               and <name type="pname">Bauer</name> unfortunately does not record how many there were included in this hoard, were marked BOXX. There is hardly
               enough information published concerning this hoard to make possible any very significant inferences or conclusions, but it is certainly most
               probable that the contents of this hoard were also exported to <name type="place">Russia</name> between 641 and 668 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                  >A.D.</hi> Since there is no mention of these coins being used in the manufacture of jewellery, we may presume that they were intended for
               commercial purposes, and perhaps the hoard was buried relatively quickly after it left the Empire.</p>
            <p>In 1928 a find of still another seven Byzantine solidi associated with costly utensils was made at Novo-Sandsherovo or Zatschepilovo in the
               Government of <name type="place">Poltawa</name>. These seven solidi were contemporary with those of the Pereschtschepino hoard, and the gold
               coins of Constans II, which again are not described, had the inscription OBXX in the reverse exergue.<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> It would
               seem most probable that this hoard also dates from the second half of the seventh century.</p>
            <p>These three eastern hoards may be discussed apart from the other finds. Perhaps the deposit of these treasures is to be connected with the
               movements of the Bulgars in the seventh century. It should be remembered that it was during the reign of Constans II that pressure from the
               Khazars forced the Bulgars to move westwards from their settlements in <name type="place">Old Great Bulgaria</name> on the steppes bordering the
                  <name type="place">Sea of Azov</name>. Under their leader or king, Asparuch, the Bulgars moved slowly westwards across the <name type="place"
                  >Ukraine</name> and settled at the <name type="place">mouth of the Danube</name>. In 679 A.D., after the defeat of Constantine IV Pogonatus,
               the Bulgar realm, which already included the Dobrudja, was expanded by the absorption of the territories between the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</name> and the <name type="place">Balkan Mountains</name>. The actual movement of the Bulgars across <name
                  type="place">southern Russia</name> must have taken place at some time in the period between 650 and 668 A.D., if the view of some recent
               scholars that they were settled in the Dobrudja prior to the death of Constans II <pb n="94"/> is correct.<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref>
               Obviously the movement of this barbarian horde across the plains of <name type="place">southern Russia</name> must have caused major dislocations
               which resulted in a temporary cessation of peaceful commerce to a great degree and the burial of treasure. The three hoards containing light
               weight solidi are more than likely the natural result of that migration.</p>
            <p>The finds of light weight solidi, insofar as they can be dated with any degree of accuracy, fall into the period from 570/71 to <hi rend="italic"
                  >ca.</hi> 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> These are the extreme limits. No light weight solidi have been found which because of associated
               finds must be recognized as coming from sites which are to be dated after the reign of Constantine IV Pogonatus. Apparently the light weight
               solidi passed out of circulation very rapidly after the last ones were struck. Certainly the character of the finds is such that they would seem
               to be primarily designed for use in border regions and foreign lands. Only the two finds, from <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381"
                  >North Africa</name> and <name type="place">Hama</name> respectively, are found in areas removed from the northern frontiers but still within
               the Empire. Therefore, since many Syrians were engaged in commerce, only the coin from <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North
                  Africa</name> would require a deeper explanation.</p>
            <p>As to the dating of the actual finds it must be remembered that the mere fact that a coin was not placed in a deposit before the latter part of
               the seventh century is not to be considered as indicating that the coin was not in the region of its final deposit at a much earlier period.
               Indeed the worn condition of the coins from the finds is the <pb n="95"/> only reason for dating their deposit so late. The light weight solidi
               must have been designed for a specific purpose and were probably put to use fulfilling that purpose as soon as possible after they were issued.
               Thus, if they were designed for use in a specific locale, they must have reached their destination fairly quickly even though the stresses and
               strains making for the deposit or burial of treasure did not affect them until they had circulated for some years. This is not an abnormal
               condition to be encountered in the study of hoards.</p>
            <p>Briefly put the hoards and finds of light weight solidi and their imitations fall into certain natural geographical groups. There is the western
               class which includes the hoards from <name type="place">northern Italy</name>, <name type="place">Carinthia</name>, <name type="place">southern
                  and western Germany</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2802361">Belgium</name>, <name type="place">Frisia</name> and <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> which is by far the largest. In this category, therefore, would be found the coins
               from <name type="place">Udine</name>, <name type="place">Cividale</name>, <name type="place">Hoischhiigel</name>, <name type="place"
                  >Muningen</name>, <name type="place">southern Germany</name>, <name type="place">Pfahlheim</name>, <name type="place">Wonsheim</name>, <name
                  type="place">Sinzig</name>, <name type="place">Müllingsen</name>, <name type="place">Mons</name>, <name type="place">Cornwerd</name>, <name
                  type="place">Nietap</name>, <name type="place">Wieuwerd</name>, <name type="place">Kent</name>, and <name type="place">Wilton</name>. These
               sites form a chain with only minor deviations extending from <name type="place">northern Italy</name> to <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. In the Balkans there were three finds, that of Szentes, that of Sadowetz, and one from an unknown
               site. In <name type="place">southern Russia</name> there were the finds from the Dnieper Delta, Pereschtschepino, and Zatschepilovo. In addition
               there was the unique find from <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> and the great hoard from <name type="place"
                  >Hama</name> which must be considered separately.</p>
            <p>The sites of the hoards pertinent to the study of light weight solidi may be compared with the other contemporary gold hoards as listed by <name
                  type="pname" corresp="#viaf_166694544">Mosser</name>. Admittedly <name type="pname">Mosser's</name> list of hoards is not complete and does
               not contain any finds later than 1935 nor the stray finds of individual pieces, but it does provide a representative selection of those known.
               Only the gold hoards buried in the period from the reign of Justinian to that of Constantine IV Pogonatus have been listed.</p>

            <p>The hoards which contained both light weight solidi as well as the normal variety have, of course, been excluded from this list, but the
               concentration of the finds within the area under effective Byzantine control and the rather sharp break in the number of Byzantine coins found in
               the West after the reign of Heraclius is immediately noticeable A survey of the hoards listed by <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_166694544"
                  >Mosser</name> reveals that after the reign of Constantine IV Pogonatus there are no Byzantine gold hoards found in the successor states in
               the West for a considerable period of time. This can be further supported by the list of finds given by <name type="pname">Sture
                  Bolin</name>,<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref>and the same situation was found to exist in the Danubian region when the finds of that area were
               studied by <name type="pname">Huszár</name>, <name type="pname">Csallány</name>, and <name type="pname">Moisil</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n34"
                  >34</ref> The historical significance of these facts cannot be minimized. Certainly it must play an important part in the formulation of any
                  <pb n="98"/> general historical theory regarding the Pirenne thesis and the general decline in the West. This aspect of its significance,
               however, must be treated in a wider context in the final chapter of this monograph.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless some observations of a more specific nature with regard to the finds of light weight solidi are also possible. All of the finds from
               the West can be traced to the period during which Byzantine gold coinage was introduced into the barbarian successor states in a meaningful
               quantity. The finds of these light weight coins are, however, largely limited to the general area of one specific trade route, i.e., that from
               northern <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> over the <name type="place">Alps</name>, down the Rhine and across the
               English Channel though, of course, they occur elsewhere as well. Several of the coins have been mounted in loops after a fashion which is most
               closely associated with Frisian finds. This, of course, strengthens the association of the light weight solidi with the particular route to
               Frisia and the general area of <name type="place">northwestern Europe</name>. This route must have been at the height of its importance during
               the reign of Heraclius. That is to say that during the period when the Empire was faced with the Persian menace in its most acute form the
               efforts of Byzantine traders in the West must have reached the zenith. After the death of Heraclius, Byzantine interest shifted somewhat to <name
                  type="place">southern Russia</name>, but the movements of the Bulgars put a sudden, though temporary, check to this effort. The three finds
               from the Balkans are undoubtedly simply a part of the general trade effort of the Byzantines in that area which is merely one aspect of the
               general interest in the West manifested by the Byzantines in the sixth and seventh centuries.</p>
            <p>It is evident from the style of the light weight coins themselves that only two could have been minted in the West where most of the finds were
               located, and it is therefore a matter of some importance to discover which mints issued these solidi. These mints must have been the sources of
               the Byzantine coins used in the western trade. In this connection the Hama hoard provides some vital evidence. In that hoard there were three
               light weight solidi marked OBXX: and eight more which were marked OB⁕+⁕ with ΘS at the end of the reverse legend. Although in only one instance
               was there a die identity of the reverses it seems fairly obvious that the mint issuing these pieces must have been in the general vicinity of the
               find spot. Only one place in <pb n="99"/>
               <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> will answer as the source of these coins, Antioch, which was destroyed by an earthquake
               on Nov. 29, 528 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> and was renamed Theoupolis after its restoration. That Antioch possessed a mint is certain from
               the existence of bronze currency of this period with mintmarks such as THЄϤ<graphic url="NNM138_sym6.jpg"/>, ΘHϤ<graphic url="NNM138_099a.jpg"/>,
                  τHϤ<graphic url="NNM138_sym7.jpg"/>, <graphic url="NNM138_sym8.jpg"/>, and <graphic url="NNM138_sym8.jpg"/> or similar ones as well as earlier
               coins bearing the older name of the city.</p>
            <p>The suggestion that Theoupolis-Antioch was the mint issuing these gold coins marked ΘS and OB⁕+⁕ was first made in the catalogue prepared by
               Sabatier, but this hypothesis has a history of its own and new evidence such as that from the Hama hoard can now be presented in support of
                  it.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref>
               <name type="pname">Tolstoi</name> in his catalogue of Byzantine coinage rejected <name type="pname">Sabatier's</name> proposal because the only
               gold coins of which he had cognizance from that mint were those which he attributed to the usurper Leontius.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> As an
               alternative suggestion Tolstoi mentioned the possibility that a barbaric error had been made in the course of cutting the die, but he indicated
               quite correctly and clearly, that even this latter explanation did not satisfy him. It was even less probable than the hypothesis proposed by
                  <name type="pname">Sabatier</name> because there were a number of coins of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, <name type="pname">Tiberius II
                  Constantine</name>, and <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name> with those very letters at the end of the
               reverse inscription, and those pieces were not barbaric in any way. <name type="pname">Tolstoi</name>, however, went even further in his
               discussion of this problem in connection with still another coin which showed a reverse legend ending in ΘSS.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> This
                  <pb n="100"/> coin was quite certainly the result of a double striking, but since Tolstoi refused to accept that fact, he reasoned from the
               existence of the double <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> that the final <hi rend="italic">sigma</hi> in all of the other cases could not be the mark
               of an <hi rend="italic">officina</hi> but was part of the name of the mint. He noted that the style and composition of the piece seemed to him to
               indicate an eastern origin, perhaps Constantinople. At the same time he once again rejected <name type="pname">Sabatier's</name> view that the
               letters ΘS might contain the abbreviation of the name of the city of Theoupolis-Antioch because he could not find any contemporary examples of
               the name of a mint city occurring at the end of the reverse inscription.</p>
            <p>This was the status of the problem until 1937 when <name type="pname">Friedrich Stefan</name>, as has been pointed out in Chapter one, argued on
               the basis of the finds in the Balkans and <name type="place">southern Russia</name> that the ΘS was to be identified with the mint of
                  Thessalonica.<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref> Byzantine mints, he maintained, were at this time designated by not more than a single letter at
               the end of the reverse legend. This contention itself is invalid, but on the basis of it <name type="pname">Stefan</name> proposed the view that
               the S at the end of the legend stood for the sixth <hi rend="italic">officina</hi> and that the Θ was the mark of the mint of Thessalonica. By a
               quite independent route Hugh Goodacre arrived at the same conclusion five years later.<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> In 1941 Goodacre noted in
               connection with the British Museum solidus of Justin II and Tiberius II Constantine that this light weight coin bore the unusual mark ΘS. Since
               he was well aware that the bronze currency of Thessalonica during the reign of Justinian presented some unusual denominations, he argued that it
               was based on a different weight for the solidus and that the gold pieces marked ΘS were the solidi of Thessalonica. Thus the view that this mark
               stood for the Balkan mint gained currency, and it was repeated in much of the secondary literature.</p>
            <p>The first real attack against this proposal was made by <name type="pname">Leo Schindler</name> and <name type="pname">Gerhart Kalmann</name> who
               pointed out that as early as the reign of Justinian a <hi rend="italic">theta</hi> was known to have appeared at the end of <pb n="101"/> the
               reverse inscription on some solidi.<ref target="#CH1-n40">40</ref> According to these two numismatists the explanation connecting the ΘS with
               Thessalonica was untenable because all of the bronzes struck at Thessalonica during the period in question bore the Latin inscription TЄS as a
               mintmark. The Greek form ΘЄS first appeared during the reign of Heraclius. They therefore took the position that the <hi rend="italic">theta</hi>
               was an <hi rend="italic">officina</hi> mark and that the S or SS had to await further clarification. The evidence of the Hama hoard seems to be
               conclusively in favor of the original suggestion made by <name type="pname">Sabatier</name>, but there is still more evidence to corroborate that
               from the find. If a close study of Coin no. 79 is made, the same coin which started Goodacre's study of the 0S ending of the reverse inscription,
               several interesting bits of information come to light. A coin from the Kyrenia hoard on Cyprus, this time a solidus of the full weight type (see
               note 45 of the Catalogue), shows a die identity of the obverse with Coin no. 79. These two coins were therefore issued by the same mint. The
               Kyrenia coin, as has been said, comes from Cyprus, a locality not to distant from Antioch, and Coin no. 79 was purchased in 1938 by the British
               Museum from a Syrian coin dealer in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> itself. Furthermore, Antioch, apart from Carthage,
               was the only place during the period which issued coins with two busts as opposed to the type with two seated figures which is quite common.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n41">41</ref> Only Antioch, however, issued coins with the busts of the emperor and his heir apparent or co-ruler. Those of
               Carthage are of the Emperor <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and the Empress Sophia. In addition the style of the solidi in question obviates
               the possibility of Carthage as a source. Thus the location and design of these two pieces can be used to strengthen the conclusions arrived at by
                  <name type="pname">Sabatier</name> and confirmed by the Hama hoard. The fact that Greek letters were used to indicate bronze coins of
               Theoupolis-Antioch at all times and certainly after its restoration during the reign of Justinian removes one of the principal objections raised
               in connection with the identification of Thessalonica as the issuing locality.<ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="102"/>
            <p>If the ΘS is understood as indicating Theoupolis then all of the coins of Justin II marked 0B⁕+⁕ (Coins nos. 50-71) as well as the two solidi of
               Justin II and Tiberius II Constantine (Coin no. 79 and the Kyrenia piece), and those solidi of Tiberius Constantine as sole ruler marked OB+⁕
               (Coins nos. 80-87), and those of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name> marked the same way with ΘS at the end of
               the reverse inscription (Coins nos. 94-99) were necessarily struck in Antioch. The remaining coins marked OB⁕+⁕, OB+⁕, or OB<graphic
                  url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/> show somewhat different characteristics and must therefore have been struck elsewhere. Where these other pieces were
               struck depends largely upon a very close stylistic study.</p>
            <p>The three coins from the Hama hoard marked OBXX, however, also present a recognizable characteristic that is of some importance. At the end of
               the reverse legend or following the exergual mark there are a series of dots. These dots are also present on one of the light weight solidi of
               Justin II in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</name> as well as on one which appeared in the Brüder Egger Sale of Nov. 28,
                  1904.<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref> The provenance of the coins from Hama again seems decisive in supporting Antioch as the source of these
               coins. <name type="pname">Mr. Grierson</name> has suggested to me the possibility that at about this time the unity of the mint of Antioch showed
               the first signs of disintegrating, and that as a result it may well be that this particular series of solidi was not struck in Antioch itself but
               in one of the surrounding towns which assumed part of the duties of that mint. It seems fairly certain that a significant number of the authentic
               light weight solidi were derived from the great Syrian emporium or its environs. The merchants of the Syrian metropolis must have brought these
               coins to the West because similar dots are found on the barbarian imitations that were recovered at <name type="place">Hoischhügel</name> and
                  <name type="place">Cividale</name> as well as on some of the imitations that have appeared in the sale catalogues.</p>
            <p>Only Coin no. 22 (<name type="pname">Justinian</name>) and Coin no. 90 (<name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>) of
               the authentic light weight pieces were almost certainly struck in the West though it would be rash to attempt to identify the particular mints.
               All of the remaining coins of the light weight variety were <pb n="103"/> apparently struck in the East, probably at Constantinople, a city which
               was also a center of Byzantine external trade. Other mints may have participated in the production of these coins, but it is impossible to
               identify them with certainty.</p>
            <p>The study of the finds and the issuing mints of the light weight solidi has revealed a startling connection between the external trade of the
               Byzantine Empire and this series of coins. The coins appear most obviously along a specific trade route leading from <name type="place">northern

               border regions of the Balkans as well as in <name type="place">southern Russia</name>. It may be easily seen that they were not widely used in
               internal Byzantine trade by simple comparison of the find spots of normal solidi with those of the light weight variety. It is equally true that
               they were not used in the foreign trade to the exclusion of full weight solidi because examples of both varieties are found together in many
               hoards. Since the light weight solidi were struck during the period of greatest Byzantine effort in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_europe"
                  >Europe</name> and cease at just the moment when finds of imperial coins are no longer evident in the areas outside the European limits of
               Byzantine control, this connection with foreign trade is further strengthened. Indeed the very mints which issued these pieces were the emporia
               of Byzantine long distance western trade.</p>
            <p>The final explanation for the existence of this rather unusual series of coins must take into account these facts as well as the evidence that
               the coins were issued in greater quantity during the reigns of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, and
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name> than at any other time. The number of dies clearly indicates a rather large
               issue, and the imitations of the Theoupolis-Antioch type of Justin II which appeared so quickly show that the barbarians were very rapidly made
               aware of these coins. It is immediately evident that the solution encompasses a very large field of general economic history and is of some
               importance in the evaluation of the Pirenne thesis in its more recent restatements. The general problem of Byzantine trade in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name> and particularly in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6941859">Rhine Valley</name> must be
               dealt with in the light of this new evidence furnished by numismatics.</p>

            <head>THE BYZANTINE TRADE WITH THE WEST</head>
            <p>The civilization of Byzantium, marked as it was by interest in Christianity and in matters of theological import, was not likely to be conducive
               to treatises on such matters as political economy and monetary policy. Byzantine authors, perhaps even more so than those of classical antiquity,
               refrained from writing about the mundane affairs of commerce and money. Only occasionally, in a work devoted to what was the larger topic of a
               chronicle or in a sermon or in one of the saints’ lives, do we find chance bits of information which can aid in the reconstruction of the
               economic history of the Byzantine Empire. As a result of this reticence on the part of the Byzantine authors, archaeology and numismatics, as
               ancillary sciences of history, must provide the necessary data for a comprehensive approach to the problem. The remarks of the contemporary
               authors cannot form the framework whereby one can interpret the archaeological and numismatic evidence, but rather the reverse is true, and the
               literary remains, insofar as they pertain to economic history, must be understood in terms of the physical legacy of the Empire.</p>
            <p>Three statements from contemporary authors furnish information regarding the monetary policies of the <name type="pname">Emperor
               Justinian</name>. The first of these is contained in the <hi rend="italic">Chronographia</hi> of the Syrian monk <name type="pname">John
                  Malalas</name>. What Malalas tells us is the testimony of a contemporary, and it must therefore be given great weight. Since he was
               particularly cognizant of the state of affairs at Antioch, a town which was in commercial contact with the West, his remarks assume even greater
               significance. Malalas says that in the month of March in the first year of the indiction, there was a disturbance among the lower classes or poor
               because of the changing of the value of the <hi rend="italic">kermata</hi> or copper coinage used as small change, and that when the news of this
               was brought to the <name type="pname">Emperor Justinian</name>, he ordered that the coins be restored to their former value.<ref target="#CH1-n1"
                  >1</ref> This event can easily be dated in the <pb n="105"/> year 554 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> by virtue of the fact that the preceding
               section which speaks of the death of Totila is dated in the fifteenth year of the indiction. What actually happened, however, is a somewhat more
               critical matter. Firstly, it may be pointed out that the statement does not refer to an alteration in the gold coinage, but it must indicate a
               change in the values of the subsidiary coinage. The use of the word <hi rend="italic">kermata</hi> is decisive in that respect, but this is also
               supported by the fact that the disturbance was created by the lower classes whose contact with currency must have been largely limited to the use
               of the subsidiary coins. It is also evident that the change was only temporary in nature and was not in itself a fundamental aspect of imperial
               monetary policy.</p>
            <p>Since this temporary change in the value of the subsidiary currency which was so disadvantageous to the poorer classes could be remedied easily
               by a decree of the <name type="pname">Emperor Justinian</name>, it is apparent that the change in value was accomplished by administrative action
               and was not the result of economic pressures. The value of all of the subsidiary coins in relation to the standard unit, the gold solidus, was
               regulated by the imperial government. Bronze coins were purely fiduciary in the Byzantine Empire, and their size and weight were determined by
               other factors than the intrinsic value of the metal. Changing the fiat value of the bronze coins, as was done in this instance, would not
               necessarily be reflected on the actual coinage itself in any way save possibly by a change in the mark of value, if that mark of value expressed
               the worth of the coin in terms of gold. In fact, however, the marks of value on Byzantine bronze coins expressed the worth of the piece in terms
               of a still smaller bronze unit, the nummus. A change in the number of bronze units equal to a solidus would affect the fiat value and the
               purchasing power of all of the bronze coins, but it would not be reflected in the marks of value on the coins. Thus, if the bronze follis was
               marked M and was worth forty nummi, and the solidus was said to contain 7,000 nummi, each follis would be equal to 1/175th of a solidus. If,
               however, the imperial government were to order by decree that 7,200 nummi were now to equal one solidus of the same weight and fineness as
               before, the value of the follis would <pb n="106"/> still be forty nummi, and the mark of value of the follis would still be M, but the follis
               would only be equal to 1/180th of the gold solidus. The bronze fiduciary coin would have lost some of its value, but this fact would not be
               reflected in any way on the coinage itself. This is a hypothetical case,<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref> but it does explain what Malalas was
               describing in his short statement. The evidence to support such an interpretation of Byzantine monetary practice is derived from early Byzantine
               sources though it should be noted that these sources are not coeval with the quotation from the Syrian monk.<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="107"/>
            <p>It is impossible to judge exactly what was the nature of the change in the valuation of the small change to which <name type="pname">John
                  Malalas</name> refers, but it does not seem as though it can justifiably be related to an incident recounted by <name type="pname"
                  >Procopius</name>. Procopius in the course of detailing the various devious methods used by <name type="pname">Justinian</name> to increase
               the profits from the customs and trade says, "Such is the way things were going as regards the administration of affairs. But I think that I
               should not omit to mention also what was done by the imperial pair with reference to the small change. For while the money-changers formerly were
               accustomed to give to those who bargained with them in exchange for one gold stater two hundred and ten obols, which they call <hi rend="italic"
                  >pholleis,</hi> these persons, contriving private gain for themselves, had it arranged that only one hundred and eighty obols should be given
               for the stater. In this way they cut off the seventh part of the value of every gold coin of all men."<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This passage would, at first glance, seem to indicate that gold coins which had previously been issued to sell at two hundred and ten bronze
               folles were now intended to be evaluated at only one hundred and eighty folles. This would mean that the value of the follis was raised by
               one-seventh, but it is clear from the concluding sentence that what actually happened was that the value of the bronze pieces was not changed,
               and instead the value of the gold piece was lowered by one-seventh. It is, of course, obvious from this passage that Procopius did not fully
               comprehend the mechanics whereby the value of the fiduciary currency was determined. He simply did not understand that lowering the value of the
               gold piece as expressed in terms of folles did not affect the value of the subsidiary bronze coins as well, if the actual intrinsic value of the
               gold coin was lowered proportionately.</p>
            <pb n="108"/>
            <p>That this is what happened is clear from the third passage, which again is from the pen of Procopius. In the course of describing the horrid
               crimes perpetrated during the tenure of <name type="pname">John Barsymes</name> as treasurer for the second time, during the period from 547 to
               some time after 555 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>, Procopius says, "And those who had been stripped of their money sat about in great sorrow,
               since he saw fit also to issue the gold coinage, not at its usual value, but reducing its value materially, a thing which had never been done
                  before."<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> This passage is probably to be connected with the same event as the preceding one, and it is obvious
               that it is a lowering of the value of the gold coins and not a change in the fiduciary subsidiary bronze coinage which is involved. This result
               could be achieved by the issuance of gold currency of lighter weight.</p>
            <p>That the event recorded by <name type="pname">Procopius</name> is not the same as that preserved by <name type="pname">Malalas</name> can be
               shown by a comparison of the dates in each case. Malalas, it will be remembered, was describing something which transpired in 554 <hi
                  rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> The date of the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Anecdota</hi> is indicated four times in the course of the
               work as the thirty-second year of the reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> Since <name type="pname"
                  >Justinian</name> counted his regnal years on all documents from 527 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>, when Justin I died, this would place the
               date of the composition in 559 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>, and it would seem possible that the events of 554 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
               might be included. Justinian's active administration, however, began in 518 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>, and if that were to be taken as the
               date from which Procopius began his counting of the regnal years it would follow that the <hi rend="italic">Anecdota</hi> was composed in 550 <hi
                  rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Thus the events of 554 A.D. could not have been recorded in that work. It seems more likely, however, that the
               first view is correct, and that the date of composition was 559 rather than earlier, and there is therefore no inherent reason in that regard why
               the two authors could not have referred to the same incident. But in the first passage which was cited from the <hi rend="italic">Anecdota,</hi>
               Procopius speaks of <pb n="109"/> the imperial "pair" in the plural and thus indicates that Theodora was still alive at the time. Theodora's
               death in 548, therefore, must be a <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quern</hi> for the event. Since the same event is connected with the second
               tenure of John Barsymes as treasurer, it must be dated in 547/8. Only by presuming that Procopius erred in using the plural can it be assumed
               that both authors are discussing a single event of a temporary nature. This involves an unnecessary emendation of the text which would be
               unjustified.</p>
            <p>It is more than mere coincidence that <name type="pname">Procopius</name> refers to a lowering of the value of the solidus by one-seventh and
               that that is approximately the amount by which at least some of the solidi that form the subject of this monograph were lightened. It seems
               obvious that <name type="pname">Procopius</name> is describing in somewhat colored terms the issuance of these solidi. Malalas apparently
               described a temporary administrative attempt to apply this new monetary system to the whole Empire though this is much more uncertain.</p>
            <p>That <name type="pname">Justinian</name> as a result of his efforts to reconstruct the <name type="place">Roman Empire</name> was consistently in
               financial difficulties is not in doubt. The expenditures of the government were enormous, and many attempts were made to increase the revenue of
               the Empire and to stretch the available amount of good currency as far as possible. <name type="pname">Justinian's</name> efforts in this regard
               with respect to the silk trade as well as his other sources of income have been adequately treated in a great number of secondary works. That the
               western trade of the Empire underwent a transformation at the same time is a matter that has not been discussed quite as completely. War with
               Persia had been an acute problem during the third and fourth centuries, but the situation on the eastern frontier seems to have been stabilized
               to a considerable degree after the death of <name type="pname">Julian</name>, and the fifth century was a period of relative quiet in that area.
               In the opening years of the sixth century, however, the problem reappeared in an aggravated form and remained an everpresent danger until the
               final victory of Heraclius in the seventh century. Of course the Persian difficulties in which the Empire was embroiled must have made the
               eastern trade more hazardous and difficult. The Persians were the intermediaries who transmitted the goods of the Far East to the <name
                  type="place">Roman</name> merchants. Negotiations such as were carried on with the peoples to the north as well as with the <pb n="110"/>
               Himyarites and Abyssinians to the south of the <name type="place">Persian Empire</name> in order to secure alternative trade routes to the <name
                  type="place">Far East</name> cannot be interpreted purely in terms of <name type="place">Justinian's</name> desire to insure that the Persians
               would be prevented from making a profit on all of the Byzantine eastern trade. Continued access to eastern sources of trade during the periods of
               Persian difficulties must have played a part in the calculations of the Emperor.</p>
            <p>All historians are agreed that the financial difficulties of the emperors of the sixth and seventh centuries were very real. The sources are
               replete with tales which serve to illustrate this. Massive military endeavors, however, accentuated the declining financial structure of the
               Empire, but the difficulties facing the imperial government in the sixth century have their roots in a much earlier period. The Roman Empire was
               clearly in decline in the second half of the third century, and nowhere is this more lucidly shown than in the papyri from Egypt. The
               inflationary spiral of the late third century was not local is any sense, but it seems to have encompassed the entire Mediterranean world. The
               literature on this decline is so extensive and detailed that it would be a patent waste of space to retrace the ground that has been covered by
               others. What is important, however, is that the succeeding early fourth century was clearly a period of economic growth and recovery. The decline
               was largely arrested, and the evidence from Egypt is overwhelmingly in favor of a general revival at least during the first half of the
                  century.<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> Some of the towns which bordered the Fayum were revived and showed signs of renewed vigor. The documents
               from the valley of the Nile itself show, if anything, an even healthier picture than in the Fayum.<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> A stable currency
               of both gold and silver was inaugurated, and the security of the frontiers was established by the armies which had been reorganized. But the
               recovery was only temporary, and the second half of the century as well as the dark fifth century show all of the signs of increasing
               dislocation. Many of the towns of Egypt which had recovered temporarily disappeared from the scene. But this time even the <pb n="111"/>
               frontiers of the Empire could not be adequately defended, and the Germanic tribes poured into the <name type="place">Roman world</name>.</p>
            <p>The appearance of the <name type="place">Germanic</name> tribes on the <name type="place">Roman</name> side of the <hi rend="italic">limes</hi>
               was not without its effect even though there was a cultural continuum. Merchants of western origin had declined in importance during the period
               of the <name type="place">Roman Empire</name>, and their position had been taken by easterners, Syrians, Jews, and Greeks.<ref target="#CH1-n9"
                  >9</ref> This process, which began quite early, however, was greatly accelerated by the Germanic invasions.<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> The
               importance of merchants of eastern origin during the Merovingian period in Gaul is certainly more marked than during the preceding Roman epoch or
               the following Carolingian period.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref> This is not merely a quantitative but a qualitative point as well. The <pb
                  n="112"/> numbers of orientals cannot be estimated other than by making note of the fact that on certain occasions, such as the entrance of
               Gontran into Orleans, the three separate communities, Syrians, Jews, and Latins, are mentioned individually as though they were all of some size.
               A list of cities in which the orientals resided would not in itself be of any importance, but their growing influence is a matter that can easily
               be traced not only by their frequent assumption of the ecclesiastical posts of the West, such as the See of <name type="pname">St. Peter</name>,
               but even in the constant stream of art motifs and works which are oriental in origin.<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The natural concomitant of this growing importance of a non-native element in the life of <name type="place">western Europe</name>, of course,
               was the gradual decline of the Gallo-Roman element to a point where it lost its identity in the <hi rend="italic">mélange</hi> of the rising
               Germanic barbarians, or more properly it may be said the the Germans and the natives fairly rapidly approximated one another culturally and in
               other ways. The granting of the right of <hi rend="italic">conubium</hi> among the Visigoths in the sixth century is simply a proof of the rapid
               romanization of the Germanic peoples throughout western Europe. Not only did the Germans adopt Roman culture and forms, but the native element in
               the population declined in self-consciousness at the same time, and the common ground was reached very quickly after the influx of barbarians
               ceased. This decline, however, did not cause a break in the unity of the <name type="place">Roman Mediterranean</name>, and contacts with the
               seat of <name type="place">Byzantine</name> culture were many. Internal decline was evident in the late fourth century, and the Germanic
               invasions hastened the process, so that the supremacy of the economic order of the East became more and more manifest. This internal decline is
               made somewhat more evident by the fact that in the areas which were conquered by the barbarians it was not the solidus which was the principal
               coin issued but the triens, which was only one-third of the Byzantine piece. The eventual cessation of coinage in gold in meaningful quantities
               for exchange is in great measure a result of this continuous decline which accompanied the <pb n="113"/> fragmentation of the political
               structure, so that no state in western Europe was strong enough to guarantee currency for its coinage as Rome had done.<ref target="#CH1-n13"
                  >13</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The most outstanding feature of the early Middle Ages is this cultural and economic decline and the fusion of the Germanic and Roman peoples. Of
               course this aspect of life in the early mediaeval period did not proceed at a constant rate nor was it uniform throughout the West. Conditions
               north of the Loire reached a much lower point than those found in southern Gaul where the Germanic penetration was much less real. The Gaul
               described by <name type="pname">Ammianus Marcellinus</name>, however, was quite different from that described by <name type="pname"
                  >Gregory</name> of Tours. <name type="place">Roman</name> civilization, it has beeen shown by <name type="place">Pirenne and Dopsch</name>,
               did not disappear in one fell stroke, but certainly the decadence of ancient culture was accelerated during the bleaker periods.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n14">14</ref> The Vandal conquest of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> must have been one of the
               events which accelerated this process of decline,<ref target="#CH1-n15">15</ref> and during the reign of Genseric Vandal fleets undoubtedly
               ravaged the shipping of the Mediterranean with impunity, but this was not a condition of any permanence. After the death of Genseric in 477 <hi
                  rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> this momentary threat passed.<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> The economic and basic cultural unity of the

                  >western Europeans</name>, but the ubiquitous class of merchants continued to ply their trade so successfully that during the early fifth
               century the gold solidus seems to have become the standard coin in use in southern <pb n="114"/>
               <name type="place">Scandinavia</name>. The great period of this <name type="place">Scandinavian</name> trade, however, lies in the years
               following 476 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> and before the accession of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref>
               These solidi probably came to <name type="place">Frisia</name> by a route down the Rhine Valley and from Frisia were sent by sea to <name
                  type="place">Scandinavia</name>. Why the importation of solidi into <name type="place">Scandinavia</name> ceased after the reign of <name
                  type="pname">Justinian</name> has been the subject of much investigation and many hypotheses. Its importance for the theme of this monograph,
               however, lies in the fact that the actual distribution of solidi in Europe seems to show that in the period before <name type="pname"
                  >Justinian</name> the route was open to trade from Italy northwards through Mainz and down the Rhine Valley to the Frisian coast. This is the
               same route which was so closely related to the finds of light weight solidi.</p>
            <p>In addition the coin finds may be said to reflect the intensity of the trade more clearly than anything else. Coin hoarding, of course, has been
               shown to mirror accurately the lack of political and economic stability. During periods of trouble the number of hoards buried rises as the
               inhabitants of the region affected attempt to preservetheir wealth from marauders.<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref> Such a peak period of hoarding
               occurred in western Europe in the second half of the third century. In France, the period from 253-282 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>, a space of
               only twenty-nine years, resulted in approximately forty-four percent of all of the hoards in that region listed by <name type="pname"
                  >Bolin</name>. In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name> and in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2921044"
                  >Germany</name> as well as in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2782113">Austria</name> the same phenomenon is evident.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n19">19</ref> The stabilizing effect of <pb n="115"/> the strong hand of Constantine is immediately evident in a sharp decline in
               the number of hoards buried during that reign. In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</name>, the peak of activity in burying
               treasure occurred about the middle of the third century, and from that point on there was a sharp decline in the practice until the last years of
               the reign of Constantine. A rise during the reigns of Constantius II and Julian the Apostate is particularly marked in Germany and is also
               evident in England though the situation seems to have been stabilized in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_france">France</name> so that a low
               point in hoarding was reached some time after 363 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> At the end of the century, however, there was a distinct rise in
               the number of hoards buried in <name type="place">England, Germany and France</name>.</p>
            <p>The pressure of the <name type="place">Germanic</name> tribes increased sharply during the last years of the fourth century and the early years
               of the fifth century, and the economic conditions within the Empire declined. These were factors which made for greater dependence upon the use
               of gold rather than fiduciary money. At the same time there was a growing awareness on the part of the Germanic peoples of the monetary value of
               gold which led to a steady increase in its use among them. Silver coinage had fluctuated too much in value as a result of the financial
               difficulties of the emperors of earlier periods. As a result the marked preference for silver currency among the Germanic tribes, which had been
               noted by <name type="pname">Tacitus</name>, died away.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> Thus it happened that the usefulness of gold currency was
               fully realized by the Germanic peoples during their invasions of the Empire. Long contact with the Romans had resulted in this. When they entered
               the Empire, of course, there was the steady process of romanization to give further impetus to the use of gold, if that were necessary. Pirenne
               clearly noted this romanization. Payments in terms of gold are common in the writings of Gregory of Tours, and the tomb of <name type="pname"
                  >Childeric</name> at <name type="place">Tournai</name> revealed that this early Frankish king had hoarded a respectable number of gold
                  coins.<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="116"/>
            <p>A recovery from the effects of the invasions and the economic decline, however, was imminent, and the first signs of this restoration appeared
               during the reign of Anastasius. His coinage was imitated in some quantity in the West, and it occurs in the hoard of Bresin in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</name> and in a number of <name type="place">Scandinavian</name> hoards. His coinage and the imitations of
               it also form an important segment of the hoards of <name type="place">Gourdon and Chinon</name> which were actually buried during the reign of
                  <name type="pname">Justin I</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> But the largest increase in the number of Byzantine coins and imitations of
               them found in the West occurs for the period from <name type="pname">Justinian</name> through <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius"
                  >Heraclius</name>. Boeles lists 208 coins, mostly of gold, found in Frisia. Ninety-five of these coins are clearly imperial gold or
               imitations, and better than half of these, or forty-six of them to be more exact, are of the period from <name type="pname">Justinian</name>
               through <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>. After that the Frankish currency seems to have held sway in <name
                  type="pname">Frisia</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> Since many of the early imitations which are found probably come from <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, it is clear that a route existed in the early years of the sixth century which brought
               a steady stream of coinage over the Alps northwards. The same situation is noted from a survey of the coins listed by <name type="pname"
                  >Werner</name>. In that instance 210 coins seen by <name type="pname">Werner</name> are listed from grave finds in <name type="place"
                  >Austrasia</name> of the period from <name type="pname">Valentinian</name> I to Constans II. Of these by far the greatest number are from the
               period from the reign of <name type="pname">Anastasius</name> through that of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius"
                  >Heraclius</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref>
            </p>
            <pb n="117"/>
            <p>It is vital to note that the gradual intrusion of Frankish currency during the seventh century into Frisia shows that the cities of the Middle
               Rhine, the Meuse, and the Moselle regions were in contact with the Frisian coast. The mints from those regions, which are, of course, closely
               associated with the trade route from Italy northwards are particularly well represented among the finds.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> All of
               the numismatic and archaeological evidence seems to point to Frisia as a great point of diffusion for trade to the north and to the east as well
               as to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</name>. The fact that something over 200 gold coins have been found within Frisia as
               compared with about 265 from the grave finds for all of Austrasia confirms this view.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This rather startling growth in Byzantine interest in the West is naturally to be associated with the Persian difficulties which became acute
               during the reign of Anastasius and continued to afflict the Romans until 639 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> During that period war between these
               two peoples was as much the order of the day as peace. <name type="place">Justinian</name> must have fully comprehended the immense task which
               faced him, and he set up a military policy which involved taking the defensive role in one region and balancing it against an offensive drive in
               another. His attempt to reconstruct the Roman Empire around the Mediterranean necessitated that a defensive attitude be adopted towards the
               Persians. Justinian used the title <hi rend="italic">Imperator Caesar Flavius Iustinianus Alemannicus Gothicus Francicus Germanicus Anticus
                  Alanicus Vanda-licus Africanus Pius Felix Inclitus Victor ac Triumphator Semper Augustus.</hi> The omission of the honorific <hi rend="italic"
                  >Persicus</hi> is most noticeable. His claim to some of the other titles was hardly any more merited than would have been that of <hi
                  rend="italic">Persicus.</hi> The interest of the Emperor, <pb n="118"/> however, had turned towards the western portions of the old <name
                  type="place">Roman Empire</name>, and his conquests must have stimulated the activities of the oriental merchants in that region. These
               merchants, however, had begun to play a more vital role in the economic life of western Europe as early as the reign of Anastasius and the
               beginning of the Persian troubles. The Byzantine fleet, which had been rebuilt, certainly controlled the entire Mediterranean in the period
               preceding the death of Heraclius, and as a direct result trade in the West became safer than it had been at any time since the Vandals reached
                  Carthage.<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Because of the importance of the western trade at a period when emphasis is most likely to be placed upon the Byzantine trade with the further
               orient it is necessary to point out that in the <hi rend="italic">Pragmatic Sanction</hi> which Justinian addressed to the "Illustrious Grand
               Chamberlain Narses and to the Magnificent Antiochus, Prefect of Italy," specific provisions were promulgated to integrate the currency which had
               circulated there into that of the rest of the Empire. Section 20 of that document is very specific in that regard. Again it should be noted that
               in Procopius’ description of the actions of the Emperor with regard to the two customs houses on the straits on either side of Constantinople he
               specifically speaks of merchants travelling between the capital and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> or <name
                  type="place">Libya</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> Even the trade of the greatest of all the Mediterranean ports, <name type="place"

               particularly <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> seems to have been more active after the reconquest of the West by the
                  Byzantines.<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> The fact that the communities of merchants in western Europe were composed primarily of Syrians,
               Jews, and Greeks, however, must have given Antioch and Constantinople a predominance which Alexandria could not challenge successfully even
               during the late sixth and early seventh centuries when trade relations between the Patriarch and the Pope seem to have reached a peak.</p>
            <p>It is pointless to repeat all of the evidence collected by Pirenne and others for the existence of very significant sea trade between the two <pb

               sixth and seventh centuries after a period of decline during the preceding epoch. It is, however, necessary to return to the subject of the trade
               route from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> by land to the Frisian coast. This route actually never seems to have been
               closed entirely, and the light weight solidi are intimately associated with it. Mediaevalists who have restricted themselves largely to the
               literary sources have continually pointed to the paucity of pre-Carolingian documentation for the use of this route over the Alps.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> A number of pilgrims, however, seem to have journeyed via this route to Rome, and the evidence is largely in favor
               of the view that as early as the second half of the seventh century pilgrimages were made between England and Rome which crossed the Frisian
               coast and occasionally followed the course of the Rhine.<ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> Use of a route over the Alps and down the Rhine for
               trade, however, is quite another thing than the occasional passage of a pilgrim or even a marauding army. In 539, <name type="pname"
                  >Theudebert</name>, the King of the Franks, entered <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> over the western Alps with an
               army of Franks, <name type="place">Burgundians</name> and <name type="place">Alemanni</name>. In 553 still another army of Alemanni and Franks
               crossed the Alps. In 568 the Lombards passed over the Alps, and the series of Lombard raids against Frankish territory carried parties over the
               Alps in the opposite direction and resulted in Frankish countermeasures. Such attacks over the Alpine passes were made throughout the last
               quarter of the sixth century. They must have interferred with trade to a considerable extent, and in this connection it should be noted that this
               appears to have been the period during which the Byzantines struck the fewest light weight solidi. The seventh century was a relatively quiet
               period along this mountain range. An agreement between the Franks and the Lombards left the southern passes in the hands of the latter while the
               more northerly ones were controlled by the Franks. Fortresses which had been a part of the old Roman system of military works guarding Italy and
                  <pb n="120"/> had been used for the same purpose by the <name type="place">Ostrogoths</name> were now strongly held by either the Lombards or
               the Franks.<ref target="#CH1-n82">82</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Archaeology provides a more certain basis for the use of this trade route in pre-Carolingian times. The Germanic invasions did not result in a
               cessation of trans-Alpine trade. Theodoric's conquest of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> and his preeminence among
               the Germanic kings provided a long period of peaceful relations with the more northerly peoples. The concentration of finds of <name type="place"
                  >Ostrogothic</name> silver coins and those of the Exarchate of <name type="place">Ravenna</name> in the middle <name type="place"
                  corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name> region seems to be conclusive proof of a continuous use of that trade route during the
               pre-Carolingian era.<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The route followed must have been one which crossed the Alps in the neighborhood of Lake Constance. Archaeological evidence gathered by <name
                  type="pname">Werner</name> on the basis of finds of specific articles such as "Coptic" bronze vessels, ornamental gold crosses, and fibulae of

                  corresp="#geonames_7581804">Danube</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref> The coins seem to have followed a more westerly route. Within the
               limits of southern and <name type="place">western Germany</name> nineteen siliquae of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> struck in <name
                  type="place">Ravenna</name> as well as forty <name type="place">Ostrogothic</name> siliquae have been found. The evidence provided by these
               finds as well as the coins struck in the area suggests that the route in question along the Rhine was of greater importance for the area to the
               east of the river than for the lands to the west of it. The amount of coinage struck in southern and <name type="place">western Germany</name>
               during the sixth century must have been very small, if the number of pieces recovered that may possibly have been issued there can be used as
               indicative of the whole. Only a very few coins can be attributed to Rhenish mints, and even these are from sites such as Trier which are located
               on the Gallic side of the river. <pb n="121"/> In the seventh century Frankish mints seem to have been in operation at Windisch, Basel,
               Strassburg, Speyer, Worms, Alsheim, Mainz, Boppard, Andernach, Bonn, Cologne, Zülpich, Julich(?), Trier, and Pfalzel near Trier, all sites ön the
               left bank of the <name type="place" corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name>. <name type="place">Basel, Strassburg, Mainz, and Trier</name> were
               the outstanding mints while the others only struck coins intermittently. Only occasionally are coins from these <name type="place">Rhenish</name>
               mints found on the right bank of the river.<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the sixth century the mass of the currency in <name type="place">southern and western Germany</name> on the right bank of the <name
                  type="place" corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name> must have been composed principally of Italic coinage such as the Ostrogothic silver and
               the later silver currency of Justinian. In addition Ostrogothic and Byzantine gold, which must have crossed the Alps in the same body of
               commercial transactions which brought the silver, played a significant role. The coinages of the Rhenish and more distant Gallic mints did not
               occupy a significant position in the sites on the right bank. It can only be concluded that the commercial ties in this area on the right bank
               were much stronger with Italy than with the Gallic lands.<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref>
            </p>
            <p>If anything, the seventh century shows an even more perceptible distinction between the regions to the right and to the left of the Rhine. It is
               true that since the importation of silver coinage had come to an end, the total number of coins found is much smaller, but the same phenomenon of
               a commercial connection with Italy rather than the Frankish realm on the left bank is noticeable. The occurrence of Anglo-Saxon sceattas and
               Frisian trient es in the middle Rhine region, however, marks even further the unity of the valley of that river in an economic sense at the later
               period. Merovingian coins at the same time are only occasionally found among the Alemanni, Franks, and Thuringians on the right bank and are
               totally lacking among the Bavarians.<ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref>

            <p>Perhaps <name type="pname">Werner</name> has gone too far in explaining this division between <name type="place">Austrasia and Neustria</name> in
               terms of the greater simplicity of economic <pb n="122"/> life in <name type="place">Austrasia</name> and the existence of an economy which made
               extensive use of barter rather than currency while in <name type="place">Neustria the Roman</name> forms of commerce persisted with the monetary
                  system.<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref> The evidence presented by <name type="pname">Dopsch</name> in favor of a money economy on the right
               bank of the Rhine cannot be ignored.<ref target="#CH1-n89">89</ref> His interpretation of the Germanic codes cannot be eliminated by citing the
               secondary literature. Certainly the right bank of the Rhine enjoyed a more primitive economy than Gaul proper, but it must not be forgotten that
               it too had been in close contact with the Roman world during the great days of the Empire. It is, however, more logical to note that the Rhine
               provides a significant barrier to lateral East-West trade while it is a highway for trade running North-South. This factor means, of course, that
               it was not in the main stream of Byzantine trade with Gaul, and that it occupied the position of a subsidiary artery of commerce. During the
               early mediaeval period traders from the East landing at Marseille would have utilized the <name type="place">Rhone, Garonne, Loire, and
                  Seine</name> much more frequently than the <name type="place" corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name> as a route for carrying on their
               transactions. The concentration of Merovingian mints and the activities of eastern merchants in western, central, and southern Gaul are much more
               heavily documented than along the distant Rhine. The connection of the Rhine with <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>,
               however, through the Alpine passes in the region of Lake Constance is clearly demonstrated from the archaeological and numismatic finds.</p>
            <p>At the extreme continental end of this trade, of course, lay <name type="place">Frisia</name> which, as has been pointed out, was the area from
               which the trade about the <name type="place">North Sea</name> radiated. Boeles lists only twenty-six gold coins from <name type="place"
                  >Frisia</name> which were struck before the reign of <name type="place">Anastasius</name>. After that date the expansion in the use of gold in
               the area is easily traced by the great increase in the number of coins of the later period that have been found there. The evidence in favor of
               the importance of the light weight solidi is probably best shown by the fact that of the four coins of Heraclius and Heraclius Constantine listed
               by <name type="pname">Boeles</name> three are of the light weight series.</p>
            <pb n="123"/>
            <p>During the period of Germanic expansion covering the fifth and sixth centuries the Frisians, like the Germans of the right bank of the <name
                  type="place" corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name>, struck only conscious imitations of Byzantine coin types and never types of their own.
               During the later part of this period two new series of coins were issued which may be attributed to the Frisians. The first was a group which is
               identified by a symbol known as the <hi rend="italic">“boucle perdue"</hi> which is frequently added to the legend. Originally this sign was a
               part of the fastening at the back of the imperial diadem or was visible as part of the offering in the hand of the Victory on the reverse of
               imperial trientes, but the Frisians seem to have developed their use of it from the pseudo-imperial Frankish trientes and the <name type="place"
                  >Ostrogothic</name> imitations of Roman currency. About the year 600 A.D. the Victory on the reverse was replaced by a cross on Byzantine and
               imitative coinages. The second group of Frisian coins was recently discovered by <name type="pname">Boeles</name>. It was lacking the so-called
                  <hi rend="italic">“boucle perdue"</hi> and showed a greater stylistic affinity for the Frankish coins than for the Ostrogothic ones. Both
               groups of purely Frisian coins were issued very commonly in pale gold, and in one case the coin is of silver.<ref target="#CH1-n40">40</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The commercial bond between Frisia and the Rhenish regions is easily established by the finds that have been made within Frisia of twenty-seven
               coins from <name type="place">Cologne, Mainz, Alsheim</name>, and Worms as well as related currencies. In addition there were five coins from the
               mints on the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2991627">Moselle</name> and ten from those on the <name type="place">Meuse</name>, including
                  imitations.<ref target="#CH1-n41">41</ref> Thus of the 208 coins listed by <name type="pname">Boeles</name>, forty-two pieces come from the
               trade area formed by these river basins. At the same time it is to be noted that a few Frisian and Anglo-Saxon sceattas, probably of later date,
               are also found in the <name type="place">Rhineland</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n42">42</ref> It is, however, to be expected that the direction of
               the flow of currency would be northward in this region. Frisia must be considered one of the more primitive <pb n="124"/> areas in the West in
               Merovingian times, and it would therefore import rather than export currency. Boeles has presented an admirable case throughout his book on
               Frisia for the view that the Frisians were not at this time the great trading people and entrepreneurs of the North Sea littoral. That honor he
               would bestow upon the Anglo-Saxons.<ref target="#CH1-n43">43</ref>
            </p>
            <p>It is important to remember that during the period covered by this study Frisia enjoyed independence, and that the expansion of the Frankish
               realm to include all of Frisia was not accomplished until Charlemagne's Saxon campaigns. Probably as early as 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>,
                  <name type="place">Maastricht</name> on the <name type="place">Meuse</name> became a Frankish town and the seat of a Merovingian bishop as
               well as a site for a Frankish mint. By the middle of the seventh century Dorestad was also the site of a Frankish mint, but in the early years of
               the last quarter of the seventh century the Frisians successfully expanded their realm to include both <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_2745912">Utrecht</name> and Dorestad. In 687, however, Pepin defeated the Frisian ruler Redbad and siezed Dorestad again,
               and between 691 and 695 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Utrecht and the mouth of the Rhine were conquered by the Merovingians. There was a short
               rebirth of Frisian power after the death of Pepin, and Redbad reached Cologne with a Frisian fleet and defeated <name type="pname">Charles
                  Martel</name>, but after the passing of Redbad the Franks returned to the offensive and again possessed themselves of the mouth of the
                  Rhine.<ref target="#CH1-n44">44</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The expansion of Frankish power during the seventh century was, of course, accompanied by the establishment of Frankish mints. That at Maastricht
               began to issue gold coinage about the year 600 and continued to do so until about the last quarter of the seventh century. A mint was established
               at Dorestad about the middle of the seventh century by the <name type="place">Maastricht</name> mint-master Rimoaldus. It was a short lived mint,
               however, because of the conquests of Redbad, and it was only after 689 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> that it could be reestablished once again
               by drawing upon the resources of the mint at Maastricht. By 716 the <pb n="125"/> town was once again in Redbad's hands and the mint-master
               Madelinus II had passed away. The last issues of the series struck by him at Maastricht, however, were degenerate and were done in silver. During
               the first quarter of the eighth century gold was withdrawn from circulation as currency in all of Frisia, and it was replaced by silver.<ref

            </p>
            <p>Frisia was a vital link in the chain of find spots for the light weight solidi, and the finds are more closely concentrated there than anywhere
               else. Through the region along the right bank of the Rhine and particularly in Frisia it was a common practice to loop or pierce gold coins and
               to use them for ornaments. This practice is present in a significant number of instances among the light weight solidi. Perhaps this practice is
               in some measure connected with the fact that since the economy of the area was certainly below that established in Gaul proper, the true value of
               gold as a monetary metal was not as securely established. Using the coins for the manufacture of ornaments involves a change in the value of the
               coins. The people residing in this area were not as accustomed to the use of gold as those who lived on lands that had formerly been Roman. In
               Frisia at least thirty-one of the coins listed by Boeles from the reign of Anastasius and later were of poor alloy, and in additon there was one
               of that unusual series of early bracteates. A survey of the coinage from the Austrasian graves listed by <name type="pname">Werner</name> shows
               exactly the same phenomenon. The percentages of coins of poor alloy are too high to be meaningless. The Germanic peoples who inhabited the region
               were apparently quite unskilled in determining which were the coins of poor gold, for many of the pieces were merely plated copper, and in one
               instance there was even a core of lead.<ref target="#CH1-n46">46</ref>

            <p>Much time has been spent establishing on a sure footing the continuous existence of a subsidiary trade route from Italy over the Alps and down
               the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6941859">Rhine Valley</name> to <name type="place">Frisia and England</name>. The character of trade
               along this route was influenced by the more primitive <pb n="127"/> condition of the peoples on the right bank of the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name> through whose territory this trade passed. These people used gold and engaged in monetary
               transactions, but the coins were also utilized as ornaments to a greater degree here than elsewhere. The inhabitants of the region retained the
               use of silver currency in an active sense while it was lost throughout most of the <name type="place">Roman world</name>. This is shown by the
               finds of <name type="place">Ostrogothic and Byzantine</name> silver coins. Their knowledge of gold as a currency medium was limited, and a great
               many pieces of poor quality, plated, or heavily alloyed, were in circulation.</p>
            <p>Into this trade the Byzantine light weight solidi were introduced. Originally they seem to have been struck in <name type="place"
                  >Constantinople</name> and sent to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name> from whence they passed over the Alps and down
               the <name type="place" corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name>. This move was part of the Byzantine design to increase the profits from the
               western trade. The Persian difficulties which began in the early sixth century turned the traders of Constantinople in increasing numbers
               westwards. As early as the reign of Anastasius a marked growth is clearly seen in the activity of the oriental traders in the West. The colonies
               of eastern merchants who were resident in <name type="place">western Europe</name> and who preserved their identity jealously after the
               settlement of the <name type="place">German</name> barbarians made this expansion easier in the more romanized parts of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</name>. During <name type="pname">Justinian's</name> reign this activity increased even more sharply since it
               was aided and abetted by the victories of Byzantine arms. Negotiations with the Himyarites to the south of the Persian Empire and the Turkic
               peoples to the north during the reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name> could not have compensated for the severe setback received by the
               eastern trade of the Byzantines as a result of the Persian wars. The importance of trade as a factor in <name type="pname">Justinian's</name>
               defensive wars against the Sassanians can be noted by simply reading Procopius’ account of the events. Under these stresses the imperial
               government sought to cultivate trade in the West through all of the available channels. Procopius who served in Italy on the staff of <name
                  type="pname">Belisarius</name> must have been aware of what was transpiring there even after he left as a direct result of his connections
               with the military men. Therefore it is in his writings that the striking of light weight solidi is mentioned.</p>
            <p>It was probably in 547/8 that <name type="pname">Justinian</name> introduced these coins for use along this specific trade route. Perhaps the
               coins were shipped <pb n="128"/> into <name type="place">northern Italy</name> directly from the mint; certainly they were not used throughout
               the Empire. A purely local situation was answered by the striking of this series of coins. It may be, however, that an attempt was made to
               introduce their use into <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name>, an emporium of western trade, during the reign of

               greeted the proposal. If that is so, and it is purely hypothetical, the attempt was not successful, and Justinian quickly reversed himself. It
               may well be that the few light weight solidi marked OB*+*, OB+*, and OB<graphic url="NNM138_sym1.jpg"/> issued by <name type="pname"
                  >Justinian</name> represent a part of that move to introduce this currency into the western trade at Antioch because these marks are clearly
               associated very strongly with <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> in the late sixth century.</p>
            <p>Failure to introduce light weight coinage into the main body of western trade that originated in <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> in the reign of <name type="pname">Justinian</name>, if the attempt to do so was made, was
               not permanent. During the reign of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> and
               its environs included at least one source of these light weight solidi. The Hama hoard shows conclusively that in the reign of <name type="pname"
                  >Justin II</name> the mint of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> issued light weight solidi. These new
               light weight solidi were apparently used in the extensive trade with the cities of <name type="place">southern France</name>, and some of them
               found their way into the <name type="place">Balkan</name> peninsula. That they are found in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_162152"
                  >Balkans</name> is not in the least surprising, if the original purpose of their manufacture was trade with essentially underdeveloped peoples
               in the West. It is certainly not wise to place too much weight upon three individual coins found in the Balkans, but it would be equally foolish
               to maintain that their existence there was inexplicable in terms of the proposed thesis of this monograph. Aside from the mere fact that coins
               are extremely mobile and are constantly being transported from one locale to another, it must be noted that the numismatic evidence is quite
               conclusively in favor of a great expansion of trade between the Byzantines and the more primitive Balkan peoples during the sixth and seventh
                  centuries.<ref target="#CH1-n50">50</ref> The Slavic tribes and their Avar allies <pb n="129"/> who were engaged in raiding the <name
                  type="place">Balkan</name> provinces of the Empire were in an even lower stage of development than the Germanic tribes of southern and <name
                  type="place">western Germany</name>. Trade in the Balkans was certainly not as significant as trade in <name type="place">western
                  Europe</name>, but the expansion of that Balkan trade was greatest during the period when light weight solidi were being issued. It is
               conceivable that a few of the light weight solidi were introduced into the Balkans for that trade, but this is by no means a necessary
               conclusion.</p>
            <p>On the other hand the evidence that light weight gold was introduced into the main body of western trade along the valley of the <name
                  type="place">Rhone</name> in the reign of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> is well attested.<ref target="#CH1-n51">51</ref> It is quite
               true that there have been no finds of authentic Byzantine light weight solidi made within the area of Gaul about the <name type="place"
                  >Rhone</name>, but a series of so-called pseudo-imperial gold coins of western manufacture which utilized approximately the same weight
               standard is known.<ref target="#CH1-n52">52</ref> It is <pb n="130"/> quite correct that typologically these pseudo-imperial gold coins are not
               imitations of contemporary Byzantine pieces, and it is also true that the trientes of the pseudo-imperial series are much more common than the
               solidi whereas in the authentic Byzantine series only solidi are known. There is, however, a satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon. By the
               mid-sixth century the triens had become the standard coin throughout the West. Nothing would be more logical for the moneyers of southern Gaul
               than to apply the new standard in terms of the coins in common use as well as in the series of solidi. The question of types is also susceptible
               of similar explanation. Justinian had abandoned the three-quarter face portraiture with the spear lying transversely on the shoulder about 539
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>, and this type did not reappear on the regular Byzantine issues until the reign of Constantine IV Pogonatus.
               The three-quarter face bust, however, was the type utilized for the pseudo-imperial pieces. Since the type itself was quite commonly used
               throughout the length and breadth of the civilized world from the reign of Constantius II there can be no doubt that it was better known in the
               West than the new portraiture introduced by <name type="pname">Justinian</name>.<ref target="#CH1-n53">53</ref> Thus the inhabitants of Gaul were
               given a coinage with types that were not remarkably different from those to which they had become accustomed, but these new coins bore marks of
               value which indicated that they were clearly derived from the authentic Byzantine light weight series insofar as the weight standard was
               concerned. The solidi were worth twenty-one siliquae and the trientes were valued at seven siliquae. That, of course, is the most essential
               feature of the relationship between these new Gallic pieces and the light weight Byzantine solidi.</p>
            <p>Other aspects of the history of the pseudo-imperial coins point to the same close relationship with the Byzantine solidi. The pseudo-imperial
               coins reflect the same tendency to move northwards that was so noticeable in the case of the Byzantine solidi from the region of the Rhine. The
               North was less highly developed than the South. A goodly number of the hundred or so specimens of the pseudo-imperial coins have been found in
                  <name type="place">Britain</name> and other northern areas. Thus some of the pseudo-imperial pieces have been recovered in the hoard from <pb
                  n="131"/> Sarre, near Reculver, in Kent and in the hoard from Nietap. They also occurred in the Sutton-Hoo ship burial and in the Wieuwerd
               hoard as well as in the Bilgaard and Hichtum terps in <name type="place">Frisia</name>. This would seem to be another instance of the attraction
               of the more Germanic, and consequently less highly developed areas, for light weight gold currency.</p>
            <p>Pseudo-imperial gold was issued regularly at <name type="place">Marseille, Aries, Uzès, and Viviers</name> and intermittently at <name
                  type="place">Venasque, Die, Valence, Vienne</name>, and possibly Grap as well. All of these cities, of course, are located in the <name
                  type="place">Rhone Valley</name>, and this valley was a major artery of trade from the <name type="place">Mediterranean</name> littoral into
               the interior. From the sea ports along the coast goods were moved up the Rhone into the heart of Gaul, and the network of other rivers throughout
               the country made for relatively easy communications with the other parts of the land.</p>
            <p>It seems most likely that this pseudo-imperial currency of Gaul was first issued during the last years of the reign of <name type="pname">Justin
                  II</name>. Rigold suggests that it was begun about the year 574 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Five trientes are known which were struck in
               the name of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>, and since they reveal a similarity to the earliest pseudo-imperial issues in the name of
               Maurice, they may confidently be placed quite late in the reign. The reign of Tiberius Constantine is represented by a single solidus struck at
               Aries and recovered with the hoard of Wieuwerd, and a single triens which may have been struck at Uzès. Since the mints of <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_2995469">Marseille</name>, Aries, and Viviers were represented on the five trientes of <name type="pname">Justin II</name>,
               it can be seen that the coinage of this variety was known over half the distance between <name type="place">Marseille and Lyons</name>, but it
               was not quantitatively very important as yet. The great period for the striking of these Gallic coins was the reign of Maurice Tiberius. Since on
               these pseudo-imperial pieces the Emperor's name is given as MAVRICIVS Tib or just MAVRICIVS rather than always Tib MAVRICIVS, they, as well as
               the authentic Byzantine light weight issues in his name, must have been struck in 583 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> or later. Pseudo-imperial
               coinage in the name of Maurice Tiberius is particularly plentiful, and it is clear than even during the reign of Phocas and the early years of
               the reign of Heraclius only a very few gold pieces of this series were issued in the names of these rulers. Instead the name of Maurice was
               revived, and two groups of coins which were issued <pb n="132"/> posthumously in his name can be distinguished. By 616, however, the last traces
               of the independence of the cities in <name type="place">southern Gaul</name> had been eradicated, and the pseudo-imperial series was replaced by
               one of royal origin which bore the royal effigy but emanated from the samec area.</p>
            <p>Historically the series of pseudo-imperial coins reflects the political influence of the Byzantines in the cities of the <name type="place">Rhone
                  Valley</name>. The relationship between the various Frankish rulers such as <name type="pname">Sigibert, Childebert, and Chilperic</name> and
               the Byzantine emperors were never as close as during the years from about 584 to 594. Subsidy payments for Frankish aid against the Lombards were
               regularly made, and as late as 601 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>, when the third Exarch of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_ravenna">Ravenna</name>, Callinicus, renewed the struggle against the
               Lombards, contacts with the Franks were necessary. In 606, however, a truce with the Lombards marked the final end of the effort by the Byzantine
               to carry offensive action against the Germanic barbarians. The decline of Byzantine influence was a concomitant of the enlargement of the realm
               of Chlotar II, the successor of Chilperic in Neustria, as an independent sovereign. In 613 Chlotar had seized all of Gaul as his own, and it was
               not long before he imposed his savage rule in the Rhone Valley as surely as elsewhere in Gaul.<ref target="#CH1-n54">54</ref> There is thus a
               connection in time between the decline of the efforts of the Byzantine rulers against the Lombards, the striking of the pseudo-imperial series in
               southern Gaul, and the rise of the realm of Chlotar II.</p>
            <pb n="133"/>
            <p>The success of the Frankish king in establishing his authority in southern Gaul is accurately reflected in the replacement of the imperial effigy
               and name by that of the king. A new weight standard had been introduced in the south, and gradually, but surely, it spread northward.
               Typologically, as well as in the matter of weight, the pseudo-imperial coins were the prototypes of most of the later Merovingian pieces. The
               "anonymous" local coinages which are so plentiful were largely produced in imitation of the light weight pseudo-imperial currency.</p>
            <p>It can be said without fear of dispute that the <name type="place">Roman</name> experiment with the use of light weight gold currency was a
               complete success in the field of external trade. The secondary trade artery along which most of these coins are found remained somewhat backward
               as compared with the more romanized sections of Europe for a considerable period of time as shown by its attraction of the pseudo-imperial
               pieces. This, however, is only a subsidiary aspect. Gold coinage of lighter weight made it possible to use less of the precious metal which the
               Byzantines treasured so closely to carry on their western trade. The tendency in <name type="place">western Europe</name> in the early mediaeval
               period was consistently towards lighter and smaller gold coins as shown by the adoption of the triens as the common gold piece rather than the
               much more precious solidus. Economic decline gave gold coins a much greater purchasing power, and as a result the lighter coins could perform the
               economic functions which had required solidi of full weight during earlier periods. Even after the peoples of the West were fully cognizant of
               the change which the Byzantines had introduced into the gold coinage used in external trade these advantages still remained. It must not be
               forgotten that the lighter weight gold standard was quickly adopted by the cities of the southern Gallic region, and from there it spread
               throughout the Frankish realm and the rest of the European successor states. As long as the Byzantines had an active interest in the western
               trade the adoption of this lighter standard made it possible for them to use a smaller amount of gold for their transactions, and at the same
               time it brought the gold coinage which they were using in this trade into direct alignment with the prevailing trend of monetary policy among the
               peoples of the West including the Franks, Suevi and Visigoths, who adopted the lighter standard.</p>
            <pb n="134"/>
            <p>But the very success of this <name type="place">Roman</name> innovation created a gap between the currency of <name type="place">Gaul</name>,
               which rapidly influenced the coinage of the remaining peoples of <name type="place">western Europe</name>, and that of the Byzantine Empire in
               its entirety. Even in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_3175395">Italy</name>, the <hi rend="italic">Pragmatic Sanction</hi> issued by <name
                  type="pname">Justinian</name> had created a common currency acceptable for the entire realm and therefore different in standard from the more
               recent Merovingian pieces. Recently conquered provinces were rapidly integrated into the economic life of the Byzantine Empire, and the
               commercial activities of the merchants engaged in purely internal trade were geared to the use of a solidus of twenty-four carats. There is
               literary proof that the light Frankish gold was not permitted to circulate within the Byzantine Empire. <name type="pname">St. Gregory</name>, in
               a letter to Dynamius, the Patrician of the Gauls, mentions a sum of four hundred <hi rend="italic">Gallicanos solidos</hi> which are obviously
               different from the imperial variety.<ref target="#CH1-n65">65</ref>
               <name type="pname">St. Gregory</name> was merely recognizing the distinction between imperial and Gallic solidi in the last decade of the sixth
               century. In a second letter written about two years later the same Pope speaks of the <hi rend="italic">“solidi Galliarum, qui in terra nostra
                  expendi non possunt, apud locum proprium utiliter expendantur."<ref target="#CH1-n56">56</ref>
               </hi> This can only refer to the pseudo-imperial coinage issued in the <name type="place">Rhone Valley</name>. Since this coinage was on
               approximately the same weight standard as the authentic Byzantine light weight gold currency, it is obvious from the literary evidence as well as
               from the list of sites where light weight solidi have been found that they were not intended for general use within the Empire. Gold, on the
               other hand, would never have been used for a currency which might be limited to a particular market place such as <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name>. Only foreign trade with <name type="place">western Europe</name>, a trade in which <name
                  type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> played such an important part, provides the explanation for the nature and the
               locations of the finds of this light weight coinage and its imitations.</p>
            <p>The coinage of pseudo-imperial gold in <name type="place">southern Gaul</name> ceased during the reign of Heraclius, and the influence of the
               imperial government in Gaul declined sharply at the same time. It was at <pb n="135"/> precisely the same instant that the pressure of the
               Persians reached the zenith. Coinage of light weight solidi at <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria">Antioch</name> had come to
               an end before the reign of Phocas. During the reign of Heraclius, Antioch was actually seized for a short time by the Persians. <name
                  type="place">Antioch, Damascus, Jerusalem, and even Egypt</name> were temporarily held by the Persians. Coevally the Avars launched an attack
               against the city of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</name>, and Heraclius pondered the wisdom of flight to <name type="place"
                  corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</name>. Fortunately the Avar attacks were a purely temporary phenomenon, and the trade in the <name
                  type="place" corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name> was not seriously hampered. The hoards and finds from the <name type="place"
                  corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name> show that the Byzantine emphasis on trade there continued through the reign of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_constantine_iv">Constantine IV</name> Pogonatus. Trade with the East, however, must have been seriously affected by the
               Persian wars which punctuated the reigns of Phocas and Heraclius during the first quarter of the seventh century. The Byzantine victory at the
               Battle of Nineveh which was followed by the death of Chosroes and a series of dynastic convulsions within Persia exhausted the Persians and made
               it possible for the Byzantines to conclude a very favorable peace.</p>
            <p>During the reigns of Phocas and Heraclius, as the Frankish realm was expanding under <name type="pname">Chlotar II</name> and Byzantine influence
               waned in <name type="place">Gaul</name>, the number of light weight solidi issued by the Byzantine government appears to have increased. The
               subsidiary trade route along the <name type="place" corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name> was probably used to a greater degree than in the
               reigns just preceding that of Phocas. Certainly the majority of the Byzantine coins found in the sites along this route were struck in the reign
               of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>. Thus it seems obvious that while Byzantine influence in <name type="place"
                  >southern Gaul</name> was paramount there was no need to exert great efforts along this subsidiary route, but when the Frankish kings had
               complete control and the Persian difficulties were pressing, the imperial government attempted to extend its activities along the <name
                  type="place" corresp="#pleiades_2748179">Rhine</name>.</p>
            <p>It is possible that the same forces which necessitated the increased activity of the Byzantines in the West along a subsidiary trade route also
               created the need for an expansion of trade in <name type="place">southern Russia</name>. Russian museums contain a startling number of light
               weight solidi. Gold coins, however, are marked by extreme mobility in the hands of collectors, and it is unsafe to make any deductions on the
               basis of <pb n="136"/> specimens in museums. Certainly the reigns of <name type="pname">Constans II</name> and <name type="pname">Constantine IV
                  Pogonatus</name> witnessed the use of these coins in the <name type="place">Ukraine</name> as shown by the hoards. The movements of the
               Bulgars were probably the factor that made for an end of Byzantine efforts at the use of light weight solidi in <name type="place">southern
                  Russia</name>. A new power in the form of the Khazar state was being erected in <name type="place">southern Russia</name>, and the Byzantines
               dealt with the Khazars on different terms.</p>
            <p>Whatever the basic causes, the Islamic conquests, the decline of stability in <name type="place">Gaul</name> and the later growth of the power of
               the Mayors of the Palace, the Bulgar pressure in the <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_162152">Balkans</name>, and a succession of Byzantine
               emperors of limited ability about the end of the seventh and the beginning of the eighth century, there can be no doubt that the concerted effort
               at building up the trade of Byzantium with the West was over by the reign of <name type="pname">Constantine IV Pogonatus</name>. It was indeed
               declining sharply as early as the reign of <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>. Of course it did not cease abruptly
               and completely, and some articles which were necessary for maintaining the prestige of the chancelleries of the western monarchs or the church
               continued to be imported, but the fact that Byzantine hoards and coins no longer occur with any frequency cannot be denied. Byzantine policy, as
               has been recognized by all Byzantine historians, was different in the eighth and ninth century from that of the period from <name type="pname"
                  >Justinian</name> through <name type="pname">Constantine IV Pogonatus</name>.</p>
            <p>The Pirenne thesis has been commented upon by a host of historians and mediaevalists of such stature as Lopez, Dennet, Baynes and many others,
               who have modified it in many respects. Many authors, of course, have gone so far as to reject that thesis completely. The subject of this
               monograph, however, is much less extensive than the external trade of Gaul during the Middle Ages. Most of the products in question in any
               discussion of the Pirenne thesis were controlled by the Islamic successors of Byzantium in the near East after the reign of <name type="pname"
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclius">Heraclius</name>. Discussion of many other factors than the finds of Byzantine coins in the West must enter into
               a complete analysis of the Pirenne thesis. The hypothesis propounded in connection with the light weight solidi, it is true, is of some
               importance with regard to that thesis, but it is in no sense a broad commentary. <name type="place">Carolingian</name> economic conditions are
               not pertinent to a discussion of the solution <pb n="137"/> of the problem of the light weight solidi, but a complete agreement on the nature of
               the <name type="place">Carolingian world</name> is vital to any discussion of Pirenne's views. It is precisely in that connection that <name
                  type="pname">Pirenne and Dopsch</name> are most clearly in disagreement. The numismatic and archaeological evidence presented here adds a new
               feature to any discussion, however, by showing that for a period of time which coincides with the growth of the Persian menace in the sixth and
               seventh centuries the Byzantines assiduously attempted to build up their external trade with peoples at a lower stage of development. That effort
               ended with the reign of <name type="pname">Constantine IV Pogonatus</name>, and the nature of international trade necessarily changed.</p>

                  p. 101) of 445 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>, it is stated that money-changers may buy the solidus for 7,000 nummi and may sell it for 7,200
                  nummi. The law codes specifically require that all obryza solidi be exchanged at the same price. <hi rend="italic">C. Just.</hi>, XI, 11, 3,
                  and <hi rend="italic">C. Th.</hi>, IX, 22, 1, are only two of the many examples of this. A change in the demand for the exchange of gold into
                  other currency might make it necessary to alter the margin of profit of the money-changers. One of the letters of Symmachus of 384/5 <hi
                     rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> tells us of just such a change. "Vendendis solidis, quos plerumque publicus usus exposcit, collectariorum corpus

                  valued at 6,000 denarii, so that like the sun it might represent the age of the world. Even though it is clear that this was not the value of
                  the solidus in the sixth century, it does indicate that Cassiodorus understood that the ratio of the solidus to the denarius could be fixed by
                  law and maintained at a given level.</p>

                  conquests of Islam, in his view, completed the process of the shift of the center of economic importance eastwards, while the antisemitism of
                  the <name type="place">Byzantines</name> resulted in a westward migration of the Jewish merchants which made possible the Carolingian economic

                     >M.G.H., Scriptores rerum merowingicarum,</hi> I, p. 173) accuses <name type="pname">Justin II</name> of cupidity. The mere fact that a
                  Byzantine emperor collected taxes by a more efficient system than was current within the Frankish state would be enough to gain him such a
                  description in the West. Still it is interesting that light weight solidi were introduced into Gaul during the reign of the very man who was
                  so marked by Gregory of Tours. <name type="pname">John, Bishop</name> of Ephesus, in the reigns of <name type="pname">Justin II</name> and
                     <name type="pname">Tiberius II Constantine</name>, also has some very unpleasant things to say about <name type="pname">Justin II</name>
                  and <name type="pname">Sophia</name>. The distinct impression is given that <name type="pname">Justin II</name> was miserly and accumulated a
                  hoard of precious metals while <name type="pname">Tiberius II Constantine</name> was by nature very generous. Ed. <name type="pname">E. W.

               <p>The reverse type of the pseudo-imperial coins is a cross surmounting a small globe. There is no true prototype for this in Byzantine

               <p>The connection between the historical situation and the pseudo-imperial coinage is adequately established in greater detail by <name
                     type="pname">S. E. Rigold</name>, "An Imperial Coinage in <name type="place">Southern Gaul</name> in the Sixth and Seventh Centuries," <hi
                     rend="italic">Numismatic Chronicle,</hi> Series 6, XIV (1954), pp. 93-133. Further discussion of incidental features regarding the
                  pseudo-imperial coins, such as the meaning of these coins in connection with the expedition of Gondovald, is not pertinent to the main thread
                  of the argument. The earlier view of <name type="pname">Luschin von Ebengreuth</name>, "Der Denar der Lex Salica," <hi rend="italic"
                     >Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien,</hi> Phil.-hist. Klasse, CLXIII (1910)» Abh. 4, pp. 28 and 38, was
                  that the trientes in Gaul were first lightened to seven and one-half siliquae, and that only after 582 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> were
                  they lowered still further to seven siliquae. The evidence cited to support this is very weak. <name type="pname">Luschin von
                     Ebengreuth</name>, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 39, also held that during the reign of <name type="pname">Chlotar II</name> the
                  standard was lowered to twenty siliquae per solidus, but his argument is not completely convincing. The fact that most Merovingian trientes
                  cannot be dated as accurately as other coins increases the difficulty inherent in the subject.</p>

                  listed its weight as 4.00 grammes. He suggested that the style of both the obverse and reverse indicated that the piece was struck in <name
                     type="place" corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</name>. In his view the workmanship clearly did not point towards Italian mintmasters. <name type="pname"
                     >Tolstoi</name>, p. 295, No. 22. See note 19. This was the only light weight solidus of the Emperor <name type="pname">Justinian</name>
                  which was struck in the ninth <hi rend="italic">officina</hi>.<lb/> Since it is customary, the figure on the reverse has been described
                  throughout the text and catalogue as a Victory, but it should be pointed out that instead of the high-girdled standing female figure found on
                  the coinage prior to the reign of <name type="pname">Justin I</name> this is a frontal archangel clad in tunic and pallium. The late <name
                     type="pname">Prof. Albert Friend</name> suggested that there might be some connection between the new male figure of an archangel which was
                  introduced on the coinage in the reign of <name type="pname">Justin I</name> and the extant panel of an ivory diptych in the British Museum
                  showing an archangel holding a staff in his right hand and a <hi rend="italic">globus cruciger</hi> in his left standing on the steps of an

                  in the Museo Civico of <name type="place">Udine</name>. He suggests that it may have been a southern Gallic imitation of the coinage of the

                  No. 24 (Coin no. 4) but with a different design on the obverse. The photographs show that both the obverse and reverse of this piece are
                  similar to Coin no. 4, but that the cross in the hand of Victory on the reverse of the next piece is different. It was <name type="pname"

               <p>The obverse legend contains a malformed A which is upside down (V). The coin, however, is clearly an authentic Byzantine piece. Ratto included
                  a note in his catalogue indicating that he was unable to determine whether this particular series was destined for a specific area within the
                  Empire or for the Empire as a whole. He does say, however, that the rarity of these coins indicates a small issue. In addition, he points out
                  that he knows of no other light weight solidi after the reign of Marcian until this series was inaugurated. It would be difficult, if not
                  impossible, to prove that prior to Marcian light weight solidi were regularly issued as a distinctive series.</p>

                  <name type="pname">Tolstoi</name>, pp. 295-296, No. 26, gives the weight of this piece as 3.75 grammes. He describes the obverse as similar to
                  his No. 23 (Coin no. 3) and the reverse as the same as that very coin save for the most unusual mark in the exergue of <pb n="177"/> this
                  specimen. According to <name type="pname">Tolstoi</name>, Coins nos. 1, 3, 4, 11, 12, and 28 were struck in the East and not in the West. This
                  conjecture, which he based on style, was supposedly supported by the fact that all of these pieces were acquired in <name type="place"
                     >Russia</name> and three of them in the southern portion of that country. Since coins are among the most easily transported objects, and
                  these coins were not found <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> this can hardly be considered a proof of any great consequence. Gold coins move
                  very easily through the channels of trade. <name type="pname">Tolstoi</name> further conjectured that since the inscription in the exergues on
                  the reverses and the style of the individual pieces did not indicate <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_constantinople">Constantinople</name> as the place of manufacture,

                  This may be confirmed by comparison with Coin no. 32 in this catalogue. These two coins seem to be strikingly similar, but it is hardly likely
                  that an identification can be established. <name type="pname">Belfort</name> speaks of a swelling on the edge of the coin (<hi rend="italic"

                  Mattingly noted the remains of the cross surmounting the globe on the reverse. These remains are discernable on the photograph, but they were
                  overlooked by later authors. Actually the traces of the cross are so slight that it seems possible that an attempt was made to obliterate the
                  cross from the die. Mattingly also attributed the coin correctly to Justin II and Tiberius II Constantine. The coin was acquired by the
                  British Museum in 1938 by purchase in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> from a Syrian coin dealer. Cf. <name

                  on a coin of the Kyrenia treasure. A spatula and chain which may be connected with the coin from Cyprus were recovered from the same people
                  who had the so-called Kyrenia girdle, but there is no proof that they were definitely associated in the find. The mounted coin is in the

               <p>There is a possibility that both Coin no. 79 and the Kyrenia coin were struck in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria"
                     >Antioch</name> in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, for aside from the relatively close find spot of the Kyrenia
                  coin and the purchase locations of the two coins there is corroborating evidence. <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_antiocheia_syria"
                     >Antioch</name> was the only place apart from Carthage which struck coins with two busts. Other places struck coins with two emperors or
                  the emperor and heir-apparent seated, but the tradition for striking twin busts facing front at this time seems to have existed at Antioch.
                  See Chapter III.</p>
               <p>These coins can be accurately dated. <name type="pname">Justin II</name> during the latter part of his reign had lost his reason, and as early
                  as December 574 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> Tiberius II Constantine had been created Caesar and had administered the Empire in conjunction
                  with the Empress Sophia. During a short period of lucidity, however, <name type="pname">Justin II</name> was prevailed upon to associate
                  Tiberius II Constantine with himself as Augustus on September 26, 578. He even went so far as to crown the new Augustus with his own hand on
                  that day. On October 5 of the <pb n="180"/> same year, however, <name type="pname">Justin II</name> died, so that this group of two coins must
                  have been struck between September 26 and October 5, 578 <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>

               <p>It is worth noting that the type of Victory standing facing front aside from these two pieces occurs for the reigns of <name type="pname"
                     >Justinian</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#nomisma_maurice">Maurice Tiberius</name>, and <name type="pname">Phocas</name>. These two

                  about the time of the coronation of Heraclius Constantine in 613. The dated bronzes show that in the year twenty (629/30) Heraclius
                  Constantine was represented with a beard and as equal in stature with his father. See note 98. Cf. <name type="pname">J. Dirks</name>, "Trésor

                  conjectural. The beardless head doubtless begins in <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 641, <pb n="186"/> when the Emperor was only eleven. In a
                  few years (about 646 ?) his face displays a close beard and whiskers. Then follows the long beard type, the first appearance of which may be
                  assigned to <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 651/2, as in that year Constans is represented with a long beard on the dated <hi rend="italic"
                     >Æ</hi> of Constantinople. At this time he was only about twenty-one years old, and the portrait is obviously entirely conventional and
