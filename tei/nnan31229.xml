            <p>It has been laid down as a general rule that coins cannot be considered of primary importance as historical evidence. Their chief uses are to
               check the statements of contemporary writers and to fill in details; they rarely make history. In the early periods of a nation's history, when
               evidence from coins is of the greatest value, it is generally meagre. In later periods when inscriptions on coins are fuller and more
               illuminating, we have a variety of other sources, so that the evidence of coins naturally occupies a subordinate position. On the other hand, we
               do not hesitate to accept the as- <pb n="2"/> sertions of coins, because money always mirrors current events. Even when the reflections are
               distorted, their very untruthfulness not infrequently affords valuable information.</p>
            <p>Apart from actual statements, coins supply historical material in a variety of indirect ways. For instance, since gold coins of the Greeks and
               Scythians in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> are practically unknown, while the gold currency of the Kushans is
               extensive, we are free to conclude that gold for some reason had become abundant after the downfall of the Greek power</p>
            <p>Coins have indirectly proved of the highest value to the archæologist, for the finding of coins along with statues and inscriptions, where the
               latter are undated, gives a clue to the period at which they were produced. Such finds have shown that Græco-Buddhist statues of the best period
               of the Gandhara school which is splendidly exemplified in the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> Museum, <placeName corresp="#geonames_1172451">Lahore</placeName>, were contemporary with the Kushan king, Kanishka. Again, coins present us with a continuous series
                  <pb n="3"/> of documents illustrating the development of the artistic designs which embellish them, and of the scripts in which the
               superscriptions are written. For these reasons they are of material interest to the artist and to the epigraphist. In addition to facts, coins
               are fruitful of surmise. The perils of such surmising are perhaps illustrated in the attempts made to unravel the mutual relationships of the
               various members of the Indo-Bactrian, Scythian and Parthian dynasties. Still, such deductions, if free from fancy, cannot be far away from the
               truth and in certain periods of early Indian history we have to be content with conjecture. So much for a general consideration of the Muse of
               history and her numismatic handmaid.</p>
            <p>Now let us turn to Indian history and numismatics. My present paper deals with the monetary issues of the early foreign invaders—Greeks,
               Scythians, Parthians, Kushans and Ephthalites—and with the indigenous pieces from the earliest times down to the Mohammedan <pb n="4"/> invasion
               which are found in <placeName>Northwest India</placeName>—especially the <placeName>Punjab</placeName>, in which province I have served for
               seventeen years as a member of the Indian Civil Service. I propose to contribute a second paper which will deal with the coins of the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> from the Mohammedan conquest down to the present day.</p>
            <p>The term "Indo-Greek" is adopted as a general appellation for the monetary issues of the Greek invaders of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and their immediate successors with whom Greek culture, as revealed by their coins, was still a living
               force. For convenience I also include the issues of the Bactrian Greeks just prior to the invasion, of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>. I propose to distinguish the Greek invaders of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>
               by the name "Indo-Bactrian." Then come the issues of what are conventionally termed the Indo-Scythians, Indo-Parthians and Great Kushans down to
               and including the better executed coins of Vasu Deva. The Bactrians and Indo-Bactrians overlap as some of the Greek kings struck money of both
               types.</p>
            <pb n="5"/>
            <p>In his preface to the British Museum Catalogue of the Coins of the Greek and Scythic Kings of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, Mr. <persName>Stuart Poole</persName> remarked that few
               fields of numismatics offer richer material, historical, archæological and even philological. To a very large extent these contemporary documents
               in metal are the only testimonies to a period which would otherwise have disappeared from history. There are a few meagre notices by historians
               of the Bactrian kings Diodotos, Euthydemos, Demetrios and Eukratides. We are also informed that Heliokles was the last king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName>. He was overthrown by an irruption of savage tribes from the steppes of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q27275">Central Asia</placeName>, and the Greeks who had crossed to the Indian side of the Hindu-Kush were completely cut off
               from European civilization. The names of Menander and Apollodotos are just mentioned by classical annalists, but those of the numerous other
               Indo-Bactrian princes are only found on their coins, and till fourteen years ago no other evidence of their existence was known.</p>
            <pb n="6"/>
            <p>But we now have the Brahmi inscription at Besnagar in the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q158467">Gwalior</placeName> State, which relates that
               the pillar on which it is inscribed was erected by Heliodoros, son of Dion, a subject of the great king Antialkidas of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1163715">Taxila</placeName>. This is one of the many remarkable discoveries made in recent years by the Archæological Department
               of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The historical importance of the coins now being discussed is not confined to the issues of the Greek princes. Our knowledge of the so-called
               Indo-Scythians, Indo-Parthians and Great Kushans is almost entirely derived from the study of the coins. The Indo-Parthian pieces give us the
               name of Gondophares, known to Christian tradition as the Indian ruler under whom the Apostle <persName>Saint Thomas</persName> suffered
               martyrdom. One of the Kushan rulers is Kanishka, the famous convener of the fourth great Buddhist Council, the body whose deliberations gave
               consistency and official sanction to the doctrines of Northern Buddhism. As regards the philological importance of the Indo-Bactrian <pb n="7"/>
               coins, it must not be forgotten that they provided the key to the Kharoshthi or Bactrian Pali script. Until their discovery the edicts engraved
               in this script on the pillars and rocks by the Mauryan king <persName>Asoka</persName> could not be deciphered because they were written in
               unknown characters. The Indo-Bactrian pieces are bilingual and were the "Rosetta stone" by means of which the <persName>Asoka</persName>
               edicts were unravelled. Many documents written in the Kharoshthi character have been recently discovered by Sir <persName>Aurel
                  Stein</persName> in Chinese Turkestan. A further interest lies in the shape of these coins, many of them being square or oblong, and in the
               characteristic designs of gods and animals as conceived by the oriental Greek artist.</p>
            <p>A rapid sketch of the numismatic history of the various dynasties is now in order. In the summer of B. C. 334, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great crossed the Hellespont at the head of thirty thousand infantry and four thousand
               five hundred cavalry. He forced the passage of the <pb n="8"/> Persian frontier and afterwards defeated the Persian monarch Darius in two
               decisive battles at Issus and Arbela. The death of Darius in B. C. 330 was followed by a revolt of the Persian governors of what is now <placeName>Western Afghanistan</placeName>, and the rebellion of these eastern satraps showed <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> that resistance had not died with the decease of the monarch. His first plans were probably confined to the humiliation of
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, but they seem gradually to have been enlarged with success until they embraced the
               complete subjugation of the Persian empire and the conquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> even to the mouth of the
               Ganges.</p>
            <p>Alexander's comprehensive mind contemplated much more than a predatory excursion resulting only in plunder. When he determined on the conquest of
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, he had also formed
               plans for their permanent occupation and future government. This he purposed to effect by securing the goodwill of his subjects. By the year 328
               he had crushed the rebellious Persian satraps and had <pb n="9"/> carried his arms over the River Oxus into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName>. Early in the following spring, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               crossed the Indian Caucasus (Hindu Kush). He spent the remainder of the year 327 in the reduction of the various cities and strongholds of the
                  <placeName>Kabul valley</placeName>, ending with the capture of the famous <persName>rock-fort</persName> of <placeName corresp="#pleiades_59687">Aornos</placeName>. In the spring of B. C. 326 he crossed the River Indus at Ohind and marched to <placeName corresp="#geonames_1163715">Taxila</placeName> (now known as Shahdheri), twenty miles northwest of <placeName>Rawalpini</placeName>, where he
               was hospitably received by the Indian king whose capital it was. From <placeName corresp="#geonames_1163715">Taxila</placeName>
               <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> advanced to the River Hydaspes (Jhelum) where he was so stoutly opposed by
               the Indian monarch Porus that he could only pass the river by a stratagem. Then followed a great battle between the Greeks and Indians, the
               submission of Porus and the foundation of the cities of Nikaia and Bukephala. Next came the capture of the hill-fortress of Sangala and the
               advance to the River Hyphasis (Beas) beyond which the Greek army, dispirited by <pb n="10"/> long marches and the warlike character of the
               people, refused to proceed.</p>
            <p>There, says Gibbon, on the eastern bank of the Hyphasis, on the verge of the desert, the Macedonian hero halted and wept. He erected twelve huge
               altars dedicated to the principal deities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> and then retraced his steps to the banks
               of the Hydaspes, where he prepared a fleet to convey his army to the sea. After various adventures he reached the Indian Ocean about the middle
               of B. C. 325. The Greek fleet coasted round to the Persian Gulf while <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               himself made a long and harassing march through the desert hinterland of the Arabian Sea to <placeName corresp="#pleiades_922695">Persepolis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName>. He died at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName> shortly after his arrival in B. C. 323.</p>
            <p>The chief provinces of Alexander's empire were apportioned to his leading officers. The eastern provinces were <placeName>Bactriana</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#pleiades_60431">Ariana</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>,
               or the countries watered by the Rivers Oxus, Helmund and Indus, respectively. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> comprised
               the three satrapies of the <pb n="11"/> Parapamisadæ (<placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName>), the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7387605">Sind</placeName>. Out of the confusion which followed Alexander's death, Seleukos, satrap of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_babylon">Babylon</placeName>, emerged as the predominant ruler of <placeName>Bactriana</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#pleiades_60431">Ariana</placeName>, but was not successful in his expedition against <persName>Chandragupta
                  Maurya</persName>, king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, known to the Greeks as Sandrokottos. By the resulting treaty,
               about 305 B. C., the <placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName>, the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7387605">Sind</placeName> were added to the dominions of <placeName>Chandragupta</placeName>, and <placeName>Bactriana</placeName> became the most easterly province of the kingdom of Seleukos. The pact thus made between the Indians and the Greeks was
               cemented by the residence of Megasthenes, ambassador of Seleukos at the Indian Court. To Megasthenes and his successor the ancient Greeks and
               Romans were indebted for nearly all their knowledge of the Indian territory.</p>
            <p>It is clear, therefore, that Alexander's settlements in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, whatever they may have been,
               had disappeared within twenty years of his death and we have no reason to believe that his rapid march through <pb n="12"/> the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> left anything permanent behind it. No trace of his twelve altars has ever been discovered, which is not surprising
               considering the great changes which have taken place in the courses of the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> rivers during the last two thousand
               years. It is extremely doubtful that <persName>Alexander struck</persName> coins in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>. However, a second Greek invasion of the <placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> was to take place with more durable consequences.</p>
            <p>Seleukos was assassinated in B. C. 280 and was succeeded by his son Antiochos Soter. Antiochos 11, surnamed <persName>Theos,</persName>
               followed his father Antiochos Soter in B. C. 261 and commehced hostilities against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>. The
               eastern provinces of the Syrian empire, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> and <placeName>Parthia</placeName>,
               seized this opportunity to cast off a yoke which had become little more than nominal. The details of this revolt are obscure, but it resulted in
               the establishment of a remarkable offshoot of Hellenic colonial enterprise in the heart of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255147">Asia</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> had greatly increased in strength as the result of fifty years of
               almost con- <pb n="13"/> tinuous peace, and its governor Diodotos assumed independent power. At about the same time a Parthian named Arsakes
               succeeded in setting up a separate State and launched <placeName>Parthia</placeName> on its great career as the rival not only of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> but ultimately of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>. These important events are assigned to the year 250 B. C. Diodotos struck coins in his own
               name, with a design of the thundering Zeus, and assumed the title Soter, meaning saviour or protector. This title, if it had any special
               significance, may have referred to the part played by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> in protecting the eastern
               flank of the Hellenic world from the barbarians of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q27275">Central Asia</placeName>. He was probably succeeded
               by his son of the same name, and this second Diodotos fell a victim to the conspiracy headed by one Euthydemos, who appears to have taken
               effectual means to prevent any of the rival family from disputing his retention of power. Under Euthydemos, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> attained the summit of its prosperity. About 209 B. C. he successfully resisted a <pb n="14"/>
               formidable invasion by Bactria's former suzerain, Antiochos III, the king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName>.
               Subsequently he carried the Bactrian arms over the Hindu Kush into the <placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName>. Doubtless his son Demetrios took a
               prominent part in these military operations. The demeanor of Demetrios as a youth had won the regard of Antiochos; his exploits as a man pushed
               the Greek dominion in the East well over the Indian border. The story of Demetrios must have been preserved down to a very late period, as
               Chaucer refers to the "grete Emetreus, king of Inde," in the Knight's Tale.</p>
            <p>Euthydemos figures on several fine coins as a man in the prime of life with a stern and heavy face. The seated Herakles is the usual design on
               the reverse of the gold and silver coins, while a prancing horse figures on the copper pieces—possibly a reference to <placeName>Balkh</placeName>, the capital of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName>, the city of the horse.</p>
            <p>Demetrios must have acceded to the throne about 190 B. C. There is reason <pb n="15"/> to believe that he extended the Greek conquests to the
               Delta of the Indus, but his coins are seldom if ever found east of the Indus. The best known issue of Demetrios is the series which represents
               the king wearing an elephant's scalp head-dress; these coins are purely Attic in design and weight. Demetrios, like Euthydemos, seems to have
               adopted Herakles as his patron deity. Herakles, the Hercules of the Romans, was the most celebrated of the heroes of classical antiquity. He was
               the apotheosis of rude strength and valor. His weapons were the club and the bow and arrow; his most frequent attributes are the club and
               lion-skin. He was a great traveller and is said to have reached <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, an exploit which is
               also attributed to Dionysos, the god of vegetation and the giver of wine and alcoholic pleasures. In new lands reached by the Greeks, some local
               hero or divinity who represented strength of body and mighty deeds would be identified with Herakles, hence his prominence on Indo-Greek
               coins.</p>
            <pb n="16"/>
            <p>Three obscure princes who were approximately contemporary with, and possibly subordinate to Diodotos and Euthydemos, were Antimachos Theos,
               Pantaleon and Agathokles. Agathokles struck a very interesting and excessively rare series of silver medallions, which bear his name on the
               reverse side, but on the obverse give the portraits and names of <persName>Alexander,</persName> Diodotos, Euthydemos and Antiochos Nikator.
               It is clear that he is claiming relationship with them or acknowledging their suzerainty, but history affords us not a single hint on which we
               might base an account of what must have been a chequered career. These coins present three conceptions of Zeus, first, the god enthroned bearing
               an eagle on his outstretched right hand; then as an avenging deity shielded by the ægis and brandishing a thunderbolt; and thirdly, in an erect
               position carrying the three-headed Hecate on his right hand.</p>
            <p>Zeus, the greatest of the Greek deities, the father and king of gods and of men, was primarily the god of the sky and is <pb n="17"/> represented
               in Art as the ideal of ripe manhood, a mature figure with wavy hair and shaggy beard. The attributes of Zeus are the sceptre, eagle, thunderbolt,
               and sometimes the figure of Nike on his outstretched hand. Kings and queens as depicted on the coins always wear the royal diadem. This was
               originally the blue and white band tied round the tiara of the Persian monarchs and was the old Asiatic symbol of royalty. It later took the form
               of a white silk ribbon sometimes embroidered with pearls.</p>
            <p>It was probably while Demetrios was fighting on the Indian side of the Hindu Kush that his authority in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> was undermined by a rival named Eukratides who appears to have been some connection of the royal
               house of Seleukos and who eventually was able to usurp the regal authority in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName>. This
               happened about the year 175 B. C. In the end Eukratides emerged triumphant from the struggle with Demetrios, who is held to have perished or to
               have been deposed about 160 B. C.</p>
            <pb n="18"/>
            <p>The extension of the Greek dominion to the south of the Hindu Kush is reflected in the coinage of Demetrios, who is the first of the Bactrian
               Greeks to strike money on the Indian weight-standard with an inscription in the Indian vernacular (now called Kharoshthi), in addition to the
               Greek legend; the one legend being a literal translation of the other. There are one or two very scarce bilingual copper coins of Demetrios of
               the characteristic Indian square shape, and I possess an Indian tetradrachm not yet published.</p>
            <p>The money of Eukratides has been found abundantly, both the pure Greek kind current in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> proper and the Indian bilingual class struck for use on the Indian side of the Hindu Kush. The earliest issues of Eukratides
               bear the image of Apollo. Apollo was one of the chief divinities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, the god of
               sunshine and light, lord of oracles and prophecy, of music and poetry, and the ideal of manly youth and beauty. His attributes were the bow and
               arrow and <pb n="19"/> the tripod-lebes, a three-footed stool bearing the lebes or cauldron for burning incense. The most characteristic issues
               of Eukratides are the splendid tetradrachms with the triumphant design of the mounted Dioskouroi, the great twin brethren, sons of Zeus. Their
               principal function was that of divine protectors and aiders of mankind, more especially travellers by sea, and their stars appeared above the
               ship of the voyager as a sure sign of help. They are shown on coins either mounted or on foot, and carry palms of victory and lances. Their
               distinctive dress was the chlamys and the pilos. The chlamys originated as a rider's cloak worn over armour, a short light mantle clasping at the
               neck. The pilos was a conical cap of felt or leather worn by artisans and fisher folk. Some seventy years ago a sensation was caused in the
               numismatic world by the discovery of a gold twenty-stater piece of this type. That magnificent coin was purchased for the French National
               Collection and may be seen in the Bibliothèque Nationale.</p>
            <pb n="20"/>
            <p>It is the largest surviving gold coin of ancient times, is still unique and is a fitting token of Bactrian wealth and power.</p>
            <p>The Roman historian Justin tells us that Eukratides while returning from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> was murdered by
               his own son. The name of the parricide is not recorded. This event is assigned to the year 150 B. C. Some authorities have identified the
               murderer with Heliokles, some with Apollodotos. Be that as it may, the removal of the strong hand was followed by the rise of a number of
               princelings probably belonging to the rival houses of Eukratides and Euthydemos, who constantly fought amongst themselves and whose civil wars
               hastened the dissolution of the Bactrian monarchy. Heliokles and Antialkidas are the last kings to strike money of the Attic standard and design.
               It is therefore safe to assume that with them passed away the Greek authority over <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName>,
               and that after their time the Greek power was limited to the <placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName> and the Northwest <pb n="21"/>
               <placeName>Punjab</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> was overrun by an irruption of nomadic tribes who
               are known as Saka Scythians, and the Greeks south of the Hindu Kush were completely cut off and are heard of no more. Positively all that history
               has to tell us of the Indo-Bactrians consists of two casual references to Apollodotos and Menander. I have already stated that the Besnagar
               pillar inscription, discovered in 1907, is the only known inscription containing a reference to any Bactrian or Indo-Bactrian king. Excavations
               at <placeName>Balkh</placeName> would probably give invaluable results, but at the present time <placeName>Balkh</placeName> is
               inaccessible for the European investigator. We have reason to believe that the Sakas were an involuntary vanguard thrust over the Bactrian
               frontier by the pressure of other obscure hordes on the Mongolian plains who were destined to overwhelm and replace both Greeks and Sakas in
                  <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName> and <placeName>Northwestern India</placeName>. I shall briefly allude to these developments after
               tarrying a few moments with the declining fortunes of the Greeks.</p>
            <pb n="22"/>
            <p>The death of Eukratides was speedily followed by the extinction of the Greek power in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName>, Heliokles being held to be the last Greek king pf <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>. The coins, however, show that a king named Antialkidas, who was probably later than
               Heliokles, struck money of both Bactrian and Indo-Bactrian types. After the time of Heliokles and Antialkidas, Greek rule was confined to the
               Indian side of the Hindu Kush, and the Greek dominions appear to have split up into a number of petty states which were generally in a chronic
               state of war amongst themselves. Sir <persName>Alexander Cunningham</persName> held that only thirty years elapsed between the death of
               Heliokles and the end of the Greek rule in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> under the last Greek king, Hermaios. Mr.
                  <persName>Vincent Smith</persName> says one hundred and eighty years. The latest and best informed opinion, that of Professor <persName>E. J. Rapson,</persName> places the death of Eukratides about 150 B. C. and the downfall of Hermaios about 20 A. D.</p>
            <p>We have to fit into this period the <pb n="23"/> reigns of some twenty-five Greek princes whose names, with the exception of Apollodotos and
               Menander, are known from their coins only, which, of course, are all of the bilingual Indo-Bactrian types and weights. The slight progressive
               degradation of design and workmanship combined with the knowledge of the find-spots and such minor details as the comparative abundance or
               scarcity of the coins of each king, form the sole evidence which the ravages of time have spared to tax the constructive ingenuity of the modern
               investigator. Menander (apparently the Milinda of the Buddhist records) is the only Bactrian king after Eukratides of whom contemporary records
               tell us anything. He probably reigned at Sagala, possibly the modern <placeName>Punjab</placeName> town of <placeName>Sialkot</placeName>,
               from about 160 to 130 B. C., and seems to have united the entire Greek power in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> under
               himself. He succeeded in the reconquest of the Indian kingdom of Demetrios—the <placeName>Northwest Punjab</placeName>, <placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7387605">Sind</placeName>—and may have carried the Greek <pb n="24"/> arms in
               raiding expeditions down the Ganges valley to <placeName>Patna</placeName>. His conversion to Buddhism is a moot question, but there can be no
               doubt that Buddhism exercised a great power over the early invaders of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, as we shall see
               in the case of the Kushan emperor, Kanishka. The death of Menander seems to have been followed by a general scramble for power. About the same
               time the Hindu princes must have driven the Greeks back from Menander's outlying territories in the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> plains. A
               gradual decline ended in the downfall of the last Greek king, Hermaios.</p>
            <p>The coins of Apollodotos, as we should expect from his name, are largely devoted to the cult of Apollo. But the silver issues usually bear the
               image of Athene with Ægis and thunderbolt. She was one of the principal Greek deities, personifying to them the guiding influence of life in
               counsel, industry and strategy of war. Her poetical name was Pallas. As the patron goddess of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> she was regarded as representing the pre-eminence <pb n="25"/> of the Greek genius in art, literature and science. Her special
               attribute was the ægis, a goat skin plated with scales in which is set the head of Medusa. The companion or symbol of the goddess was the
               owl.</p>
            <p>Gold coins of the Bactrian Greeks are extremely scarce and of the Indo-Bactrians are absolutely unknown. I have already mentioned the unique
               twenty-stater piece of Eukratides. The only other gold coin of Eukratides known to me is the stater now in the cabinet of Mr. <persName corresp="#numismatics_newell">E. T. Newell,</persName> President of the American Numismatic Society. Indo-Bactrian silver coins are found in the
               tetradrachm and drachm sizes, considerably smaller than the corresponding Bactrian denominations which are on the Attic scale.</p>
            <p>As a rule the tetradrachms are extremely rare. For example, when I wrote my <placeName>Punjab</placeName> Museum Catalogue (1914) I knew of
               only one Indian tetradrachm of Heliokles, one of Strato and Agathokleis, three of Archebios, one of Amyntas, four of Antialkidas. They are
               comparatively <pb n="26"/> abundant for Menander, Hippostratos and Hermaios. The usual size is the drachm. Polyxenos is known from one silver and
               one copper coin (both in the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> Museum) ; Telephos from three silver and half a dozen copper coins; Peukolaos from
               two silver and three or four copper; Theophilos from one silver and half a score copper; Apollophanes from a dozen silver. Several other princes
               are almost as rare. There is no reason why new names should not be found. One or two drachm issues are square, but the tetradrachms are
               invariably round. The copper coins are usually square or rectangular. Kingly titles commonly found are <hi rend="italic">Soter,</hi> protector;
                  <hi rend="italic">Dikaios,</hi> just; Aniketos, invincible ; <hi rend="italic">Nikephoros,</hi> victory-bearing. As regards the Kharoshthi
               language, I may just mention that <hi rend="italic">Basileos</hi> translates into <hi rend="italic">Maharajasa, Dikaiou</hi> into <hi rend="italic">Dhramikasa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nikephorou</hi> into <hi rend="italic">Jayadharasa;</hi> in these three words the familiar
                  <hi rend="italic">Maharaja, Dharma</hi> (right) and <hi rend="italic">Jai</hi> (victory) are plainly to be seen. The Greek monogram <pb n="27"/> may denote the name of the local magistrate under whose authority the coin was struck, or sometimes the mint.</p>
            <p>We know that Hermaios was the last of the Indo-Bactrian kings because there is a class of coins which bears two names, that of Hermaios in the
               Greek legend, and Kujula Kadphises in the Kharoshthi. This inference is definitely proved by the disappearance of the name of Hermaios from the
               coinage, its place being taken by that of the Kushan conqueror Kujula Kadphises in the Greek legend without alteration in the type, although
               modern research does not admit that Kujula Kadphises was necessarily the immediate barbarian successor of Hermaios. Thus ended the Greek dominion
               in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> after a brilliant
               career of at least one hundred and fifty years from the establishment of the independent kingdom of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> by Diodotos in the year 250 B. C. But though the political power of the Greeks had disappeared, yet Greek culture and
               civilization survived for another century <pb n="28"/> or so, as shown by the coins of the Indo-Scythian sovereigns Vonones, Moas and their
               successors, as well as by the great Kushan conqueror Kujula Kadphises and his dynasty.</p>
            <p>I should like to interject a few general remarks on these Greek coins. They are beautiful, interesting, rare, and of great value to the
               historian. They possess all the qualities necessary to attract and stimulate attention. I suppose I should never have become a coin collector but
               for the fact that in the early part of my service in the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> I saw two Indo-Bactrian coins which had been found in
               my own District. It is possible for a collector fortunately situated, in <placeName>Peshawar</placeName> for instance, to acquire a fair
               number of the commoner kinds of these coins from the bazaars alone. But the modern collector, however well placed, will not make a good
               collection without recourse to professional agents. He will find that the Bactrian series has been very extensively forged. What a pity it is
               that the modern collector cannot wander about <placeName>Kabul</placeName>
               <pb n="29"/> and the <placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName> in the happy way that the American pioneer Masson did ninety years ago! Under present
               circumstances, <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName> is quite inaccessible for the European, and the excavation of <placeName>Balkh</placeName> must await more fortunate times. A name well known in connection with Bactrian coins is that of Sir <persName>Alexander
                  Cunningham,</persName> a former Director-General of Archæology in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>. Sir <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was one of the first workers in this field and a keen collector for nearly half a century.
               His unrivalled cabinet is in the British Museum.</p>
            <p>I must now ask you to go back with me to the time of the last Bactrian king, Heliokles, and the destruction of the Greek power in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> by the Saka Scythian invasion. The term Scythian was applied indiscriminately to the
               nomadic peoples of Central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>. It is generally accepted that the hordes which have
               successively appeared as conquerors, coming from the Asian steppes to the border provinces of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> during the first century B. C. and the five <pb n="30"/>
               succeeding centuries, are the following in the order of their arrival—the Sakas, the Kushans or Great Yue-Chi of the Chinese historians, the
               Lesser Kushans or Little Yue-Chi, and the Ephthalites or White Huns.</p>
            <p>The ultimate impelling force of these successive waves of invasion from Central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName> seems
               to have been the deterioration of the grazing grounds. The fall of the Greek princes in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>
               was merely one incident in the history of that wellnigh irresistible migration of entire nations in arms, which, after harassing <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, overran almost the whole of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>,
               and under the leadership of Attila the Hun all but overthrew European civilization. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> was
               again visited by a similar scourge in the times of Chingiz Khan and of Taimur; and the Mughal invasion of Babur was followed by the establishment
               of the Mongol or Mughal empire of Hindustan.</p>
            <p>According to Chinese accounts the Sakas were driven out of the countries north of the Oxus by the Yue-Chi. Re- <pb n="31"/> tiring to the south
               and then to the east, they worked round over a region which roughly corresponds with the present provinces of <placeName>Siestan</placeName>,
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_7387605">Sind</placeName> and the <placeName>Punjab</placeName>. This, of course, meant the immediate
               overthrow of the Greeks in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName> and the eventual destruction of the Greek power in the
                  <placeName>Punjab</placeName>, possibly on the death of Menander. However, the Greeks must have continued to hold the <placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName> till the time of Hermaios. It is recorded that the Saka tribes who occupied Sakastene or Seistan afterwards separated and
               formed several distinct states under different rulers. This seems to be borne out by the three distinct dynasties of kings whose names have been
               preserved on their coins. That proceeding from Vonones and his lieutenants, Spalahores and Spalagadames, held to the west of the Indus; a second
               dynasty from Maues (or Moas) and the Azes, on both sides of that river; and a third in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7387605">Sind</placeName>
               and the west of <placeName>Central India</placeName>. To this last the great satrap Nahapana belonged.</p>
            <pb n="32"/>
            <p>There is no direct historical evidence that the Sakas ever occupied the <placeName>Punjab</placeName>, but the three monarchs Moas, Azes and
               Azilises, whose coins are found abundantly in the Northwest <placeName>Punjab</placeName> and <persName>Hazara,</persName> are accepted
               as Saka Scythians. They issued an extensive silver and copper bilingual coinage, the Greek legend being quite legible. Like that of the
               Indo-Bactrian princes, this coinage is without a single specimen in gold, with the possible exception of a tiny gold piece in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_1172451">Lahore</placeName> Museum bearing the unique name Athama. In sharp contrast with the Indo-Bactrian coins
               the pieces of the Indo-Scythians never give us a portrait of the ruler. The coins prove that Azes had an Indian general, Aspa Varma, son of Indra
               Varma, who also served under the greatest of Azes' successors, Gondophares. Sir <persName>Alexander Cunningham</persName> makes Gondophares
               the founder of a separate Saka dynasty in succession to that of Moas, Azes and Azilises, but it is more natural to call this dynasty
               Indo-Parthian, as the portraits and the names <pb n="33"/> of the kings are Parthian. Abdagases was the nephew of Gondophares, and other members
               of the same line were Orthagnes, Pakores and Sanabares.</p>
            <p>The currency of Gondophares is found in great abundance over a wide stretch of country from <placeName>Peshawar</placeName> to <placeName>Delhi</placeName>. His name is derived from the same origin as that of Gaspard, one of the three Wise Men from the East, and occurs in
               the Christian tradition concerning the later life of the Apostle <persName>Thomas.</persName> The apocryphal Acts of <persName>Thomas</persName> contain certain statements which discoveries, made since the commencement of the nineteenth century, have enabled us to test in
               the light of actual history. The narrative tells us that <persName>Thomas,</persName> much against his will and inclination, had to
               undertake the work of preaching the Gospel to the Indians, and that he was placed in the hands of an envoy of Gondophares, king of the Indians,
               who had been sent to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</placeName> in search of an architect able to undertake the construction of a
               palace for his sovereign. <persName>Thomas,</persName> in company <pb n="34"/> of this emissary, left by sea for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, which was reached after a rapid passage. Both proceeded to the Court, where <persName>Thomas</persName> made many converts, including Gondophares himself and his brother Gad, and ultimately died a martyr's death. That after so many
               centuries the actual existence of this king should have been proved by the discovery of his coins in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> is most remarkable. The first specimens were found in <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName> by the American explorer Masson
               about the year 1833.</p>
            <p>The name of Gad, Gada, or Guda, the brother of Gondophares, according to Christian tradition, is possibly contained in a hitherto unelucidated
               Kharoshthi legend on a rare type of coins of Orthagnes. The reign of Gondophares covers the middle of the first century after Christ. About this
               time were issued the very abundant copper coins of an anonymous king who called himself the King of Kings, the Great Saviour (<hi rend="italic">Soter Megas</hi>). All bear a three-pronged symbol, the peculiar device of this ruler.</p>
            <pb n="35"/>
            <p>The invasion of the chiefs, conventionally known as Indo-Scythian and Indo-Parthian, preceded that of the Kushan leader, Kujula Kadphises. I have
               already stated that the first wave of invasion from Central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_asia">Asia</placeName>, that of the Saka
               Scythians, extinguished the Greek power in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName>, and later on in the <placeName>Punjab</placeName>, and left just a remnant of Greek sovereignty in the <placeName>Kabul Valley</placeName>. All alike were swept away by the
               onrush of the Kushans. The work of conquest was continued by the second Kadphises, styled Vima Kadphises on his coins, who overran the whole of
               the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> and <placeName>Northwestern India</placeName>. The dominions of Greeks, Indo-Scythians and Indo-Parthians
               were extinguished, and Northern India came under the Kushan sway.</p>
            <p>It is generally held that the successors of Vima Kadphises were <persName>Kanishka, Huvishka</persName> and <persName>Vasu
                  Deva.</persName> An inscription recently discovered at <placeName>Mathura</placeName>, thirty miles north of <placeName>Agra</placeName>,
               confirms the existence of a king Vasishka between <persName>Kanishka</persName> and <persName>Huvishka,</persName> but his coins <pb n="36"/> have not been found, or possibly, still await identification. Of Kujula Kadphises and Vima Kadphises the only remains are their coins
               and the brief notices of the Chinese annalists; but of their successors, <persName>Kanishka, Huvishka</persName> and <persName>Vasu
                  Deva</persName>, we possess many inscriptions, several of which are dated in an era which has been called the <persName>Vikrama
                  Era.</persName> It may be remarked that there are a dozen different views regarding the date of <persName>Kanishka</persName> and the origin
               of the era. Some writers hold that <persName>Kanishka</persName> began to reign in A. D. 78. One authority places his initial date about A.
               D. 123, another as late as A. D. 278. On the other hand, Dr. <persName>Fleet</persName> held that the Kanishka group preceded that of
               Kadphises. The period covered by the reigns of the three monarchs, <persName>Kanishka, Huvishka</persName> and <persName>Vasu
                  Deva</persName> probably exceeded a century and a half, and the Kushan sway at its <persName>zenith</persName> must have extended from <placeName>Kabul</placeName> to <placeName>Bengal</placeName>. The Kushan type of coin was perpetuated in <placeName>Kashmir</placeName>
               down to the sixteenth century of our era, a duration which I think <pb n="37"/> easily surpasses all records outside <placeName corresp="#geonames_1814991">China</placeName>; and Kushan copper coins and the derived types must have remained in common circulation for many
               centuries after the death of <persName>Vasu Deva.</persName>
            </p>
            <p>It was in connection with the Buddhist faith that the memory of <persName>Kanishka</persName> was preserved by tradition, and the figure of
               Buddha appears on one gold and on a few copper coins. The wonderful relic casket unearthed near <placeName>Peshawar</placeName> bears an
               effigy of the great king <persName>Kanishka,</persName> and the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> Historical Society has published a
               photographic reproduction of the statue of <persName>Kanishka</persName> discovered a few years ago near <placeName>Mathura</placeName>.
               The coinage of the Kushans is very extensive in gold and copper, but only a single genuine silver coin is known and that was from a copper coin's
               die. It thus provides a striking contrast with the currency of the Indo-Bactrians, which is entirely lacking in gold. The coins of Vima Kadphises
               are bilingual, the Greek legend being quite legible and of some length. After his time the Kharoshthi language disappears <pb n="38"/> once and
               for all from the coinage, the only possible exception to this statement being a coin sketched in 1842 and subsequently lost. It was published by
                  <persName>Cunningham</persName> in his work on the coins of the Great Kushans.</p>
            <p>The money of the <persName>Kanishka</persName> group bears legends on both sides in legible Greek characters, but the kingly titles are
               usually Iranian. The Kushan gold coin is based on the Roman <hi rend="italic">aureus.</hi> The entire coinage of Vima Kadphises is dedicated to
               Shiv, the third person of the Hindu Trinity, but the currency of <persName>Kanishka</persName> and <persName>Huvishka</persName> is
               adorned with the images and names of an extraordinary and extensive gallery of gods, goddesses and heroes with Greek, Indian and Iranian names.
               The full pantheon of some thirty deities is found on the gold issues of Kanishka and Huvishka. Like the Athenians of old, these Kushans were
               anxious to offer their devotion to all possible deities though they did not go so far as to dedicate a coin to the Unknown God. The gold coins of
                  <persName>Vasu Deva</persName> gen- <pb n="39"/> erally give us a representation of Shiv; the copper issues have the standing king on one
               side, while on the other there is either Shiv and his bull, Nandi, or a seated goddess called Ardoksho. <persName>Vasu Deva</persName> was
               succeeded by obscure princes known as the Lesser Kushans, but after his time the design of the monetary issues becomes sadly debased and the
               inscriptions difficult to read.</p>
            <p>At this point it is appropriate to give a short account of the earliest indigenous coins and then briefly to describe the various native issues
               down to the Mohammedan invasion. Reference will be restricted to the coins found in the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> and its vicinity, but
               will include some allusion to the Sassanian, Indo-Sassanian and White Hun pieces which are often found towards the North West frontier and in
                  <placeName>Kashmir</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The earliest coinages of the ancient world appear to have been mostly of silver and electrum (a mixture of gold and silver). The earliest coins
               of <persName>Lydia</persName> were made about 700 B. C. by impress- <pb n="40"/> ing small punches or stamps on thick globules or buttons of
               electrum. Indian silver coins, which are certainly as old as the most ancient silver Greek issues, are the punch-marked flat pieces of
               indeterminate shape, but generally approximating to rectangular, adjusted to a fixed weight standard of about 56 grains. They are common all over
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The mode of fabrication is evident at once from an inspection of the coins. Silver was first beaten out into a sheet somewhat thinner than a
               quarter-dollar. Strips about half an inch in width were then cut off and each strip was divided into pieces of the same weight, approximately 56
               grains, and a final adjustment of the weight was made by cutting small bits off one or more corners of the heavier blanks. The marks of the
               chisel still remain on the edges of the thicker pieces, which were broken off when the cut did not go clean through the strip of metal. It has
               been remarked that though the coins known as "punch-marked" are rude, ugly and without legends, and as a <pb n="41"/> rule not assignable to any
               particular kingdom or locality, they possess very special claims on the interest of the scientific numismatist as documents in the early history
               of coinage. They also appeal to the anthropologist as authoritative records of the religious, mythological and astronomical symbolism current
               throughout <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> for many centuries.</p>
            <p>The term "punch-marked" adopted by general consent means that the devices on the coins are impressed, not by means of a die covering the entire
                  <hi rend="italic">flan</hi> but by separate punches applied irregularly on the surface. They often interfere with one another and in some
               cases are so numerous as to result in a confused jumble. Each of these marks may have been the special sign of some moneychanger or tester, or of
               some locality. But this conventional explanation is not sufficient, because we ought to find more punch-marked coins in the earlier stages of
               their manufacture—that is to say, exhibiting not more than one, two or three marks. I have scarcely ever seen a coin <pb n="42"/> which was not
               approximately covered with marks. It seems clear, therefore, that the surface must have been fairly well covered before a piece was released for
               circulation, and as a rule the marks are all different. Little difficulty is experienced in distinguishing the obverse from the reverse because
               the former contains several marks, while the latter is sometimes blank and is rarely distinguished by more than one device. More than three
               hundred different marks have been distinguished.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to say how old these punch-marked coins may be. They are alluded to in the Laws of Manu and even then they are called old. The
               Jataka stories speak of these coins as being current in the time of Buddha, that is, the sixth century B. C. In the early Greek money we have the
               youth of coinage, but in the punch-marked pieces of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> we see money in the very infancy of
               the numismatic art. There is an allusion to Indian money in the record of Alexander's invasion of the <placeName>Punjab</placeName>. <pb n="43"/> Quintus Curtius, describing the reception of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> by Omphis, king of
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_1163715">Taxila</placeName>, says that the Indian ruler presented golden crowns to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and his friends in addition to eight talents of coined silver. As gold was available, it is
               curious that the punch-marked coinage should consist only of silver and of copper. I think that the punch-marked series of the size and weight
               just described was intended to be an all silver currency. The true copper punch-marked coins are thick, massive pieces, which are very much rarer
               than the silver coins.</p>
            <p>The Indian monetary system was essentially original. It differed from the Greek and from all other systems in its unit of weight as well as in
               its scheme of values. The unit of weight is the <hi rend="italic">rati,</hi> the scarlet and black seed of the <hi rend="italic">Abrus
                  precatorius,</hi> the Indian liquorice, sometimes called the red-bead vine; and these seeds can be seen in use at the present day in any
               Indian goldsmith's shop. A single seed weighs something over 1¾ grains and the whole of the Indian money pro- <pb n="44"/> ceeds by multiples of
               this well-known unit. There can be no doubt that the Indian monetary system is the invention of the Hindu mind.</p>
            <p>In addition to the punch-marked coins there are the thick copper coins of Taxila with an elephant on one side and a lion on the other, which were
               the prototype of the square Indo-Bactrian issues. These are true coins with an impression on each side. We also have massive rectangular pieces
               with blank reverses which are held to be more ancient than the foregoing, and go back to at least 350 B. C. They differ from the Greek money in
               every single point, being square in form, different in standard and Indian in type. They are utterly without inscriptions and must be regarded as
               a purely indigenous currency. It is a pity that we cannot point to definite coins as being issues of the famous Mauryan king <persName>Asoka,</persName> but the absence of legends makes the attribution impossible. The earliest gold coins of <persName>Northern
                  India</persName> are one or two small pieces which were probably struck at <pb n="45"/>
               <persName>Taxila</persName> and bear the peculiar symbol which Sir <persName>Alexander Cunningham</persName> called the <persName>Taxila</persName> mark. The site of <persName>Taxila</persName> is twenty miles northwest of <placeName>Rawalpindi</placeName> in the <placeName>Northwest Punjab</placeName> and is being excavated with most valuable results by Sir <persName>John Marshall,</persName> Director-General of Archæology in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The holy city of <placeName>Mathura (Muttra)</placeName> is between <placeName>Delhi</placeName> and <placeName>Agra</placeName>, thirty
               miles north of the latter city, and ancient coins are found in considerable numbers beginning with the drachms of Menander and Apollodotos. The
               copper coins of the Kushans are abundant and there can be no doubt that <placeName>Mathura</placeName> belonged to their dominions; Ptolemy
               includes <placeName>Mathura</placeName> in the lower <placeName>Punjab</placeName>. The monetary issues of <placeName>Mathura</placeName> include coins of Indian rajahs of an indigenous type which are probably earlier than the coins of the <placeName>Mathura</placeName> satraps with Persian names. The most ancient of these foreign satraps seem to be the brothers Hagāna and Hagamāsha. Hagamāsha
               was probably followed by Rajuvula, whose son was <pb n="46"/> Saudāsa. Rajuvula struck drachms in base silver resembling and associated with the
               coins of the Indo-Bactrian prince Strato II, as well as bronze coins after the manner of the rajahs. Mr. <persName>Vincent Smith</persName>
               places Rajuvula and Saudāsa somewhere about 125-100 B. C.</p>
            <p>The <persName>Taxila</persName> and <persName>Mathura</persName> coins are local issues. Though none of them bears the name of <persName>Taxila</persName> or of <persName>Mathura</persName> there can be no hesitation in assigning them to those places because they
               are not found elsewhere. Other ancient Indian coins are distinguished by the names of the tribes which struck them and so may be called tribal
               issues. Well-known tribal coins of the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> are those of the Odumbaras, Kunindas and Yaudheyas, who struck money in
               silver and copper, the silver coins being derived from the Indo-Bactrian drachms. The Yaudheyas were one of the most famous tribes of ancient
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and were specially noted as warriors, their name being derived from the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">yudha,</hi> battle. They are mentioned by the grammarian Pānini, <pb n="47"/> who lived before the time of <persName>Alexander,</persName> as one of the warlike peoples of the <placeName>Punjab</placeName>, and they occupied the country on both banks of the
               River Sutlej.</p>
            <p>To sum up, die-struck coins essentially original in form, design and size, existed in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>
               before the invasion of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Great in 326 B. C. The Greek and Indian types of
               money mutually influenced one another as shown in the adoption by the Greeks of the Indian square shape and weight standard, and by the Indians
               of the drachm form and Greek artistic designs.</p>
            <p>There can be little doubt that the Kushan empire endured till the third century after Christ, but the history of that century is wrapped in
               obscurity. We know, however, that in its latter part a chieftain named Gupta ruled in <placeName>Bihar</placeName>, his capital being in the
               vicinity of <placeName>Patna</placeName>. In the year 320 the throne was occupied by his grandson, <persName>Chandragupta</persName> I,
               who must be regarded as the real founder of the fortunes of his house. This chief established a special era, known in after-times <pb n="48"/> as
               the <persName>Gupta</persName> Era; and many of the inscriptions and coins of his successors are dated in this era. It continued in use in
               parts of northern aind <placeName>western India</placeName> as late as the thirteenth century</p>
            <p>After a brief reign <placeName>Chandragupta</placeName>, transmitted the crown to his son, <persName>Samudragupta,</persName> who at once
               entered on a career of aggressive conquest. After reducing the princes of Upper <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName>, he
               turned his victorious arms against his southern neighbours, and celebrated the attainment of paramount power by the performance of the <hi rend="italic">asvamedha,</hi> or horse sacrifice. After a long and prosperous reign, during which the River Narbada became the southern
               frontier of the <persName>Gupta</persName> empire, <persName>Samudragupta</persName> passed away and was succeeded by <persName>Chandragupta</persName> II about the year 375. Under this rule the <persName>Gupta</persName> empire reached the zenith of its
               power. He attacked, defeated and slew the satrap Rudrasimha, ruler of <placeName>Kathiawar</placeName>, and so extinguished the foreign Saka
               Scythian dynasty of the Western Satraps, which had lasted for four centuries. The <placeName>Punjab</placeName>
               <pb n="49"/> did not form an integral part of the <persName>Gupta</persName> empire, but there can be no doubt <persName>Gupta</persName> power and influence extended as far as <placeName corresp="#geonames_1172451">Lahore</placeName>. Six years ago a find of
                  <persName>Gupta</persName> gold coins was made in the Hissar district of the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> province.</p>
            <p>The <persName>Gupta</persName> currency is essentially a gold issue derived through the gold coinage of the Kushans from the Roman <hi rend="italic">aureus.</hi> Silver and copper money of the Guptas is scarce and unknown before <persName>Chandragupta</persName> II. On
               the annexation of <placeName>Gujarat</placeName> and <placeName>Kathiawar</placeName> he recognized the convenience of the small silver
               currency of the Western Satraps, based on the Indo-Bactrian drachmas, and imitated it closely.</p>
            <p>About 413 A. D. the empire passed into the hands of <persName>Kumaragupta</persName> I, son of <persName>Chandragupta</persName> II.
               This monarch during most of his long reign enjoyed undiminished power, but towards its close he was troubled by an invasion of the White Huns,
               which was repelled by his son <persName>Skandagupta.</persName> The latter, who acceded in 455, reigned till about 480. The in- <pb n="50"/>
               cursions of nomad tribes from beyond the northwest frontier gradually shattered his power, and on his death the empire perished. Remnants of the
               dynasty survived in the eastern provinces for several generations.</p>
            <p>I have already shown that the Greek power in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> was shattered by the invasions of Asiatic
               hordes—Scythians, Parthians and Kushans. The Huns appear on the scene in the fifth century after Christ. These barbaric Huns in their migration
               westwards divided into two main streams, one directed towards the valley of the Oxus and the other to that of the Volga; the former were known as
               Ephthalites, also by the name of White Huns.</p>
            <p>The tribe of Ephthalites was of considerable importance in the history of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName> in the fifth and sixth centuries of our era. The name Ephthalite is an attempt to
               reproduce the original name of the race, which was also called White Hun, because its members were of a comparatively fair appearance. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> they <pb n="51"/> were called Hūnas. Our earliest information about the Ephthalites comes
               from the Chinese chronicles, which state that they were originally a tribe of the Great Yue-chi, that is to say, they belonged to the same stock
               as the Kushans and lived to the-north of the Great Wall. About the commencement of the fifth century after Christ they began to move westwards
               and for the next century and a half they were a menace to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, which they continually and
               successfully invaded though they never held it as a conquest. The Ephthalites defeated and killed the Sassanian king <placeName>Firoz</placeName> in A. D. 484, and the Persians were not quit of the White Huns until 557, when Anurshirwan (Khusru II) destroyed their power
               with the help of the Turks, who now make their first appearance in <placeName>Western Asia</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Huns who invaded <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> appear to have belonged to the same race as those who molested
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>. The headquarters of the horde were at <placeName>Bamian</placeName> and at
                  <placeName>Balkh</placeName>, the ancient capital of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bactria">Bactria</placeName>, and from these points
               they raided towards the <pb n="52"/> south. As already related, <persName>Skandagupta</persName> repelled an invasion, but the defeat of the
               Persians in 484 stimulated the Huns, and at the end of the fifth century their chief, Toramana, penetrated as far as Malwa in Central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and held it for some time. His son Mihirgul, or Mihira-kula (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
               510-540), made Sakala (<placeName>Sialkot</placeName>) in the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> his Indian capital, but the cruelty of his rule
               provoked the Indian princes to combine and attack him about the year 528. He took refuge in <placeName>Kashmir</placeName>, where after a few
               years he seized supreme power and attacked the neighbouring kingdom of Gandhāra, perpetrating terrible massacres. He died about 540 and shortly
               afterwards the Ephthalites collapsed under the attacks of the Turks.</p>
            <p>Our knowledge of the Indian Hūnas is chiefly derived from coins, from a few inscriptions, and from the accounts of the Chinese pilgrim, Hwen
               Tsang, who visited <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> just a century after the death of Mihirakula. The accounts of the
               Ephthalites dwell on their ferocity and <pb n="53"/> cruelty; they are represented as delighting in massacres and torture. The patron deity of
               Mihirakula, as clearly shown on his coins, was Shiv the Destroyer, and he acquired the reputation of a ferocious persecutor of Buddhism. Greek
               writers give a more flattering account of the Ephthalites, and these opinions were probably the basis of Gibbon's verdict when he described the
               White Hun as "a polite and warlike people who had vanquished the Persian monarch and carried their victorious arms along the banks, and perhaps
               to the mouth of the Indus." Nothing whatever is known of their language, but it is held to have been allied to Turkish. The White Huns were more
               barbarous than the Kushans and do not seem to have acted as other than a destructive force.</p>
            <p>The Ephthalites were content to restrike or imitate the coins of the countries which they overran. The silver coins, which are very much scarcer
               than the copper, are large thin pieces of the Sassanian model and as far as portraiture <pb n="54"/> is concerned are little more than examples
               of calculated frightfulness. Many of the White Hun pieces are anonymous, but are usually distinguished by a peculiar mark which <persName>Cunningham</persName> called the Ephthalite symbol.</p>
            <p>After the extinction of the White Hun power in the middle of the sixth century, it seems likely that the Lesser Kushans again possessed the <placeName>Punjab</placeName> for about three hundred years, as we find more and more debased types of coinage which are quite illegible but are
               still to be recognised as descended from those of the Great Kushans and of the Sassanians. I may instance the ubiquitous <hi rend="italic">gadhiya paisa,</hi> or ass money.</p>
            <p>In the ninth century we again get coins bearing distinct names, the well-known "bull and horseman" silver currency of the dynasty commonly called
               the Hindu kings of <placeName>Kabul</placeName>. The coins show a <hi rend="italic">conchant</hi> bull on one side, and on the other a fully
               caparisoned warrior mounted on his charger. The name of the king is in <placeName>Nagari</placeName> characters over the bull. Copper <pb n="55"/> pieces are of the "elephant and lion" type, both animals being heraldic in design. The coinage of <persName>Samanta
                  Deva</persName> is extremely common in the <placeName>Punjab</placeName>. These types continued till the conquest by the Ghaznivis early in the
               eleventh century and the "bull and horseman" type was perpetuated by these Mohammedan conquerors.</p>
            <p>The Maharajahs of <placeName>Kashmir</placeName> issued very degraded copies in copper of the Kushan money, which occupy the period from the
               sixth to the sixteenth century— a wonderful instance of persistence of type.</p>
            <p>In the United Provinces and <placeName>Central India</placeName> we have debased imitations of Sassanian coins without legends in silver and
               copper. There is one common issue with a representation of the boar incarnation of Vishnu and the title <hi rend="italic">Srimad Adi Varaha,</hi>
               which we know was borne by <persName>Bhoja Deva,</persName> king of <placeName>Kanauj</placeName>, in 850-900 A. D. From the tenth
               century there are the abundant mixed metal and copper coins of the "bull and horseman" type in- <pb n="56"/> vented by the Hindu kings of <placeName>Kabul</placeName> which were struck by the Rajputs of <placeName>Delhi, Ajmer</placeName> and <placeName>Kanauj</placeName>. In
               Western and <placeName>Southern India</placeName> are the mediæval coins of the kingdoms of <placeName>Vijayanagar</placeName> and <placeName>Mysore</placeName>.</p>
            <p>We have now reached the commencement of Mohammedan rule in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and with it the end of that
               obscure period in which coins have actually created so much history.</p>
