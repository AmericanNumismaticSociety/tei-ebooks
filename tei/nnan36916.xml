               <hi rend="bold">PREFACE</hi>
            </head>
            <p>It is characteristic of our ignorance of Greek, as opposed to Athenian, history, that the Euboian League, which was in existence for nearly five hundred years (from the fifth century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to the time of the emperor <persName>Claudius</persName> or later) is referred to definitely only in one passage of <persName>Aischines</persName>, and in a few inscriptions. Under the circumstances little attention has been paid to it; no one has attempted to discover what role it may have played in the history of <placeName>Euboia</placeName>. The League did, however, issue coins, which enable us to date its foundation and to see that it had a more or less continuous existence; so much numismatists have observed, but no one has studied the coins in detail, attempting to list all of the issues and to determine their dates closely. It is my hope that this book in which the essential facts are collected and examined may call attention to a comparatively early and not uninteresting federation, and to a series of coins which have some claim to beauty and throw some light on the history of their period; they show, for instance, that the Macedonians, during the period of their supremacy, interfered less seriously than has often been supposed with the autonomous issues of <placeName>Greece</placeName>.</p>
            <p>I began the collection of photographs, casts, and specimens of the various coinages of <placeName>Euboia</placeName> almost twenty years ago, but only in the case of the Euboian League does the number of specimens about which it has been possible to get information seem large enough, in relation to the number of dies used to produce them, to suggest that the series is now known with some approximation to completeness. For the drachms, at least, of the League it has clearly been possible to record most of the dies and die combinations of the original issues. Thus when, recently, the 236 drachms of section B of hoard 4 became available for study, they provided only one new die and four new die combinations. In the kantharos issue, for instance, the 299 specimens about which information is available are all struck from five obverse dies from which respectively 118, 20, 16, 78, and 67 coins are known, and from seven reverses from which 65, 47, 6, 63, 65, 33, and 20 coins are known; here it is clearly rather improbable that the discovery of
<pb n="viii"/>
more specimens will add new dies. In some issues our knowledge of some dies depends on one or two specimens only, but in general it seems safe to assume that future discoveries will add little to our knowledge. There are, I think, few series of Greek coins of which this can be said.</p>
            <p>The fact that the drachm issues are so well known makes it possible to draw certain conclusions. For instance, dies were used very unevenly in this series, and any discussion about their "average length of life" would have little value—in the case of the kantharos drachms just quoted the number of known specimens from a single obverse varies from 118 to 16, from a reverse from 65 to 6. This may only mean that some dies broke sooner than others, but, as will be seen, the explanation is probably more complicated than that. Again, issues struck from such small numbers of interconnecting dies must surely each have been produced in a short period of, perhaps, a few months or weeks only, and long gaps of fifteen or twenty years between issues are clearly indicated by the comparative wear in hoards. This situation is probably more common than has been realized in all except the largest Greek mints.</p>
            <p>Such studies as the present can only be produced through the cooperation of many people. To the officers of the American Numismatic Society my debt is great and various. Its editor, <persName>Mr. Mosser</persName>, spent long hours copying photographs for me ten years ago, and the manuscript bears the imprint of his much more recent efforts. To <persName>Mr. Noe</persName> I am grateful for kindly assistance and pertinent discouragement at many points. <persName>Miss Margaret Thompson</persName> has read the manuscript and made valuable suggestions. <persName>Mr. De Vere Baker</persName> produced most of the photographs from which the plates were made. I was fortunate in having the opportunity, at the beginning of my studies, of discussing some problems with the late <persName>E. T. Newell</persName>, and his kindness to me has been continued by <persName>Mrs. Newell</persName>, who has allowed me to examine and photograph the Euboian coins in her collection. In general I have found the Society's photographic file and incomparable library extremely useful. I have had to impose upon the often overworked an dunder-staffed directors of many European museums, and they have without exception been willing to send me casts or photographs. Coin dealers have usually proved to be interested and helpful,
<pb n="ix"/>
and to a few of them, notably to <persName>Mr. Edward Gans</persName>, <persName>Mr. Royle Baldwin</persName>, <persName>Dr. Jacob Hirsch</persName>, and <persName>Dr. Albert Cahn</persName>, I am deeply indebted; they have both provided me with information and willingly searched on my behalf for additional and unusual specimens.</p>
            <p>A fellowship granted by the <persName>John Simon Guggenheim</persName> Foundation made possible an invaluable trip to <placeName>Greece</placeName>, and leave of absence from University College gave me a year free from lectures and other engagements. A grant from the American Philosophical Society defrayed some of the photographic expenses.</p>
            <p>I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of many scholars and collectors. For casts, photographs, and information I am indebted to the following—the list of names unfortunately gives no indication of the long letters and detailed kindnesses involved:</p>

These facts are mentioned by no ancient author, but may be deduced with practical certainty from the coins, and have been agreed upon for many years. In 1883 <persName>Imhoof-Blumer</persName> published the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> Aiginetic didrachm, then unique, and in a single sentence set forth its date and its significance: "Le style de ce didrachm indique la fin du Ve siècle, c'est-a-dire l'époque précise ou les Eubéens venaient de s'affranchir du joug des Athéniens (411), en se ralliant au parti des Peloponnésiens"<ref target="#CH1-n2">

                  </ref> Thus for the last sixty years there has been agreement among numismatists about the date and circumstances of the foundation of the Euboian League.

                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> are clearly coins of a Euboian League. Their date is certainly late in the fifth century, a fact established not only by their style, but also by their occurrence along with <ref target="http://nomisma.org/id/boeotia">Boiotian</ref> coins of this period in similar condition in the <placeName>Euboio-Boiotian</placeName> hoard of 1951.<ref target="#CH1-n7">

                  </ref> The Aiginetic weight of the earliest issues—a weight never met with otherwise in the island—shows that the league which issued them was more closely linked, at first, to the states of the <placeName>Peloponnese</placeName> than to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> The coins thus make it necessary to suppose that the league was formed either in 411/10, when the Spartans enabled three of the four Euboian cities to rebel from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, or very soon thereafter. Earlier there was no opportunity for such a combination, while by 394 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and doubtless <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, too, were again on friendly terms with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n9">
                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                  </ref> and it is hard to see why a Euboian League should thereafter have coined on the Aiginetic standard. Between 411/10 and 400–395 room must be found for two issues of didrachms which were not immediately consecutive but were separated by a period of a few years.<ref target="#CH1-n10">
                     <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                  </ref> The first issue must accordingly belong either to the last few months of 411 or at the latest to some date in 410; since the revolt had been plotted as early as the fall and winter of 412/11 (Thuc. VIII 4 and 60), secret arrangements may well have

been made for the formal establishment of the League and for the issue of its coins immediately upon the declaration by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> of their independence from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. This, after a postponement of some months, occurred after the Battle of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, about September 411. That the mint, and so perhaps the meeting place, of the League was <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> is less firmly established, but is clearly suggested by the League's adoption of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>'s heifer (see note 6) as its reverse type, and by the quasi-identity of the types of the League with those of the autonomous bronze of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> when that city again issued coins in the late third and early second century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is also indicated by the fact that while the other three cities of the island all issue their own silver in the second half of the fourth century and later, contemporaneously with the issues of the League, there is no Eretrian silver until the second century—<placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> seems to have maintained the league as a fiction after the other cities had more or less abandoned it: at least <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>'s lack of coins in the late fourth and earlier third centuries is certainly not due to poverty or weakness, for the inscriptions and other antiquities found on the site show that the city flourished at this period and was, indeed, the most important of the Euboian towns.<ref target="#CH1-n11">

               <p>One of the first things that the Euboians did after their revolt from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was to narrow the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_dura-europus">Euripos</placeName> until there was room for only one ship to sail through, and to build a bridge across connecting <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> with <placeName>Boiotia</placeName>, for, says <persName>Diodoros</persName>, they were afraid that the Athenians might use their control of the sea to blockade the island.<ref target="#CH1-n12">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref> The motive assigned for the building of the bridge was doubtless also the reason for the formation of the Euboian League; and the construction of the bridge, which was undertaken, as <persName>Diodoros</persName> emphasizes, by all of the Euboians together, was probably the first act of the new federation. The Athenian reaction was immediate but ineffective—Theramenes was sent out with thirty ships, and so with some 6000 men, but found himself outnumbered, and retired. There was another Athenian

general, <persName>Eukleides</persName>, at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> during the winter 410/09, and although it is impossible to determine the exact circumstances, it is clear that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> conducted some restricted military operation here.<ref target="#CH1-n13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref> The activities of this year and a half—the fortification of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_dura-europus">Euripos</placeName> and the fighting at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>—were doubtless the occasion of the first issue of the Euboian League—the didrachms with a lying cow and ΕΥΒ on the obverse, and a nymph's head on the reverse. It is probable that at this early stage in its existence only <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> belonged to the League; between them they controlled most of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>, and they doubtless hoped that the other cities would join them, but <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> could not do so as yet, and, as we shall see, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> probably would not.</p>
               <p>When <persName>Lysander</persName> destroyed the Athenian fleet at Aigospotamoi in April of 405/4, there were two Euboians, and only two, among his subordinate generals—Aristokles of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, and Autonomos of
<pb n="6"/>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>; their statues were set up along with the twenty-eight others in <persName>Lysander</persName>'s great dedication at <orgName type="ethnic">Delphoi</orgName>.<ref target="#CH1-n14">
                     <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                  </ref> It is interesting and probably significant that there is no Chalkidian (or Histiaian) among these generals. The probable explanation is that the Eretrian Autonomos commanded the whole squadron of the Euboian League, and that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, although it sent ships to <persName>Lysander</persName>, did not belong to the League. This, if so, is not surprising; there was no road over the mountains to connect <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> with the other cities, and by sea <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was as close as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>; it must have seemed very unsafe to the Karystians to take any steps of their own volition which <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> might hold against them in the future. They could plausibly maintain that <persName>Lysander</persName> had left them no choice about declaring their independence and about fighting at Aigospotamoi, but joining an anti-Athenian Euboian League would be less easily excused if <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> should ever again be in a position to resent it. Ever since the Persian wars <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> had been forced by its exposed situation to pursue a cautious policy. There was also no Histiaian among <persName>Lysander</persName>'s generals, but the Histiaians had only recently returned to their homes, and the city was probably still weak and disorganized. Thus the fact that there was no Histiaian general in <persName>Lysander</persName>'s fleet probably means that there were no Histiaian ships, not that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> belonged to the Euboian League and so, like <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>, did not have a general of its own. This city, like <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, had no good land connection with central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> (there is still none to-day): its closest neighbors were the states of the <placeName>Maliac</placeName> and <placeName>Pagasaian Gulfs</placeName>. Moreover its citizens (who were originally Ellopians or Perrhaibians, that is Aiolians, not Ionians) had for a generation been living in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName>, whence they had come before the time of <persName>Homer</persName>, and can have felt little Euboian patriotism. Aside from these general considerations, there is one piece of definite evidence: soon after 404 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> made an alliance with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n15">
                     <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                  </ref> which would surely
<pb n="7"/>
have been unnecessary if the city had just become a member of the Euboian League. We may accordingly conclude that the only members of the League in the first decade of its existence were <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>; they undoubtedly hoped that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> would sooner or later be persuaded to join them.</p>
               <p>Autonomos of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> was probably, then, in command of the squadron sent by the League to assist <persName>Lysander</persName>, and the existence of the League will explain the lack of a commander from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>. Autonomos would naturally pay his men in the League's currency. We have here an obvious occasion for the second issue of didrachms on the Aiginetic standard, this time with the head on the obverse—an occasion which exactly fits the numismatic requirements; it is a few years later than the occasion of the first issue in 411/10, and this difference in date is demanded by the slightly better condition of the coins of the second issue in the <placeName>Euboio-Boiotian</placeName> hoard of 1951;<ref target="#CH1-n16">
                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                  </ref> it is also a rather more important occasion, probably involving the payment of more men for a longer period, and this fits well with the somewhat more numerous dies and considerably larger number of preserved specimens of the second issue. There need be little hesitation in dating the two issues of didrachms in 411/10 and 405/4 respectively.</p>

The name of this state was '<placeName>Hestiaia</placeName>' in the fifth century and seems to have been '<placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>' thereafter, although the old spelling occurs occasionally as late as the second century; the chief city was originally also '<placeName>Hestiaia</placeName>,' but after the Athenians drove out the inhabitants and sent a colony of their own to the district in 446, it appears always to have been '<placeName>Oreos</placeName>.'

                  <p>That the animal is a young cow, a heifer, and not a bull, is clear enough on the tetradrachms, and so the didrachms and the drachms presumably also represent a cow—on the drachms it has been customary to describe the type as a "bull's head." The sixth and fifth century coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> have a heifer as their obverse type, and the animal was doubtless adopted for the coins of the League partly as a canting type, partly because she was originally Eretrian.</p>

The occasion of the alliance may well have been an invitation from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> to join the Euboian League; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> perhaps replied that she did not wish to join the League but was quite willing to make a separate treaty with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>. The date given by <persName>Ziebarth</persName>
                     <hi rend="italic">ad loc.</hi> (it was <persName>Wilamowitz</persName>' suggestion) is between 410 and 390; but as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> was probably still in Athenian hands until 404, the inscription will be later than that, and there is no good reason for fixing on any particular date as the <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi>. If we had reason to suppose that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> was a member of the Euboian League in the last years of the fifth century, it might be possible to date the inscription after 395, when the League seems to have become a dead letter (see below). But it is more likely, both on general considerations and because of this inscription, that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> was not a member, and that the alliance should be dated soon after 404. It may be mentioned here that the first word of the text—[-ποι]<graphic url="NNM134_007.jpg"/>
                     <graphic url="NNM134_007a.jpg"/>αι is wrongly read by <persName>Ziebarth</persName>, and is not corrected in <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> XII, <hi rend="italic">Supp.</hi> Examination of the squeeze in the collection of the Institute for Advanced Study in <placeName>Princeton</placeName> convinced me that Eustratiades' original reading of Κ is more likely than Σ—Χ is also a possibility, but the single diagonal stroke which is all that is left of the letter seems too high and steep to be the lower hasta of sigma. And apart from this doubtful reading, the inscription shows consistent rhotacism, so that sigma here between two vowels would be surprising.</p>

               <p>We know little of the history of most minor Greek states except where their relations with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> bring them momentarily to the attention of Athenian writers; what the Athenians either chose to ignore or considered unimportant is recoverable only by inference or through the bright pin points of light provided by inscriptions and, sometimes, by coins. Such is the fate of the Euboian League in the fourth century; it is referred to specifically only once—when <persName>Kallias</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> resurrected or re-invigorated it in 341/0—and we are otherwise dependent for proof that it existed on the fortunately unambiguous evidence of the coins. The knowledge, however, that it did exist makes a number of events more intelligible, and makes it possible to see a certain unity in the otherwise disconnected scraps of information which we possess about Euboian affairs.</p>

<pb n="9"/>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> some time soon after 404, as has been mentioned, but seems thereafter to have suffered from a succession of tyrants and <placeName>Spartan</placeName> harmosts; it did not join the Athenian League until 376/5. <placeName>Dion</placeName> and <placeName>Athenai Diades</placeName>, small places in the north of the island now temporarily independent of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>, had joined a year earlier.</p>
               <p>Thus in the first twenty-five years of the century we have evidence only during the <orgName type="ethnic">Corinthian</orgName> war, and in 378/7, for the pursuit of a common foreign policy by the cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>. Even during the <orgName type="ethnic">Corinthian</orgName> War there is no reference to the League in the treaty between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n19">
                     <hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                  </ref> and it seems that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> did not make a similar treaty at the same time. We can only conclude either that the League was so loose that it did not coordinate the foreign policies of its two (?) members, which seems unlikely, or else that it ceased to be effective about the time of the alliance between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> in 394. This is the probable explanation, for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> undoubtedly preferred to ignore a league which had been formed to oppose her and which could only complicate in an undesirable manner her relations with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n20">
                     <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
                  </ref> Moreover, after 387 a Euboian League might have seemed incompatible, to some extent, with the principles of the Peace of <placeName>Antalcidas</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n21">
                     <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                  </ref> But, as the coins and certain other considerations indicate, the League was not formally dissolved; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> no longer needed each other's support against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> had failed to be attracted by the

federal idea, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was opposed to it; there was accordingly probably no more talk of the Euboian League after 395, but it existed 'on paper'; it lay dormant until its members should find some advantage in reviving it.</p>
               <p>There are two small issues of tetradrachms of the full Euboio-Attic weight, with accompanying fractions, which both style and the evidence of hoards place about the beginning of the century,<ref target="#CH1-n22">
                     <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                  </ref> and which may accordingly be dated about 400 and 395 respectively. The change from the Aiginetic to the Euboio-Attic standard must obviously come between the League's cooperation with <persName>Lysander</persName> in 404 and its participation in the <orgName type="ethnic">Corinthian</orgName> War against <persName>Sparta</persName> (a change of policy sealed by the alliance between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>) in 394. For the next half century there is little sign of common action by the cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>, and there appears to be a corresponding gap in the coinage of the League. No further staters were issued, and when the drachms reappear they are much later in style and lighter in weight, although the types are unchanged: the coinage shows a wide gap in an obviously continuing series.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> seems to have been steadily faithful to the Athenian alliance until after the Battle of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chaeroneia">Chaironeia</placeName> (and indeed until after the Lamian War), but the participation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> in the Second Athenian Confederacy was destined to be spasmodic.

But in 351 <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> sent letters to the Euboian cities warning them not to rely for safety upon their alliances with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> (Dem. <hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> 1.37): his agents and his gold followed close upon his letters, and, although we know no details, it is clear that pro-Macedonian parties sprang up in all the cities except, perhaps, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>.</p>

When the reinforcements arrived he entered <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, drove out both <persName>Kleitarchos</persName> and <persName>Ploutarchos</persName>, restored the democracy, and established a fort at <placeName>Zaretra</placeName> at the narrowest point of the island in the southern part of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>'s territory. He then returned, leaving <persName>Molossos</persName> in command (of a garrison at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>?). <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> apparently rallied his followers, went back to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, captured <persName>Molossos</persName>, and came to terms with one Hegesilaos, who seems to have been sent out on the news of <persName>Molossos</persName>' misadventure. Although <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> now treacherously handed over some Athenian prisoners to his mercenaries who held them to ransom, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> swallowed her pride and paid the price, for she was by this time too heavily involved in the north to send more expeditions to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>. The Euboians, anxious to consolidate their gains, sent ambassadors to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and managed to arrange a peace on terms of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>.</p>
               <p>If this reconstruction of the events is correct, it is clear that the role played by <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> requires explanation. He first asks for Athenian support against <persName>Kallias</persName> and <persName>Kleitarchos</persName>, and then deserts to their camp; the Athenians throw him out of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> but he returns, captures the Athenian commander and treacherously allows Athenians to be held to ransom. In short he begins as anti-Macedonian but becomes reconciled to <persName>Kallias</persName> (and to <persName>Kleitarchos</persName>?—or did <persName>Kallias</persName> agree to support him against <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName>'s agent?) and is then strongly anti-Athenian. To <persName>Demosthenes</persName> and <persName>Aischines</persName> everyone is either pro-Athenian or pro-Macedonian, but if we had Euboian sources we should doubtless see things differently. The probability is that both <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> and <persName>Kallias</persName> were first of all Euboians, and that <persName>Kallias</persName>—
<pb n="16"/>
who a few years later reconstituted or reinvigorated the Euboian League and was at the moment in command of forces ἐξ ἁπάσης τῆς Εὐβοίας—won <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> over by urging that Euboians should stick together against outside interference whether from the north or from the south. When <persName>Aischines</persName> mentions the ambassadors who came to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> to make peace after this war, he calls them οἱ πρέσβεις οἱ τῶν Εὐβοέων and says that they brought a message from <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName>; this may mean only "both the Eretrians and the Chalkidians, one or both of whom brought a message from <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName>," but it is more likely to mean that a joint embassy conducted the negotiations.<ref target="#CH1-n34">

               <p>From a study of the remnants of the Amphiktyonic lists discovered by the French at <orgName type="ethnic">Delphoi</orgName>, it is possible to throw a little further light on Euboian affairs in the later fourth century, and some too, perhaps, on the activity of the League. In our histories of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> the Amphiktyonic League appears briefly and obscurely at the time of <persName>Solon</persName>, disappears for more than two centuries,<ref target="#CH1-n48">

The twenty-four <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> who composed the council of the League had apparently met twice annually throughout the long interval without exercising any great influence on the course of history, but our information about them is confined, for the fourth century, to inscriptions listing the names, and sometimes also the 'ethnics,' of those who attended the spring or fall meetings between 343 and 327. The roster of <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> which can be compiled from these inscriptions is unfortunately very incomplete.

               <p>Too few 'ethnics' are preserved for certainty to be possible about the principle of selection. The above table shows, however, that the information at present available is consistent with the annual representation in turn, from the Battle of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chaeroneia">Chaironeia</placeName> to 327, of all three of the Ionian cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> was probably omitted because its inhabitants were considered to be Dryopians; it is probably also true that it did not belong to the Euboian League.<ref target="#CH1-n52">

strange that the cities should have held their seats in the spring and the following fall (the same year in our calendar) instead of in the fall and the following spring (the same year in most or all Greek calendars) so that the two half-yearly sessions at which each city was represented fell in different official years. Like the Euboians, the Boiotian representatives change in the middle of the year; the Athenians, however, sit by the Athenian (or Delphic) year. Many of the other <hi rend="italic">hiero-mnemones</hi> seem to sit for longer than annual periods.</p>
               <p>If after the battle of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chaeroneia">Chaironeia</placeName> the three Euboian cities took turns year about, as suggested above, in holding the Euboian seat, we find at least five (and so probably at least six) Chalkidians in a row from 340 to 338 inclusive. This anomaly begins exactly at the time when <persName>Kallias</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> was reinstituting the Euboian League, and comes to an end just after the Battle of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chaeroneia">Chaironeia</placeName>. Perhaps <persName>Kallias</persName> secured the seat for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> just as he arranged that the Euboian council should meet in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> (the Eretrians seem similarly to have kept the seat to themselves between 277 and 273—see below); when <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> was in a position to settle Euboian disputes he may have seen that justice was done and the seat shared evenly. Or it may be that <persName>Kallias</persName>, without any outside pressure, turned over to the council of the Euboian League the right to select the Euboian <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi>, and that it (first considering the matter at its second meeting in 339?) decided to rotate the holding of the seat and to begin the rotation in 338 with a Chalkidian, even though Chalkidians had held it, on some other principle (or on none at all), for the last two years.<ref target="#CH1-n53">

the explanation, it is not really surprising to find Chalkidians in a preferred position just at the period of <persName>Kallias</persName>' greatest power, and it is interesting to see that the Euboian cities belonging to the League apparently did, after 338, rotate the seat among themselves.</p>
               <p>It has been mentioned that the Euboian cities, except <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, fought on the Macedonian side in the Lamian War; they were in the army defeated by <persName>Leosthenes</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_plataea">Plataia</placeName> in 323 (Diod. XVIII 11); somewhat later the Macedonians invaded <placeName corresp="#nomisma_attica">Attica</placeName> from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> (Plu. <persName>Phokion</persName> 25), and, probably in retaliation, the Athenians made a destructive attack upon <placeName>Styra</placeName> (Strabo 447). There was thus a good deal of fighting in which the Euboian League was undoubtedly involved, and I should imagine that the 'kantharos' drachms belong to this period.</p>

                  <persName>Kassandros</persName> and <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonos</persName>' generals fought each other at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> in 313, and then, as <persName>Kassandros</persName> had to return to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>, another of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonos</persName>' generals, <persName>Polemaios</persName>, appears to have gained control of the whole island and held it until 309, but the Euboians probably took sides in the struggle only when they were compelled to do so.

How the Euboians felt about this new liberation we are not informed. It seems, however, to have resulted in a second revival of the Euboian League under <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrios</persName>' patronage, a revival which probably began at once although the inscription which is our evidence for it belongs to the early years of the next century. <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrios</persName> immediately began to prepare for war with <persName>Kassandros</persName>, and in 302 he ordered his forces, both military and naval, to assemble at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>; there were Eretrians among the sailors in his fleet.<ref target="#CH1-n56">

                  </ref> The Euboian League had obviously to cooperate in <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrios</persName>' preparations, and I should assign to this year one of its largest issues, the drachms with the 'lyre' symbol, which, from their comparative wear in the 1937 hoard (see p. 64) must come between the 'kantharos' and the 'satyr's head' drachms, and should be rather closer in date to the latter. <persName>Geyer</persName> (in <hi rend="italic">RE Supp. IV</hi> col. 441) raised the question whether the Euboian League survived through the period of the <hi rend="italic">Diodochenkämpfe</hi>, and decided that it probably did not. It is true that the League can have had little scope between, for instance, 313 and 304, but the continuous series of coins (which <persName>Geyer</persName>, of course, assumed should be dated before 338) is fairly good evidence that it was not disbanded. If we are right in putting the 'kantharos' drachms about 320 and the 'lyres' about 302, the League, however inactive,
<pb n="27"/>
will have existed in some sense between those two dates, and if these positive dates should prove to be inexact and the issues are shifted a few years in either direction, one of them will then fall inside the period. We arrive at the conclusion that the League had some kind of existence from its refoundation in 340 until the end of the century. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> belonged to it, but <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> almost certainly did not.</p>

If so, this identity of date is possibly an indication that the three Euboian cities were pursuing a common policy as a result of agreement among themselves, and this might have been secured through the League.

The tetradrachms should accordingly be dated later, but not much later, than the didrachms, which were struck in 411 and 405.

                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi> 190, and <persName>Tod</persName>, <hi rend="italic">GHI</hi> II, 153) is a document definitely dated in 357/6, the lost first part of which clearly contained an alliance between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> resulting from this war; the inscription also mentions the negotiation of probably similar alliances with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>. It is natural that this diplomatic activity should occupy the later part of the summer in which the war was fought, and so fall in the next archon year. <persName>Kahrstedt</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Forschungen zur Geschichte des ausgehenden fünften und des vierten Jahrhunderts</hi>, <placeName>Berlin</placeName> 1910, p. 69) assumed that the inscription shows <persName>Diodoros</persName>' date, 358/7, to be a year too early. <persName>Dittenberger</persName> in his notes <hi rend="italic">ad loc.</hi> also held that <persName>Diodoros</persName> was mistaken, but based his view on the fact that <persName>Diokles</persName>, one of the generals who swear to the alliance in 357/6, also as general made the truce which closed the actual fighting against Thebes (<persName>Demosthenes</persName> 21.174). <persName>Diokles</persName>, otherwise known only because he was a trierarch on several occasions, is not likely, he thinks, to have been a general for two years in succession; therefore the war must fall in the year of the alliance with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>—357/6. <persName>Dittenberger</persName> has usually been followed in this, most recently by <persName>Tod</persName> (l.c.), but the argument is very weak indeed. Many generals were reelected, and <persName>Diokles</persName> may have been one of them; the fact that we do not happen to know (otherwise) that he was re-elected is a poor reason, by itself, for correcting <persName>Diodoros</persName>. Indeed, as we know that the campaign lasted for a month and that peace negotiations always take time, it would be rather surprising if both the campaign and the resulting treaties all belonged to the second half of the summer. <persName>Diodoros</persName>' date should be accepted.</p>

If so the Eretrians may have wished for security against similar attacks in the future.</p>

Meanwhile it may be pointed out that none of the series seems to have been struck at a higher weight than about 3.75 grammes, while the first four of the lighter weight issues of the Euboian League—those with no symbol, and those with the grapes, kantharos, and lyre—all weigh more than this, only the satyr's head and dolphin groups being so light in weight, and these probably date, as will be seen, early in the third century. There is no certainty, however, that there was any relation between the weights of coin issues at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> and at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>; indeed we know that one group, at least, of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> drachms must have been struck about, or not long after, the middle of the century (see p. 21).</p>

                     <persName>Aisch.</persName> 3.85–101; the most informative sentence reads as follows: εἰς γὰρ τοῦτο προήχθη Καλλίας μὲν ὁ Χαλκιδεὺς ὕβρεως καὶ πλεονεξίας, Δημοσθένης δὲ ὃν ἐπαινεῖ Κτησιφῶν δωροδοκίας, ὥστε τὰς ἐξ ᾽ωρεοῦ συντάξεις καὶ τὰς ἐξ ᾽Ερετρίας, τὰ δέκα τάλαντα, ζώντων φρονούντων βλεπόντων ἔλαθον ὑμῶν ὑφελόμενοι, καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῶν πόλεων συνέδρους παρ᾽ ὑμῶν μὲν ἀνέστησαν, πάλιν δὲ εἰς Χαλκίδα καὶ τὸ καλούμενον Εὐβοϊκὸν συνέδριον συνήγαγον. The fullest discussion of the passage is by <persName>Kahrstedt</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Forschungen</hi> pp. 72–78. <persName>Kahrstedt</persName> is, of course, mistaken in thinking that the Euboian League was now founded for the first time. Quite apart from the evidence of the coins, πάλιν in the sentence just quoted is clear enough, while τὸ καλούμενον Εὐβοϊκὸν συνέδριον probably indicates that the "so-called" Euboian League had continued to exist in a shadowy manner from the time of its last activity early in the century. This is far more likely than, for instance, the explanation in <persName>R. B. Richardson</persName>'s edition of the oration—"τὸ καλούμενον: with a slur at the insignificance of the Euboean council compared with the Athenian." The point is, surely, the inactivity of an old league rather than the insignificance of a new one.</p>

                  <p>These figures, known only from <persName>Aischines</persName>, are suspiciously similar and suspiciously high; what is more, it seems very improbable that the Euboian cities paid συντάξεις to the Athenian Confederacy after the fiasco of 349/8 and during the rule of pro-Macedonian tyrants. They seem more likely to be assessment figures of some kind than amounts ever actually paid; but they are taken seriously by <persName>Accame</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Lega</hi> p. 137. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> is not mentioned because she did not join the Euboian League, but why does <persName>Aischines</persName> not mention the loss to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> of συντάξεις from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>? This can hardly be an oversight, and must mean that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> had ceased to contribute considerably earlier than the others. Perhaps she had formally withdrawn from the Athenian League in 349/8, when <persName>Kallias</persName> was, in fact, at war with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, while the memberships of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> had merely been allowed to lapse.</p>

                     <persName>Regling</persName>, discussing those issues of the League and of the Euboian cities which he dates about the middle of the fourth century, held that the difference between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>' types and those of the other cities showed that at times <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, at least, did not belong to the League: "Atque nummis illis Chalcidis et Histiaeae magna similitudo in parte antica est cum foederis nummis, cum Carystii prorsus diversi sint. Quae cum ita sint, concludemus Carystum certis annis a foedere alienam neque ceteras urbes semper foedere coniunctas fuisse, quod rebus annis 357 sq. gestis comprobatur." (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> XII, 9, p. 172, Appendix De Euboeae Nummis). The exact dates of the fourth century coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> require further investigation, but both these cities and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> certainly did strike some coins in the later fourth century. <persName>Regling</persName>'s conclusion is, as we have seen, probably correct, but his implication that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> used a nymph's head as their obverse type (this is the only similarity between their coins and those of the League) <hi rend="italic">because</hi> they were members of the League seems doubtful. The "similitudo" probably seemed greater to <persName>Regling</persName> than it really is, because he doubtless accepted the usual mid-fourth century date for the Histiaian drachms, the reverse type of which is a standing cow; this dating, as I hope to show elsewhere, is too early.</p>

IV 34,11). <persName>Geyer</persName>, in "<placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> (Geschichte)" <hi rend="italic">RE Supp. IV</hi> col. 440, suggests that the lack of <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> shows that the city did not belong to the Euboian League.</p>

                  <p>We do not know how any of the <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> were selected (except that <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName>'s representatives were obviously appointed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName>). It is, however, reasonable to suppose that after the re-establishment of the Euboian League in 340, the Euboian <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> were chosen by the League; indeed it is difficult to imagine any other arrangement while the League was active. The two Thessalian <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> were magistrates of the Thessalian League (not merely representatives of their individual cities)—they swore, along with the other officers of the League, to the treaty of 361/0 between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> (<hi rend="italic">IG</hi> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi>, 116 = <persName>Tod</persName>, <hi rend="italic">GHI</hi> II, 147); it is accordingly probable that they were appointed in some way by the League itself. This is <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName>, not <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>, but the parallel may hold. For <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> itself, much later, we have a possibly pertinent piece of evidence in an interesting though much mutilated inscription the text of which may be found in <hi rend="italic">FD</hi> III<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, pp. 397–8; the best discussion of it is in <persName>Georges Daux</persName>'s <hi rend="italic">Delphes au II<hi rend="sup">e</hi> et au I<hi rend="sup">er</hi> siècle</hi> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> 1936) pp. 341–3. This inscription concerns a dispute between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> on the one side and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> on the other which was arbitrated by the city of Hypata in the archonship of Babylos at <orgName type="ethnic">Delphoi</orgName>—the date is thus between 120 and 108 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see <persName>Daux</persName>, l.c., p. 156, note 3). The subject of the dispute is not specifically mentioned in the preserved part of the text, but, because the inscription comes from <orgName type="ethnic">Delphoi</orgName>, both <persName>Bourguet</persName> and <persName>Daux</persName> suppose the point at issue to be the Euboian Amphiktyonic seat (in this they follow <persName>Pomptow</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Klio</hi> 15 (1918) p. 15 and 17 (1921) p. 197; the theory is accepted without question by <persName>Ziebarth</persName> in <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> XII, <hi rend="italic">Supp</hi>. 1939, p. 207). <persName>Daux</persName> holds that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> maintained, unsuccessfully, that "l'élection du hieromnemon appartient à l'ensemble des Eubéens" rather than to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>, and it is clear that "all the Euboians" were somehow involved, for the phrase appears in the text. My only reserve about this interpretation is that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> was originally Dryopian, not Ionian, and had never, as far as we know, sent a <hi rend="italic">hieromnemon</hi> to <orgName type="ethnic">Delphoi</orgName>; that, of course, may be the reason why their claim was rejected, but if so, why are the Eretrians associated with them? For our present purpose we can put no weight on this inscription; the date is too late and the interpretation too uncertain.</p>

—there are 75 lines with up to 100 letters in each—which, although the preamble is lost, is obviously a decree of the Euboian League laying down regulations for the artists who assisted in the celebrations of the two Euboian festivals, the <hi rend="italic">Dionysia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Demetrieia</hi>, and regulations also for their treatment by the four cities, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>, and <placeName>Oreos</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>).<ref target="#CH1-n58">

                  </ref> The most interesting passages, from our present point of view, are the references to previous legislation: κατὰ τὸν Εὐβοϊκὸν νόμο[ν] (l. 20), κατὰ τοὺς νόμους (l. 33), κάθαπερ καὶ τοῖς Διονυσίοις [γέ]γραπται (l. 41), κατὰ τὴν διαγρα[φήν] (l. 57), τοὺς κειμένου[ς] τοῖς Εὐβοιεῦσι περὶ τούτων νόμους (ll. 68–9), κατὰ τὰ δόξαντα [[τα]] τοῖς Εὐβοιεῦσιν (l. 72). From these references in their context it is clear, as <persName>Ziebarth</persName> points out (in <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> XII, <hi rend="italic">Supp., ad loc.</hi>), that there already existed at the time of the inscription laws of the Euboian League about the celebration of festivals, the duties of choregoi, the awarding of contracts, and about the imposition of some kind of duties or taxes. Offenders are to be fined by the authorities of the city in which the offence is committed, and they are to be [ἐντὸς] τῆς Εὐβοίας ἀγώγιμοι. It is provided that intercalary months shall be inserted at the same times in all the cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>, and that the local authorities may insert up to three intercalary days if necessary (to enable the festivals to be held on the proper dates in the different cities);<ref target="#CH1-n59">

               <p>It is thus clear that the Euboian League flourished in the opening years of the third century under the patronage of <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrios Poliorketes</persName>, that it possessed wide powers to regulate the affairs of the island, and that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> belonged to it—probably for the first time.</p>

               <p>Examining this list we see that from 278/7 to 274/3 the Euboian representatives seem all to have been Eretrians, designated as such; in 274 and 273 respectively occur the names of the philosopher <persName>Menedemos</persName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonos Gonatas</persName>' friend, and of <persName>Aischylos</persName>, his political opponent.<ref target="#CH1-n66">

274 has clearly had repercussions at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> where, as we know, <persName>Menedemos</persName> was exiled about this time for his Macedonian sympathies. The representatives of the next two years are designated as Euboians, not Eretrians (<persName>Eperastos</persName> in 272 is, however, known to be an Eretrian, Amphikrates in 271 is a Chalkidian). We have no information about 270 or 269<ref target="#CH1-n67">
                     <hi rend="sup">67</hi>
                  </ref>, no Euboian representative appears to have been sent in 268, and <persName>Hektos</persName>, designated as a Euboian, appears in 267. Then for the next twelve years all of the Euboian representatives are designated as Histiaians. In short, the Euboian <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> were listed:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>from 278/7 to 274/3 as Eretrians</item>
                  <item>from 273/2 to 268/7 as Euboians</item>
                  <item>from 267/6 to 255/4 as Histiaians</item>
               </list>
               <p>How are these changes in nomenclature and representation to be explained? We have already suggested that the Euboian League, when active, probably appointed the Euboian <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> or at least indicated from which city they were to be chosen (see note 53). Now the Euboian League <hi rend="italic">was</hi> active, as we have seen, under <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrios Poliorketes</persName>, but it may well be that with the establishment of a garrison at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> it had again become a dead letter: the realistic <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonos</persName> was less likely than his romantic father to encourage an organization which might cause trouble for him, and which, from his point of view, served no useful purpose except to arrange for the celebration of pro-Macedonian festivals. That <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> was issuing its own coins early in the third century perhaps points in the same direction.<ref target="#CH1-n68">
                     <hi rend="sup">68</hi>
                  </ref> Accordingly when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> broke away from <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonos</persName>, as
<pb n="33"/>
the lists of <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> show that it did, in or about 279/8, the council of the Euboian League had probably ceased to meet, and the Eretrians, now free, sent representatives in their own name to <orgName type="ethnic">Delphoi</orgName>. This seems a suitable occasion for an issue of coin by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, and if the satyr's head drachms were not struck in 289, as suggested above, they probably belong to 279/8, for the evidence of hoards suggests that they should be dated ± 285 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see page 65 below). It is true that these coins are struck in the name of the League, but that is not really surprising; it need mean only that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> is continuing the policy of issuing no coins in its own name while the League exists at all. The League at the time may have been little more than an Eretrian theory, but there was hope that it could soon be revived. We do not know what form <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>'s break with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> took, but it was probably something short of formal rebellion and open war. At least <persName>Menedemos</persName> seems to have tried to keep his city on fairly good terms with his former pupil, for, as <hi rend="italic">proboulos</hi> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, he moved a decree congratulating <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonos</persName> on his victory over the <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Gauls</persName> at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lysimachia">Lysimacheia</placeName> in 277.<ref target="#CH1-n69">
                     <hi rend="sup">69</hi>
                  </ref>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> was occupied by a Macedonian garrison and probably did not gain its independence until some time after Pyrrhos' victory over <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonos</persName> in 274. Then <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, where <persName>Menedemos</persName> had just been exiled and the anti-Macedonian <persName>Aischylos</persName> was now the leading citizen, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>, which hoped to stay free of Macedonian occupation, naturally re-established the Euboian League for their mutual protection: it is a small but perhaps sufficient piece of evidence that the designation 'Eretrian' in the lists of <hi rend="italic">hieromnemones</hi> disappears in favour of 'Euboian' in 272. This does not tell us whether or not <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, which had belonged to the League at the beginning of the century, now rejoined it, but as they had less to gain from Euboian unity and more to fear from the Macedonian fleet, one may assume that they did not.</p>
               <p>This second revival of the League lasted for only a short time. Either the intrigues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>, where <persName>Arsinoe</persName>'s son was a pretender to the Macedonian throne, or perhaps merely the simple logic of the

situation—<placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> was a necessary link between <placeName>Demetrias</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_corinth">Corinth</placeName>

In either case the seat fell naturally to the Histiaians, for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, as we have seen, was not an Ionian city.</p>
               <p>To this period undoubtedly, to one of the four years between 271 and 267, belongs the last silver issue of the Euboian League, the drachms with the dolphin symbol, struck on the last occasion when the Euboian cities defended themselves against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>. The rough date for them obtained by considering the comparative wear shown by the different groups in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937 (see page 65) was c. 265 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>; they are later in style, and in all the known hoards better in condition, than any of the other issues of the League. They are also struck from a smaller number of dies, which perhaps suggests that <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Antigonos</persName> met comparatively little opposition when he undertook the reconquest of the island.</p>
               <p>Histiaians were now, for a dozen years, the only holders of the Euboian seat, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> must, accordingly, have been fairly independent of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName> at this period.

During the third century three of the Euboian cities were issuing bronze in their own names. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, still apparently clinging to the theory that the League existed, put out a number of bronze issues in the name of the Euboians; that the mint of these coins was really <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> is shown not only by the lack of any issues in the third century carrying the name of the Eretrians, but also by the fact that early in the next century, when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> did issue her own coins as well as the League's, the types of the two series are identical, while those of the other cities continue to be different. Apart from these bronze issues we know practically nothing of Euboian history in <persName corresp="#nomisma_antigonus_ii">Gonatas</persName>' last ten years or in the reigns of <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrios_priene">Demetrios II</persName> (239–229) and <persName>Antigonos Doson</persName> (229–221), until at last the island was involved in the long struggle between <persName corresp="#nomisma_charles_v_holy_roman_empire">Philip V</persName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n75">

                     <persName>Phyton</persName> of 256/5 (see p. 31). In his interesting paper on "La circulation des monnaies d'Histiée" in <hi rend="italic">Études de Numismatique grecque</hi> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> 1951) pp. 179 to 216, <persName>Professor Louis Robert</persName> quotes and discusses this inscription. <persName>Robert</persName> considers that one should not be surprised at the number of <hi rend="italic">proxenoi</hi> in this one year in view of the huge issues and wide circulation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>'s later tetrobols, and he assembles an impressive list of hoards containing these coins and of references to their discovery in many places. Now we do not know the chronological limits of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>'s later issues; <persName>Robert</persName> in a long note (p. 185, n. 3) reviews the differing and rather vague opinions of previous scholars without expressing one of his own, and rightly emphasizes the need for further study of the series. But it is certain that the great bulk of the coins which he adduces are almost a century later in date than the inscription on which he is commenting. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>'s connections may have been as extensive in the early third century as in the early second, but it is fairly clear that at the earlier date her coinage (if any—I hope soon to discuss this question further) was not remotely comparable in quantity, and the close connection with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> which <persName>Robert</persName> quite properly posits for the early second century and which was perhaps—or even probably—in some way responsible for the extraordinary size of her issues, did not exist in the early third, as is shown by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>'s Amphiktyonic seat (which <persName>Robert</persName> does not mention). In short it is better not to assume any close connection between the conditions (whatever they were) which produced the thirty-one <hi rend="italic">proxenoi</hi> of 266/5 and those which produced the numerous tetrobols of the first half of the second century. This is only one more instance of the danger of drawing historical conclusions from an inadequately known body of coins.</p>

               <p>In the winter of 209/8 <persName>Attalos</persName>, King of Pergamon, and <persName>Publius Sulpicius Galba</persName>, proconsul of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>, met in the island of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aigina</placeName>, which <persName>Attalos</persName> had bought from the <orgName corresp="#nomisma_aetolian_league">Aitolians</orgName> for thirty talents, to discuss a plan of campaign which should further <persName>Attalos</persName>' ambition to establish an Aegean thalassocracy, and reduce what the Romans conceived to be their danger from <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName>. The negotiators, their purposes, and the meeting place, so secured, all seem extraordinary to the student of Greek history; indeed they show that the history of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> has ended. But the states of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, now caught up in movements which they had no chance of controlling, nevertheless struggled as far as they could to preserve their liberties, their forms of government, and their accustomed ways of life. The cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> were more helpless than most, for they lay directly on the lines of all

military traffic in this new age, whether north and south or east and west.</p>
               <p>The united fleets of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pergamum">Pergamon</placeName> amounted only to sixty ships, but <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> could not oppose them at sea. He accordingly strengthened the places most obviously threatened, including <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>, and awaited the outcome at <placeName>Demetrias</placeName>. The allies accomplished nothing of importance anywhere; in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>, in 208, they captured <placeName>Oreos</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName>), and attacked <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> unsuccessfully; then <persName>Attalos</persName> returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName>, and <persName corresp="#nomisma_p_galb_aed_cvr_rrc">Sulpicius</persName> retired to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aigina</placeName>, while <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> won back <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> and scored other successes. The war was ended by the Peace of <persName>Phoinike</persName> in 205, and the Romans withdrew from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>. The Euboians had undoubtedly been whole-hearted in their support of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>—or in their desire for Macedonian support—but the League issued no silver, seems to have taken no military action, and had, indeed, in all probability become a dead letter again.

                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> received separate ambassadors from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_magnesia_ad_maeandrum">Magnesia</placeName> on the <persName>Maiandros</persName> inviting them to recognize and take part in the games held there in honor of Artemis Leukophryne; at the same time that these cities were approached individually, ambassadors were also sent to the κοινά of the Boiotians and the Phokians.<ref target="#CH1-n76">

emphasized by <persName>Robert</persName> (see note 72), is the probable explanation. It is unfortunate that we do not know the form it took, or the exact reason for it.</p>
               <p>The remarkable agreement for the division of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>'s foreign possessions which was made in 203/2 by <persName corresp="#nomisma_antiochus_i">Antiochos</persName> the Great of Syria and <persName corresp="#nomisma_charles_v_holy_roman_empire">Philip V</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName> was dictated by their separate interests rather than by mutual good-will, yet the Romans saw in it a possible threat to their own security. And when <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> immediately entered upon a campaign of indiscriminate annexation of Egyptian possessions and free cities alike, <persName>Attalos</persName> and <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, among others, had better reasons for concern. Thus in spite of their previous behavior in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> the Romans were able to begin the Second Macedonian War with the <orgName corresp="#nomisma_aetolian_league">Aitolians</orgName> and the Athenians as their allies and with the rest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> more or less benevolently neutral.</p>
               <p>One of the first events of the war was the capture of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> in a surprise raid by the Roman fleet from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>; the Romans massacred the inhabitants and burned the city but could not hold it (<persName>Livy</persName> XXXI 23). In the following year, 199, the Roman fleet captured <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaia</placeName> and handed it over to <persName>Attalos</persName>; somehow <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> recovered the town. In 198 it was the turn of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>; the Eretrians defended themselves bitterly, but were surprised during negotiations—the Romans found little to loot except works of art, the number of which astonished them—and the Karystians, after the fall of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, saved their lives by surrender. It is even possible that <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> recovered these cities too,<ref target="#CH1-n79">

                  </ref> but <persName>Kynoskephalai</persName> in 197 put an end to the war. It is unlikely that there was any cooperation among the Euboians such as might have been arranged by the League had it been active; the Euboian cities, impoverished and faced only with a choice of masters, fought side by side with their Macedonian garrisons against the Roman assaults, but could not or would not make any combined effort.</p>

Both the four individual cities and the League itself possessed the right to grant to foreigners honors such as <hi rend="italic">euergesia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proxenia</hi> and their attendant privileges: thus the <hi rend="italic">proxenos</hi> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> was granted the right to own land, etc., in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, the proxenos of the <hi rend="italic">koinon</hi> was granted similar privileges in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> generally—and all four cities must have agreed to recognize such rights when the recipient chose to exercise them.

               <p>If we look back over what we have been able to recover of the history of the Euboian League, it is clear first of all that it was never completely and formally disbanded at any time after its foundation in 411/10; this is established not only by the continuity of type in the issues of the League itself, but also by the pointed refusal of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> to strike coins in its own name at periods when the other cities did so and when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> itself was prosperous and influential.

That this meeting reconstituted the Euboian League is not stated in so many words but is highly probable. <persName corresp="#nomisma_flamininus">Flamininus</persName> and the ten commissioners clearly favored the establishment of small leagues in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> (especially in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName>) as a guarantee against the future aggrandizement of either <placeName>Aitolia</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>.

               </head>
               <p>We may well agree with <persName>Grote</persName> that "nothing can be more obscure and difficult to disentangle than the sequence of Euboean transactions" in this year. The problems have been discussed in detail by <persName>Kahrstedt</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Forschungen etc</hi>. (1910) pp. 54–62, and more recently by <persName>H. W. Parke</persName> in <hi rend="italic">JHS</hi> 49 (1929) pp. 246–252, <hi rend="italic">non sine fructu</hi>, as <persName>Zie-barth</persName> says, and the interested reader will find the <hi rend="italic">testimonia</hi> conveniently collected in <hi rend="italic">IG</hi> XII, 9, p. 151–2. <persName>Parke</persName> shows (with <persName>Grote</persName> and against <persName>Beloch</persName>) that the Athenians sent two expeditions to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> in 349/8, first a small one composed of ἐπίλεκτοι and some ἱππεῖς, and then another one to rescue them. He does not, I think, succeed in showing that on this second occasion the Athenians went out πανδημεῖ. The passages he quotes from <persName>Demosthenes</persName> show merely that the cavalry were sent. And <persName>Parke</persName> himself supposes that when they arrived the hoplites were not needed and only cavalry were used.</p>
               <p>But there are other and more serious difficulties in <persName>Parke</persName>'s account. His view (and indeed everyone seems to assume it—<persName>Grote</persName> states it explicitly<ref target="#CH1-n86">
                     <hi rend="sup">86</hi>
                  </ref>) that <persName>Phokion</persName> went first to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and later marched across <placeName>Mt. Kotylaion</placeName> to <placeName>Tamynai</placeName> is unlikely. Once they were in
<pb n="43"/>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> why should not <persName>Phokion</persName> and <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> have waited there for the attack from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>? <persName>Phokion</persName> more probably landed in the plain of the modern town of <placeName>Aliveri</placeName>

                     <hi rend="sup">87</hi>
                  </ref> and marched inland to <placeName>Tamynai</placeName>, intending to enter the plain of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> from the east by crossing <placeName>Mt. Kotylaion</placeName>, perhaps because he found that the narrow coast road—or rather path—between the two plains, which is five miles long and very rough, had been fortified against him. (I have been along this road several times and have observed at the eastern end of the pass the remains of what may well be the foundations of a fort of the classical period or earlier.)<ref target="#CH1-n88">

                  <persName>Aischines</persName> gives this sequence of events quite clearly in 3.86: ἐπειδὴ διέβητε εἰς Εὔβοιαν Πλουτάρχῳ βοηθήσοντες, τοὺς μὲν πρώτους χρόνους ἀλλ᾽ οὖν προσεποιοῦνθ᾽ ὑμῖν εἶναι φίλοι (that is, the Chalkidians), ἐπειδὴ δὲ τάχιστα εἰς Ταμύνας
<pb n="44"/>
παρήλθομεν, καὶ τὸ Κοτύλαιον ὀνομαζόμενον ὄρος ὑπερεβάλλομεν, ἐνταῦθα Καλλίας ... This sentence probably means that <persName>Kallias</persName> tried to persuade <persName>Phokion</persName> when he landed that he, <persName>Kallias</persName>, was more friendly to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> than <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> was, but <persName>Phokion</persName> refused to be persuaded, advanced on <placeName>Tamynai</placeName>, and joined forces with <persName>Ploutarchos</persName>, intending to cross <placeName>Kotylaion</placeName> and reinstate his ally at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>. <persName>Kallias</persName>, who was in command of considerable forces 'from the whole of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>' (including some troops provided by <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> and some Phokian mercenaries secured by his brother <persName>Taurosthenes</persName>), and who had probably already been negotiating separately with <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> without obvious result, attacked <persName>Phokion</persName>. <persName>Ploutarchos</persName>, who in the sequel deserted to the enemy, must have joined <persName>Phokion</persName> at <placeName>Tamynai</placeName> because <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> itself was now in the hands of <persName>Kleitarchos</persName>, whose revolution had been successful (Schol. Dem. 5.5); had <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> still been in control of the city with its excellent fortifications, this battle would not have been fought well to the east at <placeName>Tamynai</placeName>.</p>
               <p>There is a fragment of Theopompos preserved by Steph. Byz. s.v. Δύστος (<persName>Jacoby</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Frag. Gr. Hist</hi>. II B, F149) which certainly refers to this war, and which supports, I think, this reconstruction of the events: ἀποστήσας δὲ τοὺς ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ περιοικίδι τῶν ᾽Ερετριέων, ἐστράτευσεν ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν Δύστον. There is no indication of the subject of the sentence, and no one, as far as I know, has suggested who it might be or how such an expedition could fit into the events of this campaign. But if the subject is <persName>Kallias</persName>, all becomes clear; after driving <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> out of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> (if this had not been done by <persName>Kleitarchos</persName> before he arrived on the scene), <persName>Kallias</persName> secured the support of the inhabitants of the Eretrian plain, and then, crossing
<pb n="45"/>
or marching around <placeName>Kotylaion</placeName>, pursued <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> as far as <placeName>Dystos</placeName>—a strong fortification which rises on a conical hill above a surrounding marsh. On the report of <persName>Phokion</persName>'s landing <persName>Kallias</persName> would naturally fall back on <placeName>Tamynai</placeName>, which was roughly ten miles north-west of <placeName>Dystos</placeName>, to avoid being cut off from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>; he then probably began to negotiate separately with both <persName>Ploutarchos</persName> and <persName>Phokion</persName>. <persName>Ploutarchos</persName>, wavering, joined forces with <persName>Phokion</persName>, but deserted to the enemy when it came to fighting. This interpretation explains the site of the battle, which is a serious difficulty in other reconstructions.</p>
               <p>Again, <persName>Parke</persName> supposes that when the Athenian relief expedition went out (he says 'πανδημεῖ'), the cavalry landed at <placeName>Argyra</placeName>, the infantry near <placeName>Styra</placeName>. This would be very remarkable, for, although the site of <placeName>Argyra</placeName> is quite uncertain, the place is still known to have been in Chalkidian territory, and so well to the west of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n89">
                     <hi rend="sup">89</hi>
                  </ref> while <placeName>Styra</placeName>, whence the Athenians <hi rend="italic">returned</hi>, is the nearest port to <placeName>Zaretra</placeName>, and the most southerly town in the '᾽Ερετρική.' I should assume that the relief expedition, like the first one, landed in the plain of <placeName>Aliveri</placeName>, joined <persName>Phokion</persName> at or near <placeName>Tamynai</placeName>, assisted him in settling affairs at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, and then moved south to fortify <placeName>Zaretra</placeName>, returning to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> from <placeName>Styra</placeName>. What a small detachment of Athenian cavalry was doing at <placeName>Argyra</placeName> is not at all clear, but since <persName>Phokion</persName> summoned them ἐπὶ τήν διαδοχήν, and since <placeName>Argyra</placeName>, wherever it was, was not on the way from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> either to <placeName>Tamynai</placeName> or to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, they were not the relief expedition.</p>
               <p>Finally, <persName>Parke</persName> suggests that Hegesilaos preceeded <persName>Molossos</persName> as commander in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>; but <persName>Molossos</persName> is stated to have succeeded <persName>Phokion</persName> (Plu. <persName>Phokion</persName> 14), and it seems more likely that Hegesilaos was sent out when <persName>Molossos</persName> was captured, perhaps to save as many as possible of <persName>Molossos</persName>' men. <persName>Ploutarchos</persName>' treachery (at which Hegesilaos winked?) apparently consisted in first coming to terms with the Athenians, represented by Hegesilaos, and then handing over some Athenian prisoners to his mercenaries to be held to ransom—for 50 talents, which at two minai apiece would represent 1500 men, but the rate was probably higher.</p>

                  <p>The few visible blocks are large—the largest, at the corner, is almost 2 metres long and 70 to 80 cms. high—smoothed and level on the horizontal surfaces, with 'vertical' joins which are never exactly vertical (the accurate diagonal join between the last two visible blocks in the upper course of the short arm can be clearly seen in <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> III). The thickness of the wall can be seen at one point—120 to 130 cms., made up of two blocks. Only two courses are at present visible on the side, and only one in front; the work is similar to parts of the Eretrian acropolis wall. The ancient foundations run under the field in both directions, but a very small excavation would determine their character. Nearby in the field is a large threshold block with cuttings for door-posts; I also saw a great many sherds (none, to me, distinctive) scattered through the earth of the field. As far as I can discover, these remains have not been observed before, or at least not described in print.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The dates given by Head and <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> are, as we have seen, accurate for the earliest issues of the Euboian League, the Aiginetic didrachms, and they are reasonably accurate, too, for the tetra-drachms and drachms of Attic weight. Head, however, on stylistic and historical grounds, dated the drachms of lighter weight between 369 and 336, while <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> supposed that they ran down as late as 313 only, although he did envisage the possibility that some might belong to the third century. Head's dates were those generally accepted, for it seemed <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> probable that the Macedonians, like the Athenians before them, would have restricted the right of autonomous coinage in the states which were closely under their control—<persName>Newell</persName>, in 1921, wrote: "... 338 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> at which date the island of Euboea finally fell into <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName>'s power and all local coinage ceased."<ref target="#CH2-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> That in point of fact the Euboian coinage runs down into the third century was first maintained by Mme. <persName>Varoucha</persName> in 1941 on the basis of her preliminary study of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937,<ref target="#CH2-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> and of the information she collected about the <placeName>Koskina</placeName> hoard (see no. 2 below), for she put the drachms with a dolphin as symbol (not known to Head or <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>) in the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrios Poliorketes</persName>. In this she was followed by <persName>Professor D. M.

to make a detailed study of the large <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937, and this, with the supporting evidence of a number of smaller hoards, makes it possible, I think, to establish the chronology of these issues on a firm basis. It is best to begin the discussion with a list of the hoards known to me which contained coins of the Euboian League. They vary greatly in importance, and some of the groups listed here may even not be hoards, but it seems desirable to have all of the possible evidence collected in one place.</p>

            <p>Certainty about the burial date of this hoard must wait on the appearance of Mme. <persName>Varoucha</persName>'s full publication. Meanwhile I have tentatively adopted a date some 15 years earlier than that suggested by her in the article just mentioned because of the very slightly worn condition of the last issues of <persName>Ptolemy II</persName> (who died in 247) and of the

This is much the most important hoard, so far discovered, for the arrangement of the issues of the Euboian League. For discussion, see below.</p>

The same source informed me that the total number of coins in the hoard was about 350. It is interesting that the League didrachms with the head on the reverse are slightly more worn than those with the head on the obverse.</p>

               <item>286</item>
            </list>
            <p>These 286 coins are believed to have belonged to the same hoard as section A above, and their composition makes this not at all unlikely; the degree of wear of the various groups of League drachms seems closely similar in both sections; the coins of both sections were covered with a very thick purplish-brown incrustation; in both cases severe cleaning was necessary, which reduced the weight of individual pieces by as much as one-fifth. Whether or not they belong together, the date of burial must have been about the same, for the least worn non-Euboian coin in section B—the tetradrachm of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antiochus_i">Antiochos I</persName> which dates about 275 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>—shows signs of a fair amount of circulation (it is more worn, for instance, than the dolphin drachms). The order in which they are listed follows the apparent degree of wear of the individual issues of the Euboian League; once again it is easy to see that the first four groups are more worn than the kantharos, lyre, and satyr's head groups, and although the distinction between these is not altogether obvious it is clear that the dolphin drachms are less worn than any of the others. The non-Euboian coins fall between 325 and 275 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, thus confirming in general the dates suggested below for the Euboian issues. Unfortunately the cleaning required makes the weights much less significant than those of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937. The most welcome feature of the hoard is the appearance in it of three of the rare drachms in high relief for the date of which there had been very little evidence. It will also be invaluable for the arrangement of the issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>.</p>

            <p>Two of these coins did not come from the hoard, but which two was uncertain. No information was available about date or place of finding. I was able to weigh and examine these coins (which had apparently been cleaned, but were in good condition) and to observe that those without symbol seemed somewhat more worn than those with the grapes symbol; both of these were more worn than those with the kantharos, lyre, or satyr's head, the distinction between which was not clear; and those with the dolphin were the least worn. The coins are all entered in the catalogue.</p>

            <p>Of these coins the one with the grapes was the most worn, the one with the dolphin, least. Those with the satyr's head seemed somewhat more worn than those with the kantharos and those with the lyre, but had actually lost less weight—see Table on page 64.</p>

               <item>5</item>
            </list>
            <p>I was also shown other coins from the hoard of which I made no record and have little recollection; my impression is that they were <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> drachms and didrachms. The two Euboian League coins were much worn, having circulated for roughly two hundred years (the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> king or tyrant probably belongs in the late third century). It is interesting to find these League staters still current in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> in the late third and early second centuries—13 of them occurred in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937 (no. 1 above), and one in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> hoard of about 1945 (no. 4 above). The regular circulation of badly worn coins, and of foreign coins, is attested by innumerable hoards and surely shows that coins were normally exchanged by weight, not by face value as is so frequently assumed. It is pertinent, too, that "clipped" coins are rarely or never met with: I have never seen a Euboian coin which appeared to have been clipped.</p>

            <p>The following 11 coins, showing a characteristic reddish deposit, were plausibly stated to have been found together:</p>

            <p>The following 9 coins were secured at the same time through the same dealer and the comparative wear of the coins with the various symbols is consistent with that shown by similar coins in other hoards; the character of the oxidation is generally similar, but there was no statement about whether or not they were found together:</p>
            <list>
               <item>9 drachms of the Euboian League</item>

            </list>
            <p>The Attic weight drachm and those without symbol were much worn, the kantharos and lyre drachms considerably worn, one of the dolphins was little worn and one considerably (this last coin, because of its wear, and the Attic drachm, because of its wear and appearance, should perhaps be dissociated from the others). No conclusions whatever could be based on this group of coins if it stood alone, but the fact that its wear is similar to that of the known hoards perhaps allows it to increase slightly the total weight of the evidence.</p>

            <p>The following 15 coins were secured at the same time through the same dealer. They are all in the same miserable condition, oxidized and crystallized (six of them are broken), and the comparative wear of the different issues also indicates—although it was not stated by the dealer—that they come from the same hoard. All are Euboian League drachms:</p>

            </list>
            <p>The drachms in high relief, without symbol, and with the grapes are clearly the most worn; there is little to choose between those with the kantharos, the lyre, and the satyr's head; and the dolphin drachm seems slightly less worn than these last. The group of coins, in spite of their poor condition, is interesting because one of the drachms in high relief occurs in it, and supports the conclusion to which various other indications also point (see especially hoard 4), that the "high relief" group comes early in the series of Euboian League drachms of lighter weight (see page 87).</p>

            <p>In spite of the express statement that all of these coins were found together, it is quite clear that the 20 Boiotian "magistrate" didrachms of the mid-fourth century, some of which are in extremely fine condition, cannot have come from the same hoard as the Euboian League drachms, for these, as we have seen, must run down into the third century, while the Elis didrachm appears to belong to the late third century. I suspect that two hoards, one largely composed of staters and one largely of drachms, have been mixed together. In any case it is reasonably clear from their similar appearance and consistent wear that the Euboian League and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> drachms did form part of a hoard. Of the Euboian League drachms much the most worn are those without symbol, then come the grapes, there is little to choose between the coins with the kantharos, lyre and satyr's head, and the single dolphin drachm seems less worn than the others.</p>
            <p>The hoard is interesting, too, for the light which it throws on the comparative dates of the different issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> drachms (although
<pb n="58"/>
these are unfortunately few in number); I hope perhaps to discuss these at some future date.</p>
            <p>The comparative condition of the Boiotian staters with magistrates' names may be of interest for the arrangement of this series, and has been carefully described from the reduced but clear photograph of the reverses only which was all that was available to me; within the different categories the arrangement is alphabetical. It may be noticed that the four coins with the name ΑΡΚΑ vary considerably in the amount of wear which they show. Such differences within one small group are frequent in hoards, and mean that arguments from condition should be based either on a large number of coins from one hoard or on the comparative condition in a number of different hoards.</p>

            <p>The following coins were secured at the same time through the same dealer, and are probably, to judge from their similar appearance and consistent wear, part of the same hoard, although no statement to that effect was made by the dealer (whom I was not able to question):</p>

            <p>In this group of coins the now familiar pattern of wear is very clear–the drachms without symbol are the most worn, next come those with the grapes, the condition of those with the kantharos lyre and satyr's head is hard to distinguish by eye, and the three with the dolphin are clearly the least worn. The group of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> drachms would be more interesting if they were not mostly—17 of them—the unattractive issue with the ΖΗ monogram, usually described as "late and barbarous" (so, for instance, in the <hi rend="italic">British Museum Catalogue</hi>;

but it is clear, both from this hoard and from the last one described, to mention only two, that they are not so late as, for instance, the drachms with the caduceus symbol).</p>

            <p>The dealer through whom the following coins were secured said that they were stated to have come from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>, and that they had probably been found in 1950. They were in poor condition and were covered with a heavy deposit which left no doubt at all that they had been found together. In the course of cleaning the whole surface layer flaked off leaving the coins very light and in some cases scratched, but otherwise restoring the surface to something approximating its condition at the time of burial; it was thus possible to identify the dies, and to estimate the degree of wear with some accuracy although no dependence for this purpose can be placed upon the present weights. In the hoard listed as number 4 above the condition of the coins is somewhat similar, although both sections of that hoard were cleaned more expertly:</p>

            <p>This small group of coins was secured through a dealer who could or would give no information about them. They were similar in appearance to the last group, heavily oxidized so that the type was frequently unrecognizable; I have no doubt that they were all found together. In cleaning, a thick layer flaked off from the surface of every coin, so that their weights are now light and irregular, but the surface is sufficiently sharp and clear for the dies and the degree of wear to be easily determined.</p>

            <p>The 69 coins listed below were stated by the dealer in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, in whose possession they were in 1954, to have been secured by him at the same time from the same man; 18 others in his possession (16 Euboian League drachms and 2 <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>-type drachms), not described below, were in the same group which, when he secured it, contained more than 90 coins. The dealer did not say that they were a hoard, but he supposed, in view of their similar types and condition, that they had probably been found together. With the exception of one of the three drachms with the grapes symbol which seems rather too well preserved, the wear of the coins in each of the different symbol groups seems very similar, and it is obvious that we have to do with a hoard group with few, if any, intrusions. The coins without symbol are obviously the most worn, and those with the dolphin symbol are
<pb n="61"/>
the least. Between them it is difficult to distinguish by eye between the wear of the grapes, kantharos, lyre and satyr's head groups; good photographs were available, but no weights or die positions.</p>

            <p>The fifteen hoards listed above, of which only number 1 can claim to be approximately complete, obviously contain some coin groups on which no sober scholar would care to base any conclusions at all, while number 1, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937, is as valuable in arranging the issues of the League as any hoard could well be—unless, indeed, a similar one several times as large should become available for study. All fifteen have, however, been listed together to show that the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937 by no means stands alone in fixing the order of the League issues, and in determining that they continued into the third century—that, in short, there is nothing in any way unusual or peculiar about it.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to notice that in most of the hoard groups the kantharos and lyre coins are the most numerous, while the grapes and dolphin coins are fewest. This is the same relation as that between the total numbers known of each type, and so probably corresponds to the size of the original issues—in short no single large find of one type has upset the ratio. If one were to judge the size of the issues purely by the number of dies used for each (see the <hi rend="italic">Synopsis</hi> on page 118), one would assume—probably erroneously—that the issue with the satyr's head was as large as that with the kantharos.</p>
            <p>In all of the hoards the drachms without symbol are the most worn (neglecting for the moment the small group in high relief), and those with the dolphin are the least worn, of the lighter issues of the League. Of the other symbol groups it is fairly clear that the drachms with the grapes come early, but it is usually difficult to distinguish
<pb n="62"/>
the comparative wear of the drachms with the kantharos, lyre, and satyr's head.</p>
            <p>In estimating the degree of wear shown by different coins, it is helpful if the coins to be compared are of identical types; it is also helpful if they are not too numerous, for it is difficult to determine with the eye the average wear of a group of coins. One may compare the wear of two coins struck from the same dies with great accuracy; one may still be very accurate if they are of the same type, from different dies; but if the coins to be compared are either different in type, or numerous, only large differences in wear can be recognized with certainty. A complicating factor which has never, as far as I know, been taken into account, is the composition of the metal of the coin—some silver alloys are softer and wear faster than others. Thus the drachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>, which on the whole have a composition much like that of Sterling silver, undoubtedly wore less rapidly in circulation than those of the Euboian League which contain only about 1% of copper on the average.<ref target="#CH2-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> Another complicating factor is the difference of different students' opinions about the degree of wear of the same coins; I have called attention to one case of such disagreement above.<ref target="#CH2-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Wear, however, not only blurs the surface, it reduces the weight of the coin. It is thus possible to tell which of two coins of identical types is the more worn simply by weighing them—providing that neither coin has lost (or gained) weight in other ways, such as oxidation, incrustation, breaking, cleaning, etc. The weight will, of course, be an accurate indication of the degree of wear only if the series to which the coins belong was accurately struck so that it is a fair presumption that the two weighed approximately the same amount when they came from the mint. And if two coins of different types, or even of different issues of the same type, are to be compared, it is essential that the normal or standard weight to which each of the two series were struck should be known,<ref target="#CH2-n10">
                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> and that these standard
<pb n="63"/>
weights should not be too widely separated: obviously the comparative wear of an Aiginetic didrachm and of a <orgName type="ethnic">Corinthian</orgName> drachm found in the same hoard cannot be determined by seeing which coin has lost more weight, for the didrachm has a larger surface, and it is unlikely that coins of these two denominations passed equally often from hand to hand. Finally, it is difficult to be sure that there is an accurate correspondence between the amount a coin has lost in circulation and the length of time between its minting and its burial—indeed coins of the same group found in the same hoard often show differing degrees of wear—as has already been remarked.</p>
            <p>But if all of these considerations are kept in mind, if only coins which, apart from wear, are clearly in fairly good condition are used in the calculation, if the original weights of the series to which they belong are accurately known and not too dissimilar, and if the average weight of a considerable number of coins of the same series is used rather than the weights of individual specimens, then it should be possible to determine how much weight, on the average, the coins of the different series in a hoard have lost. The larger the hoard, the more dependable will be the result. Indeed the method, under favorable circumstances, should be able not only to tell us the order in which different series were struck, but also to give us a numerical relationship between the periods of circulation—at the time the hoard was buried—of the different series involved.</p>
            <p>Fortunately the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937 contained 275 drachms of the Euboian League, most of them in very good condition aside from wear. The following table shows the average loss of weight of the various groups of Euboian League drachms in it, and also in several of the other hoards listed above; the figures were secured by subtracting the average weight of the drachms of each group in the hoard from the standard or normal weight of each group as determined from the frequency tables (see the chapter on the "Silver Issues" and the "Synopsis" on page 118). Coins which appeared to have gained or lost weight by oxidation, breakage, etc., have been omitted from the calculation, and, accordingly, the number of coins on which the averages are based is indicated in each case.</p>

dence; indeed even here the numbers in the grapes and dolphin groups are a good deal smaller than one could wish. The other hoards (except no. 4, the coins of which were heavily oxidized) obviously do not contain enough coins in the various groups to justify making the average weights the basis of any further calculation, but it is worth while to notice that they, too, do in general indicate a similar relationship between the different issues. The argument which follows is based entirely on Hoard 1.</p>
            <p>In Hoard 1 the kantharos drachms have lost three times as much weight as those with the dolphin, and should accordingly, at the time when the hoard was buried, have circulated about three times as long. Applying this type of argument to each of the groups, and taking the period of circulation of the dolphin drachms as the unit, we observe that</p>

            <p>If we now assume a thirty year period of circulation for the dolphin drachms (the figure is admittedly rather arbitrary—the drachms show definite but not extensive traces of wear), and a date about 235 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> for the burial of the hoard (see above), the dates of the various groups may be determined as follows:</p>

            <p>The assumption of a shorter period of circulation for the dolphin drachms or of a later date for the burial of the hoard would, of course,
<pb n="66"/>
bring down the dates of all of the groups, including the earliest issues. Such a result would be rather surprising, for 340 when the Euboian League was reconstituted and undoubtedly took part in the last struggle against <persName corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> is the latest "reasonable" date for the beginning of the lighter weight Euboian League drachms—it is already some thirty years later than the latest date which has been adopted hitherto on stylistic grounds. On the other hand, to assume a longer period of circulation for these dolphin drachms (an earlier date for the burial of the hoard is hardly possible) would make the rather slight wear of this issue, which is comparable with that of the coins of <persName>Ptolemy II</persName> in the hoard, difficult to understand. Thus although the figure "thirty" was adopted somewhat arbitrarily, there can be little doubt that it is roughly right if we are correct in setting the burial of the hoard about 235.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be thought of the positive dates given by this argument—I should not be inclined to put any great weight on them if they were not also entirely reasonable from the historical point of view—there can be no doubt that the comparative dates are sound. It is also clear that we do not have to do with regularly spaced issues struck within a few years of each other, and so must not assume that the symbols appearing on the drachms stand for successive magistrates each in office for a definite period of, say, five or ten years. It seems more likely that coin was issued by the League only when specially needed—e.g., for military purposes—and that such occasions were, at the period in question, neither numerous nor close together.</p>
            <p>It should be added, more or less as a footnote, that the loss of weight of the League didrachms, which can be dated with considerable accuracy, and of the tetradrachms, which must surely belong in the first decade of the fourth century (see page 10), can unfortunately not be used to check these results. They are too few in number, and so different from the drachms in shape and value that the loss of weight in circulation may have occurred at a different, and even at a very different, rate. The three didrachms have in point of fact lost about <graphic url="NNM134_066.jpg"/> of their weight,<ref target="#CH2-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref> and as they circulated for about 175 years (from 410–405 to about 235 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) we might calculate that they lost about <graphic url="NNM134_066a.jpg"/> of their weight each quarter century. At this rate the
<pb n="67"/>
kantharos drachms, for instance, which have lost just more than <graphic url="NNM134_067.jpg"/> of their weight, should have circulated for from 80 to 85 years, whereas the period arrived at above for them is actually 85 to 90 years. This happens to be a strikingly close result, but it is clear that such calculations should only be made if they can be based on a considerable number of coins of the same denomination. This one, based on different denominations and on only three didrachms, was made here only <hi rend="italic">exempli gratia</hi>, since as far as I know this method has never been employed, and it seems worth while to suggest its possibilities. There may well be other large hoards which contain enough coins of some accurately datable series to make it possible to establish, within a single hoard, a rate of loss of weight. Such a figure, cautiously employed within a single large hoard of varied contents, might yield extremely interesting results. For the present we may claim to have established the comparative dates of the issues of the Euboian League with practical certainty, and to have approximated the positive dates fairly closely. Exactly how close the approximation is one can hardly tell until further evidence accumulates, but as can be seen from Chapter 1 reasonable occasions for the issue of coin did exist at or near all of the dates indicated.</p>

Of the 47 coins known to me from this reverse die no. 63 shows the least wear. His no. 62, which is much lighter (he gives its weight as 3.34 in his list on p. 37, but as 3.44 in his table on p. 11), is described as "somewhat worn" but can be seen from the plate to be more worn than 63: it is from the same dies as 63, although this is unfortunately not clear from the plate as the coins are in poor condition and the two reverses are lighted rather differently. There are also other discrepancies in his descriptions of condition—thus no. 60 is called "fine" on p. 11, but on p. 37 it is called "very good."</p>

               <p>There is obviously room for difference of opinion and for error in the determination of the original normal or standard weight. I discuss the way in which I have determined it at the beginning of the next chapter, and feel that the probable error in the figures adopted is very small; it must, however, be admitted that the possible error is considerable.</p>

               <p>Sixty of the drachms have been omitted, in about half of the cases because they were incrusted and had obviously gained weight as a result, in the rest because they had been cleaned electrolytically before weighing.</p>

               <p>I have not included <persName>Professor Robinson</persName>'s section of the hoard in these calculations; his coins were cleaned by a somewhat different process, and it is better not to compare weights by different investigators using different scales. After subtracting the broken coins there remain 213 Euboian League drachms, but these have been cleaned so drastically and have lost weight so erratically that little confidence can be felt in conclusions drawn from their present weights. Nevertheless it is clear that the no symbol and grapes coins have lost more weight, and that the dolphins have lost less, than the other three groups.</p>

               <p>These coins have been severely cleaned (see p. 59), and are included here only to show the difficulty of arguing from the weights of such coins. It is my impression, based chiefly on the weights in this hoard and in nos. 4 and 14, that well worn coins suffer less from oxidation—or whatever produces the patination and incrustation that results from burial—than coins which have seen little circulation. I understand that, similarly, new table silver tarnishes more rapidly than silver which has been used for a life-time.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">III. THE SILVER ISSUES OF THE LEAGUE</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The various silver issues of the League are listed below with approximate dates, descriptions, diagrams to show the number and interconnection of the dies, and frequency tables of their weights. The chronology has been dealt with in the two previous chapters.</p>
            <p>The League dies known to me are numbered continuously in the order in which they appear in this chapter, the obverse dies in Roman and the reverse in Arabic numerals. The dies and die combinations listed in the die diagrams are probably in a good many cases complete, for almost all of them are attested by a number of examples, as may be seen by reference to the catalogue, and as is indicated in the diagrams themselves; further discoveries will probably not add greatly to our information on this subject. The order in which the dies appear in each group is not, however, usually chronological—it often seems that all the dies of a group were in use at the same time; where sequence is discoverable the fact is indicated in the discussions of the various groups.</p>
            <p>The frequency tables require a word of explanation. There was obviously no point in making the intervals of these tables smaller than the smallest difference which the scales used by the Euboian mint were capable of detecting, for smaller differences in weight than that, although they of course exist, have no significance. The scales employed in different ancient mints, and in the same mint at different dates, undoubtedly differed in accuracy, and it is clear too, as we shall see, that in some series the flans were weighed more carefully than in others. I believe also that the evidence shows that the weights employed for weighing different series often differed from each other; this is suggested by the small but consistent differences in the apparent theoretical or standard weights of the various series of League drachms. If our frequency tables are to indicate how accurately different series were struck, and to exactly what weights, their intervals ought ideally to be such as would enable us to recognize the smallest differences which the ancient workman could himself detect.

How small was this? There is surely little difference between an ordinary modern balance employing separate weights (i.e. not a chain weight), and sitting in the open air (not enclosed in a glass case), and the best ancient balances. And there is no good reason to suppose that modern technicians are more careful than the best of their ancient counterparts. It seems reasonable, then, to be guided by what can be achieved by a good modern balance constructed without the refinements which were probably unknown to the ancient Greeks. My own scale is of such a kind, and with it I find that it is possible to weigh with certainty to .02 grammes and with some confidence to .01 gms., but quite impossible to be certain that one's reading is correct to .005 gms. That the Euboian mints could achieve, and sometimes did achieve, a similar degree of accuracy is suggested to me by the results of weighing carefully several thousand Euboian coins. Some of the Euboian series were struck, I believe, to within .01 grammes of the weight intended, though some are much less accurate, and the best of them does not, I think (but here the evidence is scanty), succeed in weighing to within .005 grammes of the theoretical weight. The reader who cares to do so may check the correctness of this opinion by studying the weights recorded in the catalogue; perhaps the best example of a really accurately weighed series is provided by the drachms with a satyr's head as symbol, where 23 specimens weigh about 3.70 and 34 weigh about 3.65—none is heavier. If we examine the weights more closely it appears that of the 168 satyr's head drachms the weights of which are known 8 weigh 3.70 and 8 weigh 3.69; only obviously incrusted coins weigh more, and as far as I can tell, there are no examples of specimens in brilliant condition weighing less—in short the wear appears to be absolutely consistent with the theory that every coin when it came from the mint weighed 3.70, or rather, well over 3.69 and definitely less than 3.71. It would seem then that a case could be made out for constructing frequency tables with intervals of only .01 gms., and if very large numbers of coins were available, I believe that this would be worth doing. I emphasize this, for there is a strong tendency among numismatists to feel that ancient coins were not struck very accurately, and that exact weight is comparatively insignificant (a case is quoted in note 27 below). In point of fact it is impossible to generalize—in

               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>, at least, some series were struck accurately, and some series were not; this was also true of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s mints.<ref target="#CH3-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> However, statistics are worse than useless unless they are based on an adequate—and this usually means a very large—number of examples. For <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> we have no series which contains a large number of coins in mint condition; it is accordingly necessary to be satisfied with a larger interval, an interval which will allow at least five to ten coins to appear in each of the top lines of the table, for smaller numbers have obviously no statistical significance. In short it may be laid down as a principle that the smaller the number of coins the larger the interval in the frequency table must be if one is to base any conclusions upon the differences which it records. For the Euboian series in general it was clear that the numbers available did not justify intervals as small as a hundredth of a gramme; I have accordingly adopted the usual twentieths, and have drawn the tables up in grains as well as grammes, both because grains are easier to remember, and because in some cases the slightly larger interval (1 grain = .064 grammes) seemed to produce a more satisfactory table.</p>
            <p>In arriving at figures for the standard or theoretical weights of the different series, I have used no mechanical rule, but have been influenced by the apparent accuracy with which a series seems to be struck. Where all of the heaviest coins of a series are practically identical in weight and "EF" or "FDC" in condition, I have assumed that the standard was identical with or just barely higher than the weight of the heaviest coins. But where there are a few exceptionally heavy coins in a series, as is the case with the lyre drachms, I have assumed that these were accidentally struck too heavy, and that the standard weight is slightly lower than that of the two or three heaviest coins.<ref target="#CH3-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>This method results in identical standard weights for the no symbol and grapes groups (59 grains or 3.82 grammes) and also for the kantharos and lyre groups (61 grains or 3.95 grammes). As these paired groups are chronologically contiguous, it is probable that one set of weights was employed for one pair and another one for the other. The slight but consistent difference in weight between the heaviest

satyr's head drachms and the heaviest dolphin drachms suggests that different sets of weights were used in preparing the flans for these two groups. See the 'Comparison of Frequency Tables' and the 'Synopsis of the League Issues' at the end of the chapter.</p>

<pb n="74"/>
necting the stray lock of hair on the temple with the earring in the first reverse die grows progressively worse as the die is used with the three obverses, and a slight injury by the muzzle of the cow in Obv. III is absent when the die is used with Rev. 1, but shows on most of the coins struck from Rev. 2. Rev. 2 seems also later in the style of the hair, and employs the Υ form of upsilon instead of the earlier V form. We thus have proof that only two dies were in use at once for the striking of the coins of this group, and the order in which the three obverses and the two reverses were employed is obvious.</p>
               <p>In Group 2 it is apparent that all of the dies (except Rev. 7) must have been in use almost contemporaneously. As, however, Obv. IV shows an injury below the earring when used with Revs. 5 and 6 which does not appear when it is used with Revs. 3 and 4, it seems probable that four dies were employed to begin with—IV, V, 3 and 4; then when 3 and 4 broke, 5 and 6 were put into service; finally IV broke, and so only V was used with 7. The date of Group 2 is discussed on p. 7.</p>
               <p>That the first issue, Group 1, was smaller than the second issue, Group 2, is suggested by the smaller number of preserved specimens, by the slightly smaller number of dies employed, and perhaps also by the fact that only one pair of dies was used at once—this seems to indicate a more leisurely, less hurried, production.</p>
               <p>The weights of these coins make it probable, as may be seen from the frequency table, that the series was struck very accurately at between 188 and 189 grains (12.18 to 12.24 gms.). The coins in brilliant condition—and thanks to the 1951 hoard there are several of them—all fall between these two figures; those which weigh less all show signs of wear or cleaning or both, and none weighs more. Thus although I have been able to list only 69 specimens, the standard may be stated with confidence as 188 + grains (± 12.22 gms.); it may in future be possible to narrow these limits—I should not be surprised if all coins in mint condition which turn up in this series are found to fall between 188.6 (12.22) and 188.9 (12.24), but too few specimens are known as yet to justify dogmatism. We can at least say definitely that the didrachms were struck at within one half of one percent of their intended weight.</p>

               <p>The dates of these tetradrachms are discussed above, on page 10. The earlier didrachms were apparently unaccompanied by fractions, but drachms were struck with each of the two tetradrachm issues, and there were also hemidrachms, and perhaps smaller denominations as well (see below).</p>
               <p>In Group 1 the condition of the reverse die is apparently the same with both obverses—and the order in which these two obverses are listed is accordingly arbitrary. In Group 2 the top and middle <hi rend="italic">hastae</hi> of the epsilon on the reverse appear to have been too short originally and to have been lengthened on the die after the British Museum and <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName> specimens had been struck from obverse I (the middle <hi rend="italic">hasta</hi> being somewhat over-corrected). It is accordingly clear in this case which obverse was used first. And as there are obvious injuries to the reverse die in the brilliant <persName>Locker Lampson</persName> specimen, which do not appear on any of the others, the obverse of this specimen must be the latest; thus the order of all three obverses in Group 2 is clear. It is interesting to notice that the tetradrachms required five obverse but only two reverse dies. The explanation is undoubtedly the high relief of the obverses as opposed to the much more normal reverses; as nearly as I can measure the height of the relief it is, at its greatest, about four millimetres. The die positions of the tetradrachms, as of the didrachms, are irregular, but show a certain tendency to be ↓ or ↑, or to approximate those positions.</p>
               <p>The frequency table for these coins is very unsatisfactory, for there are too few specimens, and too many of those few are badly worn. As it happens, the nine heaviest tetradrachms listed in the catalogue all belong to Group 2. All of the specimens of Group 1 are, however, worn, and I have hesitantly included all of the tetradrachms in the same table, as the wear of the various specimens seems consistent with the theory that both groups were struck to the same weight.<ref target="#CH3-n9">

no wear, and of them only one, the <persName>Locker Lampson</persName> specimen, can be described as being in practically mint condition. It weighs 264.5 grains (17.14 gms.); the other, <persName>Jameson</persName> 1177, weighs 263.4 (17.07). It thus seems reasonable to suppose that the standard, normal, or theoretical weight of the coins when they left the mint was very close indeed to 265.0 (17.17). This is probably exactly what the 'Attic standard' was supposed to be. We have too little accurate information based on careful weighing of large numbers of coins, but it may be recalled that of the 75 uncirculated tetradrachms of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> mint in the Demanhur hoard, 61 weighed between 17.15 and 17.18, while only 6 weighed less and 8 more; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> was the largest and most accurate of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>'s mints.<ref target="#CH3-n10">

               <p>Some of the flans are rather irregular in shape, and there are occasional striking similarities between the flan shapes of different coins from the same pair of dies—compare, for instance, the <persName>Newell</persName>
                  <pb n="78"/>
and British Museum specimens of VII-8 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, 15, 15). The explanation is probably that the flans were prepared by cutting slices off a bar of silver which had not been accurately rounded.<ref target="#CH3-n11">

                  </ref> Some coins from the same pair of dies show similar shapes among the didrachms, too, and among some of the drachms, although the case instanced above is the clearest. I have little doubt that all of the Euboian League flans were produced in this manner, but the evidence falls short of formal proof.</p>

                  <p>One of these tetradrachms—the last coin listed under VI-8 in the catalogue—occurred in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName> hoard recently published by <persName>Professor D. M. Robinson</persName>: <hi rend="italic">A Hoard of Silver Coins from <placeName>Carystus</placeName>, NNM</hi> 124 (<placeName>New York</placeName> 1952). It is there listed as no. 1, and is discussed on pages 12–15. <persName>Robinson</persName> recognizes that the coin shares dies with three of the undoubtedly "Attic" tetradrachms, but nevertheless produces the remarkable theory that it is an Aiginetic didrachm and "provides the connecting link between the staters (i.e. didrachms) and the tetradrachms, proving that the type was changed before the standard." This, if true, would be extraordinary. But the coin now, after "three separate efforts" at cleaning it electrolytically, weighs 13.85; this is at least 1.60 grammes heavier than the heaviest known Euboian Aiginetic didrachm, and it is clear from the photograph published by <persName>Robinson</persName> that the coin is not seriously incrusted. The other coins in the hoard which are closest in date to this one (but even so fifty years later) are the six drachms without symbol (nos. 60–71: see below, page 88), which have an average weight of just under 3.30. This series was very accurately struck at 3.82 (see page 90), and so it is clear that the six drachms have, on the average, lost .52 gms. or about <graphic url="NNM134_077.jpg"/> of their original weight—the lightest of them has lost .65, or almost ⅙. If the tetradrachm originally weighed 17.17 (see above), it has lost almost ⅕ of its original weight; if the original weight was about 16.80 (and the heaviest known specimen weighs 16.60), then it has lost exactly the same fraction of its weight as this lightest drachm. (It should be mentioned that <persName>Robinson</persName> says that the coin weighed exactly the same after the three attempts to clean it electrolytically as it did before. I have never known a coin not to lose weight in an electrolytic bath, and this coin presumably had the same type of incrustation as the others in the hoard all of which lost a great deal of weight—I can only suggest that something must have gone wrong with his records.)</p>

               <p>These drachms are of full Euboio-Attic weight, like the tetradrachms, and like the tetradrachms they are divided into two groups, the second of which has the letters ΕΥΒ–ΟΙ running across the top and down the right side of the reverse. In both groups the nymph's ear has a firm round lobe, made with the drill, which is surely not intended for an earring—the ear is treated similarly in both groups of the tetradrachms. The style is much earlier than that of the more numerous drachms of lighter weight, on all of which the nymph wears earrings. These 'Attic' drachms are thus obviously to be connected in date with the tetradrachms—as, indeed, they always have been. Furthermore it seems probable that Group 1 of the drachms accompanied Group 1 of the tetradrachms, and that the second groups similarly go together: as <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> remarked,<ref target="#CH3-n12">
                     <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                  </ref> the ΕΥΒ–ΟΙ drachms seem later in style than the others (this is at least true of the reverse die).</p>
               <p>It may seem that there is something rather arbitrary about the way the groups have been divided here, with only one reverse die assigned to the second of them. In Group 1, however, even where no actual die links are known—it is to be hoped that future finds will increase the number—other considerations establish a close connection. Thus in the first six reverses the horns and eyes are too large for the rest of the head, the nose is too narrow, and the muzzle too small. The incompetent engraver of Rev. 16 at least corrected this last fault, and in Rev. 17 we have a quite successful representation of the animal. Revs. 15, 16, and 17 are connected by an identical arrangement of the inscription—ΕΥ between the horns and Β to the right of the muzzle. In Reverse 10 the inscription is clumsily divided, and the cow's head is unconvincing. Revs. 10, 11, and 12 are similar in character and show a steady improvement in the representation of the animal, although none of them shows the left ear: it was omitted either through inadvertence or on the theory that the head is so much in profile that it could not be seen. These three are the only reverses in which the inscription contains only two letters. If we are right in putting them first, and together, they carry with them the five obverses with which they are used, and Rev. 13 as well, which is used with Obv. XV and which introduces the ΕΥ–Β form of the inscription,
<pb n="81"/>
and the first rather tentative indication of a left ear. These two innovations are continued in Revs. 15, 16, and 17. Curiously enough Rev. 14 looks like a reversion to an earlier type; its place in the series is, however, guaranteed by its use, along with Rev. 15, with Obv. XVI. This is a good example of the dangers of stylistic argument—if these two reverses were not die-linked, and were judged solely by their style, they would undoubtedly be put many years apart. There is thus no point at which it seems possible to divide the first eight reverses and their accompanying obverses. In Group 2 the obverses are not notably different from several of those in Group 1; the reverse, however, is different from the others, both in the length and arrangement of the inscription and in the character of the cow's head which seems to look more squarely out from the coin. The fact that the tetradrachms are divided into two groups makes it natural to look for a similar division among the accompanying drachms, and to associate one group of drachms with each group of tetradrachms, but it is possible—although improbable—that all of the drachms go with one of the two groups of tetradrachms, and none of them with the other. The question can only be settled by the discovery of more specimens and more hoards, and by the establishing of further die links.</p>
               <p>The die positions are irregular but, like those of the tetradrachms, show a tendency to be ↓ or ↑ or to approximate those positions.</p>
               <p>It is interesting to notice that an ancient forgery of one of these coins occurred in hoard 4 (see page 50).<ref target="#CH3-n13">
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                  </ref> The coin was probably

copied from a specimen struck by dies XVI-15. The reverse has been turned the wrong way, perhaps as a result of copying a coin directly onto a die, forgetting that when the die was used the type would face in the opposite direction.<ref target="#CH3-n14">
                     <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
                  </ref> The letters are also retrograde, and only ΕΥ appears—the Β is omitted, but in several of the known specimens struck from Rev. 15 the Β is so faint as to be hardly visible, and the forger apparently failed to notice it on the coin he was using as a model (the model was not one of the earlier dies with ΕΥ, for none of those shows the left ear). The work on the obverse is also poor and careless—the eyelids and lips are too thick, and the hair is not copied accurately. That the coin is a copy of one of the Attic weight drachms, and not of one of the later series of lighter weight, is shown by the rendering of the nymph's hair, by the lack of earring, and by the fact that the cow's head is not filleted. The silver is rather different from that used for the genuine coins; it is perhaps significant that the gold line showed prominently in its spectrum, and very little in those of the other five early drachms tested.<ref target="#CH3-n15">

                  </head>
                  <p>This issue of drachms was also accompanied by fractions, for there are hemidrachms, a diobol, and obols of Attic weight with the inscription ΕΥ–Β arranged as on the early drachms of Revs. 13, 15, 16, and 17. The hair of Obv. XXII of the hemidrachms is reminiscent of the drachm obverses XI, XII, XIII, XV, XVI, and XVII, while the hemidrachm Obv. XXIV is similar to the drachm Obv. XVIII. The nymphs on the hemidrachm obverses, like those on the early drachms and staters, wear neither earrings nor necklace.</p>
                  <p>Of the hemidrachms I have been able to list only five specimens, but small coins appear less frequently than larger ones in dealers' catalogues and in museum collections, so that there may well be many others in private possession. The five are struck from four obverse and three reverse dies (see below and <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XII); the hemidrachms from XXII-19 are like the early drachms from XVI-15, and those from XXIV-20 are like the early drachms from XVIII-16. The heaviest specimen weighs 33.5 grs. (2.17 gms.). The die positions are irregular.</p>
                  <p>Two of the obols recorded in the catalogue probably accompanied the issue of the Attic weight drachms and hemidrachms: no. 13 in <persName>Imhoof-Blumer</persName>'s collection of casts, now at <placeName>Winterthur</placeName>, and no. 480 in the <placeName>Copenhagen</placeName>

                     <p>Since this manuscript was completed I have come upon a unique and interesting drachm of Attic weight (<persName>Wallace</persName> EL 512). It is struck from Obv. XV and from a new reverse with ΕΥΒ between the horns, but without ΟΙ to the right, which we may call 13a. This reverse seems most similar in style and arrangement to Rev. 18 of Group 2, but the obverse belongs to Group 1. The coin should accordingly, perhaps, be considered to connect the two groups, and to make it doubtful that they were separately issued, as suggested above, with the two groups of tetradrachms. The weight is 62.2 grs. (4.03 gms.), and the die position is ↗; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI, 25.</p>
                     <p>It is unfortunate that so few specimens of this group of Attic weight drachms are available for study, and that of these few only one comes from a recorded hoard. No other Euboian League issue has so many dies for so few known specimens, and it is clear that we do not yet have enough coins to justify definite conclusions about the character and affinity of the group.</p>

Robinson</persName> (see note 9 above); <persName>Robinson</persName> discusses it on page 42. He considers it genuine: "There is no possibility that this is a forgery: it is too unlike the others to have passed current as an ancient forgery; it is not a modern one for it was covered with the same heavy purplish incrustation as the other coins ..." But a queer-looking forgery would have no more trouble in passing than an equally queer-looking genuine coin unless a large number of them was issued. This coin was used, for it is worn, and there were probably not many like it, for no other has survived. <persName>Robinson</persName> also considers that this coin was struck on the lighter "Macedonian" standard. It is certainly light now, weighing 53.6 grains (3.47 gms.), and may have been so originally, but many of the weights of these drastically cleaned coins are surprisingly low, indeed most of them are lower than this—in note 9 we have discussed the tetradrachm which now weighs only 13.85); whatever the original weight of this drachm it was clearly copied from a specimen of the early series of "Attic" weight.</p>

               <p>This is a small group of rare coins—I have been able to list only twelve of them. Fortunately three of the twelve occurred in Section B of Hoard 4 (see page 51) where they seem somewhat more worn than
<pb n="86"/>
the drachms without symbol and than those with the grapes. One also appeared in the hoard group listed as no. 10 above on page 55, and its wear there also suggests that it should be similar in date to the drachms without symbol and those with the grapes, but as these three issues are each represented by single coins in a group which does not certainly come from a hoard, little reliance can be placed on their condition as an indication of date. The relief is high, higher than that of the drachms of full Attic weight, and the cutting of the dies is careful, but to my eye somewhat uncertain, as if the engraver were feeling his way, inventing a new type rather than copying an old one. Perhaps the best indications of this are the fact that the left-hand (or dexter) fillet slants along the cow's cheek in all of the reverse dies instead of hanging straight down as it should (and does in all the other issues), and the excessive shortness of the right-hand fillet in Rev. 25: the engraver here seems to have left himself too little room to the right of the cow's muzzle, and had to shorten the fillet if he was to show its tassel. The nymph's head faces left on the earlier obverse and right on the later one. The chin is slightly raised, giving a tilt to the head which produces an impression of vagueness and softness and contrasts strongly with the severely straight-forward gaze of the nymphs on the didrachms, tetradrachms and drachms of Attic weight. The earring on both obverses is a single conical drop (all the other earrings represented on the League drachms have triple drops), and the head which faces to the right wears a necklace—this is the only necklace among all the obverse dies of the Euboian League drachms except for Obv. XXXII of the drachms without symbol.<ref target="#CH3-n17">
                     <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                  </ref> The coins are of the lighter 'Macedonian' weight, and—if the beautiful British Museum specimen, which shows only the slightest signs of wear, may be taken as a dependable indication of the standard—are distinctly the lightest of the drachm issues of the League. A spectroscopic examination of four of these coins showed that three of the four contained considerably more copper than appears in any of the other League drachm issues except the early series of Attic weight.<ref target="#CH3-n18">
                     <hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                  </ref> Altogether it seems clear that the group must be dated between the drachms of Attic weight and the drachms without symbol, between,
<pb n="87"/>
that is to say, 395 and 340 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Their weight suggests that these coins should come later than the period of close political connection between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> prior to <placeName>Leuktra</placeName> in 371, and probably also that they should be later than the Battle of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_mantineia">Mantineia</placeName> in 362. They were probably issued some time between 360 and 340, and earlier rather than later within that twenty years, for differences in the composition of the metal, in the fabric, and in the style separate them from the drachms without symbol of about 340. Perhaps the most probable date is 357 when the Euboians, with Athenian help, drove the Boiotians out of the island (see p. 11)—the shortness of the campaign may help to explain the smallness of the issue; but the suggestion is little more than a guess.</p>
               <p>The die positions are more regular than those of the drachms of Attic weight, but less regular than those of any of the other groups: in three cases the axis is vertical, in five it is tipped varying amounts to the left, in two it is tipped to the right, and in one case it is completely irregular. These are among the earliest coins in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> proper to show an incipient vertical adjustment of the die positions.<ref target="#CH3-n19">

               <p>A frequency table of weights is given, chiefly for the sake of uniformity with the other series, but with so few coins it has, of course, no real significance; the best indication of the standard to which the group was struck is the weight of the British Museum specimen (<hi rend="italic">BM Cat. of <placeName>Central Greece</placeName>

               <p>This group and the next should be attributed, as we have seen (page 20), to the years between the refoundation of the League in 340 and the Battle of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chaeroneia">Chaironeia</placeName> in 338. It was perhaps the largest of all the issues of the League, for it required twelve reverse dies as against seven for the kantharos drachms and six for the lyre drachms. That fewer specimens have survived is probably due to the fact that the two largest hoards—nos. 1 and 4 in our list—which together contained about half of the drachms of the League which survive to-day, were both buried late in the third century, when this issue had already circulated for a hundred years.</p>
               <p>The order in which the dies of the group are listed is based upon two considerations. First, the injury by the cow's cheek in Rev. 32 seems worse with Obv. XXXII than with Obv. XXXI. Secondly, the slight injuries by the letters in Rev. 35 seem slightly worse with Obv. XXXV than with the others. But the differences between the injuries are so slight, and so few coins show them clearly, that one can have little confidence in the result of the comparison; as further specimens become known, it may be necessary to invert the diagram. All of the dies are connected, XXXIII and XXXIV in a rather surprising manner. It is remarkable that our knowledge of three of the six obverse dies should depend, at present, on a single specimen of each.</p>
               <p>The die positions are usually adjusted vertically, and the line is usually taken through the front of the neck or between that and what we should consider the vertical position—all of the heads are tipped slightly forward, that is, to the left. The only exceptions to this rule are the coins of XXXV-39 which are all tipped even farther in this direction. Descriptions of die positions commonly ignore the fact that the line through a die representing a head was sometimes taken, not through the top of the head and the center of the neck (as would seem natural to us), but through either the front of the neck and the crown, or through the nape of the neck and the forehead. This was doubtless because the sharp angles, front and back, where the neck is cut off, provide more convenient and accurate points of reference than the center of the neck. Such positions should not be considered irregular, and I have accordingly designated them as ↑f (when the line is taken through the front of the neck) and ↑n (when
<pb n="90"/>
it is taken through the nape). ↑c indicates that the axis is vertical in our sense—through the center of the neck. As "↑" is often used to indicate positions which only approximate ↑c,<ref target="#CH3-n20">
                     <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
                  </ref> I have distinguished coins described in catalogues, etc., as "↑" from those which I know from personal observation to be ↑c. The dies seem only occasionally to have been hinged or otherwise mechanically connected, for only with XXXV-37 and XXXV-39 are all the known specimens from a pair of dies identical in die position. The positions of the whole group may be summarized as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>↑c – 15</item>
                  <item>"↑" – 15</item>
                  <item>↑f – 37</item>
                  <item>↑c–f – 39</item>
                  <item>↖ – 19 (all XXXV-39)</item>
               </list>
               <p>A frequency table such as that given above, with intervals as large as 1 grain and .05 grammes does not indicate how accurately this group was struck: the three heaviest of the coins weigh 58.8 (3.81), and all are "EF to FDC;" the next four heaviest weigh 58.65 (3.80), and all are "EF." There are no coins of the group known to me which should be described as "EF" which weigh less than 58.0 (3.76) except perhaps de Nanteuil 905 (<persName>Feuardent</persName> sale of May 26, 1914, no. 226). This coin appears from the photograph to be "EF" but weighs only 56.8 (3.68); perhaps it has been cleaned electrolytically.</p>
               <p>Since all of the heaviest coins happen to fall between 58.0 and 58.8, the frequency table would give a much more exact impression of the situation if the line marked "58," instead of including all coins with weights between 57.5 and 58.4, were to include all between 58.0 and 58.9, and so on. The table would then appear as follows:</p>
               <pb n="91"/>
               <figure xml:id="fig-13">
                  <graphic url="NNM134_091.jpg"/>
               </figure>
               <p>One tends to consider chiefly, or only, the top line of the graph; but if a series is accurately struck and the intervals of the table are as large as the customary .05 (and even more so when they are 1 grain—.064 grammes), it makes a great deal of difference to the impression given by the table whether the theoretical weight is near the top or near the bottom of the interval within which it falls.</p>
               <p>There is a coin of this typei n the <persName>Newell</persName> Collection (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, <hi rend="smallcaps">e</hi>) which I consider a forgery. It weighs 53.4 (3.46), which is rather light, as the coin is in good condition. Its die position is ↑n, which is unparalleled—in no other specimen is the die position to the right of the vertical. Neither die is used for any other known specimen, and the style, especially of the reverse, is most unusual; indeed the large dots of the fillets and the fact that the left-hand line slants away from the cow's cheek instead of falling vertically or slanting in towards it, suggest that the engraver may not have understood what he was representing. Finally the silver seems to me to be rather peculiar in appearance. The question could, of course, easily be settled by spectroscopic examination.</p>

               <p>Nothing is known of the significance of the symbols which distinguish the different issues of League drachms. They may, or may not, have been magistrates' badges. The fact that only one of the five groups of hemidrachms has a symbol—a bunch of grapes, as it happens (see page 109)—perhaps suggests that the symbols are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> magistrates' badges, for these 'grapes' hemidrachms appear to be
<pb n="93"/>
among the earliest, and the symbols, once adopted to distinguish magistrates, would probably have continued to be used. But the analogy between hemidrachms and drachms need not hold. It is perhaps more significant that the two earliest groups of drachms have no symbols while all of the later ones do have them; this suggests that, magistrates' badges or not, the symbols were adopted to distinguish the different issues rather than as pure decoration. But it is hardly worth while to guess at the considerations which led to the adoption of particular symbols.<ref target="#CH3-n21">
                     <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>This group is probably closely similar in date to the drachms without symbol which have just been described.</p>
               <p>The order adopted here for the dies is purely arbitrary, for they show no injuries the development of which can be traced. The issue was clearly small, and the coins were probably all struck within a short period of time. In the discussion of the drachms without symbol above it was noticed that three of the six obverses are known from single specimens only. It is also rather surprising in the present group that of the 80 coins from two obverses 72 should have been struck from one and only 8 from the other. Disparity of this kind in the use of the obverse dies—and to some extent in that of the reverses, too—may be seen in almost all of the drachm groups. Indeed the drachms with the dolphin symbol are the only exception. The explanation is obscure.</p>
               <p>The die positions are as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>↑c – 11</item>
                  <item>"↑" – 5</item>
                  <item>↑f – 16</item>
                  <item>↑c–f – 34</item>
               </list>
               <p>Once again there are no examples of the tilting of one die to the right, rather than to the left, of the vertical; and again specimens from the same pair of dies vary slightly, showing that the dies were not hinged or otherwise mechanically connected. Nevertheless coins from the same pair of dies tend to have the same die position: of the 10 coins from XXXVI-40 about which information is available, 9 are ↑f.</p>
               <pb n="94"/>
               <p>It is hard to tell with so few coins, but in comparing the apparent wear with the weights one gets the impression that this group was rather less accurately struck than the last one. The heaviest coins weigh: 59.4 (EF), 59.0 (EF), 58.8 (VF), 58.6 (EF or VF), 58.6 (VF/EF), 58.5 (EF), 58.2 (FDC/EF), 57.9 (EF), 57.9 (VF).</p>

               <p>For the probable date of this group see pages 25 and 65. <persName>Dr. Roger Edwards</persName> of the Pennsylvania Museum informs me that the kantharos is of the high stemmed type which, at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, he would assign to the beginning of the third century. If we knew rather more than we do about local Eretrian, and Euboian, pottery, this consideration might lead us to assign the kantharos drachms to the period of <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrios Poliorketes</persName> rather than to the Lamian War. Until more information is available, however, about the local pottery—or better, probably, about local metal-work—it seems safer to follow the indications provided by the loss of weight among these coins in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937; it is at least satisfactory that the type of kantharos suggests a definitely later date than that which has hitherto been assigned to the League drachms as a group.</p>
               <p>It is a curious fact that well over a third of the coins are struck from one obverse and three accompanying reverse dies which are not muled in with the rest; it is extraordinary, too, that so few coins should have been struck by the third of these reverses. Perhaps there were two periods in the striking of these kantharos drachms; when the desired number of coins had been produced, the four dies which had been employed were destroyed, the third reverse soon after it had been put into service. Then a sudden need arose for many more

coins, so that four new obverse and four new reverse dies were prepared and all used simultaneously. Some such explanation, at least, seems to be required by the two groups into which their connections divide these dies. There is no other reason for the order in which the dies are listed in the die diagram, for such small injuries as do occur do not enable one to determine the relative order of XXXIX, XL,
<pb n="97"/>
XLI, and XLII, or of 50, 51, 52, and 53<ref target="#CH3-n22">
                     <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                  </ref>—naturally enough, for these were clearly all in use at the same time. And there is no injury to XXXVIII by which the order of 47, 48, and 49 might be determined. More coins are known from XXXVIII—118 specimens—than from any other Euboian League die (although Rev. 57 of the lyre drachms, with 112 specimens, runs it a close second). And more are known from XXXVIII-47—65 specimens—than from any other pair of League dies; it is interesting that only 5 coins from this pair show the position ↑f which is otherwise so common in the issue (12 are ↑c, while the great majority—37 coins—lie between these positions, and are described here as ↑c–f). We may find here a possible confirmation of the sequence suggested above for the dies: as time went on more and more coins were struck in the less obvious but, for the workman, more convenient position, ↑f.</p>
               <p>The die positions of the whole issue are as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>↑c – 44</item>
                  <item>"↑" – 12</item>

                  <item>↑f – 96</item>
                  <item>↖ – 3</item>
               </list>
               <p>Once again it is to be noticed that, as with the previous groups of lighter weight, there is no known specimen which tilts to the right—i.e., towards the position which we designate as ↑n.</p>
               <p>The frequency table shows that this group was struck to a distinctly heavier standard than that of the no symbol and grapes drachms. The heaviest drachms without symbol all weigh, as we have seen, just under 59 grains (3.82 gms.), and only a single specimen of the grapes issue is recorded to weigh more than this: 59.4 grs. or 3.85 gms. (I have not been able to check the weight). The no symbol and grapes groups together, as listed in the catalogue, contain 236 coins, a figure not too dissimilar to the 300 of the kantharos group. In the kantharos group, however, 14 coins weigh from 60.0 to 60.9 grains (3.89 to 3.94 gms.), one (<persName>Wallace</persName> EL 73), which is distinctly
<pb n="98"/>
worn and would be described only as "VF," weighs 61.9 (4.01), and the least worn specimen known to me (<persName>Wallace</persName> EL 456—"EF/FDC") weighs only 60.2 (3.90). In short in the kantharos group the standard is higher, and the coins are less accurately struck.</p>

                  <p>But the small injury at the back of the neck on Obverse XLI seems more developed when the die is used with Reverse 53 than when it is used with 50; this would seem to justify the assumption that 53 was in use after 50 had broken.</p>

               <p>This issue was probably struck in 302, when <persName corresp="#nomisma_demetrius_i">Demetrios Poliorketes</persName> was assembling his forces at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>—see page 26.</p>
               <p>The direction of the nymph's head is interesting. On the first issues of the League, in the late fifth and early fourth centuries, the head had always faced to the right, and in the "high relief" group some dies face one way and some the other. But with these exceptions all of the drachm groups except the lyre drachms have heads which face to the left.</p>
               <p>The dies fall into two groups; the first four obverses and the first four reverses are all used more or less evenly each with the other, and the great majority of the coins is struck from them. Solitary specimens of Obverses XLIV, XLV, and XLVI used with Reverse 58 make the connection between the two groups; otherwise Reverses 58 and 59 are used only with Obverses XLVII, XLVIII, XLIX, and L—it is surprising both that there should be four obverses for two

                  <figure xml:id="fig-19">

                  </figure>
reverses in this group and that so few specimens should be recorded from so many dies. Unfortunately the condition of Rev. 58 does not enable one to tell which group is the earlier, so that it is possible that the die diagram should be inverted. In any case XLVII to L are distinctly different in style from XLIII to XLVI; the hair above the roll is brushed along the head in XLVII to L, but straight down from
<pb n="101"/>
the crown in XLIII to XLVI, and there is no curl or ribbon at the nape of the neck in XLVII to L. There is another rather remarkable difference between the groups—a very high percentage of those struck from the later dies (as numbered here) are <hi rend="italic">double</hi>-struck, some so slightly that it is not easily noticed except with a glass, but many very badly double-struck (e.g., no. 113 on <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> X). It almost looks as if, for some reason, less competent workmen used the later (?) dies, and struck far fewer coins with them, much less well.</p>
               <p>The die positions are as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>↑c – 199</item>
                  <item>"↑" – 17</item>
                  <item>↑c–n – 29</item>
                  <item>↑n – 3</item>
                  <item>↑c–f – 13</item>
                  <item>others – 0</item>
               </list>
               <p>In short the vast majority are truly vertical, with the line taken through the center of the neck. In this they differ from all of the earlier groups, and also from the succeeding group, the drachms with a satyr's head as symbol, which tend to tilt forward like the earlier ones. It has been mentioned that there are no examples in the earlier groups of dies set in such a way that when the reverse is vertical the head on the obverse tips backward; here, where it faces in the opposite direction, the head usually is ↑c, but a tip back is more common than a tip forward. Whatever the mechanism by which the dies were adjusted may have been, an error or inaccuracy seems to have been easier in a counter-clockwise direction. As in the previous groups, coins from the same pair of dies tend to have the same die positions, or very similar ones; thus of the fourteen coins from XLIII-55, seven are ↑c, five are ↑c–f, and two are "↑": an unusually high proportion of ↑c–f.</p>
               <p>It is interesting that there are no ↑c–f positions with obverses XLIV and XLV (138 coins), and only two ↑c–n—and no ↑n—with obverses XLVI to L inclusive (72 coins); this can hardly be chance, but the explanation is obscure.</p>
               <p>The frequency table is strikingly similar to that for the kantharos drachms: two stray specimens weigh 62 grains, a dozen weigh 61, there are many weighing 60, and the greatest number by far weigh 59.
<pb n="102"/>
In short the issue was struck rather irregularly, to a weight distinctly higher than that employed for the drachms without symbol and for those with the grapes, but identical with that used for the kantharos drachms. In compiling the table, of course, all coins were omitted which had been broken or which showed obvious incrustation or hard surface deposit—these were mostly from the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937 and, as it happens, were more numerous in this group than in the others; light coins, on the other hand, were included however obviously they had lost weight by cleaning.</p>

               <p>These drachms were probably issued either in 289 or 279 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see pages 33 and 65 above).</p>
               <p>The coins of this group show a tendency to thin widespread flans, so that the largest specimens reach a greatest diameter of 19 or 20 mm. Many, however, show a greatest diameter of about 17 mm, which is the average in the other drachm groups, and specimens are occasionally met with in which it is no greater than 15 mm.</p>
               <p>The die linkages are rather curious, as the die diagram shows. From the first three obverses there are listed in the catalogue 51, 30, and 107 coins respectively; Obverse LIV is known to me from one specimen only, and Obverse LV from two, and these three coins form a quite separate group, while the other 188 are linked together. It is further remarkable that the connections of Obverse LII with Reverses 60, 63, and 64 should each be represented, at present, by a single specimen. I have no explanation to suggest for these anomalies.</p>
               <p>Several of the dies show injuries the development of which can be traced. Obv. LIII, for instance, in many specimens shows a diagonal crack along the back of the neck which seems least marked with Revs. 60, and 61, and most developed with Revs. 62, 63, and 64. The curious die-break on the nape of the neck of Obv. LII, which looks almost like part of the hair, seems to begin with Rev. 62. And an

adhesion to the die above the horns in Rev. 60 shows with LI and LII, but not with LIII. In short the injuries to the dies seem to establish the order in which they were used, and yet the first three obverses were all used with each of the first three reverses, so that
<pb n="105"/>
one would naturally assume that all were employed contemporaneously. Perhaps the explanation is that there was a sudden demand for a fairly large issue, but few die-cutters were available. Accordingly the dies were put into service just as fast as they could be made; minting began—on this theory—with one obverse and one reverse die, and each of the others as it was finished was put into service at once along with those that were already in use. Thus although all the dies were used together as long as they lasted, those which had been made first saw service earlier and so became worn and finally broke and were discarded sooner than those which were finished later. But why Obverses LIV and LV and Reverse 65 should have been used by themselves and for so few coins, it is hard to see.</p>
               <p>The die positions are adjusted vertically in most of the coins, the line being taken through the center (41 times) or front (39 times) of the neck or in a position intermediate between these two (39 times). With one pair of dies, LIII-63, the tilt is consistently somewhat more to the left than a line through the front of the neck would make it.<ref target="#CH3-n23">
                     <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                  </ref> With twelve coins (nine of them from one pair of dies) the tilt is backwards. In general there is a strong tendency for coins from the same pair of dies to have very similar die positions, but only in the single case of the die combination LIII-61 are all the coins from a pair of dies oriented identically: ↑c.

                  <p>There are 27 coins from this pair of dies listed in the catalogue; 22 are ↖, 3 are ↑f, and 2 are not known. This regular occurrence of an irregular position would seem to indicate that the dies were hinged or that the punch worked through a bracket in which it could not turn. The three coins in which the position is slightly different are probably inaccurately recorded—all three were in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> hoard of 1937. As I recorded these positions myself this is perhaps an appropriate place to remark that it is difficult to be accurate about die positions, and they are frequently wrongly given. The best method appears to be to hold the coin with the side most easily estimated towards one (in the Euboian drachms this side is the reverse); then with a pen a small drop of ink may be placed, without turning the coin, on the top and bottom of the side which is turned away. This method seems to give more accurate results than merely turning the coin between finger and thumb, and the ink spots, of course, wipe off easily. An accurate record of the phenomena may lead to a better understanding of the technique of striking, which is as yet rather obscure.</p>

               <p>All of the known coins struck from Obv. LVI show an injury across the nose of the nymph which gives her an unpleasant expression. Rev. 66 is also unsatisfactory, for the dolphin and the cow's left ear are placed too high, and the work is generally careless. It is thus perhaps no accident that twice as many coins have been preserved from each of the other two dies.</p>

Breitenstein ingeniously calls it an "Aeginetic trihemiobol (?)," for which the theoretical weight would be about 23.9 (1.55). But no other Aiginetic fractions are known; it is strange, if they really existed, that the sole survivor should be a trihemiobol. And the relief is somewhat flat for a fraction that was struck to accompany the didrachms. But if it is not an Aiginetic trihemiobol, it would seem that it must be either an Attic or "Macedonian" triobol, in which case it is very light, or an Attic or "Macedonian" diobol, in which case it is very heavy. It is best (as Breitenstein's query suggests) to reserve judgment until other similar coins have been reported.</p>

trihemiobol. It is unfortunate that its weight is not recorded and that no other coin like it is known.</p>
                  <p>In considering the hemidrachms it should first be noticed that the die positions of Groups 1, 2, and 3 are irregular, while Group 4 is mostly ↑c, and Group 5 is clearly ↑n. Group 1 is the only group in which the cow is not filleted, and Group 5 the only one in which the nymph wears a necklace. Finally, Groups 1 and 2 are fairly clearly earlier in style than the others, and Group 5 is fairly clearly the latest in style. Altogether there can be comparatively little doubt that their chronological sequence is the order in which they are numbered here.</p>
                  <p>There was no point in presenting die diagrams for so few coins, but, as with the drachms, the dies are indicated in the catalogue.</p>
                  <p>It is not easy to connect the hemidrachm groups with the separate drachm issues. One might feel that the groups with the grapes symbol should go together; the style, however, of these hemidrachms seems very different from that of the drachms with the grapes symbol, and different too from that of Group 2 of the hemidrachms, which seems later. The coins of Group 2 are struck in rather high relief, and also share with the drachms in high relief the characteristic that the fillet follows the cow's cheek instead of hanging straight. But if Group 2 were supposed to accompany these drachms and Group 1 the drachms with the grapes symbol, this would not only change the order which seems probable on stylistic grounds, it would mean that two of the earliest and smallest of the lighter weight drachm groups were accompanied by fractions, while several of the larger groups had none.</p>
                  <p>Group 4 of the hemidrachms seems to have letters on the obverse as well as the usual ΕΥ on the reverse; Group 5 certainly has both an Ε on the obverse and ΕΥ on the reverse. It is hardly possible to read the letters on the obverse of Group 4 from the published photographs, and there is little or no trace of them on the only specimen (<persName>Wallace</persName> EL 510) which I have been able to examine.

The Ε on the obverse of Group 5 (and on Obverses LXIX and LXX of the diobols) can hardly be the initial letter of ΕΒΟΙΕΩΝ when ΕΥ appears on the reverse; it could, perhaps, be the initial of ΕΡΕΤΡΙΕΩΝ if, <hi rend="italic">per improbabile</hi>, that name appears on Group 4. The explanation must await the discovery of more legible specimens with the letters in front of the face. Of course it is quite possible that the Ε of Group 5 has no relation to the letters (if any!) of Group 4.</p>

                     </ref> And it is clear both from their style and from the Ε on the obverse that they accompany the fifth group of hemidrachms. It is interesting to notice that Obverse LXXI of the diobols (head l., no Ε and no necklace) is doubly die-linked with Obverses LXIX and LXX where the head is larger, faces right, wears a necklace, and has Ε behind the neck. These obverses would, I think, have been separated widely by anyone who attempted to arrange the coins on the basis of style alone; cases like this show the value of attention to die connections. The dies of the nine diobols listed in the catalogue are related as follows:</p>

                  <p>The obols and hemiobols call for little comment. Except for the two obols which clearly accompanied the drachms of Attic weight, it is not clear with which of the drachms or other fractions they are contemporary. The nymph's head faces either left or right, in both groups. Attention may be called to the amusing and appropriate selction of a cow's hoof as the reverse type for the hemiobols: it is a very successful application of the principle which at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_corinth">Corinth</placeName>, for instance, suggested the use of a half-Pegasos on the hemidrachm and a horse's head on the hemiobol.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">General Remarks on Weights and Dies</hi>
               </head>
               <p>It is clear from the frequency tables and the synopsis that the various lighter weight drachm issues were not in fact struck to one single normal or standard weight, and yet that several of them were struck with great accuracy—to within, at most, half a grain or three hundredths of a gramme. These facts are of some importance, for students of Greek coins have too often arrived at their standard weights in a somewhat <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> manner, and have been very ready to believe that all Greek series were rather inaccurately struck.<ref target="#CH3-n27">
                     <hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                  </ref> It seems worth while to emphasize that some issues were accurately struck although some were not, and that coins might be carefully weighed with weights which were themselves too light or too heavy. When it has once been established, from an adequate number of examples, that a particular series was accurately struck to such and such a standard or theoretical weight, this information may be useful in a number of ways. One way which has not yet been exploited is set forth at some length above (pages 62–67).</p>
               <p>The die positions of the various series of Euboian League drachms show a tentative adjustment early in the fourth century, and a rough but definite adjustment admitting hardly any exceptions in 340 to 338 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is interesting that there are absolutely no examples of the head (which faces left) being tipped back, to the right—this fact helps to identify the forgery described on p. 91. When we come to the
<pb n="115"/>
lyre group about the end of the fourth century, the fact that the head here faces in the opposite direction, to the right, is perhaps responsible for the general adoption of the ↑c position—exceptions still tip left as a rule (the position is in this case ↑n, of course, not ↑f). With the satyr's head issue early in the third century, the head again faces left and the dies are again mostly ↑c, ↑c–f, and ↑f, as they had been from 340 to 320, but this time there are more exceptions than there were earlier. It is not until we reach the last group, those with the dolphin, issued about 270–267 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, that almost all of the coins show the same position, and that that position is ↑c, not ↑f. In all series coins from the same pair of dies <hi rend="italic">tend</hi> to have the same or similar die positions, and in a few cases all coins from a pair of dies have exactly the same die relation. It is to be hoped that such observations as these may some timelead to a clearer understanding of the technique involved in striking ancient coins. Meanwhile the die positions in one case seem to give a clue to the order of the dies (see p. 97). It is also useful that the usual die position is something with which forgers are seldom acquainted.</p>
               <p>Finally, as has long been realized, die links may provide useful information. This is especially true in series such as those under consideration here, where enough coins are known to make it probable that comparatively few die links have escaped attention. Even here it is obvious that future discoveries will make some additions to our knowledge. The number of known specimens is always indicated in the die diagram so that the reader may see how nearly complete (or incomplete) our information appears to be. In some cases, such as that of the rather rare dolphin drachms, where the 90 known specimens are struck from only four dies, it seems unlikely that more dies will turn up; it is also probable that we know all the dies and die combinations of the didrachms and tetradrachms. In most of the drachm groups there is a surprising and interesting disparity in the amount of use which different dies received, and the dies, surprisingly enough, frequently fall into two groups, one much used, the other very little. The explanation may be, as has been suggested above, either a frequent under-estimate of the number of dies required for an issue of the size intended, or additional demands for coin after the striking of an issue had been completed, and the dies destroyed. It is interesting that no obverse die was used for two different series; this fact
<pb n="116"/>
supports the theory (based on comparative wear) that the issues were spasmodic, separated from each other by considerable periods of time. Die links sometimes connect in indisputable fashion coins so different in style that without this evidence it would not have been realized that they belonged in the same group; we have seen evidence of this among the hemidrachms. Finally, since it is probable that we know almost all of the dies used for striking the League staters and later drachms, the number of dies is a more dependable indication of the original size of an issue than the number of surviving specimens. Thus while the drachms without symbol are only about twice as numerous in the catalogue as the drachms with the dolphin, they were struck from at least 18 dies as opposed to only 4 for the dolphin group; it is fair to conclude that they were originally at least three or four times as numerous. And as has been mentioned, in this particular case we can check the conclusion, for we happen to know why more in proportion of the dolphin drachms have survived—they had been much more recently minted at the time when the two large hoards were buried which between them contained almost half of the known coins of the Euboian League.</p>

                  <p>"In view of the certainty of the weights for the denominations listed in the chart, [<hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> certainty, that is—the actual specimens are highly irregular] it has not been felt necessary to construct frequency tables. Indeed the meticulous consideration of the weights in any series is supererogatory, since ancient methods of minting and the whole ancient conception of the purpose of coinage differ so greatly from those of the present."—from page 26 of <hi rend="italic">Macedonian Regal Coinage to 413 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>

This is a recent and unusually explicit example, but the opinion might almost be called orthodox; many excellent numismatists hold it, at least tacitly. Thus <persName>Professor Louis Robert</persName> does not trouble to give weights or die positions in publishing two Histiaian tetrobols for the first time in his <hi rend="italic">Etudes de numismatique grecque</hi> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> 1951) page 186 and plate vi 10 and 11. The weights of the Histiaian tetrobols have been supposed to be extremely irregular, but in fact some of the numerous groups comprising the series are struck accurately, and the die positions in some groups are fixed while in some they are irregular: progress in arranging these coins will depend on the observation of such facts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Note on Forgeries</hi>
               </head>
               <p>There are comparatively few forgeries of Euboian League coins on the market, and of those few the only really "dangerous" ones which have come to my attention are imitations of the Aiginetic didrachms. Of these I saw a number of specimens in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> in 1952, produced no doubt by the enthusiasm which resulted from the discovery of the 1951 Euboio-Boiotian hoard (no. 3 on page 49). I was able to make rather hasty casts of two which had been struck from the same pair of dies—see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> These dies were extremely close copies of III and 2 in Group 1, so close that they can only be distinguished by careful examination under a glass: the differences are clearest in the eye of the obverse (the forger has represented the pupil) and in the tail of the reverse. The silver was not very different in appearance from that of the genuine coins. As the dealer who showed them to me had no doubt that the coins were "bad," he presumably knew something of their source.</p>
               <p>A very ingenious invention is the forged tetradrachm shown to Mme. <persName>Varoucha</persName> at the National Numismatic Museum in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> by a
<pb n="117"/>
German collector during the war—see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V <hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi>.<ref target="#CH3-n28">
                     <hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                  </ref> The reverse type is unique in a highly plausible manner—the inscription has been completed by the addition of ΕΩΝ below the exergue; and although there is a faint indication that the forger intended the animal for a bull, and the letters are somewhat smaller than they are on the genuine coins, the die is still very convincing. The same cannot be said for the obverse die in which the hair is poorly done with excessively thin lines and masses which are too sharply defined, while the features are somewhat coarse. I have seen three other tetradrachm forgeries from a different reverse die but apparently from this same obverse reworked—see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> V, <hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>.<ref target="#CH3-n29">
                     <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                  </ref> Here again the reverse inscription is arranged in a unique but reasonable manner, imitated from certain of the "Attic" drachms—ΕΥ–Β above, the Β being between the horns—but the animal is poorly proportioned and this time obviously a bull; the fabric and the appearance of the silver were both such as to deceive no one. The weights—16.95 and 16.75—are an intelligent compromise: the standard on which these coins were struck was probably in the neighborhood of 265 grains or 17.17 grammes (see page 77), but the heaviest known specimens of Group 1 of the tetradrachms, which these forgeries imitate, weigh 16.60 and less (unless the coin which the forger copied was heavier and has not appeared on the market). Thus these forgeries which are ostensibly in extremely fine condition were made to weigh definitely more than the coin from which they were copied, but not as much as the Attic standard seems to demand. We clearly have to do with a well-informed but technically incompetent forger.</p>
               <p>The ancient forgery of one of the early drachms of 'Attic' weight is discussed on page 81, and the interesting forgery in the <persName>Newell</persName> collection on page 91. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VIII, <hi rend="smallcaps">e.</hi> Otherwise the only drachm forgery which has come to my attention is Christodoulos 257 (in Svoronos, <hi rend="italic">Mille coins faussés de Christodoule</hi>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> 188), a specimen of which is illustrated on his plate I. The hair is done with excessively fine lines, and is imitated from obv. XXXV of the drachms without symbol; the cow on the reverse is not unlike that on the <persName>Newell</persName> coin—especially the heavy line about the eye.</p>

               <p>Unfortunately Pappadakis says nothing about the comparative condition of the specimens belonging to the different issues; he gives the sizes (16–20 mm. for all issues except the triobol), but no weights. His date for the coins follows Head (<hi rend="italic">HN</hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> p. 363), and is too late, as <persName>Newell</persName> showed (see below). The identification of the 20 League bronzes with a lying cow but no star or magistrate's name is uncertain —I have seen no coins which exactly answer the description, and am
<pb n="120"/>
inclined to think (until the coins can be examined) that these twenty are perhaps a mixture of the large third century bronzes and the medium bronzes of the Demarchos-Satyros type, all in such poor condition that the stars and magistrate's names did not show. They may, however, belong to an issue which is otherwise unknown: Pappadakis does not illustrate a specimen. The single specimen with ΙΤΑΙ<graphic url="NNM134_072b.jpg"/> is also otherwise unknown, and it is hard to believe that the letters have been correctly read.</p>

                  <persName>Newell</persName>'s discussion of the hoard is the only serious work that has been done on these coins to date; by careful examination of the comparative wear he has arranged the issues in their right order; he has
<pb n="121"/>
realized that, for these coins, weight is more important than metal size, and in a brilliant note (no. 12 on p. 14) he has distinguished and connected two different bronze issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>; finally, by comparing his hoard with Pappadakis' he has corrected the usual dates assigned to the various Euboian bronze issues, and fixed the approximate dates of both hoards. It is easy, now that the broad outlines have been laid down, and more material is available for study, to make corrections in detail (see the discussion below).</p>

               <p>There is no formal evidence that these coins came from one hoard, but they were secured at the same time from the same dealer and all of them show the same kind of green patination; I have no doubt that they were found together. The die positions are all obviously irregular, and have accordingly not been indicated. The comparative wear of the different issues of the League suggests the order in which they are listed here, and supports <persName>Newell</persName>'s arrangement.</p>

               <p>These coins were also secured together and it was stated that they had been found together; the patination in general supports this claim, although it is less convincingly homogeneous than in the last hoard. The die positions of the Euboian coins are irregular. The comparative wear of the various Euboian League and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> issues suggests the order in which they are listed, and, as it is consistent

with the evidence of the other hoards, supports the view that this group of coins was found together.

               <p>These coins were stated to have been found together in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> "many years ago;" I could get no information about the date except that it must have been before about 1920, perhaps long before that date. There seemed little guarantee that the group had not been contaminated before 1920 (I was told that it had been kept together since then) except the generally similar—but not convincingly identical—patination. However, when I came to work on the coins I discovered that the relative wear of the various issues in this group is thoroughly consistent with that in the hoards listed above; I accordingly accept them as a hoard or part of a hoard. The die positions of the Euboian coins are irregular. The issues of each separate group are listed in what appeared to be the order of wear, but the differences are often slight, and the order cannot be depended upon in detail.</p>

               <p>There had been no special study of Euboian bronze before <persName>Newell</persName>, in 1935, published his hoard (listed here as no. 2). He established the fact that some of the issues both of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> and of the Euboian League must belong to the third century, and determined the comparative dates both of his hoard and of Pappadakis' and of the various issues in them. Our investigation must begin from his conclusions.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Newell</persName>'s just observation that the style and appearance of the lying cow or bull on the Aristonikos coin in his hoard was very similar to that of the cow on the silver octobols of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> led him to the conclusion that the two must be identical in date, and as he believed that the silver issues were struck soon after 190, or at least as late as 192/1, he dated the Aristonikos coin "after 191," describing its condition (the best in his hoard) as "very good to fine." Under these circumstances it is rather surprising that the burial date he arrived at for the hoard was "late in 192 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> or ... in the early summer of
<pb n="125"/>
191 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>" This is clearly too early on his own principles; that it is so becomes even clearer when he lists at least ten different issues of the Euboian League "veiled head / butting bull" coins which he dates "after 194"—there is obviously not room for these between 194 and 191, and all of them are considerably more worn than his Aristonikos coin (not to mention the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> coins—see below). As the 194 date for the "veiled head" coins is probably right (see below), it is safe to conclude that <persName>Newell</persName>'s date for the burial of his hoard is a good deal too early, and that the least worn coin in it, the Aristonikos specimen, cannot be contemporary with the first silver issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, if these are as early as 190 (they should, in fact, be dated from 196—see below).</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Newell</persName> was necessarily concerned almost entirely with the coins which actually occurred in his hoard, and there was, as we have remarked, no good publication or large collection of Euboian bronze to which he could refer for additional specimens of the coins with which he was dealing. Thus it happened that the poor condition of his no. 104 (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV, no. 13), with the magistrate's name Demarchos, prevented him from noticing that the two bunches of grapes on the reverse are somewhat different in appearance from the two bunches on the reverses of nos. 92–103—all of them also in very poor condition—with which he connects it (although he carefully records that it was less worn than the others). In point of fact his 92–103 have a small vine leaf to the left of the bunches of grapes, and small tendrils to the right of each bunch, while the Demarchos coins, like those of Satyros, have no tendrils, but one leaf to the right of each bunch (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV, no. 14). The bunches are also shorter and more compact in these later issues. They are, as a glance at <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV will show, absolutely identical in style and form with the two bunches of grapes on the reverses of the Eretrian silver tetrobols (<hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV, no. 15); indeed the lying cow or bull of the Demarchos group is just as similar to the one on the octobols as is the animal on the Aristonikos coin. The Demarchos group should be connected in date with the silver issues, and with the Mantidoros bronze issue, of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>—full magistrate's names are thus introduced at the same moment on the League bronze and on the first Eretrian bronze and silver to appear for more than two hundred years. This moment would most naturally be soon after

                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_flamininus">Flamininus</persName>' proclamation of freedom for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> in 196, and this is the date arrived at independently on the evidence of the Anthedon hoard by <persName>Margaret Thompson</persName>.<ref target="#CH4-n2">
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                  </ref> The types of the bronze were changed again in 194 when the Euboian League was reconstituted by <persName corresp="#nomisma_flamininus">Flamininus</persName>, and the veiled head type for bronze was introduced (contemporaneously on this view) by the League, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>,<ref target="#CH4-n3">
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </ref> and thus the smallness of the Demarchos-Satyros and Mantidoros groups is explained by the shortness of the period during which they were struck. The only change which this introduces into <persName>Newell</persName>'s arrangement of the League bronze is to make his no. 104 (the League Demarchos coin) contemporary with his 105 (the Eretrian Mantidoros coin) instead of putting it a few years earlier, and to date both issues to the period 196–194 instead of putting them at the end of the third century. The change is slight—indeed <persName>Newell</persName> himself envisaged the possibility that the Mantidoros coins should be placed early in the second century rather than late in the third (l.c., p. 16). The assumption that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> continued her League issues alongside of her new autonomous coins is simpler than the alternation proposed by <persName>Newell</persName> ("Euboians" in the third century, "Eretrians" in the early second, "Euboians" again after 194, and "Eretrians" again after 190). As for the new Eretrian silver, both the Anthedon hoard and the analogy of the Demarchos group make it desirable to suppose that it began in 196—and <persName corresp="#nomisma_flamininus">Flamininus</persName>' proclamation is surely a more natural occasion for it than the Battle of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_magnesia_ad_maeandrum">Magnesia</placeName>, which as far as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> was concerned meant only the permanence of Roman domination and the end of any hope of real freedom.</p>
               <p>Both in hoard 4 and in hoard 5 above, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> bronzes with symbols were distinctly less worn than the Euboian League group with the veiled head. It is clear from <persName>Newell</persName>'s plates that this was also true of his hoard, although curiously enough he describes the condition of the League coins carefully, but omits to mention that of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> bronzes. As the three hoards all point to the same con-
<pb n="127"/>
clusion, we can hardly be wrong in putting the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> coins with symbols later than the Euboian League veiled head group (and those with ΧΑΛ above the eagle seem to be later than those with ΧΑΛ below it). On the assumption that there was not more than one issue a year (it is, of course, an assumption for which there is little or no evidence) the veiled head coins, if they began in 194, perhaps lasted until about 180, for there are twelve or thirteen symbols known; if the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> coins begin about that date and last for about a dozen years—there are eleven symbols known—we arrive at the date of Pydna, in 168. This is, perhaps, purely accidental, and certainly there are many unknowns in the argument. But the resulting arrangement seems reasonable; it was on this line of reasoning that the very tentative dates were arrived at which are suggested above for the burials of these bronze hoards. The table at the end of this chapter shows the proposed relation of the Euboian League bronze to the pertinent autonomous issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The bronze issues of the Euboian League may be summarized as follows:</p>
               <p>In the fourth century, the League struck bronze with types similar to those of the silver drachms, in small and very small denominations, of which too few examples are available to form the basis of dependable generalization. They appear, however, to weigh respectively from 2 to 2.5 grammes (in size, from 12 to 15 mm.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV, 3, and from 1 to 1.5 grammes (in size, from 9 to 10 mm.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV; 1, 2, 4 &amp; 5. They have not occurred in any hoards known to me.</p>
               <p>In the third century the League struck bronze in three denominations, which may be distinguished as 'Large,' 'Medium,' and 'Small,' with similar types, as follows:</p>
               <p rend="hang">1. Large. Weight: from 6 to 8 gms. Size: from 20 to 22 mm. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV; 6, 7 &amp; 8</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. Vine branch with depending from it two bunches of grapes, one leaf (to l.) and two tendrils (to r. of each bunch). ΕΥ-ΒΟ-ΕΩΝ or ΕΥ-ΒΟ or ΕΥΒ or ΕΥΒΟ. Star above.<ref target="#CH4-n4">

               <p>Two issues are known: ΑΙ, <graphic url="NNM134_128b.jpg"/>
               </p>
               <p>Only five specimens are known to me.</p>
               <p>As the same letters occur on different denominations, there were probably at least eight issues—ΑΙ, ΑΛΕ, ΕΥ, <graphic url="NNM134_128c.jpg"/>, <graphic url="NNM134_128d.jpg"/>, <graphic url="NNM134_128e.jpg"/>, ΣΤ, ΤΙ—although all three denominations need not have been struck each time. Their condition in <persName>Newell</persName>'s hoard suggests that they belong in the second half of the third century.</p>
               <p>Between 196 and 194 the League issued bronze in two denominations, as follows:</p>
               <p>Medium. Weight 3.5 to 5.5? Size 15 to 20 mm. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV; 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p rend="hang">
                  <hi rend="italic">Obv</hi>. Cow lying l. (Demarchos) or r. (Satyros), star above, name below, in a circle of dots.</p>
               <p rend="hang">
                  <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. Vine branch with depending from it two bunches of grapes and a leaf to the r. of each; above the branch, a star (Demarchos) or ΕΥΒΟΕΩΝ (Satyros). The Demarchos issue has ΕΥΒΟ-ΕΩΝ around the bunches of grapes.</p>
               <p>Small. Weight 2 to 3 grammes? Size 12 to 15 mm. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XIV; 16 and 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Obv</hi>. Cow standing r., star above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. Vine branch with two bunches of grapes as above. ΕΥΒΟΕΩΝ?</p>
               <p>I know only two specimens of this issue, both in poor condition. Pappadakis describes a third issue of the medium denomination, which occurred in a single example in his hoard (his no. 39), with ΙΤΑΙΕ as the magistrate's name. It seems probable that his specimen
<pb n="129"/>
was almost illegible (could he have misread ΑΛΕ as ΙΤ Α Ι<graphic url="NNM134_072b.jpg"/>?), and a definite opinion must wait on the appearance of further examples; there might, however, be room for three annual issues (although it is only an assumption that the issues were annual) between 196 and 194. These coins are rare; aside from the 18 in Pappadakis' hoard, which was probably buried just after they were issued, a bare half dozen have been recorded. This rarity is natural if they were struck for only two or three years.</p>
               <p>Beginning, probably, in 194, the Euboian League—and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Karystos</placeName>, too—issued bronze coins with a veiled head on the obverse and a butting cow (or bull?) on the reverse. Both types are new in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName>. Is the head perhaps Isis? We know that the Iseion at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> (in which Pappadakis' hoard was found) was begun in the third century, and was flourishing in the early second; there is evidence for the worship of the Egyptian divinities at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> as well as at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>. The popularity of a new deity might help to explain the introduction of the type in two (or in three?) cities at the same time. But this contemporaneous introduction of the same types in the three southern cities was probably arranged by the League—perhaps as a compromise between the Eretrian feeling that only the League should strike coins, and the hitherto independent practice of the other Euboian cities. Demeter, who was frequently identified with Isis, is another possible attribution (see note 84 in Chapter 1).</p>
               <p>Whatever the reasons for the choice of types employed for the 'medium' bronze, the coins were struck in considerable numbers and over a period of at least twelve to fifteen years, if one may judge from the fact that twelve or thirteen different symbols are found. At the same time, apparently, the 'small' denomination was struck, also in considerable numbers, but with fewer symbols. The following list contains all the types which have come to my attention, but may well be incomplete, especially for the issues of the 'small' denomination, which have not been found in any hoards known to me—and neither museums nor dealers are particularly interested in them.</p>

               <p>There are three further bronze issues, one of them 'small,' and two, apparently, very small, which are presumably later than any of the Eretrian or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> bronzes in the hoards listed above as these contained no specimens. All three of them are rare:</p>
               <p rend="hang">Small. Weight under 3 gms. (and probably more than 2). Size 11 to 16 mm. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV, 17–18.</p>

               <p rend="hang">Very small. Weight? (probably under 2 gms.). Size? (probably 10 to 15 mm.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Obv</hi>. Cow's head facing (like the Phokian)</p>
               <p rend="hang">

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Obv</hi>. Head of Hermes r., wearing petasos</p>
               <p rend="hang">
                  <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. Ear and stalk of wheat r.; above and below, ΕΥΒΟΙ-ΕΩΝ. <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> XV, 21.</p>
               <p>These coins (I know only four) seem to be slightly smaller than the cow's head and rudder issue.</p>
               <p>If we are right that the League bronze with the veiled head is all of it earlier than the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> bronze of the same denomination with symbols, and that these last three issues are later than any of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> bronzes, it follows that these last three issues were struck towards the middle of the second century. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> will then have abandoned their coinage somewhat earlier than the League. They struck again under the Roman empire, but there are no further coins of the Euboian League.</p>
               <p>It is well known that the Greeks did not strike their bronze coins nearly as accurately as their silver. As these coins were undoubtedly token money, the fact is not surprising—the metal had comparatively little intrinsic value—but it does not follow that the weight should be disregarded, and attention paid only to the size. The size may be less variable than the weight within a given group, but as the sizes of different groups are less different from each other than their basic weights, the weight is often, in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboia</placeName> at least, a better guide to the denomination than the size. I have accordingly followed <persName>Newell</persName> in recording the weights of the coins in the hoards here published for the first time. The only Euboian League bronze group in which enough coins are known to make an attempt at statistical treatment worth while is the one the types of which are the veiled head and butting cow. In the following table I have included all the coins not obviously broken or heavily oxidized in hoards 2, 3, and 5 in which the variations of weight appear to be of the same order. As the ten coins of hoard 4 were on the whole lighter in weight than the others, they have been omitted from the table (their weights are given above). It will be seen that the weights fall almost entirely between 3.5 and
<pb n="132"/>
5.5 gms. with no apparent preference for any one point in that range. Perhaps the blanks were cut 'by eye,' and then tested—as I have tested some of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalkis</placeName> issues—by ascertaining merely that each blank fell within the allowable limits. This is a much faster process than accurate weighing, and would doubtless give as good results as the mints in question were concerned to achieve.</p>

            <p>The coins are listed according to weight under the various die combinations; for the relations of these see the die diagrams in the chapter on the silver issues. Each die combination is given a serial number. Obverse dies are indicated by Roman numerals, reverse by Arabic. The weight is first given in grains, then, in brackets, in grammes. The positions are indicated as follows:</p>
            <list>
               <item rend="hang">↑c means that the obverse axis was taken through the top of the head and the center of the neck.</item>
               <item rend="hang">↑f means that the obverse axis was taken through the crown of the head and the front of the neck.</item>
               <item rend="hang">↑n means that the obverse axis was taken through the forehead and the nape of the neck.</item>
               <item>↑c–f or ↑c–n indicates positions between ↑c and ↑f or ↑c and ↑n.</item>
               <item rend="hang">↑c? ↑f? or ↑n? means that the position was guessed at from a cast or photograph.</item>
               <item rend="hang">↑, ↖ or ↗ means that the die position has been published or reported in that manner. I have also used ↖ and ↗ where the dies of the group as a whole are completely irregular.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For other positions the arrows have been used in the usual manner. The few abbreviations in the names of museums, dealers, etc., should be intelligible—a list of the museums will be found in the preface.</p>
