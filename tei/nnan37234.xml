            <p>For nearly a century the existence in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> of considerable numbers of "barbarous" bronze
               coins, imitated from types of <persName corresp="#nomisma_claudius">Claudius I</persName>, has been recognized.<ref target="#CH1-n2">2</ref>
               But beyond the recording of stray specimens here and there, little has been done in the way of a general survey of these imitations, and it was
               left to Cohen<ref target="#CH1-n3">3</ref> to voice the first theory regarding their provenance. His view that they are of <placeName>British</placeName> manufacture is at variance with other opinions that have been expressed more recently: and the object of this paper is to
               reopen the question and examine it in the light of more comprehensive evidence than appears to have been available before.</p>
            <pb n="2"/>
            <p>When <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> attained supreme power after Actium, he found, as one of the most urgent and
               prevalent problems that faced him, that of the reform of the coinage. Fifty years of constitutional strife had seen the issue of gold and silver
               coins become part of the prerogative of rival "<hi rend="italic">imperatores</hi>," exercised anywhere at their discretion: the bronze token
               coinage, issued by the Senate, had ceased altogether about 82 B. C. The plan ultimately elaborated by <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName> made <placeName>Lugdunum</placeName> the chief source of gold for the Empire and of silver for
               the West: the <placeName>Italian</placeName> peninsula received its supplies of bronze money from the re-established Senatorial mint, while
                  <placeName>Gaul</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName> were independently supplied, the first by the Gallic "Altar" series, and the two latter by local town issues. The East supplied
               itself abundantly with both silver and bronze.</p>
            <p>So far, therefore, as token money was concerned, the western part of the Empire may be regarded as having been adequately supplied during <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>' reign. It was probably under <placeName>Tiberius</placeName> that a shortage of
               bronze was first felt. His disinclination to continue the "Altar" series in <placeName>Gaul</placeName> is balanced by a diminution in the
               issues of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName>, and both
               facts reflect the measure of his antipathy to the forces of nationalism: the revolt of Sacrovir and the war with Tacfarinas<ref target="#CH1-n4">4</ref> doubtless increased his native caution. Under <persName>Caligula Rome</persName> became the sole mint in the West for gold,
               silver and bronze: <pb n="3"/> and even if certain issues were, in this reign as in the last, intended for purely provincial circulation, the
               fact remains that the western provinces were now without a single mint designed for the supply of bronze.</p>
            <p>Shortage of official small change generally leads to local and unofficial issues, and it is indisputable that during this period a flood of
               unorthodox coinage makes its appearance on the continent in the West. Even under <persName corresp="#nomisma_augustus">Augustus</persName>,
               a certain number of imitations appear to have been made: but it was in the two succeeding reigns that they first became really numerous, the ROM
               ET AVG and PROVIDENT Altar types, together with the Agrippa type,<ref target="#CH1-n5">5</ref> being especially common in <placeName>Gaul</placeName>, while local issues were manufactured in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName>. The extent of the
               unofficial coinage in <placeName>Gaul</placeName> can be well judged by the results of Ritterling's excavations at the Claudian camp at
                  Hofheim:<ref target="#CH1-n6">6</ref> large numbers of Gallic imitations appear to have entered <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName> with the <placeName>Roman</placeName> forces. Examples of pre-Claudian types found in <placeName>Britain</placeName>
               are, similarly, the results of the Claudian invasion: no question arises as to their being of any other than continental manufacture. They occur
               comparatively seldom,—a fact later to be borne in mind when the Claudian copies made in <placeName>Britain</placeName> are compared with those
               of the continent. An example of <pb n="4"/> unusual interest is the <hi rend="italic">as</hi> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carthago_nova">Carthago Nova</placeName> (Vives, <hi rend="italic">La Moneda Hispanica,</hi> IV, 37. 37) found at Rochester,<ref target="#CH1-n7">7</ref> of stiff style and clumsy workmanship. The other examples are mainly of the Altar type, as at <placeName>Wroxeter</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n8">8</ref> or the more frequent Agrippa type, specimens of which occur at <placeName>Roustage</placeName> in the <placeName>Wychwood Forest</placeName> (Oxon.),<ref target="#CH1-n9">9</ref> Otford (Kent),—a brockage,<ref target="#CH1-n10">10</ref> and <persName>Lincoln</persName>,—a mule with the Claudian Minerva-type reverse.<ref target="#CH1-n11">11</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The accession of <persName>Claudius</persName>, although it was followed in Rome by some years' heavy output of bronze coinage, was
               unattended by any change of policy in regard to provincial mints. The frequency on the continent of imitated unofficial issues now reaches its
               peak point: so great is the flood of Claudian imitations that it seems as if this unorthodox currency must have been tolerated, if not
               encouraged, by the central government. The figures from Hofheim show that, of the coins of <persName>Claudius</persName>' reign, about one
               fifth are imitations. It is indeed just conceivable that this large proportion was connived at by the authorities. But it is more likely that it
               reflects their willingness to allow communities to augment by local issues the admittedly scanty supply of bronze from the central mint of Rome:
               provided that the authentic type was recognizably <pb n="5"/> copied, the government can have had few grounds for objection.</p>
            <p>It now remains to be seen whether the same hypothesis can be applied to <placeName>Britain</placeName>. <persName>Sir George
                  Hill</persName>, in his important and authoritative paper on the Southants Hoard,<ref target="#CH1-n12">12</ref> is disposed to assign a Gallic
               origin to the Claudian copies found in this country, on the following grounds:—</p>
            <list rend="inline">
               <item n="i.">The infrequency with which they occur.</item>
               <item n="ii.">The contiguity with <placeName>Gaul</placeName> of the regions in which they occur.</item>
               <item n="iii.">The sufficiency of the native coinage (as indicated by its presence in this and other hoards), suggesting that it was not
                  suppressed, called in, or otherwise discouraged.</item>
            </list>
            <p>An examination of the evidence available in provincial museums and recorded in numismatic literature makes it possible to deny the validity of
               each of his first two premises. <placeName>Hill</placeName> quotes a few stray examples of Claudian copies from <placeName>Southampton</placeName>, <placeName>Santon Downham</placeName>, <placeName>Croydon</placeName>, and <placeName>Dorset</placeName>. The
               following list, which claims to be no more than generally representative, gives a fair indication of the parts of <placeName>Britain</placeName> where these coins occur, and of the proportion that they bear to the official <placeName>Roman</placeName> coinage.<ref target="#CH1-n13">13</ref>

                  at Rich-borough or Hofheim, to a single well-defined area. But it is quite evident that the proportion is of a very considerable size, and if
                  we were to put it at about 20% on an average over the whole area in which <persName>Claudian coins</persName> are found, we should not be
                  far from the truth. In certain localities, as may be noted, the proportion is well over half. Secondly, in considering the area over which
                  they occur, we cannot fail to notice that they are evenly spread over almost all the region embraced by the Claudian conquest, and that they
                  are found even beyond what might be expected to form their logical boundary. The examples from <persName>Yorkshire</persName>, <placeName>Staffordshire</placeName>, and <placeName>Shropshire</placeName> clearly show the extent of their spread northward.<ref target="#CH1-n16">16</ref> It can scarcely be held<ref target="#CH1-n17">17</ref> that <pb n="11"/> these copies occur only, or even
                  chiefly, in the parts of <placeName>Britain</placeName> contiguous to <placeName>Gaul</placeName>. This is not to deny that a certain
                  number of examples may have found their way across the Channel. Nevertheless it would be illogical to attribute a Gallic origin to a group of
                  coins spread over the greater part of <placeName>Britain</placeName> on the ground that a few examples may have been imported from the
                  continent.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Hill's</persName> third hypothesis is of comparatively little importance. The native <placeName>British</placeName> coinage
                  may or may not have been recalled, and in any case it does not seem to have provided an abundant supply of bronze small change. Hoards
                  containing both <placeName>British</placeName> and <placeName>Roman</placeName> coins are not uncommon,<ref target="#CH1-n18">18</ref>
                  and the general impression gained from them is that, while the autonomous gold, silver and even billon continued to circulate fairly steadily
                  during the first century A. D., the <placeName>Roman</placeName> bronze almost at once came into its own as supplying the need for a token
                  coinage.</p>
               <p>It appears therefore that no theory which ascribes a continental origin to these copies can be based on grounds either of their infrequency or
                  of their restriction to the extreme South, or of their super- <pb n="12"/> fluity beside the native <placeName>British</placeName> issues.
                  There appear to be no other obvious reasons for supposing them to be importations, and we are driven to the conclusion that they were struck
                  frequently, and over a wide area, in <placeName>Britain</placeName> itself. This sudden flood of irregular coins can be associated only
                  with the Claudian invasion. The actual area over which they are found exactly covers the districts of the first conquests: examples found
                  beyond the <placeName>Fosse Way</placeName> bear witness to the spread of the new coinage, and also to its continuance during the
                  subsequent years of conquest. An examination of the actual types found is equally strong evidence for the connection of these copies with the
                  Claudian legions. <hi rend="italic">Sestertii</hi> are of rare occurrence, as copies. In the list of coins which served as a basis for this
                  paper, less than 5% were copied <hi rend="italic">sestertii</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Dupondii</hi> are much commoner, and account for some 25%.
                  But it is the <hi rend="italic">as</hi> that we find most frequently imitated: some 70% of the Claudian copies found in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> are so accounted for. There can be small doubt that the widespread and sudden dissemination of
                     <persName>Claudian coins</persName> by the legions of the conquest led directly to their more or less general imitation throughout the
                  area under control, the commoner types naturally being most often copied. It is interesting to note that the title P. P. is hardly ever found
                  on the copies occurring in <placeName>Britain</placeName>: the examples with P. P. quoted by <placeName>Hill</placeName> from the
                  Southants Hoard are rare exceptions. Although it is difficult to differentiate in date between the issues with and without <pb n="13"/> P. P.,
                  it may justifiably be held that the earlier issues were, in the main, those which naturally entered <placeName>Britain</placeName> with the
                     legions.<ref target="#CH1-n19">19</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Claudian copies found in <placeName>Britain</placeName> confirm our knowledge of the relative frequency of the various imperial types.
                  Of the <hi rend="italic">sestertii</hi>, almost all are of the Spes Augusta type (<hi rend="italic">Plate I</hi>): an interesting exception is
                  the coin with <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi> Ob Cives Servatos, at <placeName>York</placeName>. The <hi rend="italic">dupondii</hi> include
                  both the Ceres Augusta type (<hi rend="italic">Plate II</hi>) and the coins struck with <hi rend="italic">obv</hi>. <persName>Antonia
                     Augusta</persName> in commemoration of <persName>Claudius</persName>' mother (<hi rend="italic">Plate III</hi>, 1–8) : the former class is
                  the more frequent. The <hi rend="italic">asses</hi> include the Constantiae Augusti, Libertas and Minerva types (<hi rend="italic">Plates
                     III,</hi> 9–10 &amp; <hi rend="italic">IV–VIII</hi>): of these the first is of fairly steady though not very frequent occurrence, while the
                  second is rare. The Minerva type is found in an overwhelming proportion. Copies of <hi rend="italic">quadrantes</hi> seem to be unknown in
                     <placeName>Britain</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Imitations of all the foregoing types are found in very varying stages of degradation and debasement, and it now becomes necessary to form a
                  simple system of classification by which all Claudian copies may be conveniently judged.<ref target="#CH1-n20">20</ref> The system here <pb n="14"/> adopted distinguishes four grades of debasement, as follows:—</p>
               <p rend="hang">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Grade</hi> I contains coins which show all the detail, and much of the excellence of fabric, possessed by their
                  prototype, but lack the essentially <placeName>Roman</placeName> character of the model. The legends are correct.</p>
               <p rend="hang">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Grade</hi> II embraces coins of rougher fabric than Grade I, showing in addition a growing inaccuracy of detail. The
                  legends, wherever the size of the flan allows of their being properly seen, appear to be correct.</p>
               <p rend="hang">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Grade</hi> III includes the rough and unskilful productions of thoroughly crude and barbarous style. With few exceptions
                  the legends are either hopelessly blundered or non-existent.</p>
               <p rend="hang">
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Grade</hi> IV is reserved for the rare instances of reversal of one or both types; i. e. as when the head is facing r.
                  instead of l., with or without a corresponding reversal of the <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi> type.</p>
               <p>Technique and style are the only criteria by which these copies can be compared: weight, although when averaged out over a number of specimens
                  it gives results of considerable interest,<ref target="#CH1-n21">21</ref> may be highly misleading in the case of single coins. Under the
                  heading of technique, or fabric, are included the following:—</p>
               <list rend="inline">
                  <item n="a.">The shape of the flan.</item>
                  <item n="b.">The relief of the <hi rend="italic">obv.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi> types.</item>

                  <item n="d.">The adjustment of dies.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As matters of style, there are considered:—</p>
               <list rend="inline">
                  <item n="a.">The head<ref target="#CH1-n22">22</ref> (i. e. the treatment of the features, hair, neck and bust).</item>
                  <item n="b.">The <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi> type (i. e. the treatment of the position and the drapery or armour).</item>
                  <item n="c.">
                     <hi rend="italic">Obv.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi> legends (i. e. their accuracy and position, and the form of the
                     letters).</item>
                  <item n="d.">The border.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The prototypes of these Romano-British copies possess in every case most of the qualities of a good and attractive coin. Designed, as they
                  were, at a time when the standard of numismatic portraiture was approaching a high point of vigour and skill, they show a forceful head,
                  excellently proportioned to the size of the field, surrounded by a legend of clear and fine lettering (cf. <hi rend="italic">Plate IV,</hi>
                  1). The reverses are equally successful: in particular the arresting figure of Minerva, gracefully clad, hurling her weapon in a field empty
                  but for the large letters S C (<hi rend="italic">Plate V,</hi> 1, 2), forms a type that appeals to the imagination and encourages imitation.
                  Both the <hi rend="italic">obv.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi> types were finished off with a border of dots. The flans themselves are
                  well rounded and the striking is careful and sharp.</p>
               <pb n="16"/>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">First Grade</hi> of degradation is subtle and often hard to analyse. But, in a general way, it may be said that, from
                  the first, the <placeName>Romano</placeName>-<placeName>British</placeName> copies lack the definite character of the originals. This
                  implies neither unskilful technique nor poor style: on the contrary, the flans continued to be of fairly good shape, though they may fall to
                  as little as 25 mm. in diameter. Die-adjustment is not frequent in this Grade, but it occurs far less frequently in the second, third and
                  fourth Grades. The striking is in most cases careful and the relief good, though the reverses tend to suffer in comparison with the obverses,
                  thereby forming one of the characteristics of this Grade: it almost seems as if the die-engravers, while anxious to reproduce the full detail
                  of the original, found difficulties in rendering the complexities of the reverse, and particularly of Minerva (cf. <hi rend="italic">Plate
                     V</hi>). Stylistically, these coins are not without merit: the portrait is clearly delineated and fully recognizable, although the
                  characterization may appear uncertain (cf. <hi rend="italic">Plate II</hi>, 2, 6 and <hi rend="italic">V</hi>, 3, 6). In the case of the
                  portraits of <persName>Claudius</persName>, two of the chief features of the prototypes, namely, the long, muscular neck, neatly
                  indented, and the indication of the bust below, are almost always faithfully copied. The reverse types, although frequently in low relief,
                  show accuracy and vigour. The legends, on both <hi rend="italic">obv.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rev.,</hi> are correct, with perhaps a
                  preference for the open form of A (∧): the letters are regular, orthodox in size, and properly spaced. Both sides of these coins are commonly
                  finished off with a border of dots (cf. <hi rend="italic">Plate II</hi>, 4).</p>
               <pb n="17"/>
               <p>Coins of the <hi rend="italic">Second Grade</hi> are more easily recognized, for now, besides the absence of <placeName>Roman</placeName>
                  character, there is the added criterion of rougher fabric allied with inaccurate detail. Flans are more irregular in shape, and are frequently
                  too small for the dies: this is notably the case with the numerous <placeName>Silchester</placeName> group (cf. <hi rend="italic">Plate
                     VI,</hi> 8). Occasionally a flan has all the appearance of having been restruck. The relief of the <hi rend="italic">obv.</hi> of this
                  class of coins is noticeably lower than that of Grade I, while the <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi> now receives greater care and emphasis.
                  Already, perhaps, some of the moneyers to whom fell the work of copying the official coins found in the <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi> types, and
                  especially in that of Minerva, a more stirring composition than was possessed by the head of the <hi rend="italic">obv.</hi> Viewed generally,
                  these coins show a technique that is adequate if not highly competent. It is in the matter of style that there is the greatest falling off.
                  The head, now seldom recognizable, exhibits little of the flair for portraiture which characterizes the originals: the features are either
                  flat and dull, or caricatured (<hi rend="italic">Plate VI</hi>, 1, <hi rend="italic">IV</hi>, 3). The hair is carelessly worked, and there is
                  an obvious reluctance to attempt the modelling of the neck muscles (<hi rend="italic">Plate VI</hi>). The <hi rend="italic">rev</hi>. types
                  show the same tendency to inaccuracy and lifelessness. Both the <hi rend="italic">obv</hi>. and <hi rend="italic">rev</hi>. legends appear to
                  be correct in substance, where they are readable, but in form there is a falling off here also.</p>
               <p>The coins of Grades I and II are the productions of literate communities, where Latin was either <pb n="18"/> generally in use or at least so
                  commonly understood as to lose nothing in the copying. The <hi rend="italic">Third Grade</hi>, embracing the Minerva type almost exclusively
                     (<hi rend="italic">Plate VII:</hi> cf. <hi rend="italic">Plate III,</hi> 6–8), is composed chiefly of the work of illiterates to whom Latin
                  was a closed book, for the majority of legends are either blundered or, in the worse examples, non-existent. In all respects, these coins are
                  crude and barbarous. The flans are of all shapes, and vary in size from 28–22 mm.,—hardly greater than a large debased <hi rend="italic">antoninianus.</hi> In some cases they have obviously been through a long process of restriking: most of them are too small for the dies,
                  and nearly all of them have one or both dies badly centred (cf. <hi rend="italic">Plate III</hi>, 6, <hi rend="italic">VII</hi>, 1). Relief is
                  for the most part low. From the point of view of style, this group includes coins almost worthy of inclusion in the Second Grade, which are
                  relegated to Grade III on account of greatly inferior fabric (cf. <hi rend="italic">Plate VII,</hi> 1): and at the other end of the scale
                  appear examples of the utmost degree of barbarism. In nearly every case the head is of a new and purely formal type, remarkable for an almost
                  complete absence of modelling: the head is blocked out in a mass, the eye, ear and mouth being represented by indentations or incisions (cf.
                     <hi rend="italic">Plate VII,</hi> 3, 6, 7). It is interesting to observe that, in this group, <persName>Claudius</persName>' chin is
                  usually strong and square,—a characterization never present in the <placeName>Roman</placeName> prototypes. He is given a rude shock of
                  hair and his neck, whether thin or thick, is generally long and terminates in a plain truncation. <pb n="19"/> The <hi rend="italic">rev.</hi>
                  type is as devoid of skill as the <hi rend="italic">obv</hi>., but it still preserves a certain vigour. In many cases the Minerva-figure has
                  changed its sex, and has consequently shed all drapery (<hi rend="italic">Plate VII</hi>, 3): frequently traces of drapery remain in purely
                  conventional form, such as <graphic url="NNM65_019a.jpg"/>, between the legs (<hi rend="italic">Plate VII</hi>, 2, 6, 7). Rare examples show
                  the type undergoing a more radical change, in which posture and action are such that the type may properly be called a new one. Coins of this
                  group are not uncommonly found pierced for suspension.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Fourth Grade</hi> is no more barbarous than Grade III in respect of degree of debasement, being designed merely to
                  include examples of reversed types. Here the Minerva-type supplies the only specimens (<hi rend="italic">Plate VIII</hi>). In one sense these
                  coins are the result of painstaking effort, since it seems as if the die-engraver kept his eye so carefully upon his model that he forgot to
                  engrave his design in a reversed position! Of the rare examples that occur, two are of exceptional interest. These two coins (<hi rend="italic">Plate VIII</hi>, 1–2) are in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName> and <placeName>Maidstone Museum</placeName> respectively: both <hi rend="italic">obverses</hi>, which show a crude, blocked-out head to r., with blundered
                  retrograde legend, are from the same die: but, while the <persName>B. M. coin</persName> has a <hi rend="italic">rev</hi>. with Minerva
                  l., and legend <graphic url="NNM65_019b.jpg"/>, the <placeName>Maidstone</placeName> specimen which appears by the condition of the <hi rend="italic">obv</hi>. die to be a later striking, shows the <hi rend="italic">rev</hi>. type r., with legend S C. This may represent
                  reversal of types carried to the <pb n="20"/> second degree. Other examples of Grade IV come from Astrop (Northants)<ref target="#CH1-n23">23</ref> and <persName>St. Albans</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n24">24</ref>
               </p>
               <p>As has been said before, the question of the weights of these copies must be treated with caution: so far as the grading is concerned, weight
                  is only admissible as confirming the evidence of style, since the weights of individual specimens in any given class, although in the average
                  they give useful information, vary widely in themselves. For instance, Constantia-type <hi rend="italic">asses</hi> from <placeName>Woodeaton</placeName> and <placeName>Dorchester</placeName> (Oxon.), both of Grade II, weigh 10.65 gm. and 4.99 gm. respectively, and
                  Minerva-type <hi rend="italic">asses</hi> from <persName>Lincoln</persName> and <placeName>Winchester</placeName>, both of Grade III,
                  weigh 8.75 gm. and 2.60 gm. respectively.</p>

               <p>But a calculation of the average weights of coins which have been first graded by grounds of style and fabric alone gives interesting results.
                  The table above sets out these results, and gives for comparison the average weights of the orthodox coins to which the various copies
                  correspond.</p>

               <p>With the exception of the Grade II averages of the Ceres and Libertas types, both of which are somewhat invalidated by the small number of <pb n="22"/> specimens available for weighing, these figures confirm in a remarkably thorough way the results of previous classification by
                  style. The rare copies of <hi rend="italic">sestertii</hi> drop little more than a gramme in Grade I, but Grade II shows a further drop of 10
                  grammes. With the smaller denominations the decrease is less uneven. Grade I is from 2–4 grammes lower than the orthodox weight in the case of
                  the <hi rend="italic">dupondii</hi>, and from 1–2 grammes lower in the case of the <hi rend="italic">asses</hi>. The lower Grades of both
                  denominations show a consistently decreasing weight: in Grades III and IV of the Minerva-type <hi rend="italic">as</hi>, the weight is only
                  about one half of the full orthodox weight. In general, it may be said that the weight of Grade I specimens of all denominations and types
                  shows only a small reduction, and that Grade II specimens of the commoner denominations and types show no very drastic reduction: it is in the
                  Grade III and IV specimens of the frequent Minerva examples that a completely new weight standard seems to have been reached.</p>
               <p>Evidence of provenance, frequency, style and weight has now been given, and reasons have been shown for thinking it to be certain that these
                  copies were widely manufactured in <placeName>Britain</placeName>. It remains to inquire under what circumstances and by whom they were
                  manufactured, and to determine the period of time through which their manufacture persisted. The sharp division of the four Grades of copies
                  into two main sections, one literate and one almost entirely illiterate, forms a possible starting <pb n="23"/> point: it is well to remember
                  that the ordinary <placeName>Romano</placeName>-<placeName>British</placeName> village was only very superficially <placeName>Roman</placeName>, and that Romanization was bred chiefly in the towns.<ref target="#CH1-n25">25</ref> It is, naturally, in or near the towns
                  that the majority of copies, and particularly of good copies, is found. These towns may be either administrative and military centres, such as
                     <persName>Lincoln</persName>, <placeName>York</placeName> and <placeName>Gloucester</placeName>, or tribal capitals such as
                     <placeName>Winchester</placeName>, <placeName>Dorchester</placeName> (<placeName>Dorset</placeName>), <placeName>Silchester</placeName> and <placeName>Cirencester</placeName>. From the prevalence of Claudian copies in the military towns it seems almost
                  certain that recourse must have been had to the coining of local issues as an official method of supplementing the military chest: the chest
                  may not have been too full at the time of conquest, and an army in <placeName>Britain</placeName> was in a precarious position if it had to
                  draw all its supplies of cash from the mint at Rome. The proportion of copies at <persName>Lincoln</persName> is remarkable enough: it is
                  still more remarkable at <placeName>York</placeName>, which lay outside the conquest boundary. By the time that Petilius Cerialis moved
                  Legio IX from <persName>Lincoln</persName> to <placeName>York</placeName> (A. D. 71), Flavian coinage and the preceding issues of
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_nero">Nero</persName> were presumably circulating regularly in <placeName>Britain</placeName>, and
                  perhaps the Claudian copies at <placeName>York</placeName> indicate an earlier occupation, by some kind of expeditionary force, than has
                  hitherto been deemed the case. Otherwise we must assume that Claudian copies formed a large part of the currency, whether military or not,
                  until the seventies, although, on purely numismatic grounds, the excellence of the <pb n="24"/> imitation is against this latter hypothesis.
                     <placeName>Gloucester</placeName> probably saw the legions of <persName>Claudius</persName> as part of the regular programme of
                  conquest: here again the number of high-class copies is very great.<ref target="#CH1-n26">26</ref>
               </p>
               <p>It is, then, difficult to resist the conclusion that the <placeName>Roman</placeName> officials saw to the manufacture of local coinage as
                  a means of continuing the payment of the legionaries:<ref target="#CH1-n27">27</ref> such semi-official copies would be executed either by
                  camp-moneyers or by native <placeName>British</placeName> craftsmen, and, since they would be intended for military circulation, their
                  style and weight would be fairly accurate. The Grade I copies faithfully fulfil these conditions. In time they would come to circulate through
                  the tribal centres, or country towns of the civil districts that lay between and behind the chief <placeName>Roman</placeName> military
                  posts, and must have been welcomed as a much-needed addition to the existing supplies of small change. Once absorbed into currency, they would
                  themselves be subject to imitation, the second-degree copies being proportionately less faithful and lighter in weight since they were a
                  purely token coinage, and no longer a military unit of payment. It is in the Grade II copies that we should expect to find this class of
                  coinage. They are extremely numerous at such centres as <placeName>Cirencester</placeName>, <placeName>Silchester</placeName>, <placeName>Winchester</placeName> and <placeName>Dorchester</placeName> (<placeName>Dorset</placeName>), which were <pb n="25"/> civil,
                  and not military, towns, composed of the best native <placeName>British</placeName> elements and capable of producing passable copies. In
                  the process of trade they must have had a fairly wide circulation as is perhaps to be seen by the examples found at <placeName>Dorchester</placeName> (Oxon.) (<hi rend="italic">Plate IV,</hi> 6), <placeName>Woodeaton</placeName> (<hi rend="italic">Plate IV</hi>, 5),
                     <placeName>Asthall</placeName> (<hi rend="italic">Plate VI</hi>, 2) and at <placeName>Bolitree</placeName> in <placeName>Herefordshire</placeName> (<hi rend="italic">Plate VI</hi>, 5): moreover, they must have frequently found their way into the larger and
                  military towns, as specimens at <persName>Rich borough</persName>, <persName>St. Albans</persName> and <placeName>Gloucester</placeName> go to show.</p>
               <p>Our attributions and distinctions cannot of course be entirely water-tight, since there must have been many examples of Grade II copies made
                  in the Romanized towns as a result of successive imitation of Grade I copies: in the second-class towns, too, such as <placeName>Silchester</placeName>, regular imitation of Grade II coins probably led to the production of many examples of Grade III, as the coins from the
                  site tend to show. But it is unlikely that the imitation of <persName>Claudian coins</persName> continued as long in either first or
                  second class towns as it did in small and essentially un-<placeName>Roman</placeName> settlements, whither fresh issues of orthodox coinage
                  would find their way only slowly and irregularly: and it is in dealing with the lower and chiefly illiterate Grades that we are brought up
                  most seriously against the question of the duration of the Series. It is perhaps a legitimate conjecture that copies of Grades III and IV,
                  which clearly involved no specialist knowledge of coining, were manufactured in the remoter and less civilized <pb n="26"/> centres fairly
                  soon after the first circulation of the Claudian series. Such copies would vary in degree of debasement according to the natural capacity or
                  incapacity of the copyist. But extreme debasement of style may also result through a series of ever-increasing degradation, and since there is
                  some evidence for the long-continued circulation of these copies, it may be necessary to account for a proportion of the more barbarous
                  examples by the hypothesis that they are of an unsuspected lateness of manufacture.</p>
               <p>The regular circulation of Claudian copies in the first century A. D. is shown by such hoards as those at <placeName>Timsbury</placeName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n28">28</ref> and <placeName>Nunney</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n29">29</ref> and further examples are probably to be
                  recognized among the many worn Claudian coins which formed the early currency in <placeName>Roman</placeName> Wales.<ref target="#CH1-n30">30</ref> Second-century circulation is attested by the <placeName>Southants</placeName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n31">31</ref> and Croydon Hoards;<ref target="#CH1-n32">32</ref> the first of these, buried about A. D. 150, contained
                  thirteen examples, while the second, dated a few years earlier, also included a specimen. That they were still current well on into the third
                  century is proved by the Clapton-in-Gordano Hoard,<ref target="#CH1-n33">33</ref> composed <pb n="27"/> of coins from Gallienus to Maximian,
                  together with a barbarous Minerva-type <hi rend="italic">as</hi>. The evidence of this last hoard is confirmed by a group of coins found at
                  Astrop, King's Sutton, Northants, none of which, except for a Grade IV Minerva-type <hi rend="italic">as</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Plate
                     VIII</hi>, 3), was struck before the reign of Tetricus.<ref target="#CH1-n34">34</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Of the foregoing hoards, that from Southants is the most valuable for purposes of chronology, since it serves to remind us that, even in the
                  middle of the second century, coinage of a native pattern was still extant, if not being actually manufactured. The presence in this same
                  hoard of a considerable proportion of Claudian copies gives rise to the speculation that the <placeName>British</placeName> workmen who
                  perhaps still specialized in the production of autonomous currency may have looked upon the Claudian types with a respect analogous to that
                  felt by the ancient Arabians for the Athenian tetradrachm, or by their modern successors for the <persName>Maria Theresa</persName>
                  dollar. If we could postulate a production of Claudian copies down to the middle of the second century, the occurrence of specimens a century
                  later would be a very natural possibility. After A. D. 150 the supplies of bronze in <placeName>Britain</placeName> probably sufficed the
                  country districts: before that, it may well have been necessary to resort to fairly regular imitation, and nothing is more natural than that
                  the choice of the copyists should fall upon the earliest <placeName>Roman</placeName> series known to the country. It is therefore possible
                  that, <pb n="28"/> while many of the Grade III and IV examples represent fairly contemporary imitation in backward and un-<placeName>Roman</placeName> districts a considerable number may also be assigned to a period lasting until about a century afterwards, as the
                  increasingly unskilful products of rural and uncivilized craftsmen.</p>
               <p>If this hypothesis is true, it may, in combination with the undoubted fact that the post-Claudian coinages were more plentiful, help to
                  explain the comparative infrequency of imitations of subsequent issues. Stray examples can be quoted, such as the <hi rend="italic">asses</hi>
                  of <persName corresp="#nomisma_nero">Nero</persName>, one in the Croydon Hoard<ref target="#CH1-n35">35</ref> and one in the <placeName>Lincoln Museum</placeName>, a <hi rend="italic">sestertius</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">as</hi> of Vespasian at <placeName>Dorchester</placeName> (<placeName>Dorset</placeName>)<ref target="#CH1-n36">36</ref> and <placeName>Cirencester</placeName>
                  respectively, a <hi rend="italic">dupondius</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">as</hi> of <persName corresp="#nomisma_trajan">Trajan</persName> at <placeName>Woodeaton</placeName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n37">37</ref> and <placeName>York</placeName>, and a <hi rend="italic">sestertius</hi> of Hadrian at <placeName>Cirencester</placeName>. Under the Antonines examples occur less seldom, but are never frequent: copies of types of Antoninus are found at
                     <placeName>Woodeaton</placeName>,<ref target="#CH1-n38">38</ref>
                  <placeName>Gloucester</placeName> and <placeName>Maidstone</placeName>, of Aurelius at <placeName>Woodeaton</placeName> again,<ref target="#CH1-n39">39</ref> and apparently of Faustina II at <placeName>Chesters</placeName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n40">40</ref> and <placeName>Cirencester</placeName>. But these coins are in every sense casual examples in comparison
                  with the numbers of Claudian copies that occur: most of them are sophisticated in style, and should probably be assigned some such origin as
                  has been tentatively <pb n="29"/> given to Grade I and II copies of <persName corresp="#nomisma_claudius">Claudius</persName>. In the remoter districts the Claudian
                  type may well have continued in vogue.</p>
               <p>Once the large bronze issues of Antoninus, of which certain types seem to have been specially intended for <placeName>British</placeName>
                  currency, had succeeded in penetrating throughout the country, imitation of bronze must have virtually ceased: silver then became the problem.
                  But until that time it is, as has been seen, quite probable that the copies of the original Claudian coinage had a steady circulation. Though
                  widely differing in origin and style, it would appear that they all played an important part in supplementing the meagre currency of a
                  province that was as poor as it was remote.</p>

               <p>In presenting this monograph the writer wishes to emphasize that, owing to the sporadic distribution of the material and the lack of relevant
                  archaeological literature, his treatment of the subject is necessarily preliminary and by no means exhaustive. He gratefully acknowledges
                  assistance from many quarters, and in particular his thanks are due to the committees and curators of the museums mentioned in the text for
                  their permission to examine the collections in their charge and to select coins for casting; to the Keeper of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_11217940">Ashmolean Museum</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2640729">Oxford</placeName>, for the generous number
                  of casts there made; and to <persName>Mr. Harold Mattingly</persName>, both for the furnishing of casts of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6697862">British Museum</placeName> coins and for the advantage of his helpful criticism.</p>
