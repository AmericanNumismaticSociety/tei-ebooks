               <p>During the autumn of 1925, in the neighborhood of <placeName>Gampola</placeName>, a village in the central part of <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> an earthen pot (see frontispiece) containing a large number of coins was dug up in a garden. The bulk of the find consisted of bent pieces of silver wire known as <hi rend="italic">larins</hi>. The exact number of pieces in the find is not known, but the greater part was purchased from four intermediaries by Dr. <persName>Casey A. Wood</persName> of <placeName>Pasadena</placeName>, <placeName>California</placeName>, who was visiting the island at the time. It is known that a few pieces with the same characteristic patination were being hawked about the bazaars of <placeName>Kandy</placeName> at about the same time; a number of these were obtained by Dr. <persName>Wood</persName> both then and subsequently. The presumption is that the find as now brought together (819 larins and 114 coins) forms a very considerable part of the whole. The find contained probably the largest number of larins ever found at one time, certainly the largest number ever found in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>.</p>
               <p>In this assemblage are about as many larins as had heretofore been known. No large numbers are in any one collection; probably many museums have from ten to fifty specimens of all kinds gathered from various localities in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arabia">Arabia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> and <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>, but the provenence for the most part is un-
<pb n="2"/>
certain. This find offers the first opportunity for studying a large number. Little has been published on larins as a whole, and because of lack of comparative study, few if any worthwhile conclusions have consequently been made. Probably one of the reasons for this neglect is the fragmentary nature of the inscription found on any one specimen. The width of the larin is about one-eighth of an inch; it very rarely exceeds a quarter of an inch, and the dies used in stamping were for the most part circular coin dies varying from five-eighths to over an inch in diameter. Heretofore most of the inscribed pieces have shown parts of Arabic or Persian words, or religious formulas common to Mohammedan coins, or have been fragments of designs without any special meaning or purpose.</p>
               <p>Shortly after Dr. <persName>Wood</persName> acquired the find, it was submitted to <persName>John Still</persName>, Esq. formerly Assistant to the Archaeological Commissioner of the Government of <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> who not only was instrumental in assembling the hoard but who also made a preliminary report (unpublished) to Dr. <persName>Wood</persName>. To Mr. <persName>Still</persName> belongs the credit of having discovered certain of the pieces to have inscriptions sunk, rather than in relief, and reversed. He also discovered that these pieces were impressed from coins acting as dies, chiefly from coins of mediaeval Sinhalese rulers, but also from Dutch coins.</p>
               <p>Years ago <persName>W. B. Dickinson</persName> advanced the idea that certain larins had on them letters resembling Devanagari and suggested that they might have
<pb n="3"/>
been struck by some Kandyan king. Also in an early journal of the <placeName>Bombay</placeName> Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, the assignment of larins to <persName>Prakrama Bahu</persName>, 1153–1186, was made.<ref target="#CH1-n1">

                  </ref> I find no further mention of such larins after this date, in fact most pieces chronicled since have partial Persian inscriptions.</p>
               <p>The town of <placeName>Gampola</placeName> where the find was made is a small place about twelve miles south-southwest from <placeName>Kandy</placeName> on the banks of the Mahaweliganga about fifteen hundred feet above sea level in the central highlands of <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>. Under the name of Ganga-siripura, the Royal City of the River, it was the capital for a brief period beginning 1344 A. D.</p>
               <p>The find as assembled by Dr. <persName>Wood</persName> numbered 933 pieces, 819 of which were silver larins; these were for the most part of a dull dirty greyish color, some, however, had their natural silver brightness. Many had spots of hard green corrosion and at least fifty appeared to be copper, but this was a superficial coating and on applying dilute acid the pieces turned out to be of as good consistency as the rest. Three (all detected up to date) were contemporary forgeries, made of copper wire silvered. These were easily detected as the corrosion had eaten through the silver covering exposing the copper core.</p>
               <p>Number 121 in the catalogue is shown on the next page. The others are Nos. 2 and 154. An analysis of one of the pieces was made and the conclusions
<pb n="4"/>
reached were that the original small ingot of copper for drawing the wire was dipped in a molten bath of pure silver solder or else a coating of silver solder was applied in the cold and then melted on. The composite ingot was then drawn down to requisite size.<ref target="#CH1-n2">

               <p>All of the larins appear to be of good silver, with the exception of four, Nos. 85, 86 and 155. An analysis of the latter piece showed about 46% copper.</p>

made in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, No. 304. Several of the early travellers state that the best silver is in the Persian and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ramhurmuz">Hormuz</placeName> larins. To quote one writer, <persName>Pyrard</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n3">

                  </ref> &#x93;The best silver in the <placeName>Indies</placeName> is that which comes from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName> by way of <placeName>Ormus</placeName> in (the form of) a long coin, called <hi rend="italic">larins</hi>, which the smiths of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_india">India</placeName> prize highly, and use to their great advantage, being a very pure, clean, soft and ductile silver, and good for working.”</p>
               <p>Both Mr. <persName>W. H. Biddell</persName> of <placeName>Kandy</placeName>, <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> and myself have found that in opening up larins in order to examine the inscription those of Sinhalese manufacture sometimes break while the Persian ones bend easily. As the variation of the silver content of those examined would not make this difference the cause is probably due to the lack of annealing of the wire.</p>
               <p>The coins other than larins found in the hoard fall into two divisions—copper coins<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                     <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </ref> of the Sinhalese rulers of the XIII century, 43 in number and representing six rulers, and Portuguese silver coins of the XVII century.</p>
               <p>These copper coins are very common and are found in large quantities in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> for most of the rulers. They have a standing figure on one side and a seated figure and inscription on the other. See Plate II. The coins themselves were heavily encrusted with a bright green patination.</p>
               <p>As noted elsewhere, many of the larins in the find were stamped with coins of this class used as dies.
<pb n="6"/>
As a rule it would seem unusual for coins made at one time to be mixed with coins made four centuries later, especially as the earlier coins appear to be unworn. These copper pieces, however, have been dug up for centuries in great numbers and today are constantly being unearthed, often by the potful, even in the remote villages in the jungle. <persName>Codrington</persName> mentions that they were current in the early seventeenth century.<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </ref> Therefore a representation of these in the <placeName>Gampola</placeName> find would not be unusual, and the presence of these has shown that the burier was in all probability a larin maker, silversmith and small banker and these coins were a part of his stock of dies. It is also possible that he was the manufacturer of other pieces but struck from dies made for the purpose, such as Nos. 43 and 45, as numbers of these were present and none showed signs of wear.</p>
               <p>The Portuguese colonial coins in the find numbering 70 pieces are most important. Some had a glossy black oxidization and some showed patches of a red rusty corosion, and like the larins nearly all were flecked with green patination. These coins are all scarce and many are rare. All of the coins are listed at the end of the catalogue. Several of the coins were cast counterfeits of the time, not quickly detected as the dies of the struck pieces were for the most part rough and crude and consequently gave to the coins themselves somewhat the appearance of being cast. The weights, however, quickly indicated their spuriousness.</p>
               <pb n="7"/>
               <p>The composition of this hoard is interesting because the larins and Indo-Portuguese pieces are found together. This confirms the remarks of two Europeans who were in the interior at approximately the time of its burial. <persName>Codrington</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n6">
                     <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                  </ref> says that at the time of <persName>Sebald de Wirt</persName>’s expedition (circa 1602), larins and fanams of gold and silver were current and that these coins remained in circulation in the Kandyan Kingdom side by side with Portuguese money for very many years after the Dutch occupation of the coast. He quotes <persName>Knox</persName>, who was a prisoner there from 1659–1679: &#x93;Portuguese double and single tangas of the Saint type, the <hi rend="italic">tangam massa</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">podi</hi> (little) <hi rend="italic">tangama</hi>, larins made by private parties, five of which went to the piece of eight; and silver fanams, struck by the king, of which seventy five made a piece of Eight, or a Spanish dollar.” No fanams appear to have been in the find.</p>
               <p>Mr. <persName>Biddell</persName> has informed me that several other finds of Indo-Portuguese coins in conjunction with larins have occurred in recent years, though none approximated this hoard in size.</p>
               <p>Little can be gleaned from the larins themselves as to the date of the burial of the hoard, but we get clues from the Portuguese coins, especially from the two Dutch counterstamps found on a number of them. The earliest dated coin is 1631 and the last dated piece is 1655.</p>
               <p>Although the Dutch appeared off the coast of <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> in 1602, they did not obtain a hold there until they became a strong sea power towards the
<pb n="8"/>
close of their wars with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_spain">Spain</placeName>. They secured <placeName>Galle</placeName> in the southern part in 1640, <placeName>Colombo</placeName> in 1656 and in 1658 when <placeName>Jaffna</placeName> was occupied, the last Portuguese stronghold on the Island fell. The first countermark used by the Dutch was at <placeName>Galle</placeName> in 1655,<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                  </ref> and bears the letters GAL in monogram. The V. O. C. in monogram, either plain or surmounted by a C (<placeName>Colombo</placeName>) or an I (<placeName>Jaffna</placeName>) was used after July 1661 when an order was given that no Portuguese coins, such as peruse, reals, etc. are to be accepted without having been stamped with the Company’s mark.<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                     <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                  </ref> Both of these stamps appear on coins in the hoard. As 20 of the 70 coins bear the mark of 1655, and but 8 of the coins bear the 1661 mark which is supposed to be the commoner stamp, this pot of coins was probably buried within a few years after this latter date, or about 1665; in other words before many of the coins bearing the V. O. C. stamp had reached the interior.</p>
               <p>The absence of Dutch coins in the find is easily accounted for as the Dutch had hardly penetrated into the Kandyan country at the time these pieces were buried. In fact they did not obtain actual possession of this region until the eighteenth century. The few larins in the find impressed with the devices of the Dutch coins must have been made in the earlier days of their occupancy and could easily have come up from the coast in the course of trade, as the silver larin about 1661–2, according to <persName>Wouter</persName>
                  <pb n="9"/>

               <p>The name Larin or Lari, said to have been derived from <placeName>Lar</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName> where they were first struck, is the general appellation given to these pieces. <persName>Gasparo Balbi</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n10">

               <p>&#x93;The first who began to strike them was the King of <placeName>Lar</placeName>, who formerly was a powerful king in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, but is now a small one.”</p>

               <p>The beginning of the larin, like so many other beginnings is obscure.

                  <persName>Tavernier</persName>, who made several trips to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName> between 1638 and 1663, in his Six Voyages Pt. II, under &#x93;Moneys of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arabia">Arabia</placeName>,” has this to say:</p>
               <p>&#x93;This Money (referring to his illustration) is called Larin and signifies the same with our Crowns. The five pieces are as much in value as one of our Crowns and the Ten-Half-Larins as much. Only the Five Larins want in weight Eight Sous of our Crown. This is that which the Emirs or Princes of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arabia">Arabia</placeName> take for the coining of their Money; and the profit which they make by the Merchants that travel through the Desert either into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName> or the <placeName>Indies</placeName>. For them the Emirs come to the caravans to take their Tolls and to change their Crowns, Reals or Ducats, of Gold for these Larins. . . . If these five Larins did but weigh as much as the Crown or Real of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_spain">Spain</placeName>, the Merchants would never be much troubled. But when they come to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName> or the <placeName>Indies</placeName>, they must carry their Money to the Mint, as I have said in another place, and lose about eight Sous in a Crown which amounts to 14 per cent. As for what remains the Larins are one of the ancient Coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> and though at this day they are only current in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arabia">Arabia</placeName> and at <placeName>Balsara</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_al-basrah">el Basra</placeName>), nevertheless from <placeName>Bragdatt</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_baghdad">Baghdad</placeName>) to the island of <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>, they traffick altogether with the Larin and all along the Persian Gulf, where they take 80 larins for one Toman which is fifty Abassi’s.”<ref target="#CH1-n22">

                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>From the above it would seem that at one time Larins were extensively used in the overland routes and this would explain why some of the Persian larins were stamped at interior mints, such as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_tabriz">Tabriz</placeName>, <placeName>Sheeraz</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_qazwin">Kazvin</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_kashan">Kashan</placeName>, <placeName>Ganja</placeName>, etc. He also mentions a half-larin which no one else mentions,
<pb n="13"/>
nor have I ever seen one. His illustration shows only a larin of one prong, which is probably a regular larin divided.</p>
               <p>This loss in exchange seems to have disturbed the French travellers as de <placeName>Bazinghen</placeName> in his Dictionary<ref target="#CH1-n23">
                     <hi rend="sup">23</hi>

This difference is because the Arab princes by whom the new larins were made hold back 9 deniers per larin for seigniorage, also the old larins are more esteemed than the new.</p>

               <p>Another larin of a slightly different type bearing a strong resemblance to a cotterpin (Plate IX q and r) was made in El Hasa in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arabia">Arabia</placeName> on the western side of the Persian gulf. These are often called <placeName>Nedj</placeName> larins and if not in use today have circulated up to recent times. They have been made for several centuries and are rather common, but probably have not been made in recent years as most specimens observed are very much worn. They are of extremely base metal, and are a trifle smaller than other larins, and were apparently stamped with coin dies. The inscription, so far as I know, has not been read, nor have I ever seen a coin struck from these dies. The best account is by <persName>W. G. Palgrave</persName>

               <p>&#x93;But in Hasa we find an entirely original and a perfectly local coinage, namely, the ‘Toweelah’ or ‘long bit,’ as it is very suitably called, from its form. It consists of a small copper bar, much like a stout tack, about an inch in length, and split at one end, with the fissure slightly opened; so that it looks altogether like
<pb n="17"/>
a compressed Y. Along one of its flattened sides run a few Cufic characters, indicating the name of the Carmathian prince under whose auspices this choice production of Arab numismatics was achieved; nothing else is to be read on the Toweelah, neither date nor motto. Three of these are worth a ‘gorsh’ and accordingly every copper nail separately may equal about three farthings. This currency is available in Hasa its native place, alone, and hence the proverb, ‘Zey’ Toweelat-il-Hasa,’ ‘like a Hasa long bit,’ is often applied to a person who can make himself valuable at home. Silver and gold Toweelahs were issued in the days of Carmathian glory; but they have been long since melted down.”</p>
               <p>The Persian larins, or rather those struck by or in the names of the Safavid Shahs, are not rare. Few details have come down to us about these. They appear to have been struck at several of the regular mints stamped by regular coin dies and as stated above were probably for the overland trade, for otherwise why should we get such a far northern mint as <placeName>Ganja</placeName> (see No. 301). <persName>Olearius</persName>

The value of one is nine pence English, Poddi Tangom, or the small Tangom is half as much. There is another sort which all People by the King’s Permission may and do make. The shape is like a fish-hook, they stamp what mark or impression on it they please. The Silver is purely fine beyond pieces of Eight. For if they suspect the goodness of the Plate it is the Custom to burn the Money in the fire red hot, and so put it in water; and if it be not then purely white, it is not Currant Money. The third sort of Money is the King’s proper Coin, for none upon pain of Death may coin it. It is called a Ponnam, (probably the fanam). It is as small as a Spangle; Seventy five make a piece of Eight, or Spanish Dollar. But all sorts of Money is here very scarce; And they frequently buy and sell by exchanging Commodities.”</p>
               <p>We have already mentioned that this hoard contained the Portuguese coins and the larins, and that it was found in the region in which <persName>Knox</persName> was held captive. For us, the important part (of the testimony of <persName>Knox</persName>) is the statement regarding the
<pb n="24"/>
private manufacture of the larins and the placing of arbitrary marks on them. This accounts for the several hundred different devices found, few of which have any indications whatever of governmental stamps. In fact no mention is made anywhere that the Sinhalese kings ever issued these coins, and outside of those struck by the Captain of <placeName>Colombo</placeName>, who found competent men to make them, the Portuguese and the Dutch did not make any officially. In other words those in use on the island were either brought over in the course of trade, or were made by local private artisans.</p>
               <p>One hundred years later <persName>Fra Paolino da S. Bartolomeo</persName> (1776–1789) says:<ref target="#CH1-n54">

               <p>From the above, one might draw the conclusion that the King authorized the making of them, but he in all probability introduced their use only.</p>

of fine silver. He probably was in error about the royal striking of larins. It is interesting to note, however, what he says about their being made in various sizes and values. None in the find appear to be other than whole larins, unless Nos. 85, 86 and 155 might be three-quarters larins. I personally have never seen or heard of any fractions, except for one in the American Numismatic Society’s cabinet, which is without stamps and of small gauge wire and weighs 56½ grains. A half-larin should weigh 36 to 37 grains; and a three-quarter one 54–55½ grains. It is very doubtful if any such divisions were deliberately made. Mr. <persName>Biddell</persName> doubts it as well. He also informs me that he saw a small hoard of larins all apparently of light weight (those he weighed ran 54, 58, 60¼, 67¼ grains), which were found in a remote jungle village in <placeName>Nuwarakalāwiya</placeName>. He considered them either as a local effort, or as having been taken there by traders from more civilized regions where they had been rejected. In general appearance any of these could be taken for full larins. One would also conclude from <persName>Thunberg</persName> who seemed to have visited only the coast cities that they had ceased to circulate along the coast in the seventeen seventies.</p>
               <p>The Dutch found the larin much in evidence when they occupied the country but it gradually disappeared as a circulating medium and became a money of account in the territories they occupied. Their rating was one-fifth of a rix-dollar of 48 heavy stuivers.<ref target="#CH1-n56">

Where have the caravan-loads of them gone? Where have the chestfuls taken by the Mohammedan and European traders gone? What has become of the countless numbers once in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> where elephants loaded down with them were captured? Gradually as they ceased to be current or in demand for purposes of trade, they were melted down on account of their fine grade of silver,<ref target="#CH1-n59">

                  </ref> and the wire coin went into the round coin or into other wire, into jewelry and silver ornaments. Also in later days when they came into the hands of silversmiths and money changers they were not recognized as coins sought after and went their way into the crucible.</p>
               <p>The dies used for striking larins varied. Probably
<pb n="27"/>
on the earlier larins, which were struck by the royal authority, dies for coins were employed. This was certainly the case in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ramhurmuz">Hormuz</placeName>, El Hasa and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>. Some of the later Persian ones, as has been stated, were stamped with long narrow dies made for the purpose (see 306–308) as were the <placeName>Maldive</placeName> larins (see plate IX-k, wrongly placed here under Persian). The <placeName>Bijapur</placeName> larins were made with the same kind of dies; others of Indian provenance likewise, but the dies not as narrow.</p>
               <p>In <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>, since the larins were of private manufacture, every conceivable device for stamping was employed except dies for striking coins. Many were made from coins themselves acting as dies, as will be noticed on most of the first thirty-nine numbers and No. 309 in the catalogue. In most instances the dies were dies made for the purpose of striking larins, generally the size of the piece, sometimes a little larger. Occasionally the dies were considerably larger, such as shown in Nos. 46, 81, 117, 203, 217, 249 and 250, and were probably made for other purposes. In a few cases such as Nos. 59, 142, 148 and 149, small punches were used. In a very few instances such as Nos. 241 and 242 dies resembling coin dies were made. Naturally some of the dies were cut carefully and delicately, others roughly and crudely; some are in low and some in high relief. Certain pieces with crude shallow markings give every appearance that the dies were made by etching with acid, especially in the look of the background, and the peculiar appearance of the edges of
<pb n="28"/>
the raised parts. Nos. 144, 214, 230 and 288 to 291 are examples. I have studied them very carefully and feel convinced that they were made this way.</p>
               <p>With such a large number of larins before one it has been possible to study how they were manufactured. Being made in large quantities for a great number of years by men familiar with metal working they would naturally be fabricated in the easiest and simplest manner possible. In fact it is surprising, considering that so many different people must have made them in so many different places, that more variations of manufacture do not appear.</p>
               <p>Why should a long piece of wire doubled over at the middle be used so extensively as a piece of money? This question can be best answered if we consider a way of fashioning metal to produce easily pieces of a fairly uniform weight. All that the maker of a larin had to do was to determine what length of drawn wire of a given thickness would yield a certain weight, and consequently to cut the wire that length. According to the exactitude of the cutting would the weight be uniform.</p>
               <p>The planchets for small silver coins, such as the early Russian silver kopecks, and Persian and Bokharan silver pieces, have at times been made in this manner. It is said that in fairly recent years the Russian government asked the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_bukhara">Bokhara</placeName> mint to produce a large quantity of small silver coins and that with their meagre facilities the mint officials balked at the order unless they could first make wire and then pound out the short sections.</p>
               <pb n="29"/>
               <p>Various gauges of wire were used in the making of larins, each maker presumably having his own draw plates. The thickest piece in the hoard was about .125 inches (Plate I, 45) and the finest used was .085 inches (Plate I, 308). Consequently the pieces vary considerably in length, from two and one-half inches to five and three-sixteenth inches. The weights of these two pieces are 67 and 73½ grains respectively. It is also noticed that the same maker did not always use the same gauge wire, as pieces of the same die oftentimes vary in thickness. The majority of the pieces range between three and one-eighth and three and three-quarters inches in length before being doubled and bent.</p>
               <p>The wire was cut with a chisel and not in as exact lengths as might be as the weight of the larins, as has been noted, varies several grains. The piece of wire was then doubled over at the middle, and while held firmly by tongs so that the two portions lay one on top of the other, the piece was more or less flattened on both sides by hammer blows from the fold or very near the fold to from a quarter to three-quarters of an inch from the cut ends. The blows were so moderated that the flattening gradually diminished leaving the ends the original diameter of the wire. This was done to present a larger surface for impressing the design. Only two or three specimens show flattening for the entire length. See Nos. 247 and 209, the latter shown also on Plate I.</p>
               <p>With the wire thus prepared the piece was ready
<pb n="30"/>
for stamping. As the flattening process tended to harden the silver the pieces may or may not have been again softened by heating. When two dies were used the larins were probably struck as any coin is struck. When a single die was used for striking, the wire was apparently laid on a smooth surface and the die was held on top of the wire. When the same die was used to strike both sides two methods were employed. If the piece was doubled over before striking care was taken that the second impression did not obliterate the first impression on
<figure xml:id="fig-5">
                     <graphic url="NNM61_037.jpg"/>
                  </figure>
the other side. The majority of the pieces, where a single die did double duty, were made in another manner. The wire before being folded was partially flattened, pains being taken not to touch the two ends and the middle part of the wire, because it would otherwise be more difficult to double the flattened wire which is harder. Also, it would have a tendency to spring apart and not lie together as closely. Of the total number of larins in the find, 819 pieces, only 21, about 2½%, showed the wire flattened at the middle before folding. I have dwelt on this fact especially as the only modern
<pb n="31"/>
counterfeit larins have this part flat.<ref target="#CH1-n60">
                     <hi rend="sup">60</hi>
                  </ref> An examination of the illustrations will at once show the difference. To return; the die is then stamped on the two flattened surfaces, the wire doubled over in the middle, and either with a hammer or with the same die used again, the piece is flattened down at the fold. Some of the larins with two different dies were probably made this way as well.</p>
               <p>In regard to the pieces where coins were used as dies it would seem rather destructive to the coin, on account of the comparative softness of the metal, if the impression was made by a hammer blow. In all probability these were stamped by pressure under a lever. In fact many of the other pieces could have been thus made. With these and, in fact, any stamped from dies much larger than the larin, several could have been made at one time as we find many of the larins with impressions from various parts of the die.</p>
               <p>The final stage is the curving or bending of the larins. Only those used in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> are thus curved, those pieces made on the mainland and which did not reach <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> are straight (See Plate IX). All made in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>, or coming to the Island were at once or soon curved.<ref target="#CH1-n61">
                     <hi rend="sup">61</hi>
                  </ref> This curve took various
<pb n="32"/>
forms as shown on Plate I. With the majority, curving was carefully done as if the larins were bent over a form. Many of those not made on the island or those apparently of older make, if one can judge by the wear, were simply twisted by hand into various shapes. Mr. <persName>Biddell</persName> informs me of a village tradition related to him that the larin was curved thus for secure concealment in the hair knot.</p>
               <p>The bending naturally obscured one face of the larin so that stamping both sides was not as necessary as with the flat pieces from the mainland. Consequently we find roughly two-thirds of the strictly Sinhalese larins were struck on one side only, and with many of those struck on both sides the same die was used. Those made in imitation of Persian larins were more apt to be struck on both sides.</p>
               <p>For the most part the sides are untouched and show the natural roundness of the wire. Occasionally one finds a piece with flattened sides (see Plate I, No. 62).</p>
               <p>As will be noticed on Plate I, most pieces show one or more gashes on the side. These test cuts, for want of a better name, are apparently made by a sharp-edged chisel and sometimes cut into the wire over half its thickness. All but 73 in the hoard had these cuts, over 91%. These marks are peculiar to the Sinhalese pieces as I have never seen one of these test cuts on a straight larin. These cuts number from one to seven as a rule and are mostly on one side, about equally distributed at the fold or
<pb n="33"/>
the ends and generally at both places. I am at a loss as to their purpose. If they were made to determine the fineness of the silver, as is the general opinion, they failed on the three plated larins in the find, or else, in this case, they were put on at the time to add to the deception, as in <placeName>China</placeName> false chop marks were put on Spanish and Mexican dollars that had been filled with base metal.</p>
               <p>On a large per cent of the pieces where several cuts are on the same piece, they appear to have been made at the same time. Also, with hardly an exception they are made on certain parts of the piece only, either near the fold or at the ends. The cuts apparently had no relation to the weights. Underweight pieces had a varying number of cuts, as did also overweight pieces. Pieces from the same die do not show the same number of test cuts and occasionally show none at all. Both unworn and worn pieces showed varying numbers of chisel marks as did those made on the Island and those brought from the mainland. They apparently were not made to facilitate breaking into sections as the cuts very rarely were deep enough and also the cut or cuts near the fold would not divide the piece into equal halves. No larin in the find seemed to have been broken off at any of the end cuts, although two had been broken at one of the cuts near the fold by twisting. One might make the conclusion that in early days the cuts were made to test the silver; later on especially with the Kandyan larins they were deliberately done as a finishing off process, or as a fictitious ‘hall-mark.’</p>
               <pb n="34"/>
               <p>Sixteen pieces have counterstamps on them (see Plate IX), all at the end of one or both prongs. They fall into two classes: those countermarked with the same die that stamped the larin itself, and probably done at the time the larin was made; and those stamped with a special mark punched in at a later time by someone else, possibly as an endorsement. No group with the same stamp had more than one piece counterstamped and the greatest number of specimens showing the same mark is three. They do not appear to be official stamps and are probably, especially those of the second group, private schroff marks. One, No. 242, is stamped on the truncation with a very minute punch.</p>
               <p>Studying the weights of these larins, the conclusion is reached, independent of other evidence, that they were a trade coin and probably in large transactions went by weight. The average of those in the hoard is 71.368 gr. (4,625 grms.). This or the truer weight of 73.7 gr. conforms to no silver coin at the time and in fact to hardly any silver coin issued in the Mohammedan world, but it does conform to one of their chief units for weighing precious metals and other small articles. This was the miskal (spelled methkal, metqal, etc.), the weight of which, especially in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, was between 71 and 74 grains according to locality. <persName>Poole</persName> in the British Museum Catalogue, Coins of the Shahs of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</placeName>, gives the weight as 71.18 gr. using Hanway’s tables. The weight at Teheran was 74.1 gr., at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_al-basrah">Basra</placeName> 72 gr. and at <placeName>Mocha</placeName>

                  </ref> Individual pieces in the find differed considerably in weight, even pieces struck from the same die showed a variation of several grains. The lighter pieces show no apparent signs of being clipped. The lightest larin weighed but 50½ gr. but an analysis showed it was composed of half silver and half copper (see No. 155). Another weighed about 51 grains but its appearance was entirely different from the other larins (see No. 86). Very few weighed less than 60 grains. The majority of the pieces weighed from 64 to 76 grains, the heaviest weighing 80½ grains.</p>

               <p>Checking up on these weights we find as follows: Against the earlier weight of 78.7, eight Persian larins in the Society’s cabinet, which might fall into the class of the earlier larins show an average weight of 75.375 grains. This is a little light, but the Portuguese may have rated the larin too high. As for the other weight of 73.7 grains, the weights as deduced from the hoard tally very closely. Although the average weight of all whole specimens, good, bad and indifferent averaged only 71.368 grains, the figures arrived at from our table of 550 of the better specimens show that the private makers (for in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> they were not made by the native authorities, and undoubtedly were not supervised by governmental inspection) tried to maintain a certain fixed weight standard. This makes a good showing for the integrity of the larin makers.</p>

               <p>In the cataloguing of the pieces I have endeavored to arrange them in groups. Those bearing Devanagari or Hindi letters struck from Sinhalese coins comprise the first group (Nos. 1–19) and number about one-seventh of the whole. These pieces were not unknown but simply had not been recognized and deciphered. These have been or will be taken up more thoroughly in detail in other portions of this article. The &#x93;<hi rend="italic">setu</hi>” piece (Nos. 20 and 21), with the Tamil legend stamped from a coin, was probably made by the same person that made the other larins. Twelve pieces occur, some incuse some in relief (Nos. 22–26), with some mediaeval writing I have been unable to decipher, nor have I up to date been successful in finding any one able to interpret these. Some letters resemble Nagari, two or three might be Tamil and one or two cursive contemporary Sinhalese. These inscriptions are in all probability &#x93;imitative” and the product of Kandyan workmen.</p>
               <p>The five pieces bearing types of Portuguese coins (Nos. 27–31) and the fifteen of Dutch influence (Nos. 32–39) were undoubtedly struck by native makers simply making use of whatever material
<pb n="38"/>
was at hand. None of these as far as I can glean have been published. A piece with the word FRISIAE (Nos. 32–33) was sold to a Russian collector some years ago.</p>
               <p>A large proportion, nearly one third of the hoard (Nos. 43–162), have what appear to be designs of sorts, sometimes apparently meaningless, especially if only a small part shows. Some are, doubtless, simply crude markings without reason, sufficient to differentiate one maker’s larins from another’s. Many of the designs are undoubtedly crude attempts at letters or inscriptions. I have tried to distinguish those that appear to be ignorant copies of Persian larins, of which undoubtedly there were many examples on the Island to work from. These imitations (Nos. 163–294) amounting to about one-quarter of the find present more varieties than the previous group but for the most part are not as interesting. Many that have been given separate numbers are undoubtedly from different parts of the same die but have not sufficient markings in common to tie together. The same can be said about those bearing designs; many throughout the groups were so poorly struck, were so worn or obliterated that matching together these designs was oftentimes a most difficult task. Six pieces only bore no marks whatsoever on them, which considering their private manufacture is most unusual. They were probably accidentally unstamped as they looked as if they were made by different parties.</p>
               <pb n="39"/>
               <p>The second section of larins (Nos. 296–319) were picked out as being of continental manufacture; nearly all were of Persian origin, making a total of about 160. These showed clearly that they were stamped from dies used to strike Persian coins. Unfortunately only eleven showed enough of the significant part of the inscription to warrant identification, while 128 had to be lumped together as having insufficient identifying inscription. The wear on these showed clearly that they were older larins that had done service for many years. A noticeable fact is that none showed the mill-sail pattern of some of the early Persian coins, which have been found on larins not from this find. A small sub-class in this group were of undoubted Persian manufacture but stamped from dies made to strike larins (Nos. 306–308). Although the last group (Nos. 309–319) may or may not have been made on the Island, the first five probably were. Numbers 314–317 are most interesting and have inscriptions in part similar to the Indian larins. In the entire find only 23 were too poor to classify.</p>
               <p>In going through this large assemblage of larins I was not only much impressed by the great variety of types but that nearly every piece in the hoard was different from any that I had seen before (probably about one hundred fifty). Approximately two hundred and eighty different designs, not counting the incuse and Persian pieces, are represented in this hoard, and from the still different designs of the possibly fifty Sinhalese pieces seen elsewhere, I am
<pb n="40"/>
firmly convinced that if specimens of all of the different varieties ever made in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> could be again assembled the markings and designs on these pieces found at <placeName>Gampola</placeName> would be but a small fraction of the various devices used by the makers of larins.</p>
               <p>I wish to acknowledge both my own and the Society’s indebtedness to Dr. <persName>Casey A. Wood</persName>, the former owner of the find, through whose good counsel and encouragement the present article was consummated, and through whose generosity the largest part and the first selection of the <placeName>Gampola</placeName> hoard is now in the cabinet of The American Numismatic Society. I wish also to recognize the services rendered by Mr. <persName>John</persName> Still who was the first to envisage the importance of the hoard and who was largely instrumental in gathering it together. I also wish to acknowledge the use of many of his notes in his brief report made to Dr. <persName>Wood</persName>. To Prof. <persName>William Campbell</persName> I am indebted for the analysis of several of the pieces, and I wish also to compliment Mr. <persName>Alfred L. Howes</persName> for his careful drawings of many of the larins. I wish to express my appreciation to Mr. W. H. <persName>Biddell</persName> for much valuable help and kindly comments, as well as for the careful reading of the manuscript, and to Mr. <persName>H. W. Codrington</persName> I desire to express my gratitude for the valuable assistance given through his monumental work, <placeName>Ceylon</placeName> Coins and Currency.</p>

               <head>EXPLANATION OF PLATES</head>
               <p>Plate I shows examples of the larins viewed from the side. These were especially picked out to show the various ways they had been bent and curved. The varying thicknesses of wire can be easily seen, also the test cuts.</p>
               <p>Plates II to IX (first half) show all the different types catalogued, concluding with drawings of the counterstamps.</p>
               <p>As each variety is illustrated and shown in numerical order the plate number is not given in the text. If for any reason a piece is illustrated more than once, the additional plate number is given. When both obverse and reverse are shown, the second illustration over the number is the reverse. When the larins are struck from coins used as dies the type coins are shown. In the case of the Sinhalese coins, the intaglio or reversed impression from the whole coin which was used for the die of the larin is illustrated, as the larin may have been struck from any part of the piece. Direct photographs have been used when practicable, but when the design is on the curve, or only a part of the design shows on any one piece, drawings have been made. As the illustrations are primarily to show the evidence on each larin, the entire larin is not always shown, especially in the drawings.</p>
               <p>None of the larins on the second half of Plate IX were in the find, but are from specimens in The American Numismatic Society’s cabinet. These are shown solely to illustrate other forms used elsewhere.

All have been folded over once and have not been curved. The Indian forms (a–h) are short and thick and made of heavy wire. They were made and used along the west coast of India, especially around <placeName>Goa</placeName> and by the <persName>Adil Shahi</persName> kings of <placeName>Bijapur</placeName> in the seventeenth century. The <placeName>Bijapur</placeName> larins (f, g, h) have been described by <persName>Wilson</persName>

               <p>The Persian forms (i, j, l, m, n, o) are much longer and made of thinner wire. A most unusual piece (j) is made of very thick wire, (o) is a curiously bent piece. <placeName>The Maldive</placeName> larin (k) is of slightly different form. Through error it was placed under the Persian larins. The Arabian larins (q–r) were made at El-Hasa and are of very base metal, in fact, nearly wholly copper. They are called Toweeleh (long) and were current up to recent times. The Javanese larin (p) is found in copper and pewter and is very rare. It was made at <placeName>Batavia</placeName> in 1658 or 1660.<ref target="#CH1-n65">

               <p>Plate X illustrates the Portuguese coins in the hoard.</p>
               <p>The outside of the larin will be called the obverse, and the inside the reverse. The end doubled over will be termed the fold, and the other two ends the prongs.</p>
               <p>Following the description of the piece the number given in parentheses, thus (2), indicates the number of pieces of that type in the find. The weight of the piece follows and is given in grains.</p>

                     <p>This type with impression in relief was noted by Mr. <persName>John</persName> Still in his preliminary report on the find as possibly being of the utmost importance. It <hi rend="italic">apparently</hi> was struck from dies used in making the coins of Sahasa Malla in 1200–1202 and if this were so, would antedate by about three hundred years the approximate date for the making of the first larins. Knowing that it is most unusual to find coins struck four and a half centuries earlier than the majority of the pieces in a hoard, I have given these most careful study under a powerful glass. I have come to the conclusion that they were made at about the same time as the other pieces in the find. They also look no different than the general run of the hoard and they show no great signs of wear. Although the two best pieces show they were struck from different dies I am convinced that these dies were made for the purpose of striking larins and were not the dies for the coins of Sahasa Malla. The cutting of the characters is indecisive and has not the same style as the lettering on the earlier copper coins. The large border pellets on the coins are not pellets at all on the larins but irregular indefinite objects. Also on one of the dies the last character <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> is incorrectly made (see 1 a) and has a curved terminal sweep enclosing the char-

acter where the border pellets should be. Again on the other die (1 b) at the top there shows on each side the raised confining border of the die. I also think that if the larin were struck at the time of Sahasa Malla both obverse and reverse dies would have been used and not one die used twice.</p>

In 1640 the Dutch rated the larin at 10 stuivers and in 1655, 1661 and 1662 it was rated at the same.

                        <hi rend="bold">43.</hi> In bold relief, a design which may possibly be a word of three characters. The die was evidently made for the purpose of stamping larins.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. Blank. (30) 66–76 gr. Av. wt. 73.2 gr.</p>
                     <p>These pieces were all carefully struck at the fold with the same part of the die. The other end of the die is seldom struck up. One die only was used and all the larins are made from heavy wire. None show signs of wear and on account of the large number of them it would seem as if these were made at about the time of the burial of the hoard, and probably the owner and striker of these were the same.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">44.</hi> Very similar in die-cutting and workmanship to No. 43.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. Blank. (2) 73, 75½ gr.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Rev</hi>. Blank. (21) 72–74½ gr. Av. wt. 73.3 gr.</p>
                     <p>These pieces present the same general appearance as Nos. 43 and 44, but were not so carefully struck. The imprint on twelve pieces runs one way, and on nine the other way. None show signs of wear. These, as well as those under 43 and 44, are of a very whitish color, as if the pieces had been pickled after striking.</p>

                     <p>Many of these are very poorly and lightly struck and show signs of wear; a few pieces seem to show that the same design was repeated on the reverse.</p>

                     <p>The designs on the above larins Nos. 49–58 present a Chinese appearance, and one can easily see a resemblance to certain Chinese characters such as ta, fu and <persName>yuan.</persName> As Chinese cash were not uncommon at that time these probably furnished an inspiration to the Kandyan die cutters for new designs.</p>

                     <p>One piece has been counterstamped and one piece has had the sides flattened. Nearly all of the pieces (Nos. 296–304) are made of heavy wire and have been neatly curved as shown by the first two larins on Plate I.</p>

                     <p>These pieces are an enigma. It was at first thought that they were struck by Persian coin dies accidently on the rounded sides, as the top and bottom had been purposely flattened to receive an impression. A further examination revealed the fact that they were struck after the pieces had been curved and therefore were struck in <placeName>Ceylon</placeName>. The reason, undoubtedly, was that they escaped detection until the last moment and were then struck on the only place they could then be stamped.</p>

                     <p>A second specimen of this coin from the <placeName>Gampola</placeName> find but countermarked the <placeName>Colombo</placeName> V.O.C. monogram is in <persName>Mr. Biddell’s</persName> collection. This piece was probably struck in the latter part of the fifteenth century as the crown strongly resembles that on the gold <persName>S. Thomé</persName> of 1595, compare Aragão Pl. I, No. 1 of <persName>D. Filippe</persName> I, and Grogan in Spink’s circular, 1914 Col. 91. This crown is unlike any of the later crowns. The form of the TA

monogram is unlike any on the other issues and may be the earliest type. Mr. <persName>H. W. Codrington</persName> suggests the D. T. may stand for De <placeName>Tuticorin</placeName>. It certainly is a piece of local manufacture.</p>
