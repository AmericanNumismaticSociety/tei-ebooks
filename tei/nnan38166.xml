               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, situated in the <placeName>Saronic Gulf</placeName>, was, in the seventh century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, the great commercial island of a great commercial period. She traded with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> on the west and with the ports of the Euxine on the east. Her sailors steered boldly to all parts of the known world; from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_illyricum">Illyricum</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</placeName>; from the coasts of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_africa">Africa</placeName> and of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_gallia">Gaul</placeName> to the <placeName>Crimea</placeName>. They had instilled into them by their wandering life, and by the incessant dangers that beset them on every side, a contempt for peril and a love of the unknown. Wherever a possibility of trade showed itself, there, soon, would also be found ships from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. As a very necessary phase of her commercial life, which led her ships so far from home, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> had need of friendly ports throughout the Mediterranean world in which they
<pb n="2"/>
could be safely refitted. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that she had a sort of connection with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_pontus">Pontus</placeName>, as well as with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_panticapaeum">Panticapaeum</placeName> in the distant <placeName>Crimea</placeName>. That these commercial connections were closely intertwined, is shown by the fact that both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sinope">Sinope</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_panticapaeum">Panticapaeum</placeName>, though so distant from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> where the influence of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> was principally felt, when they first struck coins, issued them on the Aeginetan standard.<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> Like a powerhouse <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> radiated its influence throughout the ancient world. She put her wares on every market, and set an example in commerce which many countries subsequently thought well to follow.</p>
            <p>The efforts of the Aeginetans, however, were not wholly expended in roving the seas in search of trade. They were naturally great lovers of art. They built several temples in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, of which the one to Aphaea, the chief local divinity, built about 475 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, and the one to Aphrodite, the patron of all their sea exploits, built a few years earlier, are the finest. The temple to Aphaea was on the height on the
<pb n="3"/>
northeastern part of the island, while the one to Aphrodite was in the town itself. Both of these were hexastyle, that is, with six columns in front. The temple to Aphaea is the better preserved of the two, and its sculptures show remarkable ability in their conception and in their execution. From the scanty remains, and from what can be found in the ancient writings, the one to Aphrodite seems to have been the larger and the more beautiful. Both temples were built just before the development which came with <persName>Phidias</persName> and his pupils, and consequently in the statues that remain to us, we find the stiff figure and the rigid smile of archaism still persisting. The front elevation of the temple to Aphrodite has been partially restored. It is probable that the pediment was occupied by a group depicting Aphrodite speeding departing mariners. Both temples were of the Doric order.</p>
            <p>There has been much discussion as to whether <persName>Pheidon</persName>, king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_argos_argolis">Argos</placeName>, struck coins at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> and the question is still unsettled owing to the lack of evidence
<pb n="4"/>
concerning the date of <persName>Pheidon's</persName> rule. It is, however, possible to conjecture his dates with a fair amount of accuracy, by studying the passages in the ancient writings relating to that time. <persName>Herodotus</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> who, however, must not be taken too literally since he often confuses the mythical with the historical in a manner most bewildering to the seeker after truth, writing about 446 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, makes the statement that <persName>Pheidon</persName> lived <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, and that his son <persName>Leocedes</persName> was a suitor of <persName>Agariste</persName>, the daughter of <persName>Cleisthenes</persName>, king of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicyon">Sicyon</placeName>. <persName corresp="#nomisma_l_vol_l_f_strab_rrc">Strabo</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n3">

               </ref> (compiled about 900 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>) made the same statement, probably copying <persName corresp="#nomisma_l_vol_l_f_strab_rrc">Strabo</persName>. <persName>Pausaniass</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n5">

               <persName corresp="#nomisma_l_vol_l_f_strab_rrc">Strabo</persName>,
<pb n="5"/>
quoting Ephorus, places him around 758 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The Etymologicum Magnum does the same. <persName corresp="#nomisma_pausanias_abdera">Pausanias</persName> puts him <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 748 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The Parian Chronicle dates him around 850 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> As has been already intimated, the story of <persName>Herodotus</persName> seems rather undependable. This leaves but two of the dates given by the ancient authorities in which <persName>Pheidon</persName> might have lived. The bulk of evidence seems to place him at about 750 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Only the Parian Chronicle puts him as far back as the middle of the ninth century. Since <persName corresp="#nomisma_pausanias_abdera">Pausanias</persName>, a very reliable authority, and Ephorus, an entirely independent writer, give him the later date, it is very possible that that is the correct one. But even if he did live in the middle of the ninth century, instead of in the middle of the eighth, that would not affect in the least the conclusion evidently to be drawn from the statement, that he did not issue coins at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, for we know that the earliest electrum of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> Minor was not struck much before 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, and the Aeginetan coins are certainly later than these. And if he had
<pb n="6"/>
lived about 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, as <persName>Herodotus</persName> had said, that also, would not affect this conclusion, because the extremely archaic style of the earliest staters proves that they could not have been struck later than about 650 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Also, although <persName>Pheidon</persName> may have had some influence in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, it is very unlikely that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> was ever a part of his dominions.<ref target="#CH1-n6">

            <p>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, then, not slow to realize the immense superiority of coinage over all other methods of exchange and barter for her extensive commerce, struck her first coins not later than 650 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> These coins were the first to be issued in <placeName>European Greece</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> Her mariners, voyaging to all parts of the ancient world, were among the first to learn of the invention of coinage. From the coast of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> Minor the tales they brought back of its great convenience probably hastened the adoption of this new medium of exchange. Though all the early coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> Minor are electrum, none of the Aeginetan coins, even the earliest, are anything but pure silver. This may be explained by the circumstance that the Ae-
<pb n="7"/>
ginetans had much easier access to silver than to gold mines. Most of the gold of the ancient world at this time came from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greek_asia">Asia</placeName> Minor and Pæonia. There is one electrum coin in the Bibliothèque Nationale at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName>, which has sometimes been attributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. But the fabric is different, the oblong incuses are very unlike any Aeginetan reverse, and even the tortoise on the obverse is very unlike the Aeginetan. So it may safely be asserted that no gold or electrum was ever issued on the island.</p>
            <p>The standard used has been a matter of much controversy. It is called the Pheidonian because it seems certain that <persName>Pheidon</persName> either originated it or made a modification of the standard then in use in the Peloponnesus, his name becoming attached to the modified one. This has also given some weight to the theory that <persName>Pheidon</persName> struck coins at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, but at the same time it practically disproves the theory that he lived <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> There seems no good reason, however, why <persName>Pheidon</persName> might not have arranged the weights
<pb n="8"/>
and measures of the Peloponnesus in 750 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, and the Aeginetans have used those weights, the standard of their own island as well as of the Peloponnesus, when they first issued coins. And this is apparently exactly what happened. That <persName>Pheidon</persName> adjusted the measures and weights of the Peloponnesus is attested by the statements of several ancient authorities. <persName>Herodotus</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> said that he established the measures of the Peloponnesus. Ephorus<ref target="#CH1-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref> said that he invented the weights and measures called Pheidonian. <persName>Aristotle</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n10">
                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi>
               </ref> spoke of certain measures as being fixed by, and named after, <persName>Pheidon</persName>. The Parian Chronicle, also, spoke of the measures of the Peloponnesus as being adjusted by <persName>Pheidon</persName>. He apparently did not invent an entirely new system, but in a rational manner adjusted the measures, then in use, to the weights, so that a certain number of units in weight would equal a measure containing a certain quantity of water. These weights and measures became so popular on account of their convenience, that not only the Peloponnesus, but also the Aegean islands, the
<pb n="9"/>
towns of <placeName>central Greece</placeName> and even <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> used them in commerce for a long time—many, until the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n11">
                  <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Several writers have believed that the standard used for the Aeginetan coins was derived from the Euboic; others have thought it was a modification of an Egyptian gold standard. But although the stater happens to be exactly one thirty-fifth of the Euboic mina, this may be just a coincidence. We know that the Aeginetans were striving to equate their silver coins with the bronze and iron spits that had been in use before, rather than with any gold coins. Moreover it was very uncommon in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> at the time of the beginning of coinage to find cities that issued silver coins only, striking them on a gold standard. Also, seeing that these bronze spits were made on a standard so well equated with the other measures, the magistrates would not wish to court unpopularity for their coins by issuing them on a differing standard, but would employ that one which they were using for every-
<pb n="10"/>
thing else, and to which they had become accustomed.</p>
            <p>The relation between silver and bronze at that time was probably about 120 to 1. This is substantiated by the following facts: A pelanor—an iron spit used as money by the Spartans—weighed 9600 grains, (622 grams) which is exactly the weight of an Aeginetan mina of six hundred obols.<ref target="#CH1-n12">
                  <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
               </ref> Hultsch<ref target="#CH1-n13">
                  <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
               </ref> gave reasons for believing that each of these iron spits was equal in value to an obol of silver. This gives a relation between the two metals of 600 to 1. In <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> at about the same time the relation between iron and bronze was 5 to 1. This would make the ratio between bronze and silver 120 to 1. Thus an obol of silver (16 grains or 1.04 grams) would equal an obol of bronze of 1920 grains (124.4 grams). And this is just about the weight, so far as we can discover, of the bronze spits issued on the Pheidonian standard. From this we may gather that the Aeginetan coins were not issued on a foreign standard of gold or other metal, but their weights were merely
<pb n="11"/>
the continuation of a standard existing in their own island, (possibly of Mycenaean origin).</p>
            <p>The standard, as far as can be ascertained, is as follows:</p>
            <p>Didrachm or stater 12.57 gm. or 194 gr.</p>
            <p>Drachm 6.28 gm. or 97 gr.</p>
            <p>Hemidrachm or triobol 3.11 gm. or 48 gr.</p>
            <p>Diobol 2.07 gm. or 32 gr.</p>
            <p>Trihemiobol 1.55 gm. or 24 gr.</p>
            <p>Obol 1.04 gm. or 16 gr.</p>
            <p>Hemiobol 52 gm. or 8 gr.</p>
            <p>Tetartemorion 26 gm. or 4 gr.</p>
            <p>This leaves out of the calculation several unique pieces of over 200 grains. The mint-masters had no accurate means of fixing the exact weight for each individual coin. They very probably were more particular to get a certain required number of coins from each ingot of metal than to have each separate piece conform to an exact weight.</p>
            <p>As has been stated above, Aphrodite was worshipped by the Aeginetan people as a sea-goddess. She was the divinity looked upon as the one most helpful to
<pb n="12"/>
them in all their sea-going affairs. Therefore it is not surprising to find that the sea-tortoise, a creature sacred to Aphrodite,<ref target="#CH1-n14">
                  <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
               </ref> was the type placed on their first coins. <persName>Phidias</persName>, the noted sculptor, made for the people of Elis a statue of Aphrodite Urania, resting her foot on a tortoise.<ref target="#CH1-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref> The fabric of the Aeginetan coins is also uncommon. There were apparently two methods of striking coins in general use among the ancients. For one known as "Anvil striking", the reverse was let into an anvil, while the obverse die was placed in the punch. The result was very flat surfaces in the field surrounding the design on the anvil side. The other method, "Punch striking", was to let the obverse die into the anvil, and to strike the reverse with the punch, which was usually a little smaller than the blank. The result of this method was unevenly raised or concave edges on the reverse. Most of the ancient mints used the latter, or, if they began with anvil striking, changed later. The reason, seemingly, for the greater use of punch striking was that the obverse,
<pb n="13"/>
being usually more elaborate and more deeply engraved was more apt to break under strain, and thus needed the additional support of the solid anvil. But <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> was almost alone in using the anvil striking just as long as she struck silver coins.</p>
            <p>The coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> may be divided into the following periods:</p>
            <div2 xml:id="d591e562" type="section">
               <head>PERIOD I 650-600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>To be able rightly to understand the reasons for the immense circulation of the coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, one must examine her history.</p>
               <p>Tradition derives her name from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, the daughter of the river-god Asopus, who was carried off by <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q34201">Zeus</ref> to the island of <persName>Oenone</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n16">
                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                  </ref>. There was born a son named <persName>Aeacus</persName>, who later ruled over the island, which was then called <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, in honor of his mother. <persName>Aeacus</persName> was a just and impartial ruler, and, so the tradition goes, when he died he was made a judge of the under-world. A temple was dedicated to him in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. Later, many of his de-
<pb n="14"/>
scendants also were worshipped, especially <persName>Achilles</persName>.</p>
               <p>Because of her location <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> prospered and waxed more and more important. Her island situation gave her an advantage over the many malaria-infested sections of the mainland. Situated in the temperate climate of <placeName>central Greece</placeName>, while she kept the artistic ability of southern peoples, she was freed from their lazy idealism. Also, while she had a great deal of the sustained aggressiveness of northern peoples, indispensable in commerce, she was freed from their gross materialism. Her position, moreover, was the key to the entire eastern coast of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>. All of the shipborne commerce to and from the isthmus of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_corinth">Corinth</placeName> had to pass nearby. Much of the coastwise trade of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> stopped there for provisioning and refitting. These advantages contributed to the growing importance of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> in the ancient world. A glance at her history will show that her people made the most of their opportunities. Jewelry slightly later than that found in Mycenaean graves of the mainland, is cited<ref target="#CH1-n17">

as evidence of the Mycenaean culture having survived in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> for a considerable period after the mainland civilization had yielded to the invaders<ref target="#CH1-n18">

               <p>She was a member of the league of <placeName>Calauria</placeName>, a purely naval confederation, which was organized to check the piracy in the Aegean, sprung up as a result of the decay of the power of the Mycenaean princes. This league was composed of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_hermione">Hermione</placeName>, <placeName>Nauplia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_orchomenus_boeotia">Orchomenos</placeName>, <placeName>Prasiae</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_troezen">Troezen</placeName>. Her maritime importance, therefore, dates back to pre- Dorian times. Her wealth slowly but surely increased with the passing years, and about 750 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, while a member of the Eretrian league, we find that she was given an important part in the war against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_samos">Samos</placeName>, an ally of the rival Chalcidians. As her wealth increased she was enabled to fit out additional ships, so that in 650 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, about the time of the commencement of her coinage, she was one of the greatest commercial states in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, and commercially the greatest of the islands.

She was also the entrepot of the Pontic trade, later, after <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina">Aegina's</placeName> overthrow, a monopoly of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. And so, on account of her immense commerce, when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> introduced coinage as a medium whereby her mariners, citizens, and others should buy and sell goods more easily, it almost immediately became more than a local coinage.</p>
               <p>Her traders, wandering to all parts of the Mediterranean world, naturally took their own money with them, so that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina">Aegina's</placeName> "turtles" grew to be looked upon by most of the merchant cities at which her ships called, as the standard coinage. This state of affairs, besides requiring the mint at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> to strike very large quantities of coins, also prevented it from introducing any really important changes in the types through fear lest the altered types might not be as acceptable to the merchants as the former ones. This is probably the reason why there is so great a uniformity in this coinage for at least two hundred years. Whenever a coinage be-
<pb n="17"/>
comes international, this phenomenon may be observed. It is illustrated by the "Owls" of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, and by the Pegasus issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_corinth">Corinth</placeName>. The coinage seems to have been accepted as standard even after the first issuance of the Athenian "Owls", for in an inscription found in the ruins of the Heraeum of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_argos_argolis">Argos</placeName>, which enumerated the contributors to the common fund, the sums given by the various cities are counted in Aeginetan money. These cities included <placeName corresp="#nomisma_heracleia_trachinia">Heraclea</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_hypata">Hypata</placeName>, <placeName>Aechinus</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_larissa_thessaly">Larissa</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_cierium">Cierium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_phalanna">Phalanna</placeName>, all in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thessaly">Thessaly</placeName>, and Oreos in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>. The inscription dates from the time of the first successors of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-n19">

               <p>The second type is almost unique, only a few examples being known to exist. They were probably unpopular among the foreign merchants, and were immediately discontinued.

               <p>Counterstamps occur very frequently on Aeginetan coins, and their presence may be explained by no less than four theories. First—as the stamps or signets of bank-

ers or prominent merchants. Second—as the coats-of-arms of cities other than the issuing one. Third—as seals of the temples to which the coins had been brought

                  </figure>
as thank offerings. Fourth—several distinctly Aeginetan forms are taken to be some manner of mint-mark.</p>
               <p>These countermarks occur not only on
<pb n="20"/>
the coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, but on those of Elis, on the sigli of the Persian kings and on the issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> which penetrated to the Asiatic markets. Of the theories advanced above, the last is the least tenable, for any such distinction between mints would have been made in the dies themselves rather than in the coins after they had come from the dies. As for the temple-marks, as such they might be placed in the same category as the counterstamps of the bankers—but little more than a certification that the piece was of full weight and of good metal. <persName>Messrs. Hill</persName>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> and <persName>Newell</persName> incline to the first explanation—that these are the symbols of bankers or important traders, and as an offset to the second of our theories, <persName>Mr. Hill</persName> remarks that though types recognizable as being common to other cities do occur, they are more likely to be the signets of bankers from those respective cities than the imprints of the cities, though of course not necessarily so.</p>
               <p>A comparison of the counterstamps used at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> with those employed on the
<pb n="21"/>
sigli published by <persName>Mr. Hill</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n20">
                     <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
                  </ref> and with the ones used on the coins of Elis listed by <persName>Mr. Seltman</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n21">
                     <hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                  </ref> bears out to some extent the first of these theories. In the case of the Olympian issues, <persName>Mr. Seltman</persName> offers suggestions for the identification of certain of the marks, although he is careful to add that they <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have been impressed by cities, leaving open the question whether this or the banker-theory explains all of them. However, in support of the second theory, a coin with the fish counterstamp, like the fish emblem of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_psophis">Psophis</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_arcadia">Arcadia</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps">Pl.</hi> II, 4), has been cited as evidence that the Aeginetan coins were officially established as a part of the coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_psophis">Psophis</placeName>. It may be noted that the sea-turtle used as a countermark, occurs on a stater of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, on several coins of Elis, and on a sigli. With one exception (possibly two), none of the countermarks occurring in the Cilician Hoard described by <persName>Mr. Newell</persName>, occur on the Aeginetan coins so far as I have been able to examine them. Nor do any of the triskeles or tetraskeles which are frequent on the sigli, and which
<pb n="22"/>
would reasonably be accepted as marks of Lycian bankers, appear on the Aeginetan staters—which is just what one would expect. The mark "disc in a square" (Hill, No. 2) occurs in all four sources. The proportion of the forms occurring both at Olympia and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> is slight; and of the two, the Aeginetan are simpler and more primitive. There is but slight evidence against the banker-theory, if one accepts the proviso that for a like reason temples may also have counterstamped coins and that civic types such as the turtles mentioned above are probably badges of patriotic citizens rather than of the city involved.</p>

               <head>PERIOD II 600-550 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>This period saw <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina">Aegina's</placeName> prosperity and influence grow steadily. Throughout the entire Mediterranean world, her money, her ships, her sailors, were to be found. But also during this period, there was a development of that hostility to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> which slowly increased until it broke out into a war in which all of the prosperity of
<pb n="23"/>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> faded. Of course the underlying reason for this animosity was commercial rivalry, and all the incidents of the long conflict may be directly traced to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Herodotus</persName>, who often combines the fictitious with the authentic, assigns another reason for the dispute. While he is the only authority for the tale, it shows that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> were hostile even in early times, since the story would hardly have originated had not these two cities been traditional enemies. The Epidaurians who, it is said, were the original colonizers of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, had two images of their patron divinities, the one of the goddess Damia, and the other of the goddess Auxesia. These two statues were made of olive-wood, which had been obtained from the Athenians. In payment for the wood, the Athenians exacted an annual offering of animals, from the Epidaurians, to the Athenian divinities Athene Polias and Erechtheus. The Aeginetans, seemingly, were hostile to the Epidaurians, and so one night in about 570 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, some of their young men made a raid and carried off
<pb n="24"/>
the two images. The Athenians did not mind who had the statues, so long as the offerings were received regularly, and so they did nothing at first. But the Aeginetans had no intention whatever of sending offerings, and when the day set for the giving of the tribute passed by without any sign, the Athenians made an attack on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, but were repulsed. This whole incident has a mythical atmosphere, the more so, in that the Athenians were said to have been repulsed by the intervention of the images themselves, who bowed their heads and made strange sounds, so terrifying the Athenians that they were easily overpowered by the Aeginetans. Would it not, therefore, be safer to ascribe the growing hostility of these two cities to their commercial relations? The Aeginetan merchants were the natural rivals of those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, and this trade rivalry might easily have been converted into real enmity by any slight clash between the two.</p>

               <head>PERIOD III 550-456 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>During this period the relations between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> grew steadily more and more strained, until finally they broke out into open warfare. Until 488 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> there was no fighting, but up to that time both cities were slowly preparing. In 507 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thebes">Thebes</placeName> was at war with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and evidently <placeName corresp="#nomisma_thebes">Thebes</placeName> was hard pressed, for she appealed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> for assistance. But the Aeginetans, apparently, thought that the time was not yet ripe for war, and so refused to take active measures, merely sending images of the Aeacidae, sons of <persName>Aeacus</persName>, the tutelary heroes of their island, expressing the pious hope that the influence of these might help the Thebans.</p>
               <p>In 491 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> was one of the states that gave the symbols of submission (earth and water) to Persia. Commerce was, of course, the chief source of her prosperity. She had very close commercial relations with the Levant, and these would have been hurt by any break with that empire. Whatever her reasons for it may have
<pb n="27"/>
been, this defection was deeply resented by the other Greek states. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, especially, was aroused, and appealed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName> to punish this offense against all the patriotic and anti-Persian sentiments of the Greek world. <persName corresp="#nomisma_cleomenes_naucratis">Cleomenes</persName>, the co-ruler of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName> with <persName>Demaratus</persName>, crossed over to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> to arrest those responsible. This attempt proved futile, partly on account of the resistance of the Aeginetans, but principally because of the opposition of <persName>Demaratus</persName>. <persName corresp="#nomisma_cleomenes_naucratis">Cleomenes</persName>, incensed by this hostility of his colleague, persuaded Leotychides, a kinsman and enemy of <persName>Demaratus</persName>, to claim the throne, on the ground that <persName>Demaratus</persName> was the son of his mother's first husband, and not of her second, who was <persName>Ariston</persName>, the former king. The affair was brought before the Delphic oracle, and the oracle, influenced by the bribes of <persName corresp="#nomisma_cleomenes_naucratis">Cleomenes</persName>, pronounced in favor of Leotychides. Shortly after this, <persName corresp="#nomisma_cleomenes_naucratis">Cleomenes</persName> made a second attempt, and succeeded in seizing ten of the foremost citizens of the island, whom he deposited at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> as hostages. The Aeginetans, probably fear-
<pb n="28"/>
ful of <persName corresp="#nomisma_cleomenes_naucratis">Cleomenes</persName>, took no active measures towards the recovery of the hostages, or towards any retaliation. But soon afterwards, <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 488 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, <persName corresp="#nomisma_cleomenes_naucratis">Cleomenes</persName> died, and in that very year, upon the refusal of the Athenians to return the hostages, at a festival at <placeName>Sunium</placeName>, the Aeginetans avenged the seizure of their chief citizens by themselves capturing a number of Athenians. The Athenians had no intention whatever of submitting passively. They therefore plotted with Nicodromus, the leader of the democratic party at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, that he should capture the inner city at the same time as the Athenian fleet and army were attacking the outer walls of the city. The plan miscarried through a misunderstanding about the time set for the attack, and the Athenians arrived only to find the entire island prepared against them, and Nicodromus in flight. Nevertheless, the Athenians continued the reprisal, and a naval engagement took place, in which the Aeginetans were defeated. However, the war which followed was marked apparently by no further Athenian victories, and
<pb n="29"/>
the Aeginetans pressed the Athenians at every point. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> finally was placed in such an unfavorable position, that in 483 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, Themistocles was able to pass an order for building two hundred triremes out of the surplus funds of the state "For use in the war against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>". This surplus had come from the lately discovered mines at Laurium, in the southern part of Attica. It had become the custom to distribute this among the Athenian citizens but the Aeginetan danger was so serious that strong measures had to be taken. Evidently, however, these new war vessels also proved ineffective against the powerful fleet of the Aeginetans, for soon afterwards <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> invited <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> to a peace congress. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> acquiescing, the congress was held on the isthmus of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_corinth">Corinth</placeName> in 481 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is not surprising to find that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> had the best of this war, since the period 490-480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was the one in which the Aeginetans were at the height of their prosperity, and the one in which they had the actual supremacy of the seas, while the Athenians had as yet
<pb n="30"/>
only a comparatively small amount of power and resources. Peace was hastened by the fact that the old enemy Persia began at about that time a new expedition against the Greek cities. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> was forced by the other states to join them against Persia. Once committed to this course, however, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> spared no resources in helping to defeat the common enemy. It was in large part due to the Aeginetan fleet's bravery that the battle of Salamis, in 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, was won.</p>
               <p>Cimon by this time had risen to power at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, and his philolaconian policy saved <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, as a member of the Spartan league, from attack. Throughout the duration of Cimon's leadership, 481-461 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> grew slowly more and more powerful, while the strength of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> derived almost solely from commerce, had been sadly depleted by the Persian war. So that when the war, usually known as the first Peloponnesian war, broke out, (460454 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> had become by far the stronger of the two. Furthermore, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_corinth">Corinth</placeName> had to bear the brunt of the
<pb n="31"/>
fighting, since all the other states kept out of it as much as possible, feeling probably that they were not strong enough as yet to oppose <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> laid siege to the island of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, and in 456 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, the Aeginetans were forced to surrender. This ended the real autonomous existence of this island; at one time one of the most powerful in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, it was now reduced to a subject ally of her old enemy. This war, like the greater one which followed, was not between powers striving for empire, nor was it on account of racial enmities. Though the struggle began partly through commercial rivalry, it resolved itself into one between oligarchy and democracy, for at the end of the second war, all the forces ranged against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and her allies were oligarchies, and all the allies of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> were democracies.</p>

may safely be attributed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. There are two main objections to so doing. First, the reverse is punch-struck, while, as has been already said, none of the Aeginetan coins were struck in any other way but anvil-striking. The second objection is that no other silver Aeginetan coin ever had a type on the reverse so elaborate as this. In fact, with the exception of a few small coins with a dolphin on the reverse, the origin of which is also doubtful, none of the silver coins had anything but incuse patterns. <persName>Mr. Head</persName>

               <head>PERIOD IV 456-404 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Throughout this period, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> held a very subordinate position in the Mediterranean world. Her commerce had become practically non-existent, and all her oldtime monopolies, such as the Pontic trade had been taken over by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. Also, having to pay a tribute of thirty talents to her conqueror was a still further blow to the former prestige of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. After the thirty years truce was agreed upon in 445 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> covenanted to restore to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> her former autonomy, but this provision of the truce was never carried into effect, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> slowly increased her hold upon the island.</p>
               <p>In the first winter of the second Peloponnesian War, which began in 431 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> expelled the Aeginetans from the island, probably fearing that they would take advantage of their strategic position, and revolt. Even for those days, this was considered most brutal, and the indignation against the deed probably influenced several of the "doubtful" states in their
<pb n="35"/>
decision to enter the war against <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> then established a cleruchy on the island, a system of colonization adopted by the Athenians about 506 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Under its usages, conquered territory was divided equally into ten portions—one for each of the ten Athenian tribes. Each portion, in turn, was divided into small parcels, which were assigned by lot to the poorer citizens of the tribe. These men were called cleruchs, and although living in the conquered territory, often at a long distance from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, they retained their Athenian citizenship, which in turn was inherited by their sons. These, however, were obliged to present themselves at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> at the age of eighteen, and to have their names registered in their proper demes.</p>
               <p>Upon being expelled from their island, the Aeginetans appealed to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName> for aid, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName>, in return for help given her by them in the past, established them in <placeName>Thyreatis</placeName>, near the border-line between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_laconia">Laconia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_argolis">Argolis</placeName>. But even there, the hostility of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> pursued them, and in 424
<pb n="36"/>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Athenian general, <persName>Nicias</persName>, who was afterwards killed at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> in 413 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, led an expedition against them, and put a large number to death. When finally in 404 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName> emerged triumphant from the war, with the power of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> forever broken, <persName>Lysander</persName> restored the scattered and harassed remnants of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina">Aegina's</placeName> once powerful and prosperous population to the island.</p>
               <p>As regards the affairs of the island itself during the second part of this period, there is not much known. The cleruchy, of course, supported <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> in every possible way, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> was used as a naval base by that city during the greater part of the war.</p>
               <p>It has always been accepted that the coinage of the Aeginetans did not stop until their expulsion from the island in 431 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Fox, in his article in the Corolla Numismatica, places here triobols of poor workmanship, with a crescent on either obverse or reverse, or both, in which he is followed in the second edition of the Historia Numorum (cf. Pl. II, Nos. 5-8). These
<pb n="37"/>
triobols have in recent years appeared in considerable numbers, and usually when it has been possible to ascertain their provenance, it has proved to be Cretan. They appear in one hoard whose date of burial is as late as 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> which contained one of these pieces in good condition (<persName>Richard B. Seager</persName>, Numismatic Notes and Monographs, No. 23, A Cretan Coin Hoard). The turtle on these triobols is apparently an imitation of our Period VI (d), although the workmanship is noticeably cruder.</p>
               <p>In view of these circumstances, we may feel warranted in rejecting Fox's assignment of these triobols to this period, the more so that it would have been contrary to the Athenian procedure to allow the conquered Aeginetans to strike any coins. There have been discovered at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siphnos">Siphnos</placeName> and at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_smyrna">Smyrna</placeName> copies of an Athenian decree,<ref target="#CH1-n23">
                     <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                  </ref> forbidding to subjugated cities the use of any silver coinage save that of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. The decree dates from 418 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> or earlier, and was later supplemented by another tending to enforce the rule more strongly. Though the decree has a later
<pb n="38"/>
date than that of the expulsion of the Aeginetans, it seems probable that it was merely a formal announcement of a policy which had long been followed by the Athenians. There is no reason for supposing that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> would have been favored above other cities in this matter—the probabilities are that with its proximity to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, there would have been even greater strictness than with more distant "allies." <persName>Mr. E. S. G. Robinson</persName> of the British Museum is preparing a paper which will have this Crescent Series as its subject.</p>
               <p>In the period between the expulsion of the Aeginetans in 431 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and until their restoration in 404, it has been generally considered that no coins were issued either by the Aeginetans at their place of refuge, <placeName>Thyreatis</placeName>, or by the Athenian cleruchs on the island. This may be true, but there is one coin which is rather hard to place unless we concede that it is within reason that the Aeginetans at <placeName>Thyreatis</placeName>, might have struck coins. The single specimen recorded is a diobol which was at one time
<pb n="39"/>
in the Consul Weber Collection (no. 1764). The obverse is of the earlier type, i. e., sea turtle, and hence must come before 404 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> at which time the change to a land tortoise took place. The style is very similar to that on the coins minted just before 456 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>

               <p>The reverse is exceptional. As is shown by the cut it is unlike any incuse reverse struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. Also, upon comparison with the reverse on several of the smaller coins of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_argos_argolis">Argos</placeName> of about 421 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, as for example pl. xxvii, nos. 2, 4, 5, in B. M. C., the striking resemblance is immediately seen, both in the form of the incuse and in the arrangement of dots within it. As has been noted, <placeName>Thyreatis</placeName>, where the Aeginetans settled in about 431 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> is on the border of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_argolis">Argolis</placeName>, and the influence of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_argos_argolis">Argos</placeName> was naturally considerable there. If the Aeginetans issued any coins at this
<pb n="40"/>
time, the logical types would be a combination of those of their old and new homes. <persName>Mr. Head</persName> in the last edition of the Historia Numorum, places the final date of early Argive coins at 421 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, or later.</p>
               <figure xml:id="fig-004">

               </figure>
               <p>This same explanation might hold for a group of minute coins, two of which are reproduced, which seem to have another origin than <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. Though the practice of having the reverses consist of single letters or monograms was not instituted until some little time after 404 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, when the Aeginetans returned to their island, this would not preclude the coins being of Argive origin, for it was there that this practice was most common. These coins might have been issued at a date considerably later than that of the coin shown in Fig. 1—the choice of the sea-turtle type having been influenced by the comparatively recent stay of the Aeginetans in

               </head>
               <p>From the time when <persName>Lysander</persName>, that very able Spartan general, restored the scattered remnants of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina">Aegina's</placeName> population to their island, until the end of Spartan domination in 379 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, the island was used as a naval base by the Spartans. Its geographical position enabled them to keep a careful watch on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, and to thwart incipient uprisings in that city to throw off the yoke of Spartan rule. In 388 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Chabrias the noted Athenian general, defeated the Spartans at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. This does not, however, seem to have affected the Spartan rule over the island, which continued, as has been said, until 379 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, despite this fortunate position of hers in the Mediterranean world, from then on played a very unimportant part in the drama of history. Her ancient greatness was at an end, for, although she tried to regain her prosperity, her re-
<pb n="42"/>
sources had been sapped to too great a degree for any substantial recovery.</p>
               <p>There were three great reasons why <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina">Aegina's</placeName> fall was so absolutely and astoundingly complete. One was, of course, the development of the Athenian navy, which was to a great extent the deciding factor in the conquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> in the first Peloponnesian war. Another was that her commerce, the one source of her prosperity and greatness, being chiefly with the Levant, was almost completely ruined by the Persian war of 482-480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But the third reason was probably the main one, since it was the most fundamental— the fact that she depended entirely on slave labor for work of any kind. It has been estimated that there were 400,000 slaves on the island as opposed to 80,000 free men. This may be an exaggeration, but nevertheless the ratio between the slaves and the free men was very nearly as large as this. A civilization based on this corrupting and enervating system is bound to fall sooner or later. The Roman empire was undefeatable so
<pb n="43"/>
long as the citizens retained their simple and severe habits, but as soon as quantities of prisoners of war began to be brought to Rome, to be sold as slaves, and when these slaves began to be used for every type of work, the Romans grew indolent and pleasure-loving. When the barbaric hordes commenced to stream into the Roman territory, the Romans were so demoralized and so lazy that they were unable to check them, and their final doom was certain. And thus, most probably, it was with the Aeginetans, so that when misfortune overtook them, they were too effeminate and corrupt to rise above their adversities and with determination to set about bringing prosperity back to their island.</p>

               <p>No plausible explanation has as yet been put forward for this change from the sea-tortoise to a land turtle. Is it not possible that the land turtle was considered sacred either at <placeName>Thyreatis</placeName>, or at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName>, probably as the symbol of some god or goddess? If this were so, then the change in type might be explained by the desire of the Aeginetans to show gratitude to their helpers in time of need, while still retaining on their coins a type enough like the original to be accepted as genuine by the merchants of other cities. This is hardly more than a supposition, but at least it may be considered possible, and there is no other theory which seems any more so.</p>
               <p>These coins are fairly numerous, though they are not found in as many distant
<pb n="46"/>
places as the earlier staters. Their numbers show, however, that the coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> was still "standard", even while the island itself had lost its prestige. The workmanship on the obverse is far better than that on the coins before 431 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> For the first time in that long series, does the type approach anything like fine art. Even this lasted but a short while, for towards the end of the period, as shown by (c), we find decidedly careless execution.</p>
               <p>Bronze coinage appears during this period for the first time in the history of the island. One of the principal reasons for this was that all the silver for the coins came from foreign states. Upon the restoration of the inhabitants, the merchants naturally recommenced trading. But this was on not nearly so extensive a scale as formerly, chiefly because the Aeginetan ships had been almost entirely destroyed. Therefore there was much less silver coming into the island through the channels of trade. Bronze was obtainable in far greater quantities than silver, since there were many copper mines in the Peloponnesus
<pb n="47"/>
near <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>. The mint-masters, therefore, in order to strike as many staters as possible, for only these coins ever had international circulation, followed the example of the majority of the other states, impoverished by the long wars, and struck nearly all the local issues in bronze. These are the first coins to break away from the custom of placing a tortoise on the obverse. They retain, however, the usual five-compartment pattern on the reverse, a form which had become almost as familiar as the tortoise itself.</p>

               <p>The silver coinage of this period is chiefly of importance because by 320 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> or a little later, the Aeginetans ceased from coining silver. Thus these coins are the

last examples of that long line of "Tortoises", which stretched back three hundred years or more to the time when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> was in her infancy, and when the name of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was hardly known in the outside world. For three centuries these coins had been "standard" over the length and breadth of the ancient world, civilized and barbarous. But when <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> of Macedon gained ascendency over the enfeebled Greek states, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> discontinued all attempts at commerce, and, there being practically no trading, silver became unnecessary, and the mint confined itself to issuing the small bronze coins which were to form the only currency of the island until Rome stopped even this.</p>
               <p>At this time <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> followed the example of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, by placing the initials of magistrates, or mint officials on her coins. But, unlike <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, these initials were never in the form of monograms. Also, there were fewer varieties.</p>
               <p>The following are the types on the silver issues:</p>

Although she was not friendly with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, she did not participate in the revolt of some of the Greek states upon the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. This was principally because <persName>Demosthenes</persName>, the great Athenian orator, was the chief instigator of the revolution, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> had always hated <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. This revolt was called the "Lamian War", because the Greek allies at its commencement had besieged Lamia, which was being held by <persName>Antipater</persName>, regent of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>. However, <persName>Antipater</persName> conquered in the battle of Crannon, and thereby ended all further Greek resistance to Macedonian supremacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> probably joined the Achaean league, when it was at its height under the able leadership of the Sicyonian general Aratus, in 229 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But if she did, she played a small part in the wars which followed shortly with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lacedaemon">Sparta</placeName> and with the Aetolian league, for we find no mention of the numbers or conduct of her soldiers. The island finally came under the domination of Pergamum. When <persName corresp="#nomisma_seleucus_iii">Attalus III</persName>, that cruel profligate, died, instead of giv-
<pb n="53"/>
ing his half-brother the kingdom, he bequeathed it, together with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName>, to Rome. Aristonicus, his half-brother, naturally resented being deprived of his inheritance, and collecting a strong force, he captured Apollonis and Colophon in Ionia, and the island of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_samos">Samos</placeName>. He then added to his victories by defeating the pontifex maximus, <persName>P. Licinius Crassus Mucianus</persName>. However, his success was short-lived, and in 130 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Roman general <persName>Marcus Perpenna</persName> defeated and captured him. Soon afterwards he was executed. His resistance had kept the Romans busy for three years, so it was not until 130 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that they were able to take over complete control of the empire of <persName>Attalus</persName>. With that year, therefore, the coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_aegina_aegina">Aegina</placeName> ceased temporarily, for the Romans at that time allowed comparatively few of the conquered Greek cities to issue coins.</p>
               <p>Throughout this period a desultory bronze coinage was kept up. The rarity of these coins proves that very few were minted. The island was much reduced in population, and the few people that re-

mained on it were poor and not at all industrious. Therefore they did not need an abundance of coins.</p>

                  <p>When Septimius Severus assumed the imperial power, he allowed many of the
