            <p>To many persons the French Colonies include only those on the African Mediterranean coast and <placeName>Indo-China</placeName>. Few realize the extent of the colonial possessions and protectorates or the number of their varied inhabitants. In <placeName>North Africa</placeName>, <placeName>Morocco</placeName>, <placeName>Algiers</placeName> and <placeName>Tunis</placeName> comprise an enormous territory, while south and south-west of their Saharan land are the colonies of Equatorial <placeName>Africa</placeName> (or <placeName>Congo</placeName>)—<placeName>Guinea</placeName>, <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, <placeName>Dahomey</placeName> (or the kingdom of <placeName>Porto Novo</placeName>), <placeName>Ivory Coast</placeName>, <placeName>West Africa</placeName>, the <placeName>Senegals</placeName>, <placeName>Nigeria</placeName>, with <placeName>Somaliland</placeName> (or <placeName>Obock</placeName>) in the east of that great continent. South-east of <placeName>Africa</placeName> are <placeName>Madagascar</placeName>, <placeName>St. Marie</placeName> and the <placeName>Comoro Islands</placeName>, while in the far East, <placeName>Cambodia</placeName>, <placeName>Cochin-China</placeName>, <placeName>Annam</placeName>, <placeName>Laos</placeName> and <placeName>Tongking</placeName> comprise what is usually spoken of as French <placeName>Indo-China</placeName>. In addition to the above there are <placeName>Pondicherry</placeName> in <placeName>India</placeName>, the Reunion and other islands in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, such as <placeName>New Caledonia</placeName>, the Society and <placeName>Marquesas Islands</placeName>, with <placeName>Guiana</placeName>,

               <placeName>Martinique</placeName>, <placeName>Guadaloupe</placeName>, and <placeName>St. Pierre</placeName> and <placeName>Miquelon</placeName> in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
            <p>These possessions, which are practically all in the Tropics, include many millions of inhabitants—Arabs, Negroes and Asiatics; all of whom are generally so successfully ruled that they are most loyal to the French. In point of area these colonies and protectorates are twenty times as large as <placeName>France</placeName> itself and forty per cent greater than <placeName>the United States</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The nominal rulers of some of these countries have established their own Orders, Decorations and Medals of Award. Some of these have never been recognized by <placeName>France</placeName>, cannot be worn in <placeName>France</placeName> without permission, and are treated as foreign Orders. In other colonies the French authorities have established honours which are awarded only upon the approval of the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour, and these are known as Colonial Decorations. In both cases permission must be granted by the same Grand Chancellor before citizens of <placeName>France</placeName> may wear the insignia.</p>
            <p>It is the purpose of this article to treat <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Orders, Decorations and Medals of the several colonies and protectorates known, whether they have or have not been officially recognized. Before doing this it might be of interest to explain the order of precedence in the wearing of decora-

tions by French citizens. The National Order of the Legion of Honour always has first rank— over and above all other Orders of the colonies or protectorates. The following is the order:</p>

            <p>When a citizen of <placeName>France</placeName> has been awarded a foreign decoration, permission to wear it in <placeName>France</placeName> must be obtained from the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour. To obtain this, the brevet of the foreign decoration is submitted to the Chancellor, who stamps the <hi rend="italic">Visé pour Autorisation</hi> thereon, together with the number of the brevet of permission to be issued. This is called the <hi rend="italic">Brevet pour Ordres Étranger,</hi> and in it is recited the name, occupation and grade of the recipient, together with the name of the order and a reproduction thereof in colour. A small fee is charged for this registration (see the illustration of permission to wear the Royal Order of

               <placeName>Cambodia</placeName>—Pl. I). If a brevet is issued in a language other than French, a translation thereof is given by the Colonial authorities (see the brevet and translation of the Ouissam Alaouit Cherifien—Frontispiece and Pl. II).</p>
            <p>Inasmuch as the official native records of some of the orders herein described have been lost or destroyed during the many changes of government in the several colonies and protectorates, it is possible that some decorations have been omitted. All known authorities have been consulted and the best endeavor has been made to confirm all statements made.</p>

               <p>This region of <placeName>North Africa</placeName>, between <placeName>Tunis</placeName> and <placeName>Morocco</placeName>, was first occupied by the Berbers, and in the sixth century B.C. by the Carthaginians. After the Punic wars, Roman control gave it a period of remarkable prosperity. It was devastated by the Vandals, controlled successively by the Byzantines, Arabs and Turks, and in the 17th and 18th centuries became a great menace to <placeName>Southern Europe</placeName> because of the pirates who infested the coast. Early in the nineteenth century the country along the Mediterranean was subdued by the French and English and gradually came under the domination of <placeName>France</placeName>. It is now managed by a French Governor-General and has become one of the most prosperous regions in <placeName>Northern Africa</placeName>.</p>
               <p>There are no official Algerian Decorations. Those which are usually awarded in <placeName>France</placeName> are also bestowed upon the native Algerians when circumstances warrant; but there was an interesting decoration instituted by <persName>Abd-el-Kader</persName>, a rebellious Arab chieftain, well worth recording.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE SILVER HAND, or <hi rend="italic">Décoration du Chéia.</hi> This was created in November 1839 by <persName>Abd-el-Kader</persName> (1808–1883), an insurgent who for twenty years gave the French authorities
<pb n="6"/>
much trouble in the West. It was instituted two and a half years after the treaty of Tafna, the terms of which recognized his authority in <placeName>Western Algeria</placeName>. <persName>Abd-el-Kader</persName>, son of <persName>Mahi-ed-Din</persName> and <persName>Zohara</persName>, his wife, was born in <placeName>Mascara</placeName>, <placeName>Algeria</placeName>, in the year 1223 of the Hégira (1808) and was proclaimed "<placeName>Amir</placeName> of the Arabs" in the vicinity of <placeName>Oran</placeName>, November 22, 1832. For many years he was a thorn in the flesh to the French, but was finally captured and imprisoned at <placeName>Toulon</placeName>, <placeName>France</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n1">*</ref> He later became a patriotic Frenchman, and as such he died in <placeName>France</placeName>, May 26, 1883.<ref target="#CH1-n2">†</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The decoration was founded to inspire rivalry in the regular army, and was only granted for brilliant action or for great services rendered, either to the Faith or to the country. The <hi rend="italic">Chéia</hi> varies in form according to the grade, and consists of a gold or silver plaque in the centre of which are the Arabic characters, <hi rend="italic">

                  <placeName>Morocco</placeName>, the country of the Moors, consists of the Western and North-western section of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, extending westward from <placeName>Algeria</placeName> to the Atlantic Ocean and South to the Spanish protectorate of Rio de Oro. This was called Mauretania by the Romans. From the earliest times the inhabitants of this country have been troublesome to Europeans. Since 1907 <placeName>France</placeName> has had an influence in <placeName>Morocco</placeName>, which has steadily increased until in 1916 a territory larger than the State of <placeName>Texas</placeName> became a French Protectorate, save for a very small section extending from the Strait of Gibraltar to a short distance beyond <placeName>Melilla</placeName> (known as the Spanish zone), and the internationalized zone of <placeName>Tangiers</placeName>. During the French occupation there has been a steady advance; now French <placeName>Morocco</placeName> has become safe for foreigners and the inhabitants are more prosperous than ever before. Too much cannot be said in praise of the French system of Colonial government. Fez, the seat of the Moslem learning for more than one thousand years, is the Holy City of <placeName>Morocco</placeName>. The Sultan of the country is assisted and advised by a Resident-General, who is appointed by the French government.</p>

There are the usual five classes. The decoration is of the same form for all grades, but the wreath of palm leaves surmounting the star is of silver for the Chevaliers. The insignia, which varies in size according to the grade, consists of a gold star of six points superimposed on silver-faceted rays, surmounted by a wreath of two gold palm branches, tied at the bottom. In the centre is a deep red-enamelled field, bearing Arabic characters in gold, signifying "His Majesty <persName>Hafid</persName>"; this is surrounded by a white and gold circle. On the points of the star, in Arabic, is the motto, "There is no God but Allah and <persName>Mohammed</persName> is his Prophet."

The decoration is a five-pointed, ball-tipped star of gold, white-enamelled and with red edges. There are palm leaves between the points except for the fifth grade, and all are surmounted by two palm branches tied at the bottom. On the white star, in Arabic, is the motto, "There is no God but Allah and <persName>Mohammed</persName> is his Prophet."

                  <placeName>TUNIS</placeName>
               </head>
               <p>To speak of <placeName>Tunis</placeName> is to think of the Barbary States, an important part of the Mohammedan Empire. During the age of the Crusaders, this section was called the Empire of the Almoravids. The Arabs of the present day call the country <hi rend="italic">Afrikiyah,</hi> which is probably derived from the Greek word A-phriké, meaning <hi rend="italic">without cold.</hi> In the second and third centuries B.C. the country was frequently invaded by the Romans. Latin historians tell us that the Roman General, <persName>Scipio Aemelianus</persName> (the Younger Scipio), decorated his soldiers of the Legion, for heroic action, with garlands of roses. This is the first known military decoration pertaining to <placeName>Tunis</placeName>. The men of that legion were the first to enter the ramparts of <placeName>Carthage</placeName> in 146 B.C. The territory had many rulers before it came under the domination of the Turks, and since 1881 it has been a French Protectorate. During this period the inhabitants of <placeName>Tunis</placeName> have greatly prospered under the admirable system of French Government. The country is managed by a French Resident-General, though ostensibly ruled by the Bey, whose powers are limited. The title of "Bey" is hereditary; the present ruler <persName>Mohammed-en-Nasir</persName> is descended from <persName>Hussein-ben-Ali</persName> who was supposed to have been a Greek converted to Islamism in the seventeenth century.</p>
               <pb n="14"/>
               <p>The French Government does not class all of the Tunisian decorations and medals among the Colonials, but treats them the same as those of a foreign nation; special permission must first be obtained, before a citizen may wear them in <placeName>France</placeName>. The Order of Nichan Iftikhar is the only one recognized.</p>
               <p>THE NICHAN IFTIKHAR, or Order of Glory or Distinction, is the best known of the Tunisian Decorations, probably because it is the only one now awarded to foreigners. In its earlier days it was bestowed upon the officers and high dignitaries of the Husseinite realm only. Authorities differ both as to who first founded the order and the date of its creation. According to <persName>M. Henri Hugon</persName> in <hi rend="italic">Les Emblems des Beys de <placeName>Tunis</placeName>
                  </hi> (<placeName>Paris</placeName>, 1913) it was adopted in 1832 or 1834 and probably inspired by the Turkish order of the same name. He also mentions and illustrates a portrait of Comte Raffo, wearing the insignia of the Order, bearing the name of <persName>Mustapha Bey</persName> in jewels, also one of <persName>Ahmed Bey</persName>. <persName>Mustapha Bey</persName> died in 1837 and was succeeded by <persName>Ahmed Bey</persName>, who is incorrectly given as the founder by several authorities. <persName>M. Hugon</persName> also quotes the writer, <persName>El Beji el Messaoudi</persName>, who said, "It is this Bey (<persName>Mustapha</persName>) who created the Nichan Iftikhar, on which he had made in precious stones

his name, and awarded it to his minister of Foreign Affairs." Certain French and Italian authorities give credit to <persName>Ahmed Bey</persName> and fix the date as 1837 or 1844, but if <persName>M. Henri Hugon</persName> is correct the credit should be given to <persName>Mustapha Bey</persName>. In 1846 when visiting <placeName>Paris</placeName>, the Bey of <placeName>Tunis</placeName> bestowed several decorations of this order on officials in <placeName>France</placeName>. The design varied according to the rank of the one honoured; thus the idea of different grades or classes. All the insignia bore in the centre the monogram or name of the reigning Bey, usually set with diamonds or other precious stones. The number and quality of the stones vary with the rank of the one decorated. Many modifications were made in the decoration and the methods of its award between 1850 and 1882. At this later date the regulations allowed the bestowal upon foreigners and women. The Order as we know it today consists of six; grades : Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer and Chevalier of the first and second classes. The plaque of the first class is a ten-pointed silver star of alternate green and red points, resting on faceted rays. In the centre of green enamel, in Arabic characters, is the name of the reigning Bey. This is surrounded by a jeweled circle. The whole is richly studded with precious stones. The badge is a star, similar to the plaque though smaller, resting on faceted rays.
<pb n="16"/>
The arms or points are enamelled alternately red and green, and surmounted by a jeweled knot of three loops, to which is attached the suspension ring for the ribbon—light green with two narrow red stripes on each side. The reverse is plain. The officer's badge has a rosette on the ribbon and the badge of the sixth class is entirely of silver, unenamelled. Plates V and VI.</p>
               <p>The NICHAN-ED-DEM, or <hi rend="italic">Ordre du Sang</hi> (Order of the Royal Family), was reserved for members of the royal house of <persName>Hussein</persName>—the founders of the reigning dynasty of <placeName>Tunis</placeName>. This family originally came from Crete and ruled in <placeName>Tunis</placeName> from 1691. Although reserved for Husseinite princes, it has occasionally been bestowed upon the President of <placeName>France</placeName> and other high French officials. It was founded by <persName>Ahmed Bey</persName> in 1837, modified in 1855, and <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName> reorganized the Order in February, 1861 (Chaban 1277).</p>
               <p>The decoration of gold and diamonds is circular in form, having rows of diamonds terminating in twelve points, with fleurons intervening. Above this jeweled piece is a knot of gold ribbon with five loops and two ends, likewise jeweled. The reverse is plain, and the suspension ribbon is green with a double line of red on either side.</p>

               <p>THE NICHAN-EL-AHED-EL-AMAN was instituted the 22 Djoumadi II 1276 (January 16, 1860), by the Bey, <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName>, in commemoration of his confirmation (in September 1859) of the Pact of Confidence or Security, which was promulgated by his predecessor, <persName>Mohammed Bey</persName>, September 10, 1857.<ref target="#CH1-n6">*</ref> The Order is conferred only upon those ministers and generals of the army, and civilians who have rendered loyal and conspicuous services to the sovereign or the government. The insignia is a gold star of ten points, enamelled green, with trophies of arms and flags of gold and red enamel superimposed. On this is an oval medallion, surrounded by emeralds, and below is a knot of ribbon likewise jeweled. On the medallion of red enamel, in Arabic characters of gold, is the motto, "The Favour of <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName> and his Confidence 1276 (1860)." The name of <persName>Mohammed</persName> and the date of the foundation are in the extreme centre of the medallion, in emeralds, on a gold field. Each successive Bey placed his name and date similarly on the medal he issued. Surmounting the star is a green-enamelled flag on a gold staff, back of which is the suspension ring for the ribbon, which is green with two red stripes each side.</p>
               <pb n="18"/>
               <p>MEDAL FOR CRIMEA—1853. <persName>Arthur Daguin</persName>, a French writer, in <hi rend="italic">Les Decorations Français et des Protectorates</hi> (<placeName>Paris</placeName>, 1900) states that the Sultan, <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName>, created a silver medal in 1855 for the Tunisian troops taking part in the Crimean war but gives no description. No other writer mentions it. As the Tunisian troops in the Crimean war served under the Turkish commanders, it is likely that the Turkish medal for this war was given to Tunisian troops and thus confused.</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR ARAB UPRISING 1864. <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName> Bey created on the 4th Hidje 1281 (April 29, 1865) a medal for those who took part in suppressing the insurrection of the Arabs, led by <persName>Ali ben Gdahoum</persName>, in 1864. The medal was of gold for officers and of silver for the privates. It was 30 mm. in diameter, and holed for the suspension ring, while the officers' medal had a gold knot of three loops surmounting the medal. On the obverse within a wreath of laurel branches is a trophy of arms and flags. At the centre of this is a round medallion inscribed in Arabic, "Iftikhar 1281." On the reverse, within two laurel branches, is "<persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok Bey</persName>." The ribbon is green with two red stripes each side.</p>
               <pb n="19"/>
               <p>The MEDAL for the expedition against <persName>Adel Bey</persName> was created in 1867 by <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName>, of gold and silver, oval in form, 35 × 28 mm. in size. On the obverse, between a laurel and palm branch, is a representation of the insignia of Nichan-ed-Dem, below which, in Arabic, is "Iftikhar" and the date 1284 (1867). On the reverse, in Arabic, is the name of the Bey. The method of suspension and ribbon are similar to those for the previous medal.</p>
               <p>THE MEDAL OF 1881 was authorized by <persName>Ali Bey</persName> in 1882, to reward the troops who took part in the expedition of 1881 against the troublesome Arabs of the West. This was oval in form and similar to the medal of 1867, except that the reverse is inscribed in Arabic, "<persName>Ali Bey</persName> 1299" (1882). The ribbon is similar.</p>
               <p>Since the beginning of the French Protectorate and the treaties of 1881 and 1883, the Tunisian troops fighting under the tri-colour are awarded the Medaille Coloniale of the French Republic.</p>
               <p>The following Orders issued by certain of the European authorities are sometimes classed as Tunisian by writers on the subject, and are included here merely because their purposes were more or less related to <placeName>Tunis</placeName> and <placeName>North Africa</placeName>.</p>
               <pb n="20"/>
               <p>ORDER OF SAINT <persName>MARY</persName> OF <placeName>MERCY</placeName>. During the thirteenth century, the frequent invasions of the Italian, French and Spanish coasts, by the Barbarians and Moors of <placeName>Northern Africa</placeName>, caused a number of Military and Religious Orders to be established in these countries. The earliest of which we have any record was created in August 1218 by <persName>James I</persName>, king of <placeName>Aragon</placeName>, and called the Order of Our Lady of <placeName>Mercy</placeName> or the Order of Saint <persName>Mary</persName> of Merced. The object of the formation of this order was to free the Christian captives in the hands of the Moors.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Elias Ashmole</persName> states that so well did they carry out the intentions of the order that 400 Christian captives were set at liberty during the first six years. The insignia was a shield, the upper half of which bore a silver or white cross on a red field and the lower half had four vertical red lines on a white field, like the arms of <placeName>Aragon</placeName>.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE SHIP. This was created by <persName>St. Louis</persName> of <placeName>France</placeName> in 1269 when he set sail from Aigues-Mortes for <placeName>Africa</placeName>, with forty thousand men, the object being to encourage the nobility of that country to accompany him on his crusade to suppress the Mohammedans. The insignia was a collar of alternate gold scallop shells and silver interlaced double crescents connected by a gold chain. From this was suspended an
<pb n="21"/>
oval of gold bearing the figure of a ship; the shells representing the shores from which he sailed, the chained double crescents signifying the emblem of the infidels he expected to conquer. Owing to the design of the collar this is often called the Order of the Sea-shell or the Order of the Double Crescent.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF SAINT <persName>PETER</persName>. Founded in 1520 by Pope <persName>Leo X</persName>, to suppress the barbarians of <persName>Africa</persName> who infested the coasts and raided the shipping of the Mediterranean Sea. No account of the insignia is given.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF SAINT <persName>PAUL</persName> OF <placeName>ROME</placeName> was instituted in 1540 by the Pope, <persName>Paul III</persName>, for the same purpose. These two orders were at that time united, and had for their insignia an oval of gold bearing on one side the image of Saint <persName>Peter</persName> and on the other that of Saint <persName>Paul</persName>. This was suspended from a collar composed of three gold chains.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE BURGUNDIAN CROSS was founded July 22, 1535 (St. <persName>Mary Magdalene's</persName> day), by <persName>Charles V</persName>, King of <placeName>Spain</placeName> and Emperor of <placeName>Germany</placeName>, as Favine says, "at the Kingdome of <placeName>Thunis</placeName> in <placeName>Affrica</placeName>." It was to commemorate his entrance into <placeName>Tunis</placeName> after he had defeated the
<pb n="22"/>
pirate <persName>Khair-ed-Din</persName>, surnamed <persName>Barbarossa</persName>, and restored the native prince to the throne of <placeName>Tunis</placeName>.

               <p>Since 1863 the French have been interested in developing the southern coast of the West African country. In that year <placeName>Porto-Novo</placeName> became a French colony—it is sometimes called the Kingdom of <placeName>Porto-Novo</placeName>. Like many other regions on the coast of <placeName>Guinea</placeName>, there was trouble with the natives. It was not until the end of the last century that, with the assistance of the French, <persName>Toffa</persName>, the King of <placeName>Porto-Novo</placeName>, was able to rest in undisturbed possession of the land, and free from the troublesome neighboring tribes.</p>
               <p>THE ORDER OF THE BLACK STAR OF <placeName>BENIN</placeName> was instituted at <placeName>Porto-Novo</placeName>, December 1, 1889 (some writers say August 30, 1892), by King <persName>Toffa</persName> (<persName>Houenou Baba Dassi</persName>), a Royal Prince of <placeName>Dahomey</placeName>, to reward those who had assisted in making his kingdom secure. The order was recognized by the French in 1892. During the World War many foreigners received this decoration—over 280 were awarded to Americans. Why, of all the French Colonial orders, this was selected to be given them, is unknown, and inquiries on that point have been unanswered. There are five grades, Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer and Chevalier. The in-

signia is a Maltese cross enamelled white with blue edges; between the arms are rays of gold and the whole is surmounted by a green-enamelled oak and laurel wreath, to which the suspension ring is attached. On the centre of the cross is a five-pointed star of black enamel. The obverse and reverse are the same and the ribbon is light blue moiré. Plate VII.</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR <placeName>ATCHUPA</placeName>. This was created in 1890 in connection with the brilliant action on the 20th of April of that year, when the troops of <persName>Toffa</persName>, under <persName>Colonel Terrillon</persName>, were victorious at <placeName>Atchupa</placeName>, against the native pretenders to the throne. The medal is of silver, 30 mm. in diameter, having on the obverse, within a wreath of oak and laurel, the Arms of the Kingdom (a silver star in upper field with a rampant leopard beneath a palm tree in the lower field; the whole surmounted by a royal crown); above is <persName>

               <p>This small section of Eastern <placeName>Africa</placeName> in French <placeName>Somaliland</placeName>, hardly two hundred miles square, is located on the <placeName>Gulf of Tajurah</placeName>, at the Southern extremity of the Red Sea, near the <placeName>Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb</placeName>. In 1856 the French secured their first foothold in this region at <placeName>Obock</placeName>, and within the next forty years had extended their influence over several of the small Sultanates of the vicinity. One of these was the Sultanate of <placeName>Tajurah</placeName>, which came under the protection of the tri-colour by treaty of October 13, 1884.</p>
               <p>THE ORDER OF NICHAN-EL-ANOUAR of <placeName>Tajurah</placeName> was created by the Sultan and Sovereign of <placeName>Tajurah</placeName>, <persName>Homed Ben Mohammed</persName> in 1887 (some say in 1884). This was acknowledged and approved by the French Government, July 17, 1888. It was formed as a memorial of the taking of the Sultan and his people under the protection of <placeName>France</placeName>. There are the usual five classes and the decoration is a ten-pointed silver star with faceted arms, between which are ten five-pointed gold stars, surmounted by a royal crown, above which is a crescent. On a blue-enamelled central medallion is a five-pointed silver star, which is encircled by a red-enamelled band inscribed in

               </head>
               <p>This small archipelago in the Indian Ocean, North-west of <placeName>Madagascar</placeName>, was first discovered by Europeans in 1598. In 1840 <placeName>France</placeName> first assumed control over the island of <placeName>Mayotte</placeName>, and by 1886 the entire group of islands was placed under the protection of the tri-colour. There are four main islands, <placeName>Anjouan</placeName> (sometimes called <placeName>Johanna</placeName> or <placeName>N'Souani</placeName>, the island of the Hand), Great <placeName>Comoro</placeName>, <placeName>Moheli</placeName> and <placeName>Mayotte</placeName>. In addition there are numerous small islands. Each of the larger islands had its own separate Sultan or ruler, but are all now subject to the French authorities. A local tradition is that the Arabs visited these islands in the first century A.D., and that a colony of Arabs, under a chief of the family of <placeName>Anjouan</placeName>, settled on the island of that name, sent their subjects to the islands of <placeName>Mayotte</placeName>, <placeName>Moheli</placeName> and <placeName>Comoro</placeName>, and for that reason <placeName>Anjouan</placeName> has been recognized as supreme. Three of the Sultans had Orders of their own, though only that of <placeName>Anjouan</placeName> is recognized by <placeName>France</placeName>.</p>
               <p>THE ROYAL ORDER OF THE STAR OF <placeName>ANJOUAN</placeName> was founded by the Sultan <persName>Said-Abdallah</persName> in 1860, though some writers consider it earlier. It was reorganized June 18, 1892, by the Sultan <persName>Mohammed-Said-Omar</persName> and recog-

nized by the French authorities September 12, 1896. There are four grades, Chevalier, Officer, Commander and Grand Cross. The order is awarded to women as well as men for services to the Protectorate. The Chevalier's cross is silver, the officer's of gold and the other grades are silver-gilt.</p>
               <p>The insignia is an eight-pointed star, each arm being composed of eight rays; in the oval central medallion of white enamel is a gold crescent surmounted by a gold hand—the emblem of <placeName>Anjouan</placeName>—and in the upper field, in Arabic characters, "The Royal Order of the Star of <placeName>Anjouan</placeName>."

ball-tipped with gold rays in the angles. This is surmounted by a faceted gold crescent, with two green stars in the field. In the green central medallion, in Arabic, is the Sultan's monogram and, on the reverse, Arabic characters. The ribbon is light green with two narrow white stripes each side. The earlier decoration is said to have been a gilt star of five ball-tipped points with faceted rays in the angles and surmounted by a ball-tipped crescent and looped to the suspension ring by gilt cords. The crescent bore the name of the order in Arabic. The ribbon was red with a white star in the centre. Plate XI.</p>
               <p>THE ORDER OF THE STAR OF <placeName>MOHELI</placeName> was reorganized in 1888 by the Sultan of the island. No date has been found for its creation nor do we know the name of its founder. This is not recognized by the French Colonial authorities, and very little information is obtainable. There were five classes, similar to the Legion of Honour. The decoration is a six-pointed gold star, in the centre of which are two stars and a crescent. The ribbon of red bears a crescent and two stars.</p>

During the latter part of the seventeenth century and early in the eighteenth the French had settlements along the coast, but wars with the natives interfered and it was not until 1861 that the island was opened to European trade and missions. Since that time the French have taken the lead in the settlement of the island. <placeName>Madagascar</placeName> became a French protectorate in 1885 and from 1896<ref target="#CH1-n7">*</ref> has been a colony.

               <p>THE ORDER OF <persName>RANAVALO</persName>. This was probably founded by the queen, <persName>Ranavalona II</persName>, who reigned from 1868 to 1883, though no authority has been found for its creation. The decoration is a seven-pointed star,<ref target="#CH1-n8">*</ref> each point being formed of three spear heads, resting on faceted rays, and surmounted by a native crown with seven feathers superimposed, and a bird above in the suspension ring. In the oval medallion are the initials R. M. (<persName>Ranavalona Mpanjaka</persName>) on a white field which takes up three-quarters of the oval; the other quarter, the lower right side, is red. The reverse is plain and the ribbon is white save for the lower right hand section, which is red. Plate XIV.</p>

               <p>THE MEDAL OF HONOUR was created by the same authorities at the same time and intended for a lesser reward.

               <p>The territory of French <placeName>Indo-China</placeName> lies to the extreme South-east of <placeName>China</placeName>, and east of <placeName>Siam</placeName>. The earliest knowledge we have of the region is derived from the Chinese historians who mention the Annamese of 2257 B.C. The country is now divided into the colony of <placeName>Cochin-China</placeName> and the protectorates of <placeName>Annam</placeName>, <placeName>Cambodia</placeName>, <placeName>Laos</placeName> and <placeName>Tong-king</placeName>. <placeName>Cochin-China</placeName> is under the direct administration of <placeName>France</placeName> through its Lieutenant Governor, who resides at <placeName>Saigon</placeName>. In <placeName>Annam</placeName> the Emperor <persName>Bao-Dai</persName> is nominal sovereign, assisted by the French Résident-Supérieur. In <placeName>Cambodia</placeName> the king directs the native administration, assisted by a Résident-Supérieur. <placeName>Laos</placeName> has several departments, but that of <placeName>Luang-Prabang</placeName> only has a king, who is aided by a Résident-Supérieur. In <placeName>Tong-king</placeName> the Résident-Supérieur in the absence of any sectional native ruler is the sole governor.</p>
               <p>French missionaries were established in this section in the seventeenth century<ref target="#CH1-n10">*</ref> and the first treaty was made in 1787 with <persName>Gia-Long</persName>, the king of <placeName>Annam</placeName>, during the reign of <persName>Louis XVI</persName>.

In 1857 an expedition was sent out by <placeName>France</placeName>, since which time the gradual extension of control has been brought about, and from 1883 the country has been entirely under French domination. The satisfactory government of these colonies is evidenced by the loyal support of the natives during the war with <placeName>Germany</placeName>, when several hundred thousand troops and workers were sent to <placeName>France</placeName> to assist the mother-country. Many millions of francs were subscribed by them for the war loans and relief societies.</p>

Founded by the Governor-General at <placeName>Saigon</placeName>, April 30, 1900, as a reward for exceptional services rendered in agriculture, commerce, industry and the arts. It is awarded to natives and to Asiatics only, and there are three classes, gold, silver and bronze. The decoration is a ball-tipped star of six points, 55 mm. in diameter, surmounted by a suspension ring composed of two branches of laurel. In the round medallion are the words <hi rend="italic">INDOCHINE : FRANÇAISE,</hi> encircling two native characters, signifying <hi rend="italic">To make known that which is beautiful.</hi> The ribbon is bright yellow.

               </head>
               <p>This section of French <placeName>Indo-China</placeName> is a narrow strip north of <placeName>Cambodia</placeName>, south of <placeName>Tong-king</placeName> and between the mountains of <placeName>Laos</placeName> and the <placeName>China</placeName> Sea. It has a coast line of approximately nine hundred miles. The Annamese (Giao-chi) are of southern Chinese origin. Their country has frequently been overrun by the Burmese and Chinese. Toward the end of the eighteenth century, by the treaty between <persName>Gia-Long</persName> and <persName>Louis XVI</persName>, the country came under the influence of the French, and the "Kingdom of the South" has been generally prosperous as a French protectorate. The native capital and principal city, <placeName>Hué</placeName>, is famed for its old walls, temples and gardens, as well as for its monuments and other antiquities. <placeName>Hué</placeName> is also the residence of the King, whose official native title is Koang-de, or Son of Heaven. The several decorations for Annamite citizens are the Bài, or plaque, the Khánh, or gong from its shape,<ref target="#CH1-n11">*</ref> the Bôi, or oval for suspension, the Tien, or Sapèque (a native coin). The Bài was made in gold or silver and was called the Kim-Bài or Ngân-Bài, according to the metal. The
<pb n="40"/>
Khánh and the Bôi were both issued in jade, gold and silver, hence the prefix, Ngoc, for jade. The Tien, or Sapèque, was issued in gold and silver; hence it becomes the Kim-Tiên or Ngân-Tiên. All of these decorations are worn on the breast, suspended by a silk cord from the neck, and bear a tassel suspended from a hole at the bottom of the piece. With the very high awards the tassel is replaced by a string of coral beads or pearls. When two or more decorations are worn at the same time they are suspended one above the other, with the tassel or coral at the bottom.</p>
               <p>BAI or PLAQUE. This insignia has been in use in <placeName>China</placeName> and <placeName>Annam</placeName> for centuries. The earliest known were of ivory and apparently were worn as a badge of office. During the reign of <persName>Gia-Long</persName> about 1802, the Ngân-Bài, or silver plaque, is said to have been worn by members of the Co-Mat, or Secret Council, as indicative of their position. In 1824/1825 the Emperor <persName>Minh-Mang</persName> seems to have issued regulations for the wearing of the Bài rather than, as some writers have supposed, rules for its creation.</p>
               <p>At the present time the Sovereign wears a rectangular plaque, made of jade, enriched by precious stones and bearing in engraved Annamite characters, "Peace and prosperity to the Son of Heaven." Gold plaques or Kim-Bài are worn by

the members of the Royal family, the high court dignitaries, members of the Co-Mat, and are awarded to the higher French officials. The plaques are made in various shapes and sizes for all the different classes, generally oblong rectangles, though those of other wearers, like the women of the household, are oval. The material is silver, ivory, horn, ebony and lead according to the grade. On the face they bear the title of the individual wearing it, be he an official of the Palace, an officer of the army or a servant of the Royal household.

It was first known to Europeans in 1873, when the Emperor, <persName>Tu-Duc</persName>—in the twenty-sixth year of his reign—caused large gold models weighing from five to

six ounces to be made for presentation to the French admiral, then at <placeName>Hanoi</placeName>, and to other high officials.

In 1887, the second year of Dòng-Khánh, four classes with multi-coloured silk fringe were authorized for Europeans. The inscription on one side denoted the grade—on the reverse was the name of the reigning monarch. In 1892 the Emperor, <persName>Thánh-Thái</persName> (dethroned in 1907 for his excessive cruelties to the women of his household), awarded the <hi rend="italic">Kim-Khánh</hi> to Mme.

               <p>The decoration, whether in gold or jade, is of a distinctive form with scrolled edges and is decorated with dragons or flowers. Both sides are alike, save for the inscription.

               <p>The writer has three specimens of this decoration, varying in size, ornamentation and lettering, which changed with the respective reigns.</p>
               <p>KIM-BÔI (or Bô), meaning a suspended oval of gold, as Ngoc-bôi means a jade oval, was instituted in 1889 by the Emperor <persName>Thành-Thái</persName>. Prior to that time the Khánh in jade, the Bôi and Plaque in jade, had been utilized as awards of honour. <persName>Thành-Thái</persName> in the first year of his reign (1888–1907) caused the Bôi to be made in gold, silver or jade, and reserved it for women. Formerly the jade bôi had been given to men as well as women. The decoration is an oval with scrolls and dragons on the edges, and in the medallion, <hi rend="italic">

               <p>When made in <placeName>Annam</placeName> the decorations of Kim-Bôi and of Kim-Khánh are of two sheets of pure gold soldered together. When made in <placeName>France</placeName> they are usually of silver, gold plated.</p>
               <p>SAPÈQUE D'ONNEUR or KIM-TIÊN. Little is known of the origin of this decoration, although, like the Khánh, it has long existed. Whenever it was to be awarded it was made in gold by order of the monarch. In the thirteenth year of <persName>Minh-Mang</persName> (1832) one thousand Kim-Tiên were ordered to be made. It was awarded to Mandarins, to the military, and to foreigners for exceptional services, and to Princes and to Princesses on their becoming of age. There are four classes; all bear on one side the name of the reigning Emperor. The other side varies. The highest class has a rampant dragon with two native characters, <hi rend="italic">Long-Văn</hi> ("ornament of dragons"), in the centre.

Owing to the fact that a decoration of the period of 1832 was awarded in 1916 (and is in the writer's collection with the brevet), it would appear that all of the twenty thousand ordered in 1832 have not yet been awarded.

               <p>THE MILITARY MEDAL OF <placeName>ANNAM</placeName>.

The decoration is a round silver-gilt medal, with a dragon's head and claws at the top, surmounted by two crossed swords of native type. On the obverse, between branches of oak and laurel, are native characters, denoting "Protectorate of <placeName>Annam</placeName> and <placeName>Tongking</placeName>. Valour and Discipline." The reverse is similar, with the inscription in French. The ribbon is yellow, edged with blue, and has two Annamite characters in the yellow centre.</p>

               <p>PLAQUE OF HONOUR. This was instituted in 1863 by the Emperor, <persName>Tu-Duc</persName>, in the sixteenth year of his reign and awarded to those who assisted in the great famine of that period. The decoration is a thin silver oval plate 79 × 62 mm. and 13.5 grains in weight, bearing in the centre native characters <hi rend="italic">LAC GUYÊN NGAI DÂN</hi>, "For lavish generosity in the help of the people." The pin-point impressions on the edge indicate the weight of the piece.<ref target="#CH1-n17">*</ref> Plate XXIII.</p>
               <p>MEDAL OF MERIT. This was issued during the epoch of <persName>Minh-Mang</persName> (1820–1840), and, as its name indicates, was probably awarded to the troops and civilians for exceptional services, though the writers on the subject say little about it. It is a thin oblong silver plaque, 64 × 50 mm., bearing in the centre Thuong Cong—signifying Reward of Merit. The pin-point impressions on the edge indicate the weight of the piece.<ref target="#CH1-n18">†</ref>

               <p>THE IMPERIAL ORDER OF THE DRAGON was adopted at <placeName>Hué</placeName>, the capital, March 14, 1886 ("the ninth day of the second month of the first year of his reign "), by the Emperor <persName>Dòng-Khánh</persName>, as a reward for civil and military

service to the Emperor<ref target="#CH1-n19">*</ref> or the Protectorate, and is sometimes conferred on women. It is the only Annamite Order which is recognized by <placeName>France</placeName> and was approved by the decrees of May 31, 1896, and of July 12, 1897. Like the other recognized Colonial Orders, it is under the control of the Minister of Colonies and the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour. There are five classes, Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer and Chevalier, and the decorations are 70 mm., 60 mm., and 40 mm. in size, according to the grade. The decoration is a star of eight points formed of forty faceted rays and surmounted by an imperial crown, above which is a green-enamelled dragon. In the oval medallion of light-blue enamel are native characters in gold, <hi rend="italic">DONG-KHANH-HOANG-DÉ</hi>, and Annamite heraldic rays, representing the sun, surround these characters. The reverse is plain and the decoration, the same for civilians and military, is of gold for all grades except that of Chevalier, which is of silver. The ribbon is green bordered with orange for civilians and white edged with orange for military members. The plaque is 90 mm. in size, with a superimposed enamelled dragon holding the centre of the medallion. Plates XXIV and XXV.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The Southern section of French <placeName>Indo-China</placeName> is called Cambodge by the French and Sroc-Khmer by the natives. During the fifth century A.D., the Khmers, of Hindu origin, occupied the country and built many cities and monuments, notably those of Angkor-Thom and Angkor-Vat. The European name for <placeName>Cambodia</placeName> is probably derived from the Hindu, <hi rend="italic">Kambu</hi>, the traditional founder of the Khmer clan. From the fourteenth to the end of the seventeenth century, the country was continuously at war with the Chinese from the North. The Annamese predominated in the population and controlled the country until the nineteenth century. After the French occupation of <placeName>Annam</placeName>, the King of <placeName>Cambodia</placeName>, <persName>Norodom I</persName>, fearing the encroachment of <placeName>Siam</placeName>, concluded a treaty with <placeName>France</placeName> on August 11, 1863. Since that time the country has been a protectorate of <placeName>France</placeName>, under a Résident-Supérieur. The present native ruler is King <persName>Monivong</persName>, whose capital is <placeName>Pnomh-Penh</placeName>, on the Mekong River.</p>
               <p>THE ROYAL ORDER OF <placeName>CAMBODIA</placeName> was founded February 8, 1864, by the king, <persName>Norodom I</persName> (1835–1904), to reward civil and military services. There are the usual five classes, Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer and

Chevalier. Foreigners are also given the decoration. The star of the chevalier is of silver; all others are of gold. The insignia is an eight-pointed faceted star of forty-eight rays surmounted by a royal crown. On the centre, within a red-enamelled band, is a light blue medallion on which in relief are the arms of the kingdom in gold; at the bottom are two vases, one above the other, surmounted by a Cambodian royal crown of seven tiers. On these are superimposed the sacred swords of <hi rend="italic">Phra-Khan</hi>, believed to have been given originally by Indra, the god of the air, to an early king of <placeName>Cambodia</placeName>. Flames are in the field.</p>
               <p>The reverse of the star is plain. The ribbon is red, edged with green, when the order is conferred by the Cambodian government, and with this ribbon a French citizen can wear the decoration in <placeName>Cambodia</placeName> only. When the order is conferred by the French authorities the ribbon is white, edged with orange; this change was effected by a decree of December 5, 1899. Plate XXVI.</p>
               <p>MEDAL OF THE ROYAL ORDER OF <placeName>CAMBODIA</placeName>. This is issued in gold, silver and bronze and awarded for services not warranting the Royal Order. It is 32 mm. in diameter, having on the obverse, within an oak and laurel wreath, <hi rend="italic">

The ribbon has three equal stripes of red, yellow and light blue. This medal is often called the Military Medal of <persName>Norodom I</persName>.</p>
               <p>MEDAL OF <persName>SISOWATH</persName> was founded in 1904 when <persName>Sisowath</persName> became King of <placeName>Cambodia</placeName>, upon the death of his brother, <persName>Norodom I</persName>. It is 32 mm. in diameter, and surmounted by a Cambodian royal crown. On the obverse, within an oak and laurel wreath, is <persName>

                  </persName>, with rays above and below. On the reverse is the arms of the kingdom and the title of the king in native characters. The ribbon is of three equal stripes, red, yellow and purple. It is awarded to the military, as well as to civilians, for services to the kingdom. Plate XXVII.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">MONI-SERPAHON</hi>, or Palmes of <placeName>Cambodia</placeName>, was founded by King <persName>Sisowath</persName> in July, 1906, as a reward to teachers, artists and authors. It is modelled after the French <hi rend="italic">Palmes Universitaires.</hi> The decoration consists of silver-gilt palm and laurel branches—in the centre is an urn with flowers and a knot of ribbon. Obverse and reverse are the same. The ribbon is bright yellow. Plate XXVII.</p>

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">SOWATHARA</hi>, or ORDER OF AGRICULTURAL MERIT, was created June 18, 1923, by royal ordinance, and approved by a decree of the Résident-Supérieur of <placeName>France</placeName>, of July 3, 1923. It is to reward and honour agriculturalists of <placeName>Cambodia</placeName> and had three classes, Commander, Officer and Chevalier. The decoration is a four-armed cross, each arm composed of five rays, in the angles of which are bunches of wheat, cotton, palm and rice paddy. In the green-enamelled medallion is a gold representation of the three-towered temple of Angkor—the ancient capital of the country—surrounded by a gold circle. The cross is surmounted by a figure of the native earth-goddess, and is suspended by a green ribbon. Plate XXVIII.</p>
               <p>The temple of Angkor-Vat was built in the city of <placeName>Angkor-Thom</placeName> (<placeName>Angkorthe Great</placeName>) by the Khmers, who came to this region from <placeName>Burma</placeName> and the Northeast, early in the Christian era. Apparently they were in the fullness of their power from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, and were surplanted in the fifteenth century.</p>

The country is inhabited by semi-civilized tribes and a mixed population from the surrounding regions. <placeName>Viengchan</placeName> (<placeName>Vientaine</placeName>) became the French capital of <placeName>Laos</placeName>, while the principal native city is <placeName>Luang-Prabang</placeName> (Kingdom of the Divine <persName>Buddha</persName>), in the province of the same name.

               </p>
               <p>THE ORDER OF A MILLION ELEPHANTS or THE WHITE PARASOL. For eight years or more this order has been awarded to natives and foreigners by the King of <placeName>Luang-Prabang</placeName>, though no information is available as to who created it, the date, or the reason for its award. The decoration is composed of three white-enamelled heads of elephants, below which is a peacock's spread tail, and above are four oval shields and a royal native crown. Surmounting this on a scroll inscribed with native characters is the name of the order. The ribbon is bright red with two narrow gold stripes and an angular scroll design on each side.
