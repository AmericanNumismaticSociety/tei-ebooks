            <p>To many persons the French Colonies include only those on the African Mediterranean coast and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q185682">Indo-China</placeName>. Few realize the extent of the colonial possessions and protectorates or the number of their varied inhabitants. In <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729887">North Africa</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2507480">Algiers</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName> comprise an enormous territory, while south and south-west of their Saharan land are the colonies of Equatorial <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</placeName> (or <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q265319">Congo</placeName>)—<placeName corresp="#geonames_2420477">Guinea</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q508014">Sudan</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q468814">Dahomey</placeName> (or the kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2392087">Porto Novo</placeName>), <placeName corresp="#geonames_2287781">Ivory Coast</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729885">West Africa</placeName>, the <placeName corresp="#geonames_2245662">Senegals</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2328926">Nigeria</placeName>, with <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q333126">Somaliland</placeName> (or <placeName corresp="#geonames_221525">Obock</placeName>) in the east of that great continent. South-east of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</placeName> are <placeName corresp="#geonames_1062947">Madagascar</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_1057213">St. Marie</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_921930">Comoro Islands</placeName>, while in the far East, <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q505503">Cochin-China</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1155895">Annam</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_1655842">Laos</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q622778">Tongking</placeName> comprise what is usually spoken of as French <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q185682">Indo-China</placeName>. In addition to the above there are <placeName corresp="#geonames_1259425">Pondicherry</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_1269750">India</placeName>, the Reunion and other islands in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, such as <placeName corresp="#geonames_2139685">New Caledonia</placeName>, the Society and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4019991">Marquesas Islands</placeName>, with <placeName corresp="#geonames_3381670">Guiana</placeName>,

            <p>These possessions, which are practically all in the Tropics, include many millions of inhabitants—Arabs, Negroes and Asiatics; all of whom are generally so successfully ruled that they are most loyal to the French. In point of area these colonies and protectorates are twenty times as large as <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> itself and forty per cent greater than <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">the United States</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The nominal rulers of some of these countries have established their own Orders, Decorations and Medals of Award. Some of these have never been recognized by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, cannot be worn in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> without permission, and are treated as foreign Orders. In other colonies the French authorities have established honours which are awarded only upon the approval of the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour, and these are known as Colonial Decorations. In both cases permission must be granted by the same Grand Chancellor before citizens of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> may wear the insignia.</p>
            <p>It is the purpose of this article to treat <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Orders, Decorations and Medals of the several colonies and protectorates known, whether they have or have not been officially recognized. Before doing this it might be of interest to explain the order of precedence in the wearing of decora-

            <p>When a citizen of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> has been awarded a foreign decoration, permission to wear it in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> must be obtained from the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour. To obtain this, the brevet of the foreign decoration is submitted to the Chancellor, who stamps the <hi rend="italic">Visé pour Autorisation</hi> thereon, together with the number of the brevet of permission to be issued. This is called the <hi rend="italic">Brevet pour Ordres Étranger,</hi> and in it is recited the name, occupation and grade of the recipient, together with the name of the order and a reproduction thereof in colour. A small fee is charged for this registration (see the illustration of permission to wear the Royal Order of

               <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName>—Pl. I). If a brevet is issued in a language other than French, a translation thereof is given by the Colonial authorities (see the brevet and translation of the Ouissam Alaouit Cherifien—Frontispiece and Pl. II).</p>
            <p>Inasmuch as the official native records of some of the orders herein described have been lost or destroyed during the many changes of government in the several colonies and protectorates, it is possible that some decorations have been omitted. All known authorities have been consulted and the best endeavor has been made to confirm all statements made.</p>

               <p>This region of <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729887">North Africa</placeName>, between <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</placeName>, was first occupied by the Berbers, and in the sixth century B.C. by the Carthaginians. After the Punic wars, Roman control gave it a period of remarkable prosperity. It was devastated by the Vandals, controlled successively by the Byzantines, Arabs and Turks, and in the 17th and 18th centuries became a great menace to <placeName corresp="#geonames_9408658">Southern Europe</placeName> because of the pirates who infested the coast. Early in the nineteenth century the country along the Mediterranean was subdued by the French and English and gradually came under the domination of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. It is now managed by a French Governor-General and has become one of the most prosperous regions in <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729887">Northern Africa</placeName>.</p>
               <p>There are no official Algerian Decorations. Those which are usually awarded in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> are also bestowed upon the native Algerians when circumstances warrant; but there was an interesting decoration instituted by <persName corresp="#viaf_90053837">Abd-el-Kader</persName>, a rebellious Arab chieftain, well worth recording.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE SILVER HAND, or <hi rend="italic">Décoration du Chéia.</hi> This was created in November 1839 by <persName corresp="#viaf_90053837">Abd-el-Kader</persName> (1808–1883), an insurgent who for twenty years gave the French authorities

For many years he was a thorn in the flesh to the French, but was finally captured and imprisoned at <placeName corresp="#geonames_2972328">Toulon</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>.<ref target="#CH1-n1">*</ref> He later became a patriotic Frenchman, and as such he died in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, May 26, 1883.<ref target="#CH1-n2">†</ref>

               <p>The decoration was founded to inspire rivalry in the regular army, and was only granted for brilliant action or for great services rendered, either to the Faith or to the country. The <hi rend="italic">Chéia</hi> varies in form according to the grade, and consists of a gold or silver plaque in the centre of which are the Arabic characters, <hi rend="italic">

                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</placeName>, the country of the Moors, consists of the Western and North-western section of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</placeName>, extending westward from <placeName corresp="#geonames_2589581">Algeria</placeName> to the Atlantic Ocean and South to the Spanish protectorate of Rio de Oro. This was called Mauretania by the Romans. From the earliest times the inhabitants of this country have been troublesome to Europeans. Since 1907 <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> has had an influence in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</placeName>, which has steadily increased until in 1916 a territory larger than the State of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_antonio_texas">Texas</placeName> became a French Protectorate, save for a very small section extending from the Strait of Gibraltar to a short distance beyond <placeName corresp="#geonames_6362988">Melilla</placeName> (known as the Spanish zone), and the internationalized zone of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2530333">Tangiers</placeName>. During the French occupation there has been a steady advance; now French <placeName corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</placeName> has become safe for foreigners and the inhabitants are more prosperous than ever before. Too much cannot be said in praise of the French system of Colonial government. Fez, the seat of the Moslem learning for more than one thousand years, is the Holy City of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</placeName>. The Sultan of the country is assisted and advised by a Resident-General, who is appointed by the French government.</p>

               <p>THE ORDER OF NICHAN-HAFIDIEN (or <hi rend="italic">Ouissam Hafidien)</hi> was founded August 7, 1910, by the Sultan <persName corresp="#viaf_39231260">Moulay-Hafid</persName>,<ref target="#CH1-n4">*</ref> who had been proclaimed Sultan in 1908 and who abdicated in 1912. There are the usual five classes. The decoration is of the same form for all grades, but the wreath of palm leaves surmounting the star is of silver for the Chevaliers. The insignia, which varies in size according to the grade, consists of a gold star of six points superimposed on silver-faceted rays, surmounted by a wreath of two gold palm branches, tied at the bottom. In the centre is a deep red-enamelled field, bearing Arabic characters in gold, signifying "His Majesty <persName>Hafid</persName>"; this is surrounded by a white and gold circle. On the points of the star, in Arabic, is the motto, "There is no God but Allah and <persName>Mohammed</persName> is his Prophet." The reverse is plain and the ribbon is red, with a white stripe on each side. Plate III.</p>

The decoration is a five-pointed, ball-tipped star of gold, white-enamelled and with red edges. There are palm leaves between the points except for the fifth grade, and all are surmounted by two palm branches tied at the bottom. On the white star, in Arabic, is the motto, "There is no God but Allah and <persName>Mohammed</persName> is his Prophet." In the centre medallion of red enamel, in gold Arabic letters, is "His Majesty <persName>Youssef</persName>." On the reverse in a field of gold is a red enamelled Cherifien umbrella. The plaque is an enlargement of the obverse of the Cross superimposed on five faceted rays. The ribbon is light orange in colour. Plate III.</p>

               <p>To speak of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName> is to think of the Barbary States, an important part of the Mohammedan Empire. During the age of the Crusaders, this section was called the Empire of the Almoravids. The Arabs of the present day call the country <hi rend="italic">Afrikiyah,</hi> which is probably derived from the Greek word A-phriké, meaning <hi rend="italic">without cold.</hi> In the second and third centuries B.C. the country was frequently invaded by the Romans. Latin historians tell us that the Roman General, <persName>Scipio Aemelianus</persName> (the Younger Scipio), decorated his soldiers of the Legion, for heroic action, with garlands of roses. This is the first known military decoration pertaining to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName>. The men of that legion were the first to enter the ramparts of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carthage">Carthage</placeName> in 146 B.C. The territory had many rulers before it came under the domination of the Turks, and since 1881 it has been a French Protectorate. During this period the inhabitants of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName> have greatly prospered under the admirable system of French Government. The country is managed by a French Resident-General, though ostensibly ruled by the Bey, whose powers are limited. The title of "Bey" is hereditary; the present ruler <persName>Mohammed-en-Nasir</persName> is descended from <persName>Hussein-ben-Ali</persName> who was supposed to have been a Greek converted to Islamism in the seventeenth century.</p>

               <p>The French Government does not class all of the Tunisian decorations and medals among the Colonials, but treats them the same as those of a foreign nation; special permission must first be obtained, before a citizen may wear them in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. The Order of Nichan Iftikhar is the only one recognized.</p>
               <p>THE NICHAN IFTIKHAR, or Order of Glory or Distinction, is the best known of the Tunisian Decorations, probably because it is the only one now awarded to foreigners. In its earlier days it was bestowed upon the officers and high dignitaries of the Husseinite realm only. Authorities differ both as to who first founded the order and the date of its creation. According to <persName>M. Henri Hugon</persName> in <hi rend="italic">Les Emblems des Beys de <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName>
                  </hi> (<placeName corresp="#geonames_2968815">Paris</placeName>, 1913) it was adopted in 1832 or 1834 and probably inspired by the Turkish order of the same name. He also mentions and illustrates a portrait of Comte Raffo, wearing the insignia of the Order, bearing the name of <persName>Mustapha Bey</persName> in jewels, also one of <persName>Ahmed Bey</persName>. <persName>Mustapha Bey</persName> died in 1837 and was succeeded by <persName>Ahmed Bey</persName>, who is incorrectly given as the founder by several authorities. <persName>M. Hugon</persName> also quotes the writer, <persName>El Beji el Messaoudi</persName>, who said, "It is this Bey (<persName>Mustapha</persName>) who created the Nichan Iftikhar, on which he had made in precious stones

his name, and awarded it to his minister of Foreign Affairs." Certain French and Italian authorities give credit to <persName>Ahmed Bey</persName> and fix the date as 1837 or 1844, but if <persName>M. Henri Hugon</persName> is correct the credit should be given to <persName>Mustapha Bey</persName>. In 1846 when visiting <placeName corresp="#geonames_2968815">Paris</placeName>, the Bey of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName> bestowed several decorations of this order on officials in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. The design varied according to the rank of the one honoured; thus the idea of different grades or classes. All the insignia bore in the centre the monogram or name of the reigning Bey, usually set with diamonds or other precious stones. The number and quality of the stones vary with the rank of the one decorated. Many modifications were made in the decoration and the methods of its award between 1850 and 1882. At this later date the regulations allowed the bestowal upon foreigners and women. The Order as we know it today consists of six; grades : Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer and Chevalier of the first and second classes. The plaque of the first class is a ten-pointed silver star of alternate green and red points, resting on faceted rays. In the centre of green enamel, in Arabic characters, is the name of the reigning Bey. This is surrounded by a jeweled circle. The whole is richly studded with precious stones. The badge is a star, similar to the plaque though smaller, resting on faceted rays.
<pb n="16"/>
The arms or points are enamelled alternately red and green, and surmounted by a jeweled knot of three loops, to which is attached the suspension ring for the ribbon—light green with two narrow red stripes on each side. The reverse is plain. The officer's badge has a rosette on the ribbon and the badge of the sixth class is entirely of silver, unenamelled. Plates V and VI.</p>
               <p>The NICHAN-ED-DEM, or <hi rend="italic">Ordre du Sang</hi> (Order of the Royal Family), was reserved for members of the royal house of <persName>Hussein</persName>—the founders of the reigning dynasty of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName>. This family originally came from Crete and ruled in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName> from 1691. Although reserved for Husseinite princes, it has occasionally been bestowed upon the President of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> and other high French officials. It was founded by <persName>Ahmed Bey</persName> in 1837, modified in 1855, and <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName> reorganized the Order in February, 1861 (Chaban 1277).</p>
               <p>The decoration of gold and diamonds is circular in form, having rows of diamonds terminating in twelve points, with fleurons intervening. Above this jeweled piece is a knot of gold ribbon with five loops and two ends, likewise jeweled. The reverse is plain, and the suspension ribbon is green with a double line of red on either side.</p>

The insignia is a gold star of ten points, enamelled green, with trophies of arms and flags of gold and red enamel superimposed. On this is an oval medallion, surrounded by emeralds, and below is a knot of ribbon likewise jeweled. On the medallion of red enamel, in Arabic characters of gold, is the motto, "The Favour of <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName> and his Confidence 1276 (1860)." The name of <persName>Mohammed</persName> and the date of the foundation are in the extreme centre of the medallion, in emeralds, on a gold field. Each successive Bey placed his name and date similarly on the medal he issued. Surmounting the star is a green-enamelled flag on a gold staff, back of which is the suspension ring for the ribbon, which is green with two red stripes each side.</p>

               <p>MEDAL FOR CRIMEA—1853. <persName corresp="#viaf_12439307">Arthur Daguin</persName>, a French writer, in <hi rend="italic">Les Decorations Français et des Protectorates</hi> (<placeName corresp="#geonames_2968815">Paris</placeName>, 1900) states that the Sultan, <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName>, created a silver medal in 1855 for the Tunisian troops taking part in the Crimean war but gives no description. No other writer mentions it. As the Tunisian troops in the Crimean war served under the Turkish commanders, it is likely that the Turkish medal for this war was given to Tunisian troops and thus confused.</p>
               <p>MEDAL FOR ARAB UPRISING 1864. <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName> Bey created on the 4th Hidje 1281 (April 29, 1865) a medal for those who took part in suppressing the insurrection of the Arabs, led by <persName>Ali ben Gdahoum</persName>, in 1864. The medal was of gold for officers and of silver for the privates. It was 30 mm. in diameter, and holed for the suspension ring, while the officers' medal had a gold knot of three loops surmounting the medal. On the obverse within a wreath of laurel branches is a trophy of arms and flags. At the centre of this is a round medallion inscribed in Arabic, "Iftikhar 1281." On the reverse, within two laurel branches, is "<persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok Bey</persName>." The ribbon is green with two red stripes each side.</p>
               <pb n="19"/>
               <p>The MEDAL for the expedition against <persName>Adel Bey</persName> was created in 1867 by <persName>Mohammed-es-Sadok</persName>, of gold and silver, oval in form, 35 × 28 mm. in size. On the obverse, between a laurel and palm branch, is a representation of the insignia of Nichan-ed-Dem, below which, in Arabic, is "Iftikhar" and the date 1284 (1867). On the reverse, in Arabic, is the name of the Bey. The method of suspension and ribbon are similar to those for the previous medal.</p>
               <p>THE MEDAL OF 1881 was authorized by <persName>Ali Bey</persName> in 1882, to reward the troops who took part in the expedition of 1881 against the troublesome Arabs of the West. This was oval in form and similar to the medal of 1867, except that the reverse is inscribed in Arabic, "<persName>Ali Bey</persName> 1299" (1882). The ribbon is similar.</p>
               <p>Since the beginning of the French Protectorate and the treaties of 1881 and 1883, the Tunisian troops fighting under the tri-colour are awarded the Medaille Coloniale of the French Republic.</p>
               <p>The following Orders issued by certain of the European authorities are sometimes classed as Tunisian by writers on the subject, and are included here merely because their purposes were more or less related to <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Tunis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729887">North Africa</placeName>.</p>

               <p>ORDER OF SAINT <persName>MARY</persName> OF MERCY. During the thirteenth century, the frequent invasions of the Italian, French and Spanish coasts, by the Barbarians and Moors of <placeName corresp="#geonames_7729887">Northern Africa</placeName>, caused a number of Military and Religious Orders to be established in these countries. The earliest of which we have any record was created in August 1218 by <persName>James I</persName>, king of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>, and called the Order of Our Lady of Mercy or the Order of Saint <persName>Mary</persName> of Merced. The object of the formation of this order was to free the Christian captives in the hands of the Moors.</p>

                  <persName corresp="#viaf_27215170">Elias Ashmole</persName> states that so well did they carry out the intentions of the order that 400 Christian captives were set at liberty during the first six years. The insignia was a shield, the upper half of which bore a silver or white cross on a red field and the lower half had four vertical red lines on a white field, like the arms of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3336899">Aragon</placeName>.</p>

The insignia was a collar of alternate gold scallop shells and silver interlaced double crescents connected by a gold chain. From this was suspended an

oval of gold bearing the figure of a ship; the shells representing the shores from which he sailed, the chained double crescents signifying the emblem of the infidels he expected to conquer. Owing to the design of the collar this is often called the Order of the Sea-shell or the Order of the Double Crescent.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF SAINT <persName>PETER</persName>. Founded in 1520 by Pope <persName corresp="#viaf_96579640">Leo X</persName>, to suppress the barbarians of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</placeName> who infested the coasts and raided the shipping of the Mediterranean Sea.

               <p>ORDER OF SAINT <persName>PAUL</persName> OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_3169070">ROME</placeName> was instituted in 1540 by the Pope, <persName>Paul III</persName>, for the same purpose. These two orders were at that time united, and had for their insignia an oval of gold bearing on one side the image of Saint <persName>Peter</persName> and on the other that of Saint <persName>Paul</persName>. This was suspended from a collar composed of three gold chains.</p>
               <p>ORDER OF THE BURGUNDIAN CROSS was founded July 22, 1535 (St. <persName>Mary Magdalene's</persName> day), by <persName>Charles V</persName>, King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</placeName> and Emperor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, as Favine says, "at the Kingdome of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2464470">Thunis</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255146">Affrica</placeName>."

In that year <placeName corresp="#geonames_2392087">Porto-Novo</placeName> became a French colony—it is sometimes called the Kingdom of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2392087">Porto-Novo</placeName>.

The order was recognized by the French in 1892. During the World War many foreigners received this decoration—over 280 were awarded to Americans. Why, of all the French Colonial orders, this was selected to be given them, is unknown, and inquiries on that point have been unanswered. There are five grades, Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer and Chevalier. The in-

               <p>THE MEDAL FOR <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q468814">DAHOMEY</placeName>, 1892. Following the troubles of 1892, with <persName corresp="#viaf_69739830">Behanzin</persName> the pretender to the throne of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q468814">Dahomey</placeName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_73211499">Toffa</persName> created a medal to reward those taking part in the campaign under General Dodds. It is of silver or bronze, 30 mm. in diameter, having at the obverse centre the crowned arms of the Kingdom, above which in relief is <persName>TOFFA ROI</persName>. Below are two laurel wreaths. The reverse, which is plain, has in relief <hi rend="italic">CAMPAGNE / DU / <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q468814">DAHOMEY</placeName> 1892</hi>. A variant of this medal has only the words <persName>TOFFA / ROI</persName> on the obverse, between two branches of oak and laurel. The ribbon is green with three vertical white stripes.</p>
               <p>Another medal for Service, in the writer's collection, has on the obverse, within a wreath of oak and laurel branches, <persName>TOFFA ROI,</persName> and on the reverse the crowned arms of the Kingdom encircled by the inscription <hi rend="italic">ROYAUME DE <placeName corresp="#geonames_2392087">PORTO NOVO.</placeName>

In 1856 the French secured their first foothold in this region at <placeName corresp="#geonames_221525">Obock</placeName>, and within the next forty years had extended their influence over several of the small Sultanates of the vicinity. One of these was the Sultanate of <placeName corresp="#geonames_220782">Tajurah</placeName>, which came under the protection of the tri-colour by treaty of October 13, 1884.</p>
               <p>THE ORDER OF NICHAN-EL-ANOUAR of <placeName corresp="#geonames_220782">Tajurah</placeName> was created by the Sultan and Sovereign of <placeName corresp="#geonames_220782">Tajurah</placeName>, <persName>Homed Ben Mohammed</persName> in 1887 (some say in 1884). This was acknowledged and approved by the French Government, July 17, 1888. It was formed as a memorial of the taking of the Sultan and his people under the protection of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>. There are the usual five classes and the decoration is a ten-pointed silver star with faceted arms, between which are ten five-pointed gold stars, surmounted by a royal crown, above which is a crescent.

               <p>This small archipelago in the Indian Ocean, North-west of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1062947">Madagascar</placeName>, was first discovered by Europeans in 1598. In 1840 <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> first assumed control over the island of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1024031">Mayotte</placeName>, and by 1886 the entire group of islands was placed under the protection of the tri-colour. There are four main islands, <placeName corresp="#geonames_922000">Anjouan</placeName> (sometimes called Johanna or N'Souani, the island of the Hand), Great <placeName corresp="#geonames_921930">Comoro</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_921780">Moheli</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_1024031">Mayotte</placeName>. In addition there are numerous small islands. Each of the larger islands had its own separate Sultan or ruler, but are all now subject to the French authorities. A local tradition is that the Arabs visited these islands in the first century A.D., and that a colony of Arabs, under a chief of the family of <placeName corresp="#geonames_922000">Anjouan</placeName>, settled on the island of that name, sent their subjects to the islands of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1024031">Mayotte</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_921780">Moheli</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_921930">Comoro</placeName>, and for that reason <placeName corresp="#geonames_922000">Anjouan</placeName> has been recognized as supreme. Three of the Sultans had Orders of their own, though only that of <placeName corresp="#geonames_922000">Anjouan</placeName> is recognized by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>.</p>

nized by the French authorities September 12, 1896. There are four grades, Chevalier, Officer, Commander and Grand Cross. The order is awarded to women as well as men for services to the Protectorate. The Chevalier's cross is silver, the officer's of gold and the other grades are silver-gilt.</p>
               <p>The insignia is an eight-pointed star, each arm being composed of eight rays; in the oval central medallion of white enamel is a gold crescent surmounted by a gold hand—the emblem of <placeName corresp="#geonames_922000">Anjouan</placeName>—and in the upper field, in Arabic characters, "The Royal Order of the Star of <placeName corresp="#geonames_922000">Anjouan</placeName>."

ball-tipped with gold rays in the angles. This is surmounted by a faceted gold crescent, with two green stars in the field. In the green central medallion, in Arabic, is the Sultan's monogram and, on the reverse, Arabic characters. The ribbon is light green with two narrow white stripes each side. The earlier decoration is said to have been a gilt star of five ball-tipped points with faceted rays in the angles and surmounted by a ball-tipped crescent and looped to the suspension ring by gilt cords. The crescent bore the name of the order in Arabic. The ribbon was red with a white star in the centre. Plate XI.</p>
               <p>THE ORDER OF THE STAR OF <placeName corresp="#geonames_921780">MOHELI</placeName> was reorganized in 1888 by the Sultan of the island. No date has been found for its creation nor do we know the name of its founder. This is not recognized by the French Colonial authorities, and very little information is obtainable. There were five classes, similar to the Legion of Honour. The decoration is a six-pointed gold star, in the centre of which are two stars and a crescent.

During the latter part of the seventeenth century and early in the eighteenth the French had settlements along the coast, but wars with the natives interfered and it was not until 1861 that the island was opened to European trade and missions.

The earliest knowledge we have of the region is derived from the Chinese historians who mention the Annamese of 2257 B.C. The country is now divided into the colony of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q505503">Cochin-China</placeName> and the protectorates of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1155895">Annam</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_1655842">Laos</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q622778">Tong-king</placeName>. <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q505503">Cochin-China</placeName> is under the direct administration of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> through its Lieutenant Governor, who resides at <placeName corresp="#geonames_1566083">Saigon</placeName>. In <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1155895">Annam</placeName> the Emperor <persName>Bao-Dai</persName> is nominal sovereign, assisted by the French Résident-Supérieur.

In 1857 an expedition was sent out by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, since which time the gradual extension of control has been brought about, and from 1883 the country has been entirely under French domination. The satisfactory government of these colonies is evidenced by the loyal support of the natives during the war with <placeName corresp="#geonames_2921044">Germany</placeName>, when several hundred thousand troops and workers were sent to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> to assist the mother-country.

               <p>This section of French <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q185682">Indo-China</placeName> is a narrow strip north of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName>, south of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q622778">Tong-king</placeName> and between the mountains of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1655842">Laos</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q29520">China</placeName> Sea. It has a coast line of approximately nine hundred miles. The Annamese (Giao-chi) are of southern Chinese origin. Their country has frequently been overrun by the Burmese and Chinese. Toward the end of the eighteenth century, by the treaty between <persName corresp="#viaf_162630835">Gia-Long</persName> and <persName corresp="#viaf_212882453">Louis XVI</persName>, the country came under the influence of the French, and the "Kingdom of the South" has been generally prosperous as a French protectorate. The native capital and principal city, <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q36167">Hué</placeName>, is famed for its old walls, temples and gardens, as well as for its monuments and other antiquities. <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q36167">Hué</placeName> is also the residence of the King, whose official native title is Koang-de, or Son of Heaven. The several decorations for Annamite citizens are the Bài, or plaque, the Khánh, or gong from its shape,<ref target="#CH1-n11">*</ref> the Bôi, or oval for suspension, the Tien, or Sapèque (a native coin). The Bài was made in gold or silver and was called the Kim-Bài or Ngân-Bài, according to the metal. The
<pb n="40"/>
Khánh and the Bôi were both issued in jade, gold and silver, hence the prefix, Ngoc, for jade. The Tien, or Sapèque, was issued in gold and silver; hence it becomes the Kim-Tiên or Ngân-Tiên. All of these decorations are worn on the breast, suspended by a silk cord from the neck, and bear a tassel suspended from a hole at the bottom of the piece. With the very high awards the tassel is replaced by a string of coral beads or pearls. When two or more decorations are worn at the same time they are suspended one above the other, with the tassel or coral at the bottom.</p>
               <p>BAI or PLAQUE. This insignia has been in use in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q29520">China</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1155895">Annam</placeName> for centuries. The earliest known were of ivory and apparently were worn as a badge of office. During the reign of <persName corresp="#viaf_162630835">Gia-Long</persName> about 1802, the Ngân-Bài, or silver plaque, is said to have been worn by members of the Co-Mat, or Secret Council, as indicative of their position. In 1824/1825 the Emperor <persName corresp="#viaf_65097519">Minh-Mang</persName> seems to have issued regulations for the wearing of the Bài rather than, as some writers have supposed, rules for its creation.</p>
               <p>At the present time the Sovereign wears a rectangular plaque, made of jade, enriched by precious stones and bearing in engraved Annamite characters, "Peace and prosperity to the Son of Heaven." Gold plaques or Kim-Bài are worn by

the members of the Royal family, the high court dignitaries, members of the Co-Mat, and are awarded to the higher French officials. The plaques are made in various shapes and sizes for all the different classes, generally oblong rectangles, though those of other wearers, like the women of the household, are oval. The material is silver, ivory, horn, ebony and lead according to the grade. On the face they bear the title of the individual wearing it, be he an official of the Palace, an officer of the army or a servant of the Royal household.

               <p>The decoration, whether in gold or jade, is of a distinctive form with scrolled edges and is decorated with dragons or flowers. Both sides are alike, save for the inscription. The illustration, Plate XVIII, has on the obverse <hi rend="italic">DAI-NAM-HOÀNG-DÊ-SAC-TÚ</hi>, signifying "Given by his Majesty <persName>Hoang-De</persName> the Emperor of Great <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1155895">Annam</placeName>," and on the reverse <hi rend="italic">NHUT HANG KIM-KHÁNH</hi>, signifying "Kim-Khánh of the First Class." The hole at the top is for the silk neck cord; that at the bottom for the silk fringe or tassel, which is of violet, old gold and red, all held together by native knots.</p>
               <p>The writer has three specimens of this decoration, varying in size, ornamentation and lettering, which changed with the respective reigns.</p>
               <p>KIM-BÔI (or Bô), meaning a suspended oval of gold, as Ngoc-bôi means a jade oval, was instituted in 1889 by the Emperor <persName>Thành-Thái</persName>.

               <p>When made in <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1155895">Annam</placeName> the decorations of Kim-Bôi and of Kim-Khánh are of two sheets of pure gold soldered together. When made in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> they are usually of silver, gold plated.</p>
               <p>SAPÈQUE D'ONNEUR or KIM-TIÊN. Little is known of the origin of this decoration, although, like the Khánh, it has long existed.

In the thirteenth year of <persName corresp="#viaf_65097519">Minh-Mang</persName> (1832) one thousand Kim-Tiên were ordered to be made. It was awarded to Mandarins, to the military, and to foreigners for exceptional services, and to Princes and to Princesses on their becoming of age. There are four classes; all bear on one side the name of the reigning Emperor. The other side varies. The highest class has a rampant dragon with two native characters, <hi rend="italic">Long-Văn</hi> ("ornament of dragons"), in the centre.

acters on each side.

               <p>PLAQUE OF HONOUR. This was instituted in 1863 by the Emperor, <persName>Tu-Duc</persName>, in the sixteenth year of his reign and awarded to those who assisted in the great famine of that period. The decoration is a thin silver oval plate 79 × 62 mm. and 13.5 grains in weight, bearing in the centre native characters <hi rend="italic">LAC GUYÊN NGAI DÂN</hi>, "For lavish generosity in the help of the people." The pin-point impressions on the edge indicate the weight of the piece.<ref target="#CH1-n17">*</ref> Plate XXIII.</p>

This was issued during the epoch of <persName corresp="#viaf_65097519">Minh-Mang</persName> (1820–1840), and, as its name indicates, was probably awarded to the troops and civilians for exceptional services, though the writers on the subject say little about it.

It is the only Annamite Order which is recognized by <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> and was approved by the decrees of May 31, 1896, and of July 12, 1897. Like the other recognized Colonial Orders, it is under the control of the Minister of Colonies and the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour. There are five classes, Grand Cross, Grand Officer, Commander, Officer and Chevalier, and the decorations are 70 mm., 60 mm., and 40 mm. in size, according to the grade. The decoration is a star of eight points formed of forty faceted rays and surmounted by an imperial crown, above which is a green-enamelled dragon. In the oval medallion of light-blue enamel are native characters in gold, <hi rend="italic">DONG-KHANH-HOANG-DÉ</hi>, and Annamite heraldic rays, representing the sun, surround these characters. The reverse is plain and the decoration, the same for civilians and military, is of gold for all grades except that of Chevalier, which is of silver. The ribbon is green bordered with orange for civilians and white edged with orange for military members. The plaque is 90 mm. in size, with a superimposed enamelled dragon holding the centre of the medallion. Plates XXIV and XXV.</p>

               <p>The Southern section of French <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q185682">Indo-China</placeName> is called Cambodge by the French and Sroc-Khmer by the natives. During the fifth century A.D., the Khmers, of Hindu origin, occupied the country and built many cities and monuments, notably those of Angkor-Thom and Angkor-Vat. The European name for <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName> is probably derived from the Hindu, <hi rend="italic">Kambu</hi>, the traditional founder of the Khmer clan. From the fourteenth to the end of the seventeenth century, the country was continuously at war with the Chinese from the North. The Annamese predominated in the population and controlled the country until the nineteenth century. After the French occupation of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1155895">Annam</placeName>, the King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName>, <persName corresp="#viaf_13956146">Norodom I</persName>, fearing the encroachment of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1605651">Siam</placeName>, concluded a treaty with <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> on August 11, 1863.

The insignia is an eight-pointed faceted star of forty-eight rays surmounted by a royal crown. On the centre, within a red-enamelled band, is a light blue medallion on which in relief are the arms of the kingdom in gold; at the bottom are two vases, one above the other, surmounted by a Cambodian royal crown of seven tiers. On these are superimposed the sacred swords of <hi rend="italic">Phra-Khan</hi>, believed to have been given originally by Indra, the god of the air, to an early king of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName>. Flames are in the field.</p>
               <p>The reverse of the star is plain. The ribbon is red, edged with green, when the order is conferred by the Cambodian government, and with this ribbon a French citizen can wear the decoration in <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName> only. When the order is conferred by the French authorities the ribbon is white, edged with orange; this change was effected by a decree of December 5, 1899. Plate XXVI.</p>

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">SOWATHARA</hi>, or ORDER OF AGRICULTURAL MERIT, was created June 18, 1923, by royal ordinance, and approved by a decree of the Résident-Supérieur of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName>, of July 3, 1923. It is to reward and honour agriculturalists of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831722">Cambodia</placeName> and had three classes, Commander, Officer and Chevalier. The decoration is a four-armed cross, each arm composed of five rays, in the angles of which are bunches of wheat, cotton, palm and rice paddy. In the green-enamelled medallion is a gold representation of the three-towered temple of Angkor—the ancient capital of the country—surrounded by a gold circle. The cross is surmounted by a figure of the native earth-goddess, and is suspended by a green ribbon. Plate XXVIII.</p>
               <p>The temple of Angkor-Vat was built in the city of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1831949">Angkor-Thom</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#geonames_1831948">Angkorthe Great</placeName>) by the Khmers, who came to this region from <placeName corresp="#geonames_1327865">Burma</placeName> and the Northeast, early in the Christian era. Apparently they were in the fullness of their power from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, and were surplanted in the fifteenth century.</p>

               <p>Part of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1655842">Laos</placeName> is in <placeName corresp="#geonames_1605651">Siam</placeName> and part in French <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q185682">Indo-China</placeName>. The latter was largely ceded by <placeName corresp="#geonames_1605651">Siam</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3017382">France</placeName> in 1893. The region west of <placeName corresp="#wikidata_Q1155895">Annam</placeName> and North and Northeast of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1605651">Siam</placeName> has been a protectorate since that date. The country is inhabited by semi-civilized tribes and a mixed population from the surrounding regions. <placeName corresp="#geonames_1651944">Viengchan</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#geonames_1651944">Vientaine</placeName>) became the French capital of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1655842">Laos</placeName>, while the principal native city is <placeName corresp="#geonames_1655559">Luang-Prabang</placeName> (Kingdom of the Divine <persName corresp="#viaf_259214648">Buddha</persName>), in the province of the same name.

               </p>
               <p>THE ORDER OF A MILLION ELEPHANTS or THE WHITE PARASOL. For eight years or more this order has been awarded to natives and foreigners by the King of <placeName corresp="#geonames_1655559">Luang-Prabang</placeName>, though no information is available as to who created it, the date, or the reason for its award. The decoration is composed of three white-enamelled heads of elephants, below which is a peacock's spread tail, and above are four oval shields and a royal native crown. Surmounting this on a scroll inscribed with native characters is the name of the order. The ribbon is bright red with two narrow gold stripes and an angular scroll design on each side. Plate XXIX.</p>
