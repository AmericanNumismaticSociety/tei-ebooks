            </head>
            <p>A hoard of ninety-two silver coins, all covered with a thick purplish incrustation, recently came into my collection from a European dealer. The
               coins were cleaned with considerable difficulty;<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </ref> the Euboean stater, no. 1 in the catalogue, resisted every effort to remove the incrustation; two Athenian tetradrachms (nos. 79 and 80,
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI) have been left uncleaned to aid the identification of other coins which originally belonged with this
               hoard, if there be any such. The dealer said that he had bought the coins from a peasant who claimed that he had seen them dug up on the slopes
               of <placeName>Mt. Ocha</placeName>, above the modern <placeName>Carysto</placeName> (after 1833 called <placeName>Othonupolis</placeName> and now
                  <placeName>Palaechora</placeName>) and that this constituted the total collection. I have been unable to get any further information about the
               precise spot on <placeName>Mt. Ocha</placeName>, whether they were found in a grave or near the primitive temple mentioned below. It is certain,
               however, in view of contents of the hoard, that they came from the site of the ancient <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName>. This is the fourth hoard<ref target="#CH1-n2">

               under Boeotian and then Macedonian influence. After the expedition of <persName>Timotheus</persName> in 357, the Athenians were reinstated at
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName>, but by 350 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> was detached
               from the Athenian alliance, the tyrants in the various cities being, in the main, adherents of the Macedonian party. By 338 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> was under Macedonian domination along with the rest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>.

               her reasons for starting an issue of coinage and then stopping it, all these things are unanswered questions, since she was a rather unimportant
               city-state and did little to change <pb n="4"/> the course of history. In fact, the whole of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> never played a very large part in the affairs of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, after the early
               period, and had no historian to give that island immortality; therefore there must be considerable conjecture in any attempt at explanation of

               tetradrachms, and three, drachmas of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>; and the last one is a rare tetradrachm of

               placed after the Euboean drachmas, although they were probably contemporaneous. This actually disturbs the order very little and serves to leave
               the Euboean coins, the most important group in the hoard, together in the catalogue.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Milne</persName> in his <hi rend="italic">Greek and Roman Coinage</hi> (pp. 92–97) discusses the differences between two main classes
               of hoards, domestic and mercantile, which in summary form are as follows. Mercantile hoards are predominantly local with no preference for
               staters; they may contain a marked proportion of worn coins (the contents of the till) or of freshly minted pieces (cash drawn for a definite
               purpose). Domestic hoards normally contain the best coins in circulation and the largest denominations readily available. The proportion of badly
               worn coins is smaller than in casual finds representing ordinary currency. Many domestic hoards contain earlier worn pieces and then fresh ones,
               indicating the time that the hoard was started and its subsequent growth. Such hoards are only accumulated when economic conditions are fairly
               stable. If there has been depreciation of the currency, the operation of <persName>Gresham's</persName> law (which <persName>Gresham</persName>
               did not invent) makes the "best" coins in circulation the older heavier ones; consequently the appearance of the coins in a domestic hoard is
               dependent on financial and economic conditions.</p>
            <p>Further differences in the two types of hoard, not mentioned by <persName>Milne</persName> , must also be considered. A mercantile hoard can be
               presumed to contain a large proportion of currency in common use at a given moment when some circumstance prompted the secretion of the money. In
               such a case comparative wear would give an indication of comparative dating of the coins, but an indication merely, since it is obviously
               impossible to trace the wanderings of an individual coin, <pb n="6"/> and since foreign coins would tend to show more wear than local ones. Take
               for instance the hoard from Siphnos published by <persName>Newell</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n25">
                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
               </ref> which contained, among others, seventeen Athenian coins all but one of which (a tetradrachm) were much more worn than the coins of Siphnos
               itself, which were at least as early as, if not earlier than, the Athenian pieces. The Siphnos hoard, like the one under discussion, is neither
               clearly mercantile according to <persName>Milne's</persName> definition nor clearly domestic. Indeed it is unlikely that most hoards can be so
               sharply delineated unless they appear in recognizable contexts in the course of excavations. However, a domestic hoard, the "proverbial
               stocking," to quote <persName>Milne</persName> , would contain coins covering a greater range of years (cf. for example the third, fourth and
               fifth Dura hoards, the last of which ranges in date from 49–20 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. to 256–7 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d</hi>.)<ref target="#CH1-n26">
                  <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
               </ref> and of varying degrees of wear, depending (a) upon the financial condition of the country or city — i.e. whether or not there was a
               depreciation of the currency at any time, (b) upon the financial condition of the hoarder, and (c) upon whether the coin was of local or foreign
               origin. Obviously a comparatively poor person would save whatever coin he could: a drachma or a tetrobol might well mean considerable scrimping;
               a wealthier person could exercise some discrimination in what coins he saved. Therefore, to argue from wear on hoard coins it must be
               demonstrated either that all the coins were withdrawn from circulation at once and stored away, and a distinction made between local and foreign
               currency, or that the hoarder had a historical rather than a financial interest in the coins. If he had two pieces of equal value, he may be
               supposed to have put away the better looking, if it weighed more. It seems fallacious to assume that the thrifty souls of antiquity, whose
               savings we come upon from time to time, were coin collectors in the modern sense, seeking to possess only the most beautiful of coins. This is
               not to say they were not cognizant of beauty: who would dare say that of a <orgName type="ethnic">Greek</orgName> ? But, in a domestic hoard,
               even more than in <pb n="7"/> a mercantile one, cash value, or bullion value, that is weight, is to be taken as the determining factor in the
               selection of coins to be saved.</p>
            <p>Our hoard has more characteristics of the domestic than of the mercantile hoard. Of the ninety-two coins fifty-one are staters or tetradrachms;
               forty-one are drachmas. Sixteen pieces are not of the island and of the remaining seventy-six, thirty are not of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName>. <persName>Milne's</persName> statement that such a hoard contains "normally the best coins
               in circulation and the largest denominations readily available" is not at all restrictive. We have no way of knowing what are normally the best
               coins in circulation; in city states where the mint operated somewhat fitfully, the best coins of the year preceding an issue by the mint would
               not be in such good condition as the best coins in a year in which the mint operated. The "largest denomination readily available" would depend
               more on the financial condition of the hoarder than on the coins in circulation. The fact that this hoard ranges in date from the end of the
               fifth century to the second half of the third and contains but ninety-two coins is clear proof that it was not the saving of a wealthy family.
               Surely private financial and economic considerations determined the deposition of each coin in the hoard. It is, indeed, rather surprising, but
               not impossible, that the family savings were kept more or less intact over so long a period of time, although of course there is no way of
               knowing how often some coins were withdrawn to meet an emergency.</p>
            <p>Disregarding the "foreign" coins in the hoard, the seventy-six Euboean pieces show signs of wear which preclude the possibility of judging
               relative chronology from wear. The Euboean stater, no. 1, is in very good condition; it might even be described as fine. It is the earliest coin
               in the hoard and obviously saw little circulation before being put away. Of the thirty-seven Carystian staters, 6% are very worn, 17% are worn
               and 40% are somewhat worn. The chart shows the distribution of the three groups of Carystian staters (see below for the classification), the
               Carystian drachmas and the Euboean drachmas, with symbols and without. In summary form these are the figures:</p>
            <pb n="8"/>
            <p>Carystian staters: 6% very worn; 17% worn; 40% somewhat worn.</p>
            <p>Carystian drachmas: 12% very worn; 62% worn; 25% somewhat worn.</p>
            <p>Euboean drachmas: 17% worn; 60% somewhat worn.</p>
            <p>So we see nearly all the Carystian drachmas not well preserved; 77% of the Euboean drachmas more than slightly worn; 63% of the Carystian staters
               more than slightly worn.</p>

            <p>The pattern which emerges in the staters shows that those with the short form of the ethnic (Group I, the earliest issue) include 47% in slightly
               worn, or better, condition, while the other two later groups have no specimen as good as some of those in Group I. This is a contradiction of
                  <persName>Milne's</persName> statement that the early coins of a domestic hoard are more worn than the later entrants into it, a contradiction
               whose force is enhanced by the Euboean stater no. 1; on the other <pb n="9"/> hand, the very small proportion of very worn coins (6%), as well as
               the number of staters in contrast to the Carystian drachmas, do not allow the term mercantile to be applied to this hoard. It must be concluded
               that the period during which the early staters were struck, or perhaps a few more years, was a period of comparative prosperity for the family,
               when they were able to put away twenty-five staters. This is confirmed by the dies, since there is evidence of heavy striking in this series;
               surely private prosperity is in most cases at least closely associated with civic prosperity. If large numbers of these coins appeared on the
               market in quick succession, it must have been at a time of considerable prosperity when the family could save a large proportion of its income.
               The later staters were struck more lightly, for there are fewer die links; the inference is that times were less prosperous and there was less
               money in circulation; the family was able to save fewer and these in poorer condition.</p>
            <p>Moreover, without considering the possible application of <persName>Gresham's</persName> law that good money tends to be driven out of
               circulation by bad, it is revealing to note that the 'somewhat worn' staters have a high average weight.</p>

            <p>There can be no question but that the weight of the coin was the determining factor in its entrance into the hoard. Ancient methods of minting
               being what they were, it is not surprising that a person interested in putting away as much value as possible would lay more <pb n="10"/> stress
               on weight than on appearance. Groups II and III do not show so clearly the importance of weight as a determining factor (their small number, 12,
               makes them less valuable as evidence), but they do show that it is not always the earliest coin that is the most worn. There can be no question
               about the chronological order of these Groups of staters: fabric, style and technique all combine to place Group I sometime about 377–371 and the
               other two Groups at least as late as 323, if not 313.</p>
            <p>Turning to the other large group of coins in the hoard, the thirty Euboean drachmas, no. 45, which is a <hi rend="italic">unicum</hi> has been
               excluded from the tabular survey on p. 8. The remaining thirty-one are grouped according to symbol in a relative chronology discussed in detail
               below. It is based on the quality of the style; the development of the coiffure from the coins of Evaenetus and his followers, widely adopted in
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> after 368, and the influence of the sculptural style through the latter half of the
               fourth century, as well as the deterioration of inspiration, not of an individual artist, but of numismatic art as a whole in the third century.
               While it is true that any stylistic argument may be considered subjective, yet generally recognized trends of style in related arts cannot be
               ignored. The existence of the British Museum coin (see below p. 4), in style closely related to those of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, is sufficient to make it clear that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> was in the area affected by
               these trends in style. No. 45 and the British Museum coin show the early stage before any symbol was used; nos. 66–71, also without symbol, occur
               much later in the series when the political situation did not warrant the addition of symbols to the type. The disparity between the early coins
               without symbol and nos. 66–71 shows clearly that they could not have been struck contemporaneously.</p>
            <p>Turning back to the chart on p. 8, the similarity of the "wear pattern" of the drachmas to that of the staters is apparent. There are more of the
               earlier coins in better than "somewhat worn" condition than of the later ones. As with the staters, weight here is the determining factor in the
               entrance of a coin into the hoard.</p>

            <p>Those weights marked (b) indicate coins which chipped in cleaning, because of the crystalization of the metal. The one coin with the cantharus
               symbol, weighing 3.70 (no. 55) is the only one of high weight in better than "somewhat worn" condition; this is balanced by no. 63, a "worn"
               coin, weighing 3.76. It is evident that too little attention has been paid to weight as contrasted with wear in the <pb n="12"/> study of
               domestic hoards. The coin in best condition from the point of view of the hoarder is the coin that weighs the most, not the one which looks the
               most beautiful. This principle should also operate in the case of mercantile hoards, since, except for purely local currency which had a token
               value rather than a value determined by the metal content, weight would be of prime importance. All other factors aside, weight, which is
               accurately measurable, as contrasted with degrees of wear, the determination of which is bound to be somewhat subjective, is tangible evidence on
               which to rely; weight must be considered before drawing conclusions about dates from the amount of wear on coins, particularly in dealing with
               domestic hoards such as this. For a further instance of a later coin which is more worn than an earlier one, see the Elean staters, nos. 81–82,
               pp. 56–57, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate</hi> VI.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in assigning relative and suggesting definite dates for Carystian and Euboean coins, greater reliance has been placed on such factors
               as fabric, technique, style and historical probability than on the wear of coins within the hoard. Particularly in this hoard, where the earliest
               and the latest coins of the ninety are the best preserved, any reliance on wear in determining dates is like to building one's house upon the
               sand.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> p. xlviii, as 17.49, with whom <placeName>Gardner</placeName>, <hi rend="italic">History of Ancient Coinage</hi>, p. 156
                  agrees; by <persName>Seltman</persName>, <pb n="14"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">Greek Coins</hi>, p. 42, as 17.00 grms. I should prefer to set the figure at 17.44 grms. which is 1/125 of the royal mina of
                  1090 grms. In any case the Attic standard must be above 17 grms. Of the six Athenian tetradrachms in the hoard, the two uncleaned specimens
                  weigh 17.31 and 17.45 grms. (nos. 79 and 80); the cleaned specimens, (nos. 75–78), all of which are worn, weigh respectively 16.50, 16.50,
                  16.40, and 16.31 grms. Such Euboean tetradrachms of Attic weight as I know have the following weights recorded: <persName>Mc Clean</persName>,
                  no. 5704, 16.59 grms., three in the <persName>Newell</persName> collection, 16.36, 16.32 and 16.95 grms., three listed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi>, pp. 195–6, 16.10, 16.45, 17.01 grms., the Basel coin
                  mentioned above, 16.42 grms., Naville, 16 (1933), 1180, 16.51 grms. There can be no question but that these coins are struck on the Attic
                  standard. Turning to the hoard coin, we have the extant weight of 13.85 grms., which is far too light for a tetradrachm on the Attic standard.
                  Furthermore, this is the only coin in the hoard from which it was impossible to remove the heavy incrustation. The other coins, in the
                  cleaning, shed this rather heavy layer, which flaked off with a tooth pick. Five Carystian staters were weighed before and after cleaning,
                  with the results given below. The norm for these coins, on the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>ian standard, is
                  7.29–7.36 grms.</p>

               <p>The average loss is 14 % and the range represented by these coins, taken quite at random, goes from more than 18 % to more than 11 %. Two of
                  the drachmas, one of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> and one of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>, suffered a loss of slightly over 4 % of the weight in cleaning. The diameter of the Euboean stater is 0.002 m. larger
                  than the average for the Carystian staters; this means that the Euboean coin has a slightly larger surface <pb n="15"/> area for corrosion and
                  that more than 14% loss could be assumed from cleaning, provided it were possible to remove the incrustation, which has hitherto resisted
                  three separate efforts at cleaning the coin. After each attempt the coin was weighed and its weight remained 13.85 grms. But, to take as a
                  conservative figure 14%, the weight loss would be 1.91 grms, which subtracted from 13.85 would leave 11.94 grms., as the cleaned weight of the
                  coin, a figure which is probably too high, since 14% is conservative. The Euboean staters of Aeginetan weight, of which I know the weights are
                  as follows: 11.94, 11.92, 11.45 (all from <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Traité,</hi> pp.
                  193–194), <persName>Newell</persName> collection, 11.45 grms. The figures for the Carystian staters indicate that about 14% was added to the
                  norm for the denomination by incrustation. If 14% be added to the norm for the Aeginetan stater (ca. 12.60 or ca. 12.14 grms.) the weight is
                  14.24 or 13.72 grms., in the former case only .39 grms. more and in the latter .13 grms. less than the weight of the hoard coin, which
                  although in fine condition was probably not fresh from the mint. Therefore, in spite of the fact that certainly the obverse die and possibly
                  the reverse die were used for Attic weight tetradrachms (cf. the references to the <persName>Newell</persName> and Basel coins above), this
                  coin is an Aeginetan stater and provides the connecting link between the staters and the tetradrachms, proving that the type was changed
                  before the standard. This change probably took place near the beginning of the fourth century (cf. note 27).</p>

               <p>These thirty-seven staters and eight drachmas of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> represent the largest group in
                  the hoard, and nearly half the total number of coins in it. While it is not possible, of course, to draw final conclusions from such a number,
                  these pieces do suggest a more definite chronology than has been given to the fourth century coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>; together with the Euboean drachmas (nos. 45–74) they help to clarify the numismatic history of the island.</p>
               <p>Leaving the drachmas out of account for the moment, the fabric and mint technique of the staters makes it possible to arrive at a relative

                  others; Head was not aware of the existence of the variety with the complete ethnic but no monogram. For convenience those with the short
                  ethnic, nos. 2–25, are called Group I, those with the complete ethnic, nos. 26–29, Group II, and those with complete ethnic and monogram, nos.
                  30–36, Group III. They show some differences of size and weight, the former of which is emphasized by the fact that on the first Group the cow
                  is always slightly too large for the flan. Curiously enough, as the flans grew larger the cows grew smaller. Below are the differences in
                  weight and size.</p>

               <p>Since Groups II and III are more like one another than Group I, their weights also have been averaged: 6.90 grms. As Group II and III total
                  only eleven coins as contrasted with the twenty-four in Group I, it is perhaps unsafe to say more than that Group I coins are at once heavier
                  and smaller than the others. They are thicker and the reverse, if not actually scyphate, is at least deeply saucer-shaped, indicating the use
                  of a circular punch very little, if any, larger than the die. The result of this difference in shape is apparent on the coins: the reverses of
                  Group I are in many cases almost unworn, while the obverses are badly rubbed (cf. nos. 3, 9, 10, 11, 17–19); in the other Groups the wear is
                  more nearly the same on both sides. The dies in Group I are all loose; in Group II the dies are fixed in the upright position; of the third
                  Group, nos. 30–34 have the dies reversed and nos. 35–36 have the punch die at a right angle. At first glance it would seem then that the
                  catalogue order should be changed, since Group II has the normal position for fixed dies. But, there is no real difference between having the
                  dies fixed upright or in reverse, for the stresses on them are identical, at least on dies with such types as these. The real advance comes in
                  nos. 35 and 36, where placing the punch die at a right angle to the anvil insures that the long axes of the dies are in the same direction,
                  with a resultant distribution and equalization of pressure in use which would prolong the life of the dies. Therefore, from the point of view
                  of technique and fabric, it appears that Group I is the earliest and that some time elapsed between it and the two subsequent Groups, which
                  probably succeeded one another closely.</p>
               <p>In the catalogue the order of the coins is the result of the observation of the growth of die breaks, each of which is recorded; the use of
                  anvil die A 1 before A 2 is proved by the growth of the breaks on punch die P 7. In no. 12 it shows only the lower break; nos. 13 and 14 show
                  the upper break as well, in a sufficiently advanced form to presuppose considerable use between nos. 12 and 13. Nos. 20 and 21, which show P 7
                  with A 2, show both breaks larger than on any of the coins with A 1. The other two punch dies used with both anvils (P 5 and P 8) have no
                  discernable damage and their position in the se- <pb n="24"/> quence is based, as is that of all the other dies, on the growth of breaks in
                  the anvil dies. Either this issue of Carystian staters was very heavy or the two anvil dies were used over a long period. If the latter were
                  the case, we might reasonably expect to find great individual variety in the punches and fewer coins from the same dies in the hoard. Possibly
                  also there might be differences in wear, although that is a minor consideration in such a hoard as this. However, there is little variety in
                  the punch dies, not more than can be attributed to individual artists working simultaneously; the type of the cock is homogeneous and in
                  considerable contrast to that of the later staters. In the case of P 2, P 3, P 5, P 7 and P 8 we have from two to five coins from the same
                  die. It seems reasonable to conclude, therefore, that, whatever the occasion for the commencement of this issue, a demand for large numbers of
                  coins was felt and was met by such coins as these in the hoard. In the case of nos. 24 and 25, each of which has both punch and anvil dies
                  unconnected with the others (cf. note 36) we may infer that production slackened off after the first demand for currency was satisfied. This
                  inference from the hoard is confirmed by such published specimens as are known to me; there are only two coins, those mentioned in note 41,
                  from the dies of no. 24 and none, so far as I have been able to determine, from the dies of no. 25.</p>
               <p>The dies present another anomaly, or perhaps tend to refute a statement which has gone unchallenged. The punch die, because of the pressure
                  exerted directly upon it, is presumed to have worn out faster than the anvil.<ref target="#CH1-n41">

                  their earliest use in the hoard (nos. 2. and 16) and an increasing amount with the changing punch dies. The increase has been noted in the
                  catalogue. The reason for such a state of affairs is not clear, but may possibly be set down to local patriotism. The obverse type, bovine as
                  was customary in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>, pointed less directly to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> than did the cock on the reverse. The later use of the complete ethnic and then an additional monogram on the reverse

                  the more important. For the obverse then, as long as they had the cow, her battered state was of no concern, but the cock had to be in prime

                  </ref> The first artist, who is not the <pb n="26"/> most gifted, made three dies used only with A 1 (P 1, no. 2; P 2, nos. 3 and 4; P 3, nos.
                  5–8), one die used with both anvils (P 8, nos, 15, 22, 23) and one die used only with A 2 (P 9, no. 16). These five dies have such minor
                  differences that it is difficult to distinguish them: possibly P 1 is the same as P 2, but the letters K and A seem to be slightly higher on P
                  1; P 8 differs from P 2 chiefly in the angle of the rear talon of the right foot, best seen on no. 15; P 9 is differentiated from P 3 only in
                  the cross bar of the A and the spacing of the K and A. Artist 1 was possibly the main workman, since he made half the extant dies. The second
                  artist made only one die appearing in the hoard; it is P 7 (nos. 12, 13, 14, 20, 21) where the cock has unusually long wattles. This is the
                  only punch which is damaged; by means of it the order of use of A 1 and A 2 has been determined. The third artist is the most individual of
                  the lot; three dies which are used with both anvils are certainly assignable to him, possibly two others. P 5 (nos. 10,17,18), P 6 (no. 11)
                  and P 10 (no. 19) have a cock with short wattles and slightly opened mouth, in an aggressive pose which is enhanced by the roughened
                  appearance of his feathers. The effect seems to have been produced by the use of the drill only slightly masked. He also used the drill in
                  making the letters, connecting the dots (depressions in the die) by thick lines; the Κ often appears as Κ, not a rare form generally, but
                  confined to Artist 3 on the Carystian pieces. He may also have been the artist of P 4 (no. 9) and of <hi rend="italic">SNGL</hi>, III, 1782;
                  these show the same use of the drill, but the pose of the bird is different: there is a shallow curve from the tip of the tail, along the back
                  and up the neck, while P 5, P 6, and P 10 have no curve between neck and back and a rather sharp angle between back and tail. It is hard to
                  tell whether one pose is characteristic of one artist or whether the same artist varied the stance of his bird. At least they are closely
                  related; in the catalogue the maker of P 4 has been called Artist 4. The maker of P 11 perhaps is Artist 1, but the only specimen from this
                  die in the hoard (no. 24) does not show the arrangement of the tail feathers which Artist 1 uses elsewhere. It is in his rather pedestrian
                  style. No. 25 is worn, and damaged on the reverse; it is possible that the die is <pb n="27"/> the same as one of the others, but the
                  condition of the coin does not warrant a final attribution. Since the anvil die is unique, it is probable that the punch should be considered
                  a new one.</p>
               <p>The anvil dies lack the individuality of the punches. It is possible that one artist made the first three: A 1 and A 2 particularly are
                  closely alike in pose and proportions, while A 3 differs but slightly. A 4 is in a rather different style and more like the obverses of
                  staters nos. 26–36. Despite the apparent indifference of the Carystians to the condition of the anvil die, the type is of considerable
                  interest.Through-out <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>'s history, the main types were always bovine, obviously

                  surety, since the mass of that coinage has not received the attention it deserves. However, the two versions of the type in the north are used
                  on coins of two different weight standards: the type facing left appears on coins which are Attic didrachms; the others are on the standard
                  which developed later into the Macedonian. There are, of course, other bovine types in the north, but this is the only one which spread as far

                  he may have known the source of this coin type. The existence of a primitive temple of "Hera" may mean that the Mother-Goddess worshipped here
                  from Minoan times changed only her name with the coming of the Olympians.<ref target="#CH1-n54">
                     <hi rend="sup">54</hi>
                  </ref> One detail of the type of the staters is the heavy, irregular, exergual line, which must be meant to represent the rough surface of the
                  ground, such as occurs on the Minoan plaque cited in note 48 and <pb n="29"/> in other contexts on many Minoan paintings, and even vases. This
                  'pictorial' treatment of the exergual line is clear on A 1 and A 2, but is lacking on A 3 and A 4; this is one reason for doubting that one
                  artist made more than the first two dies. The staters with the complete ethnic retain it slightly reduced, but it is missing from those with
                  the monogram. Its survival into the fourth century in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> gives weight to the words of
                     <persName>Thucydides</persName> just quoted, since it more than hints that something of Minoan tradition remained there. The device is not
                  used on coins with this type issued elsewhere. Its appearance is a mystery, but there can be no doubt of its source.<ref target="#CH1-n55">

               <p>The eight Carystian drachmas, nos. 37–44, in fabric and technique closely resemble the staters with the abbreviated ethnic. They are rather
                  thick and the reverse is almost scyphate. No. 37 is possibly the earliest, but is separated by no great interval of time from the others. The
                  inscription on the reverse has only the first three letters ΚАP of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName>, and there
                  appears not to be a club below the recumbent animal. Other and better specimens may, however, show that it is part of the type as it is on the
                  others. The style of the remaining seven is homogeneous<ref target="#CH1-n56">
                     <hi rend="sup">56</hi>
                  </ref> and but slightly better than that of no. 37. Six punch dies and eight anvils furnish few dies links, although the British Museum coin
                  mentioned in note 39 adds another. The chief significance of these eight drachmas in the hoard is to confirm its domestic nature: either they
                  are slightly earlier than the staters and entered the hoard before them, or they are contemporaneous and entered the hoard in small numbers
                  because of the availability of the staters, and the inferential prosperity of the family at the time.</p>
               <p>The use of the head of Heracles on the obverse, the relegation of the island canting type to the reverse and the complete abandonment <pb n="30"/> of the local canting type should have some significance. Possibly in the fourth century there was an increased interest in the
                  cult of Heracles and the temple mentioned in late inscriptions was really begun at that time. It is tempting to see a connection with the
                  north in the appearance of Heracles on the drachmas at a time when the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>n kings were
                  using that type for the obverse of their staters, but there is nothing to justify it. More reasonably, in view of the increasing importance of

                  may be construed as evidence that the city needed help in the undertaking of the issue of coinage. The very heavy first issue, attested by the
                  worn obverse dies and the plurality of reverses, shows an immediate need for large numbers of coins. The standard itself which was chosen for
                  these coins is also an indication that the time of the starting of the issue is shortly after 379.</p>

                  for the drachma. The close correspondence between these weights and those given by <placeName>Gardner</placeName> makes it superfluous to call
                  the standard of the Carystian, as well as other Euboean, coins 'reduced Attic.'<ref target="#CH1-n65">

               <p>It is significant that the Chalcidic mint increased its production of tetradrachms in 379 and the years immediately following,<ref target="#CH1-n69">
                     <hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                  normal life. The agricultural areas of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boeotia">Boeotia</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>, would be the most likely and easiest sources of the
                  things the Chalcidic League needed. While, so far as I know, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boeotia">Boeotia</placeName> never abandoned the
                  Aeginetan standard, it is clear that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName>, and the other cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> as well, adopted the standard of the Chalcidic League: in the case of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> probably very soon after 379. The production of the League mint between 379 and <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 376, under Asclepiodorus, seems to have been exclusively tetradrachms (cf. note 69), a comparatively short time, but
                  one during which coins for foreign trade, i.e. the larger issues, were the paramount necessity. The Euboean cities, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> and later Chalcis, Histiaea and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>,
                  provided the small change, in drachmas, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> struck didrachms as well. This
                  denomination was never used by the League, but local conditions probably made its issue advisable. The curious circumstance that no coin of
                  the League, or of Philip of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>, is in the hoard is not a telling argument against the
                  use of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>n standard in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>;
                  no coin of Chalcis or Histiaea, nor of Boeotia, all of which are nearer <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> than
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName> or Chalcidice, entered the hoard either, so the argument <hi rend="italic">ex
                     absentia</hi> is without force.</p>
               <p>Since the coinage of Chalcis, Histiaea and the Euboean drachmas struck at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> started
                  after 368 (see below) and continued, at least intermittently, until about the middle of the third century,<ref target="#CH1-n70">
                     <hi rend="sup">70</hi>
                  </ref> it is likely that the presence of the earlier of the thirty Euboean drachmas in the hoard indicates that coinage ceased at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> not long after 368. The fabric of the Euboean drachmas is later than that of the Carystian
                  pieces, where the drachmas and Group I staters both are <pb n="34"/> markedly scyphate and the dies not fixed. There are no Carystian pieces
                  similar in fabric to the Euboean, until the latter part of the fourth century. Group III has already been dated as late as 313 and after (cf.
                  p. 30) and possibly Group II is as late. I should prefer to date it nearer 323, since the eagles on the Elean staters most closely resembling
                  the elegant cocks on those pieces are dated about that time.<ref target="#CH1-n71">

                  </ref> A domestic hoard such as this tends to be composed mainly of local coins, whatever the denomination; the reason for the intermission of
                  Carystian coins is unknown, unless it lies in the fact that after 348 all Euboean towns but <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> were independent.<ref target="#CH1-n72">
                     <hi rend="sup">72</hi>
                  </ref> No self-respecting Carystian would save coins from a city a hundred-or-so miles away if his hometown were issuing coins. The Euboean
                  drachmas fall into seven groups, which are discussed below; not all of these precede the staters of Groups II and III. However, from 368 the
                  Euboean drachmas, those of Histiaea until 340, and those of Chalcis, seem to be the only coins struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>, although the Carystian pieces undoubtedly continued to circulate, until <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> again struck staters in the last quarter of the fourth century. Such coins as the family was able to save during that
                  time would be these drachmas, the earlier of which are quite well-preserved showing signs of little circulation before entering the hoard, and
                  the more worn Carystian staters, such as nos. 8, 21, 22, and 25. It is not impossible that the Athenian tetradrachms (nos. 75–80) also entered
                  the hoard at this time. However, their worn condition and their lack of definite date would permit them to have entered the hoard at almost
                  any time prior to its final abandonment.</p>
               <p>The real problem of this hoard is the relation of the Carystian and Euboean pieces to one another, and the matter of their dates. As has been
                  pointed out above, the evidence of wear is contradictory to the accepted dates, fabric, style and technique in the case of the Carystian <pb n="35"/> staters. As will be seen below, the evidence of wear in the case of the Euboean drachmas is likewise contradictory to the fabric,
                  style and technique not only of the drachmas themselves, but of the coins of Chalcis and such other fourth and third century Greek coins as
                  offer legitimate parallels. Therefore, since wear in this hoard is a broken reed on which to lean, no reliance has been placed on it in
                  determining the relative chronology of the Euboean drachmas.</p>

                     <persName>Milne</persName> , <hi rend="italic">Greek and Roman Coins</hi>, 81, speaks of the reduction of standards because of the re-use
                     of already coined silver, wear plus minting costs bringing about the issue of coins of less weight than the original norm of the silver
                     acquired. This seems unrealistic, except where the coin is used only as local, and therefore token, currency, for the intrinsic value of
                     the coin determined its popularity; it is questionable whether even local currency would have a face value above its intrinsic value,
                     except at a much later period. In the case of the Euboean coins, we have the tetradrachms on the Attic standard issued early in the fourth
                     century; these show weights no lower than those of the Athenian tetradrachms. We do not know the source of Euboean silver; it may possibly
                     have come from Attica, as the nearest place. If so, it could have come as well in the form of bullion as in the form of struck coins. The
                     Euboean tetradrachms were accompanied by some drachmas, which also have normal weights for Attic drachmas. It is much more probable that
                     there was a change of standard in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> about 379, for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> at least, and about 368 for the Euboean Confederation coins and possibly those of
                     Chalcis and Histiaea as well, from the Attic to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>n.</p>

                  <p> The explanation that Philip chose that standard to make it fit with the Attic standard on which gold was struck seems weak; it is more
                     likely that he saw the relation between the two standards, in the two metals, and chose the Attic for his gold, since he had for commercial
                     and economic reasons been led to adopt the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>n standard for his silver.</p>

               <p>The year 368 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>. is of considerable importance in the numismatic history of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>. In that year, the Congress at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_delphi">Delphi</placeName> reinforced the autonomy of
                  cities, already agreed upon at the time of the Peace of Antalcidas (387). A number of Greek cities thereupon began striking their first coins
                  or resumed coinages which had been interrupted. Chalcis began again to strike coins, the first since ca. 507, when it was conquered by the
                  Athenians; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaea</placeName> struck its first coins and the <pb n="40"/> mint of the Euboean
                  Confederation resumed its federal issue which had ceased some years before: all these coinages were on the Macedonian standard which
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> had introduced into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> ca.
                  379. There were also a number of cities of central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</placeName> which inaugurated or resumed an issue of coins at this time (cf. below note 83).
                  Comment has already been made, <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>, by all numismatists on the imitation of the Syracusan tetradrachms in the style
                  of Evaenetus by the various cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> which started or resumed coining a little before
                  the middle of the fourth century. Head<ref target="#CH1-n82">
                     <hi rend="sup">82</hi>
                  </ref> says, "All these.... imitations of Syracusan coins are to be accounted for not so much by the political influence undoubtedly exercised
                  by Dionysius (who was present at the Congress) in Central <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>, as by a considerable influx
                  of Syracusan money at this period, in payment of various mercenary troops sent into the country by Dionysius in support of his Lacedaemonian
                  allies." May not aesthetic appreciation of the art of Evaenetus have had an influence, apart from political considerations?
                     <persName>Seltman</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Greek Coins</hi>, pl. XXIV, 3, shows the fifth century decadrachm signed by Evaenetus from
                  which the fourth century coins were copied; pl. XLIV, 4–7, show the Syracusan copies, ranging in date from ca. 380 to ca. 350. No die cutter's
                  name appears on these coins and it is improbable that Evaenetus made them.</p>
               <p>The coiffure of the nymph seems to be in a fashion peculiar to the West, although it was not originated by Evaenetus.
                     <persName>Seltman</persName>, pl. XXII, gives a number of tetradrachms, dating from 474–413, showing a variety of coiffures, most of which
                  can be paralleled from vases and statues. However, nos. 10–12, signed Sosion, Euth. and Phrygillus, and Evaenetus, show variants of a new
                  mode, where the hair is pulled back and up loosely, then coiled softly over a confining band, which must have been placed on the head before
                  the hair was drawn up. (It is close to the style of no. 1 in this catalogue.) This mode appears on the coins of south Italian towns in the
                  last third of the fifth century. Cf. <persName>Seltman</persName>, <hi rend="italic">Greek Coins</hi>, pl. XXI, 4 (Terina, <hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. 425), 7 <pb n="41"/> (Neapolis <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 430), and 13 (Cumae, <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 430). No. 5. on the
                  same plate, also a coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_terina">Terina</placeName>, shows clearly how <persName>Evaenetus</persName> took the
                  simple mode of no. 4 and softened the rather severe outline with a profusion of escaping ringlets. On the Syracusan pieces, the added grain
                  wreath further relieves the simplicity. It is this style which was copied far and wide.</p>
               <p>While some of the coins with such a head may have reached <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> earlier than 368, so long as
                  the various cities were not free to strike coins until that time or shortly before, it must be concluded that those coins which show an
                  adaptation of this style are to be dated 368 and after.<ref target="#CH1-n83">
                     <hi rend="sup">83</hi>
                  </ref> In the borrowing the style is modified, the grain wreath is often omitted and the hair bound merely with a fillet, or not at all. The
                  results achieved in various places reflect the relative skill of the copyists: at Opuntian Locris, the die cutters were among the most
                  successful; at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> and some of the other cities listed in note 83, the copies were
                  somewhat less successful than the model.</p>
               <p>While the manner of the adoption of this type was undoubtedly peculiar to each city that adopted it, one can see the course of events in the
                  Euboean confederation. Prior to 387, that organization struck, on the Attic standard, among other denominations, drachmas having as types the
                  head of a nymph with her hair rolled up in a fashion not too unlike the early Syracusan, to which no. 1 in the hoard is related, and the head
                  of a bull with the letters ΕΥ above.<ref target="#CH1-n84">
                     <hi rend="sup">84</hi>
                  </ref> After that coinage ceased, the next drachmas were on the Macedonian standard, but <pb n="42"/> continued the same types. The change
                  from the earlier style to the later was effected with the aid of a foreign artist, as can be seen from a comparison of the hoard coin, no. 45,
                  with the <hi rend="italic">B.M.C</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Cent. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>
                  </hi> specimen, p. 95, no. 7, pl. XVII, 5. No 45 is a unique specimen in a style that is either early or crude<ref target="#CH1-n85">
                     <hi rend="sup">85</hi>
                  </ref>: it cannot be early because its weight (3.47 grms.) shows that it is on the Macedonian standard. It therefore is crude. The nymph's
                  head is coarse, with heavy profile and unintelligible hair; it is hard to be sure a female head is intended. The bull's head, small,
                  unfilleted, poorly executed, is to the left and the letters are retrograde. There is no possibility that this is a forgery: it is too unlike
                  the others to have passed current as an ancient forgery; it is not a modern one, for it was covered with the same heavy purplish incrustation
                  as the other coins in the hoard and its type was not distinguishable before cleaning. It does not have fixed dies like the other hoard
                  drachmas. The flatness of the reverse argues against its being as early as the Carystian drachmas, whose cup-shaped reverses have already been

                  die-cutter had obviously been out of work for some time; desuetude has left its mark in the execution of the hair and features on the obverse
                  and in the complete reversal of the type on the reverse, with the retrograde letters. Or, alternately, a person with no experience in cutting
                  dies, trying to copy the earlier type, would be likely to achieve such a result as is embodied in no. 45. Dissatisfaction with this result led
                  the Euboeans to employ the services of a minor "master," for the London coin cited above is in the best style (cf. note 85). The <pb n="43"/>
                  maker of this die used the Syracusan head as his model, even to the necklace and earring; the treatment of the hair is simpler and neater than
                  on the coins of Opuntian Locris and that of the features and profile is quite as fine. That he was no mere copyist is clear (a) from the fact
                  that he was not slavishly bound to retain the orientation of the model (the heads on all the earlier Euboean coins had been turned to the
                  right) and (b) from his simplification of the hair, which is far more suitable to the small size of the flan than a more elaborate arrangement
                  would have been.</p>
               <p>It is questionable whether he made more than the one obverse die, since the <placeName>London</placeName> specimen seems to be the only one
                  published. He also made the reverse die for the same coin, where the bull's head is for the first time filleted; the artist's individuality
                  appears in his delineation of the texture of the bull's hide, by means of a delicate use of the drill. This reproduction of texture, so far as
                  I know, does not occur on any other coins where the bull, or his head or protome, is the type.<ref target="#CH1-n87">

                  lyre was more than a local coin-type with only a religious significance. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_ichnae">Ichnae</placeName>, situated

                  island <pb n="46"/> and the League, whose name, whatever the nationality of the people, would provide a strong bond of sympathy with the
                  people of the island. This close association is best dated between 368 and 357, the period when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> and the League were not working toward the same ends, and before the cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> joined the mid-century Athenian Confederacy.</p>
               <p>Nos. 53 and 54, with a facing Silen mask as symbol, are the only hoard representatives of the group which succeeded to those with the lyre.
                  The <placeName>London</placeName> specimen is from the reverse die (P 6) of no. 54, but the obverse is not A 6; the Lockett and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</placeName> coins (see note 75) add a fourth reverse and fifth obverse to the dies with which I am
                  acquainted. This makes it possible to suggest that coins with the Silen mask symbol were struck in about the same numbers as those with the
                  lyre, of which I have been able to find four reverse and five obverse dies, or if not in the same numbers, at least over a comparable length
                  of time. The nymph on the two hoard specimens is the immediate successor to the one on no. 52. She has even plainer earrings, her fillet has
                  no bow at the nape of the neck and her hair is rather more simply done, although still in the "Western" style.<ref target="#CH1-n94">
                     <hi rend="sup">94</hi>
                  </ref> The head is for the first time facing left, an orientation which persists through the subsequent series, although on the coins of
                  Histiaea the change is never made. The bull is brother to those on nos. 46–52.</p>
               <p>Since they are immediate upon a series which ended in 357, and since the period between 357 and 350 was characterized by a close association
                  with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>, it is logical, granting a political significance to the symbols, to seek a
                  meaning connected with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> for the use of the Silen mask. The extreme rarity of a Silen
                  mask, even as a type, although a satyr or Silen himself occurs on the coins of various cities,<ref target="#CH1-n95">
                     <hi rend="sup">95</hi>
                  </ref>
                  <pb n="47"/> argues a recherché reason for its use at this time. Rather hesitantly I put forward the suggestion that we have here a reference
                  to the Dionysia at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>: in the fifth century this was the season at which the tribute was
                  paid; it probably continued to be the appointed time in the fourth century, when the Euboean cities, voluntarily rather than under compulsion,
                  were paying tribute to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName>. While the symbol is none too clear on the coins, and the
                  parallels cited do not give much more detail, the bald elderly satyr is always Silenus. <persName>Miss Bieber</persName> in <hi rend="italic">Die Denkmäler zum Theaterwesen im Altertum,</hi> pp. 90–91, states that the Satyr-play in the fourth century was performed, not following
                  the three tragedies, but quite separately at the beginning of the celebration of the Greater Dionysia. As Papposilenus was the leader of the
                  satyr crew, it seems at least a workable hypothesis that the mask on the coins refers to the time of the collection of the tribute, the
                  prominent position of the Satyr-play making the choice of that mask instead of a tragic one a readily recognizable allusion. Since <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> recognized the independence of all of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>
                  except <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> in 348, the symbol would have been abandoned at that time, if it had not
                  already been in 350, when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> was betrayed by Plutarch at the battle of Tamynae.<ref target="#CH1-n96">

               <p>The years following, up to the battle of Chaironeia, saw a succession of "tyrants" in the Euboean cities, with factional strife between
                  pro-Macedonian and pro-Athenian parties. The somewhat later style of the remaining Euboean drachmas leads to the conclusion that there was an
                  interruption of an indeterminate number of years between nos. 54 and 55. The coiffure of the nymph is no longer in the "Western" style, but in
                  one which reflects the sculpture of the latter half of the fourth century and which continues into the Hellenistic period. It has already been
                  remarked that the coiffure made popular by Evaenetus had no parallels on vases or sculpture in the fifth century. The <pb n="48"/> vases show
                  an amazing variety, ranging from loose-tressed Maenads to heads bound with all manner of fillet, ampyx, sphendone or stephane.</p>
               <p>Sculptured heads were dressed more simply. Starting, somewhat arbitrarily, with the Lemnian Athena,<ref target="#CH1-n97">
                     <hi rend="sup">97</hi>
                  </ref> one finds the hair drawn down over the brow and bound with a fillet; the hair of the Amazons was drawn down over the ears from a center
                  part; the <hi rend="italic">Terme</hi> Niobid's hair is quite similar, with a broad fillet high on the head. A modification of this style is
                  dimly apparent in the battered heads of the Phigaleia frieze and becomes clearer in the coiffure of Eirene holding the infant Ploutos. Here
                  the hair is curled back from the face to form a heavier frame for it. By the middle of the fourth century, probably under the influence of
                  Praxiteles, although he may only have refined an existing fashion, the hair, still parted in the middle, was drawn away from the center of the
                  brow before being brought back over the tips of the ears, as for example on the Cnidian Aphrodite and Demeter, both of which are dated very
                  close to 350. A further and later modification resulted in retaining the triangular brow framed by the hair, but in coiling the hair loosely
                  back over the sides of the head and tips of the ears. The Aphrodite of Arles, the Sarcophagus of the Mourning Women from Sidon, the Tyche of
                  Antioch, to name but a few, show various forms of the modifications of the hair style of the two Cnidian statues.</p>
               <p>Turning to the drachmas, those with the cantharus as symbol, nos. 55–65, pls. 4 and 5, show some beautiful examples of this mode, which seems
                  on the coins to have developed easily from the "Western" style. For example, nos. 55 and 56 have only slightly modified the coiffure of no 54,
                  lowering the hair at the back to form a chignon, while curl- <pb n="49"/> ing it away from the face instead of drawing it back loosely. The
                  following coins, nos. 57–64, show individual artists' treatment of the fashion, with varying degrees of elaboration in the matter of vagrant
                  tresses, and finally with some deterioration of quality in nos. 63 and 64. The style is clearly later than on nos. 46–54. No. 65,<ref target="#CH1-n98">
                     <hi rend="sup">98</hi>
                  </ref> pl. 5, is very close to nos. 63 and 64. The succeeding coins, nos. 66–71, with no symbol, show a dullnes and triteness in the treatment
                  of the hair. The last two, nos. 70 and 71, have added a necklace for the nymph's adornment; she is made no more beautiful thereby. The last
                  three hoard drachmas, nos. 72–74, pl. 5, show a marked degradation of style. The hair has become merely a series of regular lines and there is
                  none of the subtlety of planes that was evident on the other heads. In addition, the modeling of cheek, profile and chin is weak and flat, a
                  feature Madame Varoucha had already remarked; she considered it a further indication of the late date of the coins with the dolphin
                     symbol.<ref target="#CH1-n99">

               <p>Since the change in the style of coiffure from the head on the Silen mask series to that on the cantharus series reflects a mode not far from
                  the middle of the fourth century, there is nothing to impel one to infer any interruption of the Euboean drachmas. However, it is perhaps
                  better to conclude that in that confused period between 348 and the final conquest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>
                  by Philip in 338 there was some time in which no coins were struck. <persName>Newell</persName>

                  association with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> in 341–340, are in style so close to the Histiaean drachmas on the
                  Macedonian standard that <persName>Newell</persName> believes the same artist cut the dies. Now, the hair on the nymph of the Histiaea coins,
                  although bound by a sphendone or ampyx, shows a change from the "upsweep" of the <pb n="50"/> drachmas to the rather patterned waves back from
                  the brow, which has already been marked on the Euboean drachmas. Cf. <hi rend="italic">B.M.C. Cent. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName>

                  not attain to the excellence of A 8, the coiffure, even to the detail of the few escaping locks, is the same. As it is not safe to "pinpoint"
                  the date of any coinage without specific historical data, and as there remain, to the best of my knowledge, about the same number of dies for

                  Now, on the coins of Philip of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>, minted at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> subsequent to 356, there occurs a cantharus occasionally as a symbol below the body of the horse; the same symbol
                  is used on <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> coins from that mint.<ref target="#CH1-n106">
                     <hi rend="sup">106</hi>
                  </ref> The reason for it escapes me, since I can find no reference to one of the independently issued Amphipolitan coins having that symbol.
                  Why the Euboeans should choose that symbol rather than one of the many others which Philip used is another phenomenon for which I can offer no
                  explanation. It may be suggested that about 340 a pro-Macedonian tyrant chose this symbol to mark, somewhat obscurely because of the symbol's
                  apparent reference to Dionysus, his loyalty to Philip. On this hypothesis there would be time for the coiffure of the statues mentioned above
                  to become known to the die cutters and a short enough interval after the other two series for the quality of the reverses not to have
                  deteriorated.</p>
               <p>The next symbol used must have been the bunch of grapes, represented in the hoard by a single specimen, no. 65. It is hard to tell, from one
                  coin, whether the rather hard profile and stereotyped hair on the obverse and the undistinguished bull on the reverse are the product of an
                  inferior artist or the result of a lapse of time. The rather commonplace symbol<ref target="#CH1-n107">
                     <hi rend="sup">107</hi>
                  </ref> indicates its decreasing importance, I believe, and its use may have been as a result of the ambiguous cantharus on the preceding
                  series. The latter's connection with Dionysus was so obvious that it rendered obsolescent the remote Macedonian connection in the years
                  following, say, 335, when political events were far <pb n="52"/> off and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> was almost
                  somnolent. The bunch of grapes was a clear reference to Dionysus and had no political meaning.</p>
               <p>The coins which have no symbol further reflect the lack of interest in political affairs: here quite clearly no political events were
                  important enough to be recorded on the coins. The dies are quite uninspired and bear no resemblance to the earlier drachmas without symbol,
                  no. 45 and the <placeName>London</placeName> coin. The coiffure of the nymphs has already been shown to be later than that on the cantharus
                  drachmas. A 12, nos. 66–68, is the best and shows clearly how the coils of hair at the sides of the face come to be more sharply
                  differentiated from the hair on the top of the head and from the chignon; the curious thick lock above the ear is an enlargement of that on
                  such a head as no. 64. These heads are the embodiment of neatness; not a lock escapes from its place. The head of no. 69, which is connected
                  by its reverse with no. 70, is in the same style; the artist has delineated eye, cheek and profile more successfully. Nos. 70 and 71 show a
                  marked degradation, being the least attractive heads of the lot. The bulls are so nondescript that they must have been depicted at a time when
                  the "land of fair cattle" had been stripped of its blooded stock: a sorrier lot of animals one would go far to see. During the years following
                  the death of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>, when the world was in turmoil and all parts of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> were scenes of battle, very likely livestock was slaughtered in quantity to supply food for
                  the soldiers, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> was bound to suffer in that respect. These coins are to be assigned
                  to the last quarter of the fourth century, possibly following the Lamian War.</p>
               <p>There seems no longer any support for the theory<ref target="#CH1-n108">
                     <hi rend="sup">108</hi>
                  </ref> that there was a general interruption of autonomous Greek coinage following 338. There is no indication from the Euboean drachmas that
                  any cessation of their coinage occurred between 338 and 313, the date of the liberation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> from <persName>Cassander</persName>. In the case of the Carystian staters, <pb n="53"/> fabric and mint technique point
                  to an interval between Group I and Groups II and III. The addition of the monogram is the only essential difference between the latter two
                  Groups. The last Group had already been assigned to the period following 313 by Head, who apparently did not feel that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName>' assistance to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens</placeName> in the Lamian War
                  (323–22) presupposed an issue of coins, and later by <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName> (cf. note 40) who assigned
                  both Groups I and II to the period between 369 and 338. I should be more inclined to place the staters of Group II, as well as Group III,
                  after 313 for a number of reasons: 1. the fabric and technique of those two Groups is nearly the same and quite different from Group I (cf.
                  above pp. 23, 30, 34); 2. the use of a monogram, although it had occurred earlier in the fourth century sporadically, is characteristic of the
                  Hellenistic period; 3. the presence of the Euboean drachmas in a hoard from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> argues
                  for a lack of local coinage. The coins of Groups II and III seem to be considerably rarer than those of Group I, indicating a shorter period
                  of production; such an indication may be contradicted at any time by the appearance of more coins. Appearing first in 313, they may have
                  continued until 265 as Head suggests, followed by <persName corresp="#nomisma_kis_perinthus">Babelon</persName>, but in view of the contents
                  of the hoard, they probably ceased at the end of the fourth century.</p>
               <p>The connection of the dolphin, the symbol on nos. 72–74, with Demetrius Poliorcetes has already been suggested by Madame Varoucha in the
                  article cited in note 90. The great difference in quality between these coins and those preceding makes one hesitate to conclude that they
                  followed directly upon them. Their very flat style and banal treatment of the hair, as well as the extremely sketchy deliniation of the bull,
                  places them in the third century when the coins of other cities show a similar deterioration.<ref target="#CH1-n109">
                     <hi rend="sup">109</hi>
                  </ref> It is better to admit a lapse of time between the last three hoard drachmas and the others, although there may be other coins with the
                  dolphin symbol whose style and fabric would serve to bridge the gap and make it possible to conclude that this symbol was used over a longer
                  period of time than any of the <pb n="54"/> others. These dolphins scarcely deserve to be dated before 294, when Demetrius became king of
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>, and probably came to an end in 265.</p>
               <p>Although the relative dates of the Euboean drachmas would remain unchanged thereby, it must be recognized that there is the possibility that
                  these changing symbols have no political meaning. Influenced by the suggestion of Madame Varoucha that the dolphin, the latest symbol, had
                  such a meaning, the same thing has been sought for the others. The fact that, as far as I know, there is no linking obverse die from one
                  symbol to the other, a curious fact in itself, since none of the obverse dies is much worn, rather supports the political theory of the
                  symbols; it argues separate occasions for each issue, rather than a regular succession with symbols honoring various deities. However, leaving
                  out of account the dolphin (which of course could be a reference to Poseidon, albeit an unusual one), it is possible that the lyre, Silen
                  mask, cantharus and bunch of grapes were purely religious in intent. The worship of Apollo Daphnephorus at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> was of long standing; the appearance of the lyre as the first symbol after the Congress at
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_delphi">Delphi</placeName> would doubly honor the god, for his local importance, and for the freedom the
                  Euboeans, along with others, gained under the shadow of his temple at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_delphi">Delphi</placeName>. The other three
                  are plausibly Dionysiac, the last named being commonly used, not only in the various cities of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> but generally throughout the ancient world, by such places as were proud of their wines, or had another association
                  with Dionysus.<ref target="#CH1-n110">

                  appear most frequently in the north, more often in Thrace than in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedonia</placeName>, but the
                  cantharus at least is found as far south as Boeotia.<ref target="#CH1-n111">

                  </ref> As the worship of Dionysus was introduced through the north, the earlier northern use of Dionysiac types and symbols is not surprising.
                  Given the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName>n temple and theater of Dionysus, assuming a religious significance for the
                  symbols, the fact <pb n="55"/> that they are used in the fourth century at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> can be
                  taken to indicate that close association with the north made the adoption of symbols used hitherto almost exclusively in the north a simple
                  enough matter. Such an interpretation gives no clue to the dates of issue of the various symbols, but, as has been stated, their relative
                  chronology remains unaffected.</p>

                  <p> One is led to this conclusion by a consideration of the fabric of the two series: the Carystian pieces were deeply rounded on the reverse
                     and the dies were not fixed; the Euboean drachmas are almost flat and the dies are fixed with such precision that on many the point at the
                     front or back of the neck marks the line of the axis. The Histiaean and Chalcidian coins resemble the Euboean drachmas in fabric. It would
                     be surprising not to find a single coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> in this hoard, since both <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalcis</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> were approximately
                     equidistant from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName>, if there were no political reason for the Carystians to use
                     the coins from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_eretria">Eretria</placeName> instead of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>.</p>

               <p>These Athenian tetradrachms, the grotesque fourth century type with a profile eye on the obverse and the caricatured owl on the reverse, add
                  little but numbers to the hoard. No attempt has been made to identify dies. They offer the negative evidence of date in that they lack the
                  symbols which appeared on the reverse of a few rather rare old style tetradrachms. Those with the symbols are assigned to some period later
                  than theLamian War,<ref target="#CH1-n113">
                     <hi rend="sup">113</hi>
                  </ref> which leaves the remainder of the fourth century, probably after 394, for such tetradrachms as these in the hoard. They may have
                  circulated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> after 357 (see above p. 48); the date of their entrance into the hoard
                  must be considerably later, judging from their worn state. It may be conjectured that in the interval between the earliest group of Carystian
                  staters and the two later ones (i.e. <hi rend="italic">ca</hi>. 370 and 313) these were the only large coins circulating in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> and that they entered the hoard during the latter part of that time.</p>

                  unlike any of his, not only in Group G, in that the eagle is standing on what looks like a heap of rocks. The coin is clearly a member of
                  Group G, which is the only one with the <pb n="57"/> horizontal fulmen. <persName>Seltman</persName> assigns these to the years 363–343,

                     <hi rend="sup">114</hi>
                  </ref> inclines to the earlier date. No. 82 indicates a closer connection between <persName>Seltman</persName>'s Group G and his Group K than
                  he intimates, for the obverse is like his DA (pl. VII) except that the beard ends are mere lines and the hair at the nape of the neck is
                  brushed out from the head. A somewhat similar treatment is seen on his CV (Group J, pl. VII) and foreshadowed in Group G, CK, CL, CN, CF (pl.
                  VI). The reverse of no. 82, without a symbol, has the Ionic capital as a footrest for the eagle, which appears only in his Group G, although
                  this die is not there. The coin is more worn than no. 81: another hoard instance of the date not being indicated by the amount of wear on
                  coins in this hoard. His Group K dates from 273–191, Group J from 323–271; no. 82 therefore should be dated near the end of the fourth century
                  or the beginning of the third. The eagles on both the staters are of the style which the Carystian cocks of Group II and III emulate. These
                  coins may record a trip to Olympia by some member of the family, or they may have reached <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName> through <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boeotia">Boeotia</placeName> where they would circulate easily, since <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boeotia">Boeotia</placeName> used the same standard.</p>

               <p>Although the tetradrachms have been catalogued first, the earliest <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> piece is
                  probably the drachma, no. 87; it is the only one which retains the older style position of Zeus. The clipping of no. 85 occurred anciently,
                  for the edge is smooth and not ragged as is the case with those coins whose metal had crystalized and chipped off in cleaning. The presence of
                  such a coin in the hoard is surprising. The inclusion of these seven coins in the hoard, which has no coins of Philip, is of some importance.
                  If only the tetradrachms were present, one could infer that the small coins issued locally were still circulating in some quantity, but for
                  the purposes of savings the tetradrachms (and perhaps the staters of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_elis_elis">Elis</placeName> ) were put away.
                  The three drachmas, however, show that toward the end of the fourth and during the first half of the third century small coins of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> were supplementing, if not replacing local issues. This may be taken as a partial
                  explanation of the fact that of the latest series of Euboean drachmas, those with the dolphin, the hoard contains only three specimens.
                  Evidently the old order was changing and giving way to the new, as individual communities became smaller in the perspective of the great new
                  world.</p>

                  the exergue. While the exergue is defaced, enough remains to show that there were both monogram and symbol below; the area below the torch
                  above Apollo's foot is unmarred and too small to have contained the Pegasus protome. The obverse die differs from one used at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName> only in minor details; indeed, <persName>Newell</persName> himself says that the obverse
                  dies of his nos. 1553–4 and 1557–8 are almost indistinguishable. However, the arrangement of the hair above the fillet marks this as the die
                  of his δ specimen of no. 1558. He dates the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_abydus">Abydus</placeName> issue slightly earlier than the
                  Lampsacene, saying (p. 331) "Doubtless in consequence of an Egyptian attack on the Chersonnese and paricularly on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_abydus">Abydus</placeName>, the Seleucid mint there was merged with that of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_lampsacus">Lampsacus</placeName>."

               <p>The curious but self-evident fact that the earliest and the latest coins in the hoard show the least signs of wear has already been remarked
                  as one of the reasons for disregarding wear in dating the contents of the hoard. The hoard is, however, important historically and
                  economically, representing as it does the accumulation of a family over a period of about 150 years. There are various other instances of
                  hoards of such long accumulation: the third, fourth and fifth Dura hoards include coins of at least as long a period. The small <placeName corresp="#nomisma_siphnos">Siphnos</placeName> hoard published by <persName>Newell</persName> covers nearly 100 years.<ref target="#CH1-n125">
                     <hi rend="sup">125</hi>
                  </ref> Surely the total, 90 coins, is sufficient to indicate that it must have been slowly accumulated, with considerable sacrifice. Thus we
                  may outline the vicissitudes of a family in those troublous years of the fourth and third centuries, humble folk, of whom little account is
                  taken in the investigations of great events, the battles and the conquests, in those years which saw the fall of independent Greek cities and
                  the rise of the great Hellenistic kingdoms. The first coin saved, a rare and beautiful specimen, possibly was put away for that reason,
                  drachmas or tetrobols being put aside to exchange for this handsome piece with which to start the family savings. Following that the eight
                  Carystian drachmas found their way into the family coffers. The twenty-four staters with the short ethnic, all struck in close succession,
                  indicate more settled financial conditions and some local prosperity: this may be implicit in the fact that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> struck staters, for she was the sole Euboean city to issue larger coins than drachmas
                  between 387 (the terminal date usually given to the tetradrachms of the Euboean Confederacy) and 340, when <placeName corresp="#nomisma_histiaea">Histiaea</placeName> struck octobols. As the fabric of the staters is earlier than that of the Euboean
                  drachmas, the period following 368, when possibly the six Athenian tetradrachms also entered the hoard, is represented by these coins, with
                  the corollary that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_carystus">Carystus</placeName> was not issuing coins during that time. Possibly after <pb n="62"/> the Lamian War, or a little later, there was a brief period of prosperity again for the town and townsfolk, when the later staters
                  were struck, of which the family could save only eleven. The end of the fourth century and the beginning, or even the first half, of the
                  third, during which only a few Euboean drachmas entered the hoard, was not necessarily a more stringent period financially for the family,
                  since they were able to save the Elean staters and the Alexandrine pieces, but their inclusion marks a diminution of local currency.</p>
               <p>The absence of coins of Philip of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_macedon">Macedon</placeName>, which enjoyed such wide circulation and which
                  were on the same standard as the Euboean coins, may be set down to the intense local patriotism of the family; later the increasing number of
                  bronze issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_euboea">Euboea</placeName>, and the reduction of silver, may have made it more profitable to
                  sacrifice principle to prudence and put away the large silver of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>. The last
                  coin, the tetradrachm of <persName corresp="#nomisma_antiochus_hierax">Antiochus Hierax</persName>, shows that the hoard was not finally put
                  away until the thirties of the third century; the occasion for it I have been unable to discover. Some obscure fate overtook a family which
                  had been thrifty for a long, long time.</p>
