            <p>In the first half of the ninth century the Muslim empire of the <orgName corresp="#nomisma_abbasids">‘Abbāsids</orgName> was both politically and culturally at the pinnacle of its power and creativity. With the exception of the far west the whole area conquered in the seventh and eighth centuries was controlled by the caliphs in Iraq, while the artistic activity of Samarra together with the religious and philosophical ferment in Baghdad and elsewhere testify to the profound spiritual vitality of the time. The second half of the century witnessed, on the other hand, a definite decadence in the political structure of the empire, which paved the way for the collapse of caliphal authority a century later. One of the signs of this decadence was the appearance in various parts of the empire of local dynasties which usurped to a greater or lesser degree the sovereignty of the caliphs. Among these dynasties one of the best known was that of the Ṭūlūnids of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> (868–905) which brought to Egypt a prosperity which the land of the Nile had not known for several centuries and which prepared the way for the brilliant later civilizations of the Fāṭimids and the Mamlūks. Among the many signs of the bounty of the time was the coinage established by the founder of the dynasty, which, according to mediaeval chroniclers, acquired an almost proverbial value. It is to this coinage and to the historical conclusions which can be drawn from it that this study is devoted.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">THE COINAGE OF THE <orgName corresp="#nomisma_tulunids">ṬŪLŪNIDS</orgName></hi>
            </head>
            <p>Some years ago the coin collection of Yacoub <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_76158805">Artin Pasha</name>, acquired by <name type="pname">Robert C. H. Brock</name> and presented by him to the University Museum in Philadelphia (hereafter U.M.), was transferred on indefinite loan to the American Numismatic Society. Dr. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_carpenter">G. C. Miles</name> has already devoted a monograph to Fāṭimid coinage and an article to Umayyad and ‘Abbāsid dinars,<ref target="#CH1-pg1-n1">1</ref> both of which were based in large part on the University Museum collection. Furthermore he has included some of the more outstanding specimens in his <hi rend="italic">Rare Islamic Coins.</hi>
               <ref target="#CH1-pg1-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This study of the coins of the Ṭūlūnid dynasty in Egypt was similarly originally based on the collection of the University Museum (35 coins, all gold), to which were added the 18 specimens of the American Numismatic Society. There is, although it is now almost eighty years old, a corpus of Ṭūlūnid coins made by <name type="pname">E. T. Rogers</name> in 1877, which included at least 15 coins which were to become part of the Pennsylvania collection.<ref target="#CH1-pg1-n3">3</ref>
               <name type="pname">Rogers</name> knew of 125 coins which he attributed to the Ṭūlūnids, and divided them into 58 types, a type being defined on the basis of mint, date, and other characteristics. A thorough search through publications since Rogers’ time has led me to count almost 600 Ṭūlūnid coins known in all, falling into 97 types based on differences in metal, date, mint, and inscription.<ref target="#CH1-pg1-n4">4</ref> There is
<pb n="2"/>
then some justification in assuming that a new publication of existing Ṭūlūnid coins is not out of place, since it will bring together documents which are only too often scattered in dozens of periodicals. Moreover, Rogers’ publication is purely analytical, giving only bare epigraphical and metrologic information. In fact one of the essential aims of numismatic studies is to provide the historian with documents which must be correlated with other sources. In Roman and Byzantine history, the works of <name type="pname">A. Alföldi</name>, <name type="pname">C. H. V. Sutherland</name>, <name type="pname">M. Grant</name>, and many others, and in Islamic history, the older works of Max van Berchem and recent studies by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_carpenter">G. C. Miles</name>, <name type="pname">J. Walker</name>, and others, have shown the extraordinary wealth of numismatic evidence for the understanding of civilization and history. In the specific case of the Ṭūlūnids a number of problems of great significance for the history of the ‘Abbāsid caliphate are posed and the coinage may perhaps be used to solve some of them.</p>
            <p>The first part of this study will be devoted to a catalogue of the coins known to me which can be assigned without doubt to the Ṭūlūnids; that is, those coins bearing the name of a member of the Ṭūlūnid family.<ref target="#CH1-pg2-n1">1</ref> Only different types of coins will be described, but in each case the number of known coins will be indicated. They can all be found in the appended bibliography. The metrologic information (weight in grams, diameter in millimeters) has been, whenever possible, based
<pb n="3"/>
on the coins of the ANS and of the University Museum in Philadelphia. Otherwise it has been copied from whatever publication has first dealt with a coin. Only one set of metro-logic characteristics is given whenever all coins whose weight and diameter are known are quite similar to each other in this respect. Any variation which may be of interest to the economic or political historian has been included, wherever it occurs. Since, on the whole, <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnid</name> coins follow the pattern of the classical '<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name> type in appearance and in epigraphy, full description will be given only once. It is assumed that, unless specifically noted, each coin follows the pattern of the one preceding it. Whenever possible, a bibliographical reference has been given for each coin in one of the two standard and most complete catalogues (British Museum, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>).<ref target="#CH1-pg3-n1">1</ref> Unpublished or rare issues are marked with an asterisk(*), illustrated specimens with a dagger (†).</p>
            <p>The second part will include discussions of a series of problems posed either by the coinage itself or by the history of the dynasty, for which coins may provide an answer. A detailed history of the Ṭūlūnid dynasty has not been included, since it is easily available in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Islam,<ref target="#CH1-pg3-n2">2</ref>
               </hi> in G. Wiet’s contribution to Hanotaux’ <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Nation Egyptienne,</hi> and especially in Zaky Hassan’s <hi rend="italic">Les Tulunides</hi> and Carl Becker’s superb evaluation of Egypt in Ṭūlūnid times in his <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur Geschichte Ägyptens.<ref target="#CH1-pg3-n3">3</ref>
               </hi> Most
<pb n="4"/>
of these studies have in fact used numismatic evidence, especially for establishing dates. But the historical problem of the Ṭūlūnids is a much wider one.</p>
            <p>It is often said that <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> became virtually independent, and his status is compared to that of the Ṭāhirids in Persia or to that of the Aghlabids in Ifrīqiyah.<ref target="#CH1-pg4-n1">1</ref> But it may be questioned whether the notion of independence is not in many ways ambiguous when applied in contemporary terms to what has been recently called “the Muslim City.”<ref target="#CH1-pg4-n2">2</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The intrinsic theoretical unity of the Muslim world, <hi rend="italic">dār al-Islām,</hi> has often been emphasized.<ref target="#CH1-pg4-n3">3</ref> But it is equally well known that, in practice, the middle of the third century A. H. saw the first breaking up of the physical unity of the Muslim empire. Together with it, or somewhat later, there appeared also, at the head of the “politico-religious unity” characteristic of Islam,<ref target="#CH1-pg4-n4">4</ref> a breakdown of the unity of command with the multiplication of <hi rend="italic">amīrs</hi> and later, <hi rend="italic">sulṭāns,</hi> who first in fact and then also in right shared with the Commander of the Faithful the leadership, actually even the sovereignty, of the Islamic community. Islam underwent a practical breakup of its theoretical structure both in the center of the caliphate and in the provinces which made up the empire.<ref target="#CH1-pg4-n5">5</ref> A study of the Ṭūlūnids can only concern itself with the latter phenomenon, but the Egyptian dynasty is
<pb n="5"/>
particularly important in this process of disintegration. Its early date is significant in the sense that it was the first true dynasty to develop within the Arab core of the Islamic empire and that, therefore, it created a precedent for all later developments. Furthermore, the personalities of the men who were involved in the <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnid</name> adventure (especially <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> and <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>) were such that through them one can get a glimpse of the ideology and of the motivations which led them to do and to say what they did and said.</p>
            <p>The problem is not so much one of establishing facts as of determining in what ways the political <hi rend="italic">morcellement</hi> of the empire was reconciled in men’s minds with the theoretical unity of Islam. In other words, how did the Ṭūlūnids (or any other third century A. H. dynasty) explain their own position in regard to the caliphate? The problem is not academic, for it is only through a study of each individual dynasty of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries that one can properly understand the later formalization of a new Muslim concept of sovereignty and of a new political and social situation after the arrival of the Seljuqs, when mediaeval Islam was transformed.<ref target="#CH1-pg5-n1">1</ref> For the early period we do not possess a systematic treatise such as that of al-Māwardi or an analysis of the contemporary situation such as al-Ghazzāli’s. Nor are the individual stories found among chroniclers always sufficient to suggest a clear picture of the situation.<ref target="#CH1-pg5-n2">2</ref> The epigraphical material, however, spotty as it may be, and in particular coins, whose date and minting place are generally known, can be of great interest. On the one hand, this material, in most cases, is rigorously contemporary with the event with which it was connected; and, on the other hand,
<pb n="6"/>
it is not a mere recording, but a definite expression of power and sovereignty.<ref target="#CH1-pg6-n1">1</ref> This study will attempt to determine, on the basis of coinage, inscriptions, and texts, the nature of the Ṭūlūnids’ power in Egypt in relation to the caliphate and in what ways their power was similar to or dissimilar from the contemporary sovereignty of Aghlabid and Ṭāhirid princes.<ref target="#CH1-pg6-n2">2</ref> Such an analysis is particularly justified in the case of the Ṭūlūnids, since, as will be shown, <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> for one was very careful throughout his life to have his acts sanctioned by religious authorities.<ref target="#CH1-pg6-n3">3</ref> It will be attempted to show that this was not a purely formal habit and that the life and utterances of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> indicate a high degree of religious consciousness in all of his activities. But, even
<pb n="7"/>
without this indication, it could be argued that his acts and decisions had in some way or other to be adapted to the politico-religious thinking of the time. Even if they were not always in accord with the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> consensus of theological opinion, they must have been agreeable to a certain <hi rend="italic">fraction</hi> of the religious community and, therefore, must have reflected a definite religious and ideological trend of the time. Thus, insofar as it is based on official epigraphical material, this study will not concern itself primarily with the political, economic, social, or military aspects of Ṭūlūnid history, which have been well analyzed by <name type="pname">C. Becker</name>, <name type="pname">G. Wiet</name>, <name type="pname">Z. Hassan</name>, and others (unless the coinage can lead us to new conclusions), but with the ideological or theoretical frame within which this history took place.</p>
            <p>This evaluation of Ṭūlūnid coinage as a political and historical document falls under two headings: the coinage of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> and the coinage of <name type="pname">Khumārawayh ibn Aḥmad</name>. In the case of the latter, only the coinage of the first few years of his rule is of any significance. Late Ṭūlūnid coinage is of little interest and serves only as a useful contemporary milestone for dates which are otherwise clearly established through texts.</p>

               <p>One should note that coinage or, in a more general way epigraphy, is not the only non-literary source which can be used to clarify the political and ideological relationship of various dynasties to the caliphate. Others are, for instance, clothes and arms. These are comparatively well known and accessible as far as the Mameluk period is concerned, after the studies of <name type="pname">L. A. Mayer</name> and <name type="pname">D. S. Rice</name>. But, so far as the earlier period is concerned, only a very careful combing of the sources could lead to the establishment of a consistent order among the numerous "robes of honor." Cf. some preliminary remarks in Tyan, pp. 488 ff., especially p. 496, where, of course, only caliphal dresses and <hi rend="italic">insignia</hi> are mentioned. The essential point is that, when the literary sources are few or unreliable, and even when they are abundant, the mediaeval Islamic world has left us an enormous body of material which, following Sauvaget, one may call “archaeological,” and which supplements, when it does not actually supersede many a literary document. Cf. <name type="pname">J. Sauvaget</name>, <hi rend="italic">Introduction à l'histoire de l'Orient Musulman</hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>, 1946), pp. 48 ff.</p>

               </head>
               <p>According to the mediaeval chroniclers, <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, after some thirty-five years spent either as a student at Tarsus or as an officer in Samarra—where his life was largely devoid of the usual more or less criminal intrigues which characterized the ‘<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name> court after the death of al-Mutawakkil—was given his first appointment in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> in 254 A.H./868 A.D. <name type="pname">Al-Ṭabari</name> simply says that in that year Bayākbāk, or Bākbāk, the apanagist of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and Aḥmad’s stepfather, “entrusted ('<hi rend="italic">aqada)</hi>
                  <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> with the governorship of Miṣr.”<ref target="#CH3-pg28-n1">1</ref> Maqrīzi and <name type="pname">ibn Sa'īd</name>, who repeat the contemporary account of <name type="pname">ibn al-Dāyah</name> and whose reliability as far as <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> under <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> is concerned is greater than al-Ṭabari’s, are more specific. According to them, <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> was appointed as the agent of Bayākbāk in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">(fī khilāfatihi 'ala Miṣr)</hi> and in fact his appointment was only over the main part of the province, <hi rend="italic">al-qaṣbah,</hi> to the exclusion of the regions which depended from it, such as Alexandria, etc.<ref target="#CH3-pg28-n2">2</ref> For sixteen years thereafter, until his death in 270 A.H./884 A.D., <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> remained in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. But the nature of his power there did not remain the same throughout these years.</p>
               <pb n="29"/>
               <p>The second stage in Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn’s rule over <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> began in 257 A.H., when Yārjūkh, the new apanagist of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and Aḥmad’s father-in-law, gave him control over Alexandria and Barqah.<ref target="#CH3-pg29-n1">1</ref> But the major new event occurred in 258. In that year Aḥmad received control over the finances of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, after the removal of his rival <name type="pname">ibn al-Mudabbir</name>, and also the governorship (<hi rend="italic">wilāyah</hi>) of the Syrian marshes.<ref target="#CH3-pg29-n2">2</ref> And <name type="pname">ibn Sa'īd</name> adds that the letter of appointment which was brought to <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> by a personal servant, <hi rend="italic">khādim,</hi> of the caliph al-Mu'tamid, was witnessed by two respected judges, one from Wāsit, the other one from the marshes.<ref target="#CH3-pg29-n3">3</ref> The fact itself and the station of the people involved would further enhance the suggestion made above that, in all his dealings with the caliphate, <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> was always careful to receive the approbation of the religious leaders of Islam.</p>
               <p>In the same year, 258/871–2 Yārjūkh died and <name type="pname">Ja'far ibn al-Mu'tamid</name>, later called al-Mufawwaḍ ila Allāh, became
<pb n="30"/>
heir to the caliphate.<ref target="#CH3-pg30-n1">1</ref> Some sources assert that it is soon after that, in 259, that <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> became independent, while others have even believed him to have been so as early as 258. But the literary evidence does not give any information to suggest any difference in Aḥmad’s status between 258 and 259; and the two late texts (<name type="pname">ibn Khaldūn</name> and <name type="pname">ibn Taghribirdi</name>) which do speak of independence are contradicted either by earlier documents or by their own further accounts.<ref target="#CH3-pg30-n2">2</ref>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time, 258 is the date which is usually taken to have witnessed the first appearance of Ṭūlūnid coinage. In 1854 and 1856 <name type="pname">F. Soret</name> published two copper coins, dated in 258, struck in Miṣr, and bearing in the lower part of the reverse the sign |◊||, which was interpreted by Soret to mean Aḥmad.<ref target="#CH3-pg30-n3">3</ref> The reading is, of course, unacceptable, but these two coins have been taken by <name type="pname">Rogers</name> as nos. 1 and 2 of his classification of Ṭūlūnid coins. In 1904, <name type="pname">E. de Zambaur</name> published a coin with the same sign at the bottom of the reverse, but without any trace of mint or date. Over the
<pb n="31"/>
sign appears the name <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, while on the obverse the first part of the profession of faith is followed by the name of the caliph al-Mu'tamid ‘ala Allāh.<ref target="#CH3-pg31-n1">1</ref> But the two Soret coins did not bear the name of the Commander of the Faithful. Zambaur assumed this sign to be a date, 262, but in a second article<ref target="#CH3-pg31-n2">2</ref> he seems to have accepted Nützel’s suggestion that it is a mere ornament. In 1950, George C. Miles published two similar coins bearing the probable date of 259,<ref target="#CH3-pg31-n3">3</ref> while the collection of the American Numismatic Society contains a number of other coppers of the same type. Five specimens of a similar variety were discovered by the American excavators at Tarsus.<ref target="#CH3-pg31-n4">4</ref> The question is whether these coins all belong to one group and whether they should all be considered as Ṭūlūnid, bearing in mind that the problem is further complicated by the fact that, with an exception to be mentioned presently, no other copper coin is known until the rule of Khumārawayh, twelve years later.</p>
               <p>A first point to be made is to compare the evidence of the <hi rend="italic">fals</hi> with that of the other coins from Miṣr. Egyptian gold and silver issues are known for almost the whole period between 255 and 267.<ref target="#CH3-pg31-n5">5</ref> All these issues, except one, are purely
<pb n="32"/>
‘<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name>, without any mention of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>. The 265 coin in the ANS, the only <hi rend="italic">dirhem</hi> of the whole group, is of particular importance, since it suggests that the two undescribed ones of 264 were also purely ‘Abbāsid. But, among these coins, one issue poses a problem and it is noteworthy that it is the 258 issue, i.e., the issue which is contemporary with the major group of problematic copper coins. Five of these coins are known to me: one in the Bibliothèque Nationale,<ref target="#CH3-pg32-n1">1</ref> two in the University Museum collection,<ref target="#CH3-pg32-n2">2</ref> one in the National Library (ex-Khedivial) in Cairo,<ref target="#CH3-pg32-n3">3</ref> and one in a group of coins published by <name type="pname">Rogers</name> in 1875.<ref target="#CH3-pg32-n4">4</ref> All these coins, the only ones known for Miṣr in 258 (with the exception discussed in note 3), have on the reverse, under the name of the caliph, at the place where one generally finds the name of the governor, a word ( ?) which so far has not been identified (P<hi rend="smallcaps">LATE</hi> III). But there is no doubt that it cannot be <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>. In other words for the year 258 (and perhaps 259 also as far as the copper coins are concerned) we deal with a body of gold and copper coins with a strange sign on the reverse and no obvious <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnid</name> name.</p>
               <p>The second remark which can be made is based on a comparatively recent archaeological discovery. Among the coins found by the Tarsus excavators, we meet not only with the
<pb n="33"/>
five previously mentioned coins with the name of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, but also with 27 specimens of a copper type which bears on the reverse the name of <name type="pname">MuṬammad ibn Mūsa</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg33-n1">1</ref> Similar coins were already known in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_paris">Paris</name>
                  <ref target="#CH3-pg33-n2">2</ref> and by Soret.<ref target="#CH3-pg33-n3">3</ref>
                  <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_carpenter">G. C. Miles</name> has argued that <name type="pname">Muḥammad ibn Mūsa</name> was in fact a nephew of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, who, under Khumārawayh, governed Tarsus for a short time in 279/892–3,<ref target="#CH3-pg33-n4">4</ref> and that this whole group of coins should be assigned to the <hi rend="italic">thughūr al-sha'miyah,</hi> which, from 258, were under the theoretical control of the Ṭūlūnids. This argument is most plausible and the typological similarity of the Zambaur coin to this later group added to the facts that it is epigraphically notably different from the 258 coins and that a number of specimens of the same type were found at Tarsus would indeed suggest that all the coppers bearing the name of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> should then be connected with the <hi rend="italic">thughūr.</hi> It is, of course, impossible to determine the date of these coins with any certainty. But since the dated Miṣr specimens do not bear any proper name, and in particular not the name of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, it is doubtful whether the Zambaur and Tarsus coins should be considered as contemporary with them. A date after 265, that is after Aḥmad’s triumphal expedition through Syria, is perhaps more likely,<ref target="#CH3-pg33-n5">5</ref> inasmuch as this date would correspond with the first issues of coins in Miṣr with the name of the Ṭūlūnid prince.</p>
               <p>In other words the copper coins bearing the name of a <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnid</name> should be attributed to the Syrian marshes and are
<pb n="34"/>
probably to be dated after 265, while the coins struck in Miṣr in 258 and 259 do not have any <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnid</name> name. The only point of contact between the two groups of coins is that on both the sign |◊|| occurs and the question which arises is, of course, the origin of that sign. Chronologically the Egyptian samples should be considered as the first to have used this sign, but did the sign originate in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>? To my knowledge there is no similar decorative motive in Islamic coinage, either before or after the Ṭūlūnid period. A heraldic sign or some symbol of Central Asian Turkish origin seems very unlikely for so early a period. But, if one considers that this type of copper coin was most common in the <hi rend="italic">thughūr</hi> area, it may be suggested that the sign was an imitation of one of the marks of value, monograms, letters, or countermarks on Byzantine coins.<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n1">1</ref> Although such adaptations of non-Islamic, particularly Byzantine, types are well known at various times throughout Islamic numismatic history,<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n2">2</ref> this explanation cannot be, for the time being, more than a simple suggestion. It may perhaps be strengthened somewhat by the fact that <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> spent many years in Tarsus, studying with the many learned men who were there and participating in the constant Holy War which was waged at the frontier.<ref target="#CH3-pg34-n3">3</ref> It is because of this attachment
<pb n="35"/>
to Tarsus and to the idea of the war against the Byzantines that he received the financial and political control of <hi rend="italic">thughūr</hi> before acquiring Syria. In the little-known early <hi rend="italic">ghāzi</hi> milieu of Tarsus, Byzantine objects and coins must have been quite common; and it is possible that attempts were made then to copy or transform Byzantine symbols, just as the latter certainly were taken over a few centuries later when the Danishmend and Ortoqid cultures developed in another area, but in the same relationship to the Christian civilization of Anatolia. It is quite possible that <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> had seen some such Byzantine type, and then adapted it to Egyptian copper coins, since there is no reason to doubt his genuine concern for the <hi rend="italic">jihād</hi> against the infidels, which he wanted to undertake as an <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi> rather than as an individual soldier of fortune.<ref target="#CH3-pg35-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time it must be emphasized that, whether one considers the motive of the diamond and three bars as an imitation from Byzantium or as a mere decoration, the copper coinage on which it appears in no way reflects the position of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>
                  <hi rend="italic">vis-à-vis</hi> the caliphate. If it were not for the Zambaur and Tarsus coins which bear the sign and the name of the prince, there would not be any justification in considering the coins as <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnid</name>. Even then, these copper coins, which can by analogy be associated with the <hi rend="italic">person</hi> of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, can in no way be taken as evidence of his office, much less so of his independence from the caliphate. In a strict sense, whatever power <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> may have acquired in 258, it was not considered by him, or by the caliphate, as a type of appointment which permitted him to add his own name to that of the caliph on the coinage of the province of which he was vice-governor and financial director. In that sense his position was definitely
<pb n="36"/>
different and lower than that of the numerous governors who, before him, had put their names below the names of the caliph on the coins issued in their capitals.<ref target="#CH3-pg36-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>This still formally subservient position of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> is further confirmed by the fact that the known <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> inscriptions from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> dated in 260, 262, and 263<ref target="#CH3-pg36-n2">2</ref> do not mention the name of the then governor of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. Yet the letter of appointment which was sent by al-Mu'tamid in 258 did mention <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> together with finances, although the text is admittedly quite vague.<ref target="#CH3-pg36-n3">3</ref> A third series of more or less contemporary documents is provided by a weight and a stamp recently published by <name type="pname">M. Jungfleisch</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg36-n4">4</ref> The stamp is dated 260 and mentions neither the name of the caliph nor of the Ṭūlūnid. The weight is dated 259 and does bear the name of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, called there <hi rend="italic">mawla amīr al-mu’minīn</hi>.<ref target="#CH3-pg36-n5">5</ref> The formula used on these two objects, as has been pointed out by <name type="pname">M. Jungfleisch</name>, is interesting in that it used the full expression <hi rend="italic">bism Allāh al-raḥmān al-raḥīm,</hi> which is only known on two objects from the times of <name type="pname">al-Wāthiq</name> and <name type="pname">al-Mutawakkil</name> and which had been abandoned by ibn Ṭūlūn’s immediate predecessors. These two objects seem to confirm the evidence of the coins: in 259 we meet with the name of the <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnid</name> on an official object, just as he is indirectly suggested on the copper coins, but, in both
<pb n="37"/>
cases, we are dealing with a practice which was common to many governors who have never been suspected of trying to become independent. One may call this "routine" procedure, except for the fact that the usage of a less typical formula on glass (a formula, it may be noted, which is characterized by the completeness of its divine invocation) and of a mysterious sign on coinage does indeed suggest that we are dealing with a rather extraordinary man. At the same time, the glass inscription, like the gold coins between 259 and 265 and the <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> formulas which belong to the usual ‘<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name> type, does not mention the name of the governor.<ref target="#CH3-pg37-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, in dealing with this group of Egyptian documents between the years 254 and 265, we are led to the conclusion that there is only one piece of evidence which definitely and unequivocally mentions the name of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>: the 259 weight. The coincidence of a curious sign on a group of coins of 258 and 259 with the appointment, known through texts, of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> to the control of the finances and of the administration of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and its similarity to the sign on a coin from a different area suggests, without proving, that the copper coins could be considered as <name type="pname">Ṭūlūnid</name>. But in none of these cases do we meet with any indication that the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> ruler of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> considered himself independent from the caliphate. If it had not been for what followed, these documents, or the corresponding literary texts, would not have warranted any extensive study. As it is, however, when connected with the texts, they do offer a great deal of interest in illustrating two important points in any explanation of ibn Ṭūlūn’s career: his concern for the absolute
<pb n="38"/>
legality of his acts towards the caliphate,<ref target="#CH3-pg38-n1">1</ref> and a strange interest in the activities of the Byzantino-Arab frontier.<ref target="#CH3-pg38-n2">2</ref> His actions seem meant to appear as conforming to the dictates of Islamic legal and political theory. It must be recalled that the first part of the third century A.H. was one of the most flourishing ones in the development of Islamic civilization, but one that is especially characterized by the activities of the great traditionists and codifiers of Islamic law. Practically alone among the Turkish officers, whose scandals fill the political chronicle of Iraq, <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> takes some part in the religious life of the time and withdraws to the frontier with its <hi rend="italic">ribāts</hi> and its <hi rend="italic">ghāzis</hi> without taking his family along.<ref target="#CH3-pg38-n3">3</ref> It would not seem consequent then to suggest that his life of earnest retirement was followed by a sudden and intense involvement in intrigues which would ultimately make him independent, and put him in a position contrary to the very nature of Islamic political theory. That he did intrigue to achieve his aims is amply proved by the texts: it was the only means to achieve any result. But to attribute to him an aim to match his means is not to do justice to his past; and such an interpretation is certainly not justified by the contemporary and official documents of the time—as opposed to the later texts, which, influenced as they were by the later developments of Islamic history, tended to simplify earlier events. And it will be attempted to show that these very same religious and legal concerns directed ibn Ṭūlūn’s later actions.</p>
               <p>We must, however, first turn to one unsolved problem of the coinage of the time, the problem of the five gold coins of 258. These, it will be remembered, are perfectly normal ‘<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name> coins, except for the fact that on the fifth line of
<pb n="39"/>
the reverse area we meet with a word which has not, so far, been understood [P<hi rend="smallcaps">late</hi> III]. It has been read as <hi rend="italic">Najrān</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Baḥrayn,</hi> the latter being properly discarded by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_carpenter">G. C. Miles</name>,<ref target="#CH3-pg39-n1">1</ref> since Miṣr appears as a mint on other coins of the same type, and since this would have been a most unusual place for the mint name at the time. The position of the word would almost require that it be a name, presumably the name of the governor responsible for the mint. But the possible names of <name type="pname">Yārjūkh</name>, the absentee lord of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> in 258, <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, or <name type="pname">Ṭa'laj</name> or <name type="pname">Ṭughj</name>, who briefly replaced <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> while the latter went to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name>, do not fit the epigraphical data; and I have been unable to find a possible explanation for this word. Could it be a metrological term? Or are we dealing here with some symbol?</p>
               <p>The first evidence we possess for a change in ibn Ṭūlūn’s position occurs in 265. From this year we have two inscriptions. One is on a textile.<ref target="#CH3-pg39-n2">2</ref> It is of the usual type, except for the fact that the praise of the caliph is followed by the words: "this is what the <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi> has [ordered] to be executed in the public <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz,</hi> in Miṣr, in the year 265." The name of the <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi> is not given, but there is little doubt that it is <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>. The other two <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> inscriptions known during his life-time and after 265 are both of the type of the 265 one, not of earlier ones.<ref target="#CH3-pg39-n3">3</ref> The second inscription of 265 is the well-known one celebrating the foundation of the mosque of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg39-n4">4</ref> In it we meet again with the title of <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi> and with the expression <hi rend="italic">mawla amīr al-mu'minīn,<ref target="#CH3-pg39-n5">5</ref>
                  </hi> but the importance
<pb n="40"/>
                  <pb n="41"/>
of the inscription as a document consists essentially in the emphasis given in it to religious themes not usually found in construction inscriptions.<ref target="#CH3-pg41-n1">1</ref> Aside from the usual Qur’ānic quotations (II, 256; IX, 18; XXIV, 36–38), we meet with quotations (XLVIII, 29; III, 106) which are less common on building inscriptions and which emphasize the duty of the Muslim against the infidel,<ref target="#CH3-pg41-n2">2</ref> thus pointing once more to the importance given by <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> to the religious motivations of his acts and to the Holy War. Expressions such as <hi rend="italic">tasniyah al-dīn</hi> and '<hi rend="italic">ulfah al-mu'minīn</hi> within the inscription itself give it an exhortative quality which was common enough on mosque inscriptions but whose emphasis relates it fairly closely to the later Seljuq and Ayyūbid inscriptions, at a time when the main task of the rulers was to restore the spiritual unity of the Islamic community. These two inscriptions are then followed in 266 by the gold coins struck in Miṣr with the name of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> under the name of the caliph. It is, therefore, only from that date that one could conceivably speak of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> as officially independent from the caliphate. But, even then, two questions are raised by this innovation. First, why 266 and not any other year after 258? And, second, what exactly can be meant by independence in the third century A. H., bearing in mind of course that we are not dealing so much with the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> situation as with the <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> one? Is this the same kind of independence as is evidenced in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> at the same time?</p>
               <p>The reason for raising the question of the year 266 is that, so far as one can gather from the texts, there was no new
<pb n="42"/>
appointment given to <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> in that year. One would have to assume that more or less arbitrarily, in that year, <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> suddenly decided to give an official confirmation to his actual rule over <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. However, the events of the preceding three years, that is since 263, together with the events which followed 266, may suggest a more complex explanation for the introduction of the Ṭūlūnid’s name on the coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, and one that would be more consistent with his political and legal ideas.</p>
               <p>In 258, according to <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name>, <name type="pname">al-Mu‘tamid</name> had given his brother <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> the provinces of Diyār Muḍar,<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n1">1</ref> Kinnasrīn, and <name type="pname">al-‘Awāsim</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n2">2</ref> This tradition is definitely suspect, since it is contradicted by the existence of two coins from al-Rāfiqah (in the Diyār Muḍar) dated in 259 and bearing the name of Ja‘far.<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n3">3</ref> According to ibn-Sa‘īd, the whole empire was divided into two parts, the western part being farmed out to <name type="pname">Ja'far al-Mufawwaḍ,</name> al-Mu'tamid’s son and first in line of succession.<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n4">4</ref> No date is given by <name type="pname">ibn-Sa'īd</name>, although a later Egyptian tradition (<name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34592187">Taghribirdi</name>) gives the date 256;<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n5">5</ref> but the same event is related by <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name> for the year 261.<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n6">6</ref> The coinage of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> has the name of <name type="pname">Ja'far</name> as early as 258,<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n7">7</ref> and, since the name appears already in 256,<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n8">8</ref> one
<pb n="43"/>
might assume that the division was effected as soon as al-Mu'tamid became caliph. On the other hand, the 256 coin is from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_baghdad">Baghdad</name> which, according to the texts of the division, belonged to the realm controlled by al-Muwaffaq. Taghribirdi’s date is thus certainly wrong, but whether this means that 261 should be accepted as the official date is not entirely certain. The numismatic and <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> evidence does confirm the fact of the division,<ref target="#CH3-pg42-n4">4</ref> but to my knowledge there is no epigraphical material between the years 256 and 261 which would give us the exact date of the division. In using the name <name type="pname">Ja'far</name> on the coins the mintmasters could have referred to the heir apparent to the throne. But at the same time it should be noted that we do not have any textual reference to al-Mu'tamid’s heir apparent until 261, in Ṭabari’s text, from which it appears that this is the date at which the name al-Mufawwaḍ was given to him. Ṭabari’s statement in this respect is confirmed by the coins, and the date 261 seems the most likely one for the division of the empire.<ref target="#CH3-pg43-n2">2</ref> Why then does Ja'far’s name appear on coins before 261? It has been suggested by <name type="pname">Becker</name> that it is because, at the death of Yārjūkh in 258, Ja’far was probably made successor to all of the latter’s functions.<ref target="#CH3-pg43-n3">3</ref> But while this is possible,<ref target="#CH3-pg43-n4">4</ref> it would
<pb n="44"/>
not explain the existence of coins as early as 256 with the name of <name type="pname">Ja'far</name>. One would have to dissociate in Ṭabari's text the two facts of the division of the empire and of the succession to al-Mu‘tamid. <name type="pname">Ja'far</name> was already heir apparent in 256. In 261 he acquired a <hi rend="italic">laqab</hi> and was associated with al-Muwaffaq in the rule of the empire, both decisions being strengthened by the sending of the agreement to Makkah, where it was put in the Ka'bah, following probably the precedent of the earlier agreement between <name type="pname">al-Amīn</name> and <name type="pname">al-Ma’mūn</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg44-n1">1</ref> As far as <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> is concerned the years 258–261 are characterized by the fact that there was no proper authority replacing Yārjūkh. <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> did not receive a new appointment nor did he accomplish any action which would indicate that he considered himself independent, although, of course, there was no one to prevent him from doing what he wanted.</p>
               <p>The situation was regularized in 261 when Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn’s area of influence, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and the <hi rend="italic">thughūr,</hi> fell to the lot of <name type="pname">Ja'far</name> and, while al-Muwaffaq had his hands full in the murderous Zanj war, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, with its wealth and army, was the only remaining force in the empire. The events which followed are well known and can be found in all reference books. Al-Muwaffaq asked for money, <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz,</hi> slaves, and horses. But at the same time al-Mu'tamid, the caliph, sent a secret message to the effect that al-Muwaffaq’s messenger was but a spy sent over to plot against <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>. The latter kept the messenger under surveillance, but he did make an important contribution for the Zanj war, which, let us note it again, was witnessed officially by various Egyptian military and religious leaders. The sum was thought insufficient by <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> and the insulting manner
<pb n="45"/>
in which his envoy was received led him to write an injurious letter to <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> and to remove him from his position. He even levied an army under the command of Mūsa ibn Būghā to move against <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name>. <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> also started to build up his defenses, but at the same time he wrote a letter to <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>, the text of which has been preserved by <name type="pname">Ibn Sa'īd</name> and <name type="pname">Maqrīzi</name>, and which is one of the most important documents to explain all further actions of the Egyptian prince, especially if we keep in mind the all-important fact that the caliph himself had advised <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> against sending help to <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>. The main point of the letter is legal: "he (<name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>) has no power over my office; he did not invest me with it... The division [of the empire] was between him and the <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi>
                  <name type="pname">Ja'far</name>. The oath of allegiance was sworn to them provided they keep their faith ... [If not,] the <hi rend="italic">community (al-ummah)</hi> [<hi rend="italic">may</hi>]<hi rend="italic"> break from him and from</hi> [<hi rend="italic">their</hi>]<hi rend="italic"> oath to him,</hi>"<ref target="#CH3-pg45-n1">1</ref>
                  <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> did try to use force, but his army stopped at Raqqah and it soon disintegrated. The only result was that <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> lost his official control over the <hi rend="italic">thughūr,</hi> but here again the reason given by <name type="pname">Ibn Sa'īd</name> is interesting.<ref target="#CH3-pg45-n2">2</ref> It is that the <hi rend="italic">thughūr</hi> should be held by "somebody who would be there, who would participate in the <hi rend="italic">ghazw</hi> with its people, while <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> had sent somebody who was not doing anything about it." If one recalls the attachment of <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> to the frontier area, his next move is perfectly understandable. Disregarding his dismissal, which he probably believed had been forced on al-Mu'tamid by his brother, and profiting from the fact that Amajūr, the governor of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, had died in 264, he invaded <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> and received the allegiance of the
<pb n="46"/>
local prefects. But here again, while the possession of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> is a long-standing economic and strategic necessity for whoever rules <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, it should be noted that formally <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> was only asking for the passage of his army to Tarsus, from where he was planning to start the war against the Christians.<ref target="#CH3-pg46-n1">1</ref> Although the Tarsus expedition was only half successful, he intended to stay there;<ref target="#CH3-pg46-n2">2</ref> but the news arrived of his son's revolt in 265. Returning to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> in 266, he gathered forces against his son; and in that same year the first coins bearing his name appeared in Fusṭāṭ, although no new investment was bestowed on him, nor had he taken any new title for himself.</p>
               <p>It has been argued<ref target="#CH3-pg46-n3">3</ref> that at that time <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> finally felt that he had reached the pinnacle of his power. But it must be admitted that <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> had been just as powerful and secure two years earlier when Mūsa ibn Būghā’s army
<pb n="47"/>
collapsed in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</name>. Furthermore, the example of his own lieutenant Lū'lū', who, in 268, issued coins with his own name in Rāfiqah, shows that it was not necessary to wait until one’s power was fully established to start using the privileges of the <hi rend="italic">sikkah.</hi> Aḥmad’s action must, I believe, be explained in terms of his opinion on what was happening in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</name> at the time. His earlier letter had shown that he believed that <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> had usurped a power which did not belong to him and his relations with <name type="pname">al-Mu'tamid</name> led him to believe that the caliph felt the same way.</p>
               <p>Around 266, <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> went a step further and assumed that the caliph was no longer free of his movements, that he was virtually the prisoner of his brother. The events which followed have been well summarized by <name type="pname">Hassan</name> in his history of the Ṭūlūnids:<ref target="#CH3-pg47-n1">1</ref> al-Mu'tamid’s unsuccessful flight from <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</name>; the attempt to establish the caliphate in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>; Aḥmad’s dismissal by <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> and his replacement by Isḥāq ibn Kundāj, the governor of Mosul; his unsuccessful expedition to occupy <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_mecca">Mecca</name>; and finally the meeting at Damascus in 269, when the judges and religious leaders of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> were gathered to hear about the tragic state of the caliph and to exclude <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> from the succession to the throne. The meeting in Damascus is the crucial act in ibn Ṭūlūn’s activities. He did not try to use religious authority to foster the aims of his own ambition. Rather he tried to persuade the religious authorities of the truth and validity of his own inner conviction that the Commander of the Faithful was a prisoner and that he had to be delivered.<ref target="#CH3-pg47-n2">2</ref> The meeting of 269 was certainly not called on the spur of the moment, but had been brought about by a long series of events which are not always very clear in the
<pb n="48"/>
sources.<ref target="#CH3-pg48-n1">1</ref> It may be suggested that the appearance of the name of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> on the coins of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> in 266 can provide us with the date at which the vice-governor of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and director of its finances felt that, since his contacts with the caliphate through proper channels were broken and since the caliph could no longer voice proper authority, he could participate in the official right of <hi rend="italic">sikkah.</hi> In fact it was his duty to do so.</p>
               <p>For this whole development illustrates yet another significant point. In the eleventh-century <hi rend="italic">al-Aḥkam al-Sulṭāniyah</hi> of al-Māwardi, there is a passage which discusses the case when the freedom of the <hi rend="italic">imām</hi> is impaired.<ref target="#CH3-pg48-n2">2</ref> Two possibilities exist: either a subordinate of the <hi rend="italic">imām</hi> takes more power than that to which he is entitled, or the <hi rend="italic">imām</hi> is the prisoner of a victorious enemy, a polytheist or a rebellious subject. In the first case the procedure is for the <hi rend="italic">imām</hi> to look for an ally or helper who will put an end to the domination of the usurper; in the second case, the whole community (<hi rend="italic">ummah)</hi> must try to liberate him, through arms or through ransom. It could be argued that, in the case of the relationship between <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> and the caliphate, an evolution occurred which corresponds to the two possibilities outlined by al-Māwardi. First, the caliph, feeling that <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> took on too much power,<ref target="#CH3-pg48-n3">3</ref> appealed to <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> for help.</p>
               <pb n="49"/>
               <p>The second step appears to have been taken by <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> independently from the caliphate, when he was led to believe—or tried to make others believe<ref target="#CH3-pg49-n1">1</ref>—that the caliph was a prisoner of his brother. In the first act of the drama, at the time of his letter to <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>, <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> was still considering himself as bound to the agreement which made <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> second in succession to the caliphate. It is only when he thought it incumbent upon himself, as the head of the only sizeable force in Islam outside of al-Muwaffaq’s, to move against the latter—or shortly before that—that he felt free to strike coins with his own name below that of the caliph and with the name of the heir apparent and lord of the West, al-Mufawwaḍ, on the obverse. Through his appeal to the <hi rend="italic">ijmā'</hi> of the religious leaders of the area under his control, through his usage of a procedure which later became part of the textbooks on Islamic law, <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> also shows that his acts corresponded without doubt to a legal thought which must have been formulated somewhere in his time and which he probably learned during his years at Tarsus. In this sense, it is interesting to compare him to his opponent in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> itself, Bakkār ibn Qutaybah, the chief <hi rend="italic">qāḍi</hi> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>,<ref target="#CH3-pg49-n2">2</ref> who refused to accept the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> verdict on the grounds that there was insufficient proof of the plight of <name type="pname">al-Mu'tamid</name> and that <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> had not, therefore, forfeited his position.<ref target="#CH3-pg49-n3">3</ref> Bakkār certainly believed that the preservation of the faith was in a way independent from political contingencies.<ref target="#CH3-pg49-n4">4</ref> Thus, next to ibn Ṭūlūn’s comparative
<pb n="50"/>
radicalism, there seems to appear in Bakkār that principle of <hi rend="italic">ḍarūriyah</hi> (necessity) which will be so much more strongly emphasized by <name type="pname">al-Māwardi</name> and <name type="pname">al-Ghazzāli</name>, several centuries later.<ref target="#CH3-pg50-n1">1</ref> It would be interesting to know to what extent and in what ways these two attitudes, this "ambivalence" so characteristic of any living culture,<ref target="#CH3-pg50-n2">2</ref> corresponded to any well-defined position of the religious and legal groups of Islam in the ninth century.</p>
               <p>Another question raised at this stage is that of the origins of ibn Ṭūlūn’s attitude. Does his legal framework reflect that of the early <hi rend="italic">ghāzi</hi> of Islam? Too little is known about the organization and the life of the frontier in the ninth and tenth centuries A.D., but the previously quoted statement of <name type="pname">ibn Hawqal</name>
                  <ref target="#CH3-pg50-n3">3</ref> suggests that there was an intensive intellectual life there together with the constant warfare.<ref target="#CH3-pg50-n4">4</ref> We may meet in early Islam with a frontier psychology which is perhaps better known in the case of the later Danishmends, but which may at that time have been characterized by strict obedience to religious and legal principles.<ref target="#CH3-pg50-n5">5</ref> The literary evidence is not very clear on the question of ibn Ṭūlūn’s religious
<pb n="51"/>
affiliation. According to <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34592187">Taghribirdi</name> and the Egyptian tradition he was a <hi rend="italic">ḥanīfite,<ref target="#CH3-pg51-n1">1</ref>
                  </hi> like Bakkār, and this is accepted by <name type="pname">Hassan</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg51-n2">2</ref> But another possibility is suggested by ibn al-Athīr,<ref target="#CH3-pg51-n3">3</ref> who, although late, was fairly well informed on Ṭūlūnid matters.<ref target="#CH3-pg51-n4">4</ref> His description of <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> mentions the latter not only as a pious man full of concern for religious problems, but also as a staunch <hi rend="italic">shāfi'ite.</hi> The question cannot be settled without a more thorough attempt at comparing ibn Ṭūlūn’s actions and opinions with the lessons of the two schools, but could it be perhaps that, in his somewhat puritan approach, <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> had been influenced by certain <hi rend="italic">shāfi'ite</hi> methods of thought?<ref target="#CH3-pg51-n5">5</ref>
               </p>
               <p>If these hypotheses are acceptable, one can see how the coinage of <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> serves to qualify the notion of the independence of the first dynasty of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. We must now examine the problem from another direction and attempt to compare the expression of sovereignty of <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> with that of the other dynasties of the century. The Ṭāhirids and the Aghlabids, although both dynasties started considerably earlier than the Ṭūlūnids and although the collapse of the Tāhirids actually corresponded to the rise of the Ṭūlūnids, are most likely to be fruitful as comparative subjects, since the establishment of the literally contemporary Ṣaffārids was the result of a conquest, while <name type="pname">Ibrāhīm ibn al-Aghlab</name> and <name type="pname">Ṭāhir ibn al-Ḥusayn</name>, just as <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, were appointed to their offices.</p>
               <p>The 184/800 appointment of Ibrāhīm as governor (<hi rend="italic">amīr</hi>)<ref target="#CH3-pg51-n6">6</ref> of Ifrīqiyah was truly "la solution avantageuse d’une situation
<pb n="52"/>
difficile qui n’avait que trop duré."<ref target="#CH3-pg52-n1">1</ref> The "difficult situation" was not the ambition of one leader, but the chaos of North African politics in the late eighth century. Ibrāhīm ibn al-Aghlab appeared to be the only leader who could unite all parties, and Hārūn al-Rashīd empowered him to do so. From then until the end of the dynasty we do not have much evidence of any continuous political relationship between the various Aghlabid rulers and the caliphs. In particular there is no indication that each Aghlabid prince was invested anew by the Commander of the Faithful.<ref target="#CH3-pg52-n2">2</ref> At the same time we have no evidence that there was any break between <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_baghdad">Baghdad</name> and Qayrawān. In one case where it is related that Ziyādah Allāh, while drunk, wrote a challenging letter to <name type="pname">al-Ma’mūn</name>, it is added that he immediately tried to overtake the messenger, and, failing to do so, that he sent a second letter in much more submissive terms. <name type="pname">al-Ma’mūn</name>, we are told, did not pay any attention to the first letter.<ref target="#CH3-pg52-n3">3</ref> Furthermore, when al-Mu‘taḍid ordered Ibrāhīm ibn <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> to resign in favor of his son, he did so; but, instead of appearing before the caliph to justify himself, he preferred to go and die in the Holy War against the Christians.<ref target="#CH3-pg52-n4">4</ref> Certain coins also were marked as being for the caliphate,<ref target="#CH3-pg52-n5">5</ref> and it seems<ref target="#CH3-pg52-n6">6</ref> that there was a continuous tribute sent from <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</name>. Similarly the spiritual prestige of the caliph was in no way
<pb n="53"/>
impaired.<ref target="#CH3-pg53-n1">1</ref> And yet, on the coins of the Aghlabids, with the exception of the coins of Ibrāhīm I, there is no mention of the name of the caliph.<ref target="#CH3-pg53-n2">2</ref> For the first quarter of the third century this may not be too surprising, since, in a number of cases, even gold and silver coins struck in areas directly controlled by <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_baghdad">Baghdad</name> did not give the name of the ruling Commander of the Faithful.<ref target="#CH3-pg53-n3">3</ref> But from the reign of al-Mu'taṣim, and certainly from the time of al-Wāthiq, the name of the caliph always occupies the lower part of the reverse area, with, more often than not, the name of the heir apparent on the obverse. This practice was not followed by the Aghlabids. Did they simply continue the traditional type? Or were they indicating that, while vassals of the caliphate as an institution, they did not necessarily feel subjected to any specific caliph and that they considered themselves as politically and financially independent? The second explanation is certainly the more likely one and corresponds quite clearly to the reality of the time.<ref target="#CH3-pg53-n4">4</ref> In other words, in the case of the Aghlabids, we deal with a dynasty, whose first representative was legally appointed by the caliph and which perpetuated itself without interfering in the affairs of the caliphate and without being touched by it. It is, as has been justly seen by <name type="pname">Marçais</name>, the perfect application of the first kind of <hi rend="italic">amirate</hi> according to Māwardi,<ref target="#CH3-pg53-n5">5</ref> but it went much
<pb n="54"/>
further in its expression of independence than any previous dynastic group (always with the exception of Umayyad <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>), for it completely ignored the caliphal right of the <hi rend="italic">sikkah,</hi> and only preserved the higher one of the <hi rend="italic">khuṭbah.</hi>

               <p>At the other end of the empire the major power until the middle of the third century A. H. was that of the Ṭāhirids. They are generally considered, and in many ways justifiably so, in relation to the later so-called Persian dynasties, but the curious point about them is that, regardless of their significance as the first materialization of a Persian renaissance, from the caliphate’s point of view they fulfilled in the East the same function <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi> as that of the Aghlabids in the West. They did not assume the rule of Khurāsān themselves, but it became apparent to the caliphs that the troubled situation in northeast <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name> could only be resolved through the appointment there of Ṭāhir.<ref target="#CH3-pg54-n1">1</ref> After his death his descendants were all regularly appointed by the caliphs until in 259 Muḥammad ibn Ṭāhir was forcibly removed by the first Ṣaffārid.<ref target="#CH3-pg54-n2">2</ref> But it is doubtful whether one can properly speak of a Ṭāhirid dynasty in Khurāsān, since many Ṭāhirids held high office in other parts of the empire, combining these at times with their own governorship in Khurāsān. The annals of 'Abbāsid governors in the first half of the third century show us many examples of sons succeeding fathers at the helm of various provinces<ref target="#CH3-pg54-n3">3</ref> and the fact that five generations of Ṭāhirids followed each other as rulers of Khurāsān shows simply that from the point of view of the caliphate they fulfilled their purpose without endangering
<pb n="55"/>
the unity of the caliphate or creating undue trouble.<ref target="#CH3-pg55-n1">1</ref> The literary evidence is here fairly well confirmed by the numismatic. On the one hand the existence of copper coins with debased Sasanian busts<ref target="#CH3-pg55-n2">2</ref> shows the concern of some Ṭāhirids for the Sasanian heritage still alive in <name type="place">east Persia</name>. But at the same time their coinage was not much different from that of many a governor. The name of the caliph is always mentioned and the few exceptions that are known are called "revolutionary" by <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_carpenter">G. C. Miles</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg55-n3">3</ref> Since they were struck by <name type="pname">Ṭāhir ibn al-Ḥusayn</name> in 206, they should probably be connected with his tentative separation from the caliphate mentioned in a previous note.<ref target="#CH3-pg55-n4">4</ref> In general, however, to consider Ṭāhirid coins separately as the expression of a new independent dynasty would lead us logically to consider any coin bearing the name of an officially appointed governor as the expression of the same independence. This does not mean denying the importance of the Ṭāhirids in the growth of independent movements in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name>. It merely suggests that, <hi rend="italic">from the point of view of the official expression of sovereignty,</hi> there is no justification in calling the Ṭāhirids an independent
<pb n="56"/>
dynasty. The whole situation was, of course, to be altered in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_persia">Persia</name> with the advent of the Ṣaffārids and Sāmānids, just as it had been altered in the West with the conquering dynasties of the Umayyads of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name> and of the Idrīsids of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2542007">Morocco</name>.</p>
               <p>Thus in comparing the Ṭūlūnids with the other two "dynasties" of <hi rend="italic">appointed amīrs</hi> of the third century A. H., we can see that there was a definite difference between what happened in Ifrīqiyah, Miṣr, and Khurāsān. In <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name>, the Aghlabids, officially appointed by the caliphs before taking things into their own hands, soon dropped the name of the caliph from their coins but maintained the principle of their appurtenance to the Islamic <hi rend="italic">koin</hi>é through regular gifts and through sporadic announcements of their activities. The caliphs, probably largely ignorant of what was happening in their far-flung province, now and then showed some interest and some initiative in Aghlabid affairs. The Aghlabids, therefore, come as close to being independent as is possible within the framework of sunni Islam. The Ṭāhirids of Khurāsān would really be at the other extreme. This "iranisierte Familie arabischen Ursprungs"<ref target="#CH3-pg56-n1">1</ref> belongs in fact to the category of hereditary top civil and military servants of the state who have taken to heart the interests of one part of the empire. Many examples could be found of similar occurrences in other civilizations and at other times. They were identified with a specific cultural area of the Islamic world, but, with a unique and short-lived exception, they did not sever their allegiance to the caliphate, either in fact or in their coinage.</p>
               <p>The case of the Ṭūlūnids, and especially of <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, belongs somewhere between these two extremes. <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> was officially appointed in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, but only in a junior capacity. Through his abilities and his intrigues, to
<pb n="57"/>
which must be added the Zanj war that immobilized the whole strength of <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</name>, he rose in power. Official investments were only given to him piecemeal and his assumption of the title of <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi> together with the striking of coins bearing his own name occurred only when, rightly or wrongly, he felt that it was his legal and religious duty to save the caliphate, and that he was the only one who could do so. Such questions as his personal ambitions and the justification of his assumptions do not matter on this score,<ref target="#CH3-pg57-n1">1</ref> since in numismatic and epigraphical analyses we are dealing essentially with the <hi rend="italic">formal</hi> rationale of man’s actions; however, it should be noted that Aḥmad’s constant concern with religious forms, the Holy War and religious justification of his actions could not have been very hypocritical, at a time when power politics of the roughest kind were shaking the Muslim world.<ref target="#CH3-pg57-n2">2</ref> His coinage retained all the official notations expected in the realm controlled by the caliphs. Its importance, therefore, resides not so much in what appeared on it as in the timing of its appearance. Thus, while on the one hand the constant focusing of his attention on the affairs of the caliphate brings him closer to the situation of the Ṭāhirids (especially the earlier ones), his more or less self-imposed isolation from the actual power in <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</name> led him to a degree of independence which belonged rather to the Aghlabid type. The ambiguity of the Ṭūlūnid phenomenon in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> will appear most
<pb n="58"/>
strikingly in the time of Aḥmad’s son and successor, Khumārawayh.</p>
               <p>A last point must be made about the coinage of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name>. Aside from Miṣr, only two mints are known, al-Rāfiqah and Dimishq.<ref target="#CH3-pg58-n1">1</ref> Dimishq appears only twice, in 269 and in 270, and, although generalizations cannot be made on the basis of unique coins, it may be suggested that the appearance of the <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> mint must be related to the meeting of 269 and to its consequent full assertion of ibn Ṭūlūn’s power. As to the al-Rāfiqah mint, of which we have many examples for 267, 268, and 270 (one coin), there is no doubt that the choice of the easternmost outpost of ibn Ṭūlūn’s possessions must be connected with his claim on the person of the caliph and with his opposition to <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>. The year 267 was perhaps the one in which the flight of al-Mu‘tamid was planned and the sending to Diyār Muḍar of Lu’lu’, ibn Ṭūlūn’s most important lieutenant,<ref target="#CH3-pg58-n2">2</ref> may have been connected with these plans. Lu’lu’'s importance and comparative independence from <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> is shown by the addition of his name to the coins of 268. In spite of Lu’lu''s defection and of the failure of al-Mu‘tamid’s escape,<ref target="#CH3-pg58-n3">3</ref> and although at that time ibn Ṭūlūn’s control over a part of the Jazīrah was not secure, the striking of al-Rāfiqah coins was continued in 269 and 270. <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> was still intent on asserting his power as close as possible to the caliphate. And perhaps the more political or strategic character of the al-Rāfiqah coins could find a further argument in the fact that with one known exception<ref target="#CH3-pg58-n4">4</ref> all the coins whose weight is published are definitely lighter and therefore
<pb n="59"/>
more debased than the usual Miṣr dinars.<ref target="#CH3-pg59-n1">1</ref> As far as the latter are concerned, not only were they kept at a consistent weight and gold standard, but it was part of the policy of <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> to maintain a high standard of currency. In a story transmitted by <name type="pname">Ibn Sa'īd</name>, it is said that for a king the purity of the gold used in his <hi rend="italic">dīnārs</hi> means the purity of his life and afterlife.<ref target="#CH3-pg59-n2">2</ref> It is added that the best <hi rend="italic">dīnārs</hi> are of the <hi rend="italic">Mu'taṣimi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sindi</hi> types, and that <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> did his best to reach the latter’s level.<ref target="#CH3-pg59-n3">3</ref>

There is a curious discrepancy between al-Kindi’s statement that <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> had received the governorship of the marshes and ibn al-Dāyah’s that it was only the financial control. Al-Kindi’s statement appears more convincing, since it is followed by a relation of the difficulties found by <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> in getting a representative in Tarsus, whose functions were to be political. It should also be noted that <name type="pname">ibn al-Dāyah</name> was more interested in anecdotes and that his facts (or is it ibn Sa'īd's relation of them?) are not always too precise; cf. <name type="pname">Becker</name>, p. 152. Whatever happened, whether Aḥmad’s control was purely political or financial, or both, it is an odd assignment if one considers that he did not control Syria at the time. It can only be properly understood if one admits that the war against the infidels was one of the foremost aims in ibn Ṭūlūn’s mind, as is suggested by a number of sources, <name type="pname">ibn al-Athīr</name>, <hi rend="italic">al-Kāmil</hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cairo">Cairo</name>, 1353 A.H.), VI, pp. 14–5 and <name type="pname">ibn al-Maḥāsin</name>

It would be tempting to attribute this coin to Miṣr, since it is only on Egyptian coins that we meet with the odd signs described below. On the other hand, the numerous coins known between 258 and 261 do not possess the sign, and one might wonder why it suddenly reappeared. Properly speaking this coin does not belong to the group of 258 coins. It is simply mentioned here, because it may eventually be of use in finding the solution to the problem of this whole group of coins.</p>

                  <p>The question here is to know whether, at this time, the expression <hi rend="italic">mawla amīr al-mu'minīn</hi> is the statement of a certain personal relation between the two men or whether it is an official title. In a series of passages Max van Berchem has brilliantly shown that all titles in <hi rend="italic">amīr al-mu'minīn</hi> imply a certain share in the sovereign power of the caliph, a "partage du pouvoir." See, for instance, <hi rend="italic">Matériaux pour un Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum I Egypte</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de la Mission Archéologique Française au Caire,</hi> vol. XIX (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_cairo">Cairo</name>, 1903), pp. 81 ff.; or "Eine arabische Inschrift aus dem Ostjordanlandes," <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palästina Vereins,</hi> XVI (1893). In his commentary on the inscription of the mosque of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>, <hi rend="italic">MCIA,</hi> p. 29, van Berchem assumed that already at that time the expression was a title with the same implication as that found on later inscriptions. At the same time it can be open to doubt whether the formula, when used after the names of governors and financial administrators throughout the Umayyad and ‘<name type="pname">Abbāsid</name> periods on stamps and weights, did mean much more than a personal relationship to the caliph. Cf. <name type="pname" corresp="#numismatics_carpenter">G. C. Miles</name>, <hi rend="italic">Early Arabic Glass Weights and Stamps</hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</name>, 1948), index under <hi rend="italic">mawla amīr al-mu'minīn.</hi> It seems to me that in the third century A.H. most titles were not yet formalized and that, in the case of <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> one should still consider the formula as the expression of a personal relationship between the caliph and his subordinate, perhaps a delegation of authority, but certainly not a sharing of it, since the formula was used too often after the name of comparatively minor officials.</p>
                  <p>The same problem can be raised in the case of the word <hi rend="italic">amīr,</hi> which refers either to a function or to a title. <name type="pname">A. Mez</name>, <hi rend="italic">The Renaissance of Islam,</hi> Eng. tr. (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, 1937), pp. 81 ff., defines the <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi> as the military commander, to whom was joined an <hi rend="italic">'āmil,</hi> whose responsibility it was to deal with financial problems. While perhaps true in the tenth century, this is not so in the case of <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name>. It is clear from <name type="pname">al-Ya‘qūbi</name>, <hi rend="italic">Historiae,</hi> ed. <name type="pname">T. Houtsma</name> (<name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2751773">Leyden</name>, 1883), II, p. 620, that he was the '<hi rend="italic">āmil</hi> of Miṣr, while <name type="pname">ibn al-Mudabbir</name> was controlling the finances. In the examples used by Mez <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi> refers really to a function. Similarly, when in his letter to <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> (see below p. 45) <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> refers to the latter as <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi>, he no doubt meant the function of the caliph's brother as commander of the army, since the latter was only appointed as <hi rend="italic">wāli al-mashriq</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wāli al-'ahd</hi> (Ṭābari, III, 1890). Similarly <name type="pname">ibn Ṭūlūn</name> had been appointed as <hi rend="italic">wāli</hi> or '<hi rend="italic">āmil</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi>. And yet, when on the 259 glass or on the mosque inscription <hi rend="italic">we</hi> meet with the expression <hi rend="italic">al-amīr Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</hi>, there is little doubt that a rank or a title are meant as much as a function. There seems to be a distinction, in the third century A.H., between titles which were given and titles which were assumed. Either <name type="pname">Aḥmad ibn Ṭūlūn</name> liked to be known essentially as a military leader, or we are dealing here with the first steps of a formalization of titles which will be more completely achieved in the following centuries, but the whole question of the development of titles would warrant a more complete study. Cf. just recently <name type="pname">A. A. Duri</name>, arts. '<hi rend="italic">Āmil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amīr</hi> in new ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of Islam.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">2. The coinage of Khumārawayh <name type="pname">ibn Aḥmad</name> and late Ṭūlūnid coinage</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A discussion of the coinage of Khumārawayh ibn <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> may best be attempted from two different points of view. First, there is an historical problem, to the solution
<pb n="60"/>
of which the numismatic evidence may be of some help. Second, there is a problem posed by the coins themselves in the state in which they have been preserved. It must be borne in mind, however, that, except for the earliest period of Khumārawayh’s rule, the history of the Ṭūlūnid regime in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> after the death of <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> is far less interesting and far less eventful than the few years which saw the establishment of the dynasty in Fusṭāṭ, and the coinage does not pose any major problem.</p>
               <p>Khumārawayh <name type="pname">ibn Aḥmad</name> succeeded his father without any difficulty, at the age of twenty.<ref target="#CH3-pg60-n1">1</ref> The army and the civil government of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> accepted him as their leader.<ref target="#CH3-pg60-n2">2</ref> But his position was not confirmed by the caliphate, in whose eyes Isḥāq ibn Kundāj was the legal governor of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. Therefore Khumārawayh’s first task was to be recognized by the supreme power of Islam. There is no evidence to suggest that he tried in any way to maintain the positive moral and legal position of his father. Neither his character nor his training had prepared him for such an attitude. His sole aim was to stay in power. But this did not mean that he would meekly accept the dictates of <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>. After a series of military campaigns (on which more will be said below), in 273 a political and perhaps financial arrangement was reached with <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>. The latter was again mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">khuṭbah,</hi> which suggests that Khumārawayh had maintained for three years the situation which existed at the time of Aḥmad’s death, including the cursing of <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg60-n3">3</ref> The
<pb n="61"/>
political agreement between <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and the <name type="place">caliphate</name> is important in that it closed the chapter opened ten years earlier with Aḥmad’s refusal to send more money to <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> than was due to him. The politico-religious attempt of Aḥmad’s had failed, since <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> was still in power. But, at the same time, the so-to-speak illegitimate succession of Khumārawayh to his father’s position was recognized by the caliphate, largely because the military expedition sent to crush him had failed. No information is given on the specific financial arrangements made at that time, although there probably was some agreement on that matter; but the point is established that Khumārawayh and his successors <hi rend="italic">(wulduhu)</hi> receive the governorship (<hi rend="italic">wilāyah)</hi> of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and of the Syrias (<hi rend="italic">al-sha'māt</hi>, meaning <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254930">Palestine</name>, <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name> proper, the <hi rend="italic">thughūr,</hi> and, almost certainly, the right bank of the Euphrates) for thirty years.</p>
               <p>The importance of this agreement and of the events which preceded it consists in that it emphasizes two points: the absolute necessity for a working arrangement with the caliphate;<ref target="#CH3-pg61-n1">1</ref> and the fact that the caliphate neither recognized the independence of the Ṭūlūnids nor accepted without reservations the fact of a dynasty. By setting a time limit <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> acknowledged the existence of the Ṭūlūnids,<ref target="#CH3-pg61-n2">2</ref> but refused to farm <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> out to them permanently and thereby admit the theory of dynastic succession outside the
<pb n="62"/>
caliphate in the Muslim community. This agreement, no doubt, represents a step toward independence when compared with the regular appointments of Ṭāhirid governors, but it is not yet on a par with the situation of later centuries, when the dynastic sense increased and the relationship to the caliphate became more tenuous. In 279, after another series of military actions, in which <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> may not have been directly involved, a new agreement was reached with al-Mu‘taḍid, the new caliph and former commander of the armies which had attacked Khumārawayh in 271. Actually this new agreement confirmed and clarified the first one. The area to be controlled by the Ṭūlūnids was defined as extending from the Euphrates to Barqah; administrative and judiciary autonomy was accorded to them; and the tribute was fixed permanently.<ref target="#CH3-pg62-n1">1</ref> This agreement was maintained until 286, when the Ṭūlūnid Hārūn ibn Khumārawayh lost his northern possessions, was compelled to increase the tribute, and finally seems to have been forced to accept caliphal supervision in his administration.<ref target="#CH3-pg62-n2">2</ref> In 292 <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> became again a province directly administered by the caliphs.</p>
               <p>The coinage of Khumārawayh and of his successors confirms this state of affairs. From 270 on until the end of the dynasty it reflects quite faithfully the situation of the caliphate. Al-Mu‘tamid and al-Mufawwaḍ continue to appear on coins. <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> does not, and it should be presumed, although for obvious tactical reasons the question does not appear to have been raised during the discussions, that the Egyptians still maintained the fiction of the division of the empire. <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> died in <hi rend="italic">Ṣafar</hi> 278 and was succeeded by his son al-Mu'taḍid in his position of second in the line of succession.<ref target="#CH3-pg62-n3">3</ref> Exactly a year later al-Mu‘taḍid edged out
<pb n="63"/>
his cousin al-Mufawwaḍ and became the only official <hi rend="italic">wāli al-'ahd</hi>.<ref target="#CH3-pg63-n1">1</ref> In <hi rend="italic">Rajab</hi> of the same year 279 al-Mu‘tamid died and al-Mu'taḍid became caliph.<ref target="#CH3-pg63-n2">2</ref> Two coins struck in Miṣr and preserved in the University Museum and American Numismatic Society collections (no. 52) belong to the early part of 279, since they have al-Mu'taḍid as heir apparent, but a number of coins of the same year already have him as caliph. They must have been struck shortly after he became caliph and confirm the fact that it was customary to strike coins as soon as a new man attained supreme power. The same thing occurred at the death of al-Mu'taḍid in <hi rend="italic">Rabī' II</hi> 289.<ref target="#CH3-pg63-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Another body of epigraphical evidence parallels that of the coins and can help in defining the relationship between the Egyptian dynasty and the caliphate. It consists of the <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> inscriptions, of which a comparatively large number survives from the period under consideration. Two inscriptions are particularly interesting since they are dated in 272, that is before the agreement was reached which recognized Khumārawayh as governor of Egypt.<ref target="#CH3-pg63-n4">4</ref> One was made in Tinnīs, and contains not only the name of the <hi rend="italic">amīr</hi> Khumārawayh, <hi rend="italic">mawla amīr al-mu’minīn,</hi> but also that of the caliph and of al-Mufawwaḍ, curiously enough here simply called <name type="pname">Ja'far</name>. This inscription confirms the evidence of both coins and texts, showing that Khumārawayh preserved the situation as it was at the time of Aḥmad’s death in spite of the illegality of his situation. The other <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> inscription, made this time in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name>,<ref target="#CH3-pg63-n5">5</ref> bears the name of the caliph only. In other words, during the time when Khumārawayh was actually fighting the forces of the caliph, textiles were
<pb n="64"/>
officially made in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> for the caliphate without mention of the Egyptian ruler’s name.</p>
               <p>The existence, after 273, of well over thirty published <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> inscriptions from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> during the Ṭūlūnid period can help in providing an explanation for this anomaly. Of these inscriptions all those made in Tinnīs, except one, and the only one known from Damietta<ref target="#CH3-pg64-n1">1</ref> bear the name of the Ṭūlūnid ruler, while all those made in Alexandria or Miṣr bear only the name of the caliph.<ref target="#CH3-pg64-n2">2</ref> It will be recalled that <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> had received the right to deal with <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz</hi> matters.<ref target="#CH3-pg64-n3">3</ref> It may be assumed that Khumārawayh maintained the practice established by his father and that it was accepted by the caliphate after 273 or 279, although there is no mention of it in the texts. But what is important to us is that at no time<ref target="#CH3-pg64-n4">4</ref> did the Ṭūlūnids control <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the textile factories of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. Serjeant, in his study of texts on Islamic textiles, has suggested that Tinnīs and Damietta were centers where Christians from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> worked and where a Coptic type of textile was made.<ref target="#CH3-pg64-n5">5</ref> If his conclusions are correct, the Ṭūlūnids only had power over the purely local, Coptic factories; but throughout their history the cloth manufacture in the two largest cities of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>, Fusṭāṭ<ref target="#CH3-pg64-n6">6</ref> and
<pb n="65"/>
                  <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_alexandreia_egypt">Alexandria</name>, was not their direct concern but that of the far away caliphs. The implication of this state of affairs in the organization of textile manufacturing, a state concern almost on the same level as the striking of coins,<ref target="#CH3-pg65-n1">1</ref> does not concern us here,<ref target="#CH3-pg65-n2">2</ref> but these examples are important in illustrating once more the curious dichotomy of mediaeval Islamic civilization, not only a dichotomy between practice and theory which has often been discussed,<ref target="#CH3-pg65-n3">3</ref> but a dichotomy between levels of legal authority. With textiles, just as with coins, it was essential to preserve the fiction of an effective caliphal control. And, thus, just as in Islamic art a series of unifying factors tie together the tremendous variety of themes and ideas which found their way into mediaeval Near Eastern culture,<ref target="#CH3-pg65-n4">4</ref> the more or less self-sufficient political centers (outside of the remote areas of <name type="place" corresp="#wikidata_Q27381">North Africa</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_2510769">Spain</name>) felt bound to accept symbols of a politico-religious authority which at times was not capable of raising an army to defend itself.</p>
               <p>There is yet another historical problem where the coins can be of help. Between 270 and 279, as has been mentioned, Khumārawayh was involved in a series of military operations whose purpose was to consolidate his position in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>. These operations are described in the texts, but since they were numerous and as they involved always the same people,
<pb n="66"/>
many a chronicler appears to have been confused about their order and their exact dates. In the case of one mint the remaining coins can be used to determine the succession of the campaigns. The case is that of the coins struck in al-Rāfiqah. They are known for every year between 270 and 279. After 279 they still appear, but they are of no importance to us here since they are purely ‘Abbāsid,<ref target="#CH3-pg66-n1">1</ref> reflecting probably the fact that, as was previously mentioned, the 279 agreement limited Khumārawayh’s possessions to the areas west of the Euphrates and presumably did not include the Diyār Muḍar in its totality, if at all. It is the period between 270 and 279 which interests us here and it is the most eventful one in terms of military expeditions. Among the coins the name of Khumārawayh appears in 270, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, and 279. But, in 270, 271, 272, 274, and 275, coins were also struck in al-Rāfiqah which do not bear the Ṭūlūnid’s name and should therefore be considered as purely ‘Abbāsid.<ref target="#CH3-pg66-n2">2</ref> The question is whether this body of coins can help us determine with some degree of certitude the exact succession of events.</p>
               <pb n="67"/>
               <p>It will be recalled that in 269 Isḥāq ibn Kundāj had been appointed by <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name> as governor of all of ibn Ṭūlūn’s possessions.<ref target="#CH3-pg67-n1">1</ref> This man, whose lack of military ability (I believe that he lost just about every battle in which he was involved during the period under consideration) was only matched by his pugnacious interference wherever he thought he might gain some advantage, will become the main actor in the subsequent fighting. At the time of ibn Ṭūlūn’s death he was in Mosul. The news of ibn Ṭūlūn’s death traveled fast and, while one of the first acts of the new ruler of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> was to strike coins with his own name in both Miṣr and al-Rāfiqah, ibn Kundāj moved towards <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, underestimating, as ibn al-Athīr specifically says, the power of Aḥmad’s son.<ref target="#CH3-pg67-n2">2</ref> There is no doubt that he went first to al-Rāfiqah, since there is a purely ‘Abbāsid coin from al-Rāfiqah in 270 and since <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name> states that in 270 a fight occurred there between ibn Kundāj and the Ṭūlūnid representative.<ref target="#CH3-pg67-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the meantime, ibn Kundāj had got in touch with the caliphate, which sent an army under abu al-‘Abbās Aḥmad ibn <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>, the future al-Mu'taḍid. This army moved along the Euphrates, then crossed over to Qinnasrīn, and, finally, went south to <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254930">Palestine</name> where, between <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_jerusalem">Jerusalem</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_118840">Ramleh</name>, it encountered the main Ṭūlūnid force at the tragi-comic battle of al-Ṭawāḥīn.<ref target="#CH3-pg67-n4">4</ref>
                  <name type="pname">Al-Kindi</name> puts the battle in <hi rend="italic">Ṣafar</hi> 271, but this sequence of events poses a problem. According to the Egyptian chroniclers (<name type="pname">al-Kindi</name>, <name type="pname">al-Maqrīzi</name>, <name type="pname" corresp="#viaf_34592187">Taghribirdi</name>), <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> died on the tenth of <hi rend="italic">Dhū</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">al-qa'dah</hi> 270. Could it be that during the three months which elapsed between the day of his death and the battle of al-Ṭawāḥīn all this could have occurred: the news had traveled as far as
<pb n="68"/>
Mosul; coins had been struck at al-Rāfiqah both by the new ruler of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and by the invader; an army had been raised in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_baghdad">Baghdad</name> and Mosul and had reached southern Palestine? One should take into consideration here a tradition transmitted by <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name> alone<ref target="#CH3-pg68-n1">1</ref> to the effect that the news of Aḥmad’s death had reached <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_baghdad">Baghdad</name> as early as <hi rend="italic">Sha'bān</hi> 270. Tabari puts the battle of al-Ṭawāhīn in <hi rend="italic">Shawwāl</hi> 271, which would give us some fourteen months between the two events. The dates of the Egyptian historians are definitely unacceptable. And, although one could conceivably adopt Tabari’s date for the death of <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> and the Egyptian date for the battle, it is generally apparent that the chronology of events transmitted by <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_99237">Iraq</name>i historians is more trustworthy than that given by the Egyptians. A difficulty would be that no coins from Miṣr are known for the year 270 with the name of Khumārawayh, an odd thing if four months had elapsed between the death of <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> and the end of the year. Yet such coins may still be found and may even be included among the 27 specimens of our type 14, many of which are undescribed, inasmuch as there is a Rāfiqah coin struck in 270 with the prince’s name. One should, I think, adopt Ṭabari’s dates for both events.</p>
               <p>That in 271 we have only an ‘Abbāsid coin from al-Rāfiqah is perfectly natural, since, although the Ṭūlūnids won the battle, they only pursued the enemy as far as <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> which was properly and officially re-occupied. The events of 272 and 273 are more complex and the chronicles are highly confusing. We know practically nothing of what Khumārawayh was doing during most of the year 272. He appears to have stayed in Fusṭāṭ. He left in <hi rend="italic">Dhū al-qa'dah</hi> for <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, where he had his governor in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> murdered for insubordination in <hi rend="italic">Muḥarram</hi> 273.<ref target="#CH3-pg68-n2">2</ref> At the same time a
<pb n="69"/>
quarrel took place between ibn Kundāj and ibn abi al-Sāj, another roving ‘Abbāsid governor, half official, half adventurer, who was governor of the Euphrates area south of al-Rāfiqah.<ref target="#CH3-pg69-n1">1</ref> Ibn abi al-Sāj called Khumārawayh for help, subjecting himself and the area under his control to the Ṭūlūnid. Together they moved against ibn Kundāj, whom they defeated near Raqqah in <hi rend="italic">Jumāda I</hi> 273, and pursued as far as Samarra.<ref target="#CH3-pg69-n2">2</ref> Ibn abi al-Sāj obtained from Khumārawayh all that had been conquered from ibn Kundāj. The expedition was followed by the agreement of 273, actually reached through the intermediary of ibn Kundāj. Territorially the agreement probably acknowledged the <hi rend="italic">status quo,</hi> and thus can be explained the purely Ṭūlūnid coins of 273.<ref target="#CH3-pg69-n3">3</ref> A problem arises, however, about the existence of two Ṭūlūnid coins of 272 struck in al-Rāfiqah. Only two possible explanations for their existence can be found. One is that some local governor acknowledged Khumārawayh for a while without its being recorded in the literature. It could not have been ibn Kundāj and, according to ibn al-Athīr, ibn abi al-Sāj, who had been governor at Raqqah, only controlled Qinnasrīn at that time. But one may wonder whether ibn al-Athīr is correct in writing that ibn abi al-Sāj was in Qinnasrīn. In 269, according to <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name> and ibn al-Athīr, he was in Raḥbah, on the Euphrates below Raqqah, and had gone as far north as Qarqisiyā (at the mouth of the Khābur and the Euphrates),<ref target="#CH3-pg69-n4">4</ref> whence he had dislodged ibn Ṣafwān, a Ṭūlūnid governor.<ref target="#CH3-pg69-n5">5</ref> There is, so far as I have been able to
<pb n="70"/>
discover, no information about his whereabouts between 269 and 273. But, when <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name> mentions the battle that took place between him and ibn Kundāj in 273,<ref target="#CH3-pg70-n1">1</ref> he places it at Raqqah, which would be perfectly logical if the man had still been in the middle Euphrates area. <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name> says nothing about his allegiance to Khumārawayh, but the 272 coin would indicate that he had already passed into the Ṭūlūnid camp. Thus, while ibn al-Athīr’s sequence of events is in all probability the correct one, his dating and his account of the areas in which the events occurred is confused. The 272 coin and the information given by <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name> permit a more secure understanding of what happened, where, and when.</p>
               <p>A second series of military operations took place between 274 and 276. There were in fact two major operations.<ref target="#CH3-pg70-n2">2</ref> First ibn Kundāj, in 274, started a new offensive towards <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>. Khumārawayh opposed him brilliantly, crossed the Euphrates, and defeated him. Ibn Kundāj gave up all his possessions to the Ṭūlūnid and Khumārawayh returned to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>. Immediately afterwards ibn abi al-Sāj revolted. Khumārawayh defeated him alone near <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_damascus">Damascus</name> (in <hi rend="italic">Muḥarram</hi> 275), then pursued him to the Jazīrah. There Khumārawayh received help from ibn Kundāj, who was, however, defeated. But Khumārawayh himself was victorious over ibn abi al-Sāj; and the latter, who had been in constant touch with <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>, withdrew to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_baghdad">Baghdad</name>, where he received a new appointment.<ref target="#CH3-pg70-n3">3</ref> These events are confirmed by the numismatic evidence, which definitely favors ibn al-Athīr’s account over that of the Egyptian chronicles. In 274 there appears a series of ‘Abbāsid issues, which correspond to ibn abi al-Sāj’s revolt. Since there is also a 275 ‘Abbāsid coin, it

follows that ibn abi al-Sāj remained in Raqqah during the early part of that year, but the Ṭūlūnid issues of the same year illustrate Khumārawayh’s victory. From 275 until 279 only Ṭūlūnid coins are known from al-Rāfiqah. After that date, willingly or not, Khumārawayh lost control of all areas east of the Euphrates.<ref target="#CH3-pg71-n1">1</ref>
               </p>
               <p>While the coins provide an answer for a number of historical problems, in themselves they pose a major one to which historical texts should provide an answer. One of the striking features of Khumārawayh’s coinage is the sudden multiplication of the number of mints. While under <name type="pname">Aḥmad</name> only three are known (Miṣr, al-Rāfiqah, Dimishq), under his son five new ones appear (Ḥims, Filasṭīn, Ḥalab, Ḥarrān, and Anṭākiyah), and none of the older ones is abandoned. Furthermore these mints do not, so far as our present evidence goes, appear from the very beginning of his rule, but only from the year 276, with the exception of Ḥimṣ, which occurs already in 274. It is admittedly true that a numismatic discussion can never wisely be based on negative evidence, unless one deals with hoards or large numbers of coins, and it may very well be that future discoveries will
<pb n="72"/>
complete or change the picture. I do not believe, however, that future discoveries will alter the picture too much, since it is between 273 and 276 that Khumārawayh had established himself firmly as ruler of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> and <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_syria">Syria</name>, and it is only then that he was free to administer his provinces without interference.</p>
               <p>The questions that are raised by the introduction of the new mints are essentially two: what led to the specific choice of mints? What was the function of coins struck in these mints in the economy and life of Ṭūlūnid controlled lands? The questions are really too vast to be dealt with entirely at this juncture, inasmuch as contemporary texts are of little help. Furthermore these are not problems which can be easily solved through the case of the Ṭūlūnids alone, but ones which should be started with studies of the Umayyad and early ‘Abbāsid periods in order to show the precedents which might have led to the situation under the Ṭūlūnids. Only a few remarks can be made here which may contribute towards a better understanding of the whole problem.</p>
               <p>First it can be asked whether the Ṭūlūnid mints were deliberately located so that every province <hi rend="italic">(jund)</hi> should have its own. Do the coins show something about the administration of the land? Miṣr, Filaṣtīn, Ḥimṣ, Ḥalab, and Anṭākiyah are all in different <hi rend="italic">junūd.</hi>
                  <ref target="#CH3-pg72-n1">1</ref> In the cases of Dimishq and Ḥimṣ, both the province and the capital bear the same name. In <name type="place" corresp="#geonames_6254930">Palestine</name> Filasṭīn was used to mean the capital Ramlah,<ref target="#CH3-pg72-n2">2</ref> while Miṣr is almost always identified with Fusṭāt.<ref target="#CH3-pg72-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <pb n="73"/>
               <p>In the two cases of Ḥalab and Anṭākiyah, we are dealing with the capitals of the provinces of Qinnasrīn and al-‘Awāsim.<ref target="#CH3-pg73-n1">1</ref> No city other than the capital is known as a mint in any of these provinces. This points to a remarkable organization of the minting processes in Ṭūlūnid times. Instead of using a large number of mint names often with comparatively little concern for administrative units, as was often the case in earlier times, we meet now with what appears to be a conscious pattern of unity. This pattern will be followed in the ‘Abbāsid period after the fall of the Ṭūlūnids and under the Ikhshīdids, although in Fāṭimid times again the number of mints will increase, often with little relation to the organization of the state.<ref target="#CH3-pg73-n2">2</ref> The only mint which appears immediately after the Ṭūlūnids in the area under their control is that of <name type="pname">Ṭabari</name>yah, capital of the province of Urdunn, and, even then, a new discovery may easily fill in this gap, so that there is no need to assume that al-Urdunn was not a Ṭūlūnid province with its own administration. An interesting fact about these mints is that in at least two cases the Ṭūlūnid initiative seems to have acted as a stimulant. Ḥalab and Anṭākiyah were extremely rare mints before the Ṭūlūnid period,<ref target="#CH3-pg73-n3">3</ref> but Ḥalab became quite common in later years.<ref target="#CH3-pg73-n4">4</ref> while Anṭākiyah remained as an Ikshīdid mint, but was soon after taken by the Byzantines.</p>
               <p>A last question to be raised with regard to the administrative significance of these mints is why, in the cases of
<pb n="74"/>
Anṭākiyah and Ḥalab in particular, was the name of the town chosen rather than the name of the province, since the evidence definitely indicates that the mints were chosen because they represented the provinces. The problem is important, for an answer to it would lead to an eventual understanding of the nature of the process of localization of gold minting in mediaeval Islam. Were the towns chosen indiscriminately? Were the capitals of the provinces chosen because the coins were actually struck there? Is there a difference between coins struck in "royal" foundations and those struck in administrative capitals?<ref target="#CH3-pg74-n1">1</ref> While a valid answer could only be given after a comparative analysis of mints on a large scale, one may venture the suggestion that in Ṭūlūnid times, the mints were restricted to provinces, but that each province tended to become characterized by its chief city (whether the reasons for determining the chief city be political or economic). Filasṭīn and Miṣr appear to be exceptions, but even there the official identification of the two terms with the cities of <name type="place">Ramlah</name> and Fusṭāt seems likely, and in the case of Miṣr, this identification would probably be confirmed by the evidence of the <hi rend="italic">ṭirāz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be noted that two Ṭūlūnid mints have been omitted from this discussion: al-Rāfiqah and Ḥarrān. As far as al-Rāfiqah is concerned, I hope to have established that, since the province was never held by the Ṭūlūnids long enough to be truly administered by them, the coins issued there had a political rather than administrative significance.<ref target="#CH3-pg74-n2">2</ref> The appearance in the year 276 only of the mint of Ḥarrān is definitely puzzling. It is in the Diyār Muḍar, but much farther north than the usual scenes of the fighting between Khumārawayh and ibn Kundāj or ibn abi al-Sāj. Furthermore,
<pb n="75"/>
Khumārawayh was back in Fusṭāṭ in <hi rend="italic">Jumāda I</hi> of that year and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, Ḥarrān is never mentioned by the chroniclers as being part of the areas belonging to Khumārawayh, although an army of <name type="pname">Aḥmad Ibn Ṭūlūn</name> did reach Ḥarrān.<ref target="#CH3-pg75-n1">1</ref> The most likely explanation for these coins could be the following. In 275, when ibn abi al-Sāj left Raqqah and moved first to Mosul and then to <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_baghdad">Baghdad</name>, ibn Kundāj remained in the Diyār Rabī'ah and the Diyār Muḍar.<ref target="#CH3-pg75-n2">2</ref> At that time he was presumably still an ally of Khumārawayh and these coins could be a sign of his allegiance to the Ṭūlūnid, struck where he had established himself at the time, that is, at Ḥarrān. This allegiance was probably very short-lived, since in later times we do not hear any more of any relations between the two men, nor are there any coins which would suggest one, although in 280 ibn Kundāj was still active in the same areas, involved this time in ‘Abbāsid politics.<ref target="#CH3-pg75-n3">3</ref>
               </p>
               <p>These coins from Ḥarrān are interesting in yet another respect. With the exception of an Arab Byzantine copper<ref target="#CH3-pg75-n4">4</ref> they are the first known coins from that mint and here again the mint was fairly active in the years which followed.<ref target="#CH3-pg75-n5">5</ref> What seems to have been an accidental event of Ṭūlūnid coinage had significant repercussions. But the importance of these coins, as far as the Ṭūlūnids are concerned, is, just as in the case of al-Rāfiqah, purely political. Their aim was propagandistic not economic or administrative; and in that sense they no doubt fulfilled an essential function of coins throughout the middle ages, if not even in the modern period.</p>
               <pb n="76"/>
               <p>A last remark should be made about Ṭūlūnid coins as a whole. Almost always—the few exceptions are indicated in the catalogue—the coins other than those bearing Miṣr as a mint are lower in weight by a rather considerable margin. In view of the importance of the <hi rend="italic">sikkah</hi> as a gubernatorial and princely prerogative, it is probable that this custom was imposed from <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name> (it may be worth noting that the Ḥarrān coins certainly struck outside the regular channels are of higher weight than the rest of the provincial coins). It is all the more remarkable because the Miṣr coins are almost throughout<ref target="#CH3-pg76-n1">1</ref> of a high and consistent weight, thanks to the wealth of the country and to the high standards imposed by <name type="pname">Ibn Ṭūlūn</name>.<ref target="#CH3-pg76-n2">2</ref> Was this an attempt to assert the high value of the currency struck in <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>? Does it imply that the coins bearing provincial mints were not necessarily struck there?<ref target="#CH3-pg76-n3">3</ref> Can it be connected with attempts to protect or to enhance the buying power of the inhabitants of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_egypt">Egypt</name>? These questions are directed to the economic historian and cannot be answered before more complete data are available from other times and places.</p>
               <pb n="77"/>
               <p>The marks found on Ṭūlūnid coins should be connected either with economic matters or with the identification of certain issues. The general problem of marks is, however, far from being solved and we lack sufficient evidence to draw any general conclusions. An interesting point, however, is that these marks, which are of the most common type (‘<hi rend="italic">ayn</hi>, <hi rend="italic">hā, ḥā, tā-mim, bā)</hi> do not occur at the beginning of the dynasty. The earliest example is on the 276 coin from Anṭākiyah and it should be noted that these signs begin on provincial mints, although by no means all of them, and that they do not become common on Miṣr coins before 280. Here again we seem to meet with a difference between provincial and central mints, whose significance is not very clear and which cannot, I believe, be explained through Ṭūlūnid coins alone.</p>
               <p>The only individual coin which may still deserve comment is the one numbered 51 in the catalogue. It was published over a hundred years ago by Soret;<ref target="#CH3-pg77-n1">1</ref> by the inclusion of the name <name type="pname">al-Mu'tamid</name> it is datable before 278, and it also bears the name of Khumārawayh. On the reverse this small copper bears a name which has been read by Soret as Aḥmad ibn Ya‘qūb. Soret suggested first that this may have been an Aḥmad ibn Ya'qūb who had for a while governed <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> for the Aghlabids and who would have gone to the Orient at a certain time. For some reason Soret assumes that he ruled in 268. This hypothesis has to be discarded since both ibn al-Athīr and ibn Idhāri mention that the man, who had indeed been governor of <name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</name> in 257, was killed in 258.<ref target="#CH3-pg77-n2">2</ref> A second suggestion made by <name type="pname">Soret</name> was that Aḥmad ibn Ya'qūb belonged to a heretical group called al-Ya‘qūbiyah, which had its center not far from Mosul, at a place called
<pb n="78"/>
Marj, and which in 273 fought against ibn abi al-Sāj.<ref target="#CH3-pg78-n1">1</ref> I have been unable to find anything out about the leaders of this sect at that time, but I wonder whether Defrémery, and following him, Soret, did not confuse a small heretical group<ref target="#CH3-pg78-n2">2</ref> with the Christian sect of the Jacobites called <hi rend="italic">al-Ya'qūbiyah</hi> by Arabic authors, which was certainly represented in the area of Mosul.<ref target="#CH3-pg78-n3">3</ref> There is little doubt that they did not strike coins as a group and, while it is not impossible to imagine that Ṭūlūnid coins were struck in the area of Mosul, the Soret coins cannot be taken as evidence for it. I have not been able to discover another man by the name of Aḥmad ibn Ya'qūb who could conceivably have been involved in Ṭūlūnid politics. Just as in the case of the other copper coins struck under the Ṭūlūnid regime this one should perhaps be considered as originating from the <hi rend="italic">thughūr</hi> and Aḥmad ibn Ya‘qūb may have been one of the many commanders who at one time or another took the field against the Byzantines.</p>

The 274 coins present a curious problem. They bear on the reverse the name of Aḥmad ibn <name type="pname">al-Muwaffaq</name>, the future al-Mu‘taḍiḍ, while the obverse has the name of al-Mufawwaḍ.

Was this coin the result of some manoever of that political group? Did ibn abi al-Sāj belong to it?</p>

A Sindi coin was of the type developed by al-Sindi, who took over the mint after the fall of the Barmakids, while a Mu'taṣimi was obviously according to the standard of the coins struck by the caliph by the same name.

                  <p>There are several pieces of evidence suggesting that provincial coinage, in particular that of al-Rāfiqah, was not struck in the provincial city itself, but either in Baghdad-Samarra or in Fusṭāṭ. On the other hand, it must be pointed out that a glance at the illustrations (see, for instance, pl. I, nos. 27, 45) shows that there are notable epigraphical differences between al-Rāfiqah and Miṣr coins. It would seem <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> unlikely that the mint masters in the capitals would also devise a special epigraphy for provincial coins. This phenomenon should perhaps be connected with the information given by <name type="pname">W. Barthold</name>, <hi rend="italic">Turkestan down to the Mongol Invasion</hi> (<name type="place" corresp="#nomisma_london">London</name>, 1928), pp. 204ff., that in Khwarizm debased coinage was introduced to prevent the circulation of local coinage beyond the frontiers of the province.</p>
