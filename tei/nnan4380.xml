            </head>
            <p>It is over 60 years since Sydney Noe published Part 1 of his <hi rend="italic">Coinage of Metapontum</hi> (1927). Part 2 appeared four years
               later and in the Preface Noe referred to Part 3 as if work were well in hand. Kubitschek, in the <hi rend="italic">Numismatische Zeitschrift</hi>
               for 1931, noted the publication of Parts 1 and 2 and promised "ein Paar Worte zu dem ganzen bedeutenden Werk" — but Part 3 never materialized.
               Given that it is now 20 years since I took over Noe's notes and casts with the aim of completing the last part of his study, I am inclined to be
               sympathetic rather than critical. He never entirely abandoned Metapontum, however, and by his death in the early 1960s he had done a great deal
               of work on the remaining material, arranging the coinage into groups and identifying dies, and even writing sections of the text on subjects such
               as magistrates' names, the gold issues, and the coinage of <name type="pname">Alexander</name> the Molossian. Originally I hoped that it would be
               possible simply to put his catalogue in order and update it, pull together his various drafts and provide whatever was still needed for the
               introduction. Part 3 would be published under <name type="pname">Noe's</name> name, and I would do little more than act as midwife. Naturally it
               was not so easy.</p>
            <p>One major practical problem was that <name type="pname">Noe</name> had learned a peculiar system of shorthand which he used to annotate notes,
               text and casts, so that there was no way of knowing what his comments and second thoughts were. I showed examples to older secretaries, but
               nobody could decipher the hieroglyphs and I had to accept that they were impenetrable. Even the material that I could read was not without
               problems. <name type="pname">Noe</name> had changed his mind about some things, like the gold, and left several conflicting versions. He had also
               never written down explicitly the sequence in which he thought the issues had been struck, though it was possible to piece together roughly what
               he had in mind. He had left nothing on important topics such as hoards and overstrikes, where in any case there was a substantial amount of new
               information to be considered. Gradually and reluctantly I came to the conclusion that I had to make a completely fresh start.</p>
            <p>Like <name type="pname">Noe,</name> I would pick up the project from time to time, only to be distracted by other things just when I was making
               progress. One of these distractions was the updating of Parts 1 and 2, an idea that had been mooted early on and actually reached publication in
               1984 largely thanks to the encouragement and practical support of Dr. <name type="pname">Athos Moretti.<ref target="#CH1-n1">
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </ref>
               </name> Inevitably the work of updating turned into a far larger undertaking than was envisaged at the outset. Nevertheless, although it meant a
               further delay, the revision of the earlier periods was a very valuable exercise and I feel that ultimately Part 3 has benefitted from it. Another
               useful diversion was a renewed attempt by <name type="pname">Michael Crawford,</name>
               <name type="pname">Keith Rutter</name> and myself to finish the <name type="place">Italy</name> fascicule of the third edition of <hi
                  rend="italic">Historia Numorum</hi>; this forced me into a thorough study of the other coinages of S. <name type="place">Italy,</name> which
               has helped to put Metapontum in context. All in all, it is perhaps just as well that Part 3 has taken 20 years to mature.</p>
            <p>The final version differs in one important regard from <name type="pname">Noe's</name> (and my own) original intention: the plan was to produce a
               full die study along the same lines as Parts 1 and 2, listing all the known examples. <name type="pname">Noe</name> had left me the basis for
               producing a catalogue of this type, but in the end I decided that it was not worth the time involved in tracking the pieces in private hands
               through the sales catalogues of the last 50 years, or the space to print a very detailed listing. Instead, I have tried to identify as many <hi
                  rend="italic">dies and die-combinations</hi> as possible, listing in the catalogue an illustrated reference piece and providing a concordance
               between the <pb n="viii"/> catalogue and the relevant volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum</hi>.</p>
            <p>Numerous people have contributed to this study over the many years of its preparation. Those who sent casts to <name type="pname">Noe</name> and

               <name type="place">Cambridge,</name> who renewed my Research Fellowship so that I might complete the study of Metapontum. This formal statement
               does not convey the immense benefits conferred by three years' membership of that congenial society. For someone like myself, working outside the
               museum world and the traditional university system, it was of inestimable value to have the stimulus and support that comes through daily contact
               with others engaged in research. It was also an extraordinary privilege to encounter people from all over the world, working in all manner of
               disciplines, in the friendly atmosphere that a <name type="place">Cambridge</name> college at its best provides. Secondly, I must again express
               my gratitude to <name type="pname">Dr. Athos Moretti</name> for his continuing encouragement and practical help in this long-drawn-out
               enterprise, which might well have foundered without his patient insistence and willing generosity. Lastly, my greatest debt is to <name
                  type="pname">Ted Buttrey,</name> who introduced me to numismatics in the first place and has been my most valued teacher, guide and critic
               ever since. I do not know how I would have managed without him.</p>
            <p>Obviously I alone am responsible for all the errors, omissions and deficiencies that remain despite the efforts of so many colleagues and
               friends. In particular, I apologize for the quality of the plates, which through no fault of the printer are well below the standard that I would
               have wished.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">Note on Terminology and Catalogue Numbering</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A word of explanation is in order regarding the division of the coinage into classes, groups and issues, and the numbering system based upon it
               used in the catalogue. The aim was to provide an indication of relative chronology by means of the lettered classes A-D, so that references would
               be more immediately comprehensible than if <name type="pname">Noe's</name> numbering had simply been continued from N.549 onward. Class B is thus
               later than Class A and earlier than Class C. Within the classes, however, it has not been possible to establish the chronological sequence of
               issues with any certainty, and the numbered subdivisions within the lettered classes are not intended to convey that, for instance, C4 is <hi
                  rend="italic">necessarily</hi> earlier than C5, although some attempt has obviously been made to put the issues into a plausible order.</p>
            <p>The term "issue" is used to describe coins with the same types and (normally) the same subsidiary symbols and/or signatures; a distinctive
               obverse type or reverse symbol may be used as a shorthand reference ("the plough issue": Cl; "the facing head isssue": C2).</p>
            <p>The smaller issues have been amalgamated into groups where they share some common feature(s) suggesting that they belong together, although
               symbols or even obverse types may vary (e.g. D3, all with the reverse signature <hi rend="bold">˫A;</hi> or D4, all with reverse signature <hi
                  rend="bold">ΦI</hi>). In Class A, this logic is slightly stretched, so that the issues signed <hi rend="bold">KAΛ / API / ONA</hi> have been
               given a single group number (A6), as have those signed <hi rend="bold">ΓPO</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Γ</hi> (A7), and <hi rend="bold">Φ</hi> or <hi
                  rend="bold">ΦI</hi> (A8). The first number after the letter thus indicates the group/ issue; the second number registers the different die
               combinations within it (thus A6.5 refers to one die pair within group A6).</p>
            <p>The silver fractions have been given the prefix F and the gold the prefix G; here again it must be stressed that the numbers are not intended to
               have any necessary chronological significance.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The narrative of historical events that formed the backdrop to the later coinage of Metapontum has been set out lucidly by several historians who
               have worked almost exclusively from the literary sources.<ref target="#CH1-n2">
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi>
               </ref> The first significant event that touched the city in this period was the expedition of Timoleon to Sicily in 344:<ref target="#CH1-n3">
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </ref> according to Diodorus,<ref target="#CH1-n4">
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi>
               </ref> Timoleon's fleet called in at Metapontum en route to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily</placeName> and left hurriedly for
               Rhegium after having been tracked down by a Carthaginian trireme carrying ambassadors who hoped to dissuade him from the venture. Clearly
               Metapontum was a natural port-of-call for ships traveling from <placeName>western Greece</placeName> to S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy"
                  >Italy</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_sicily">Sicily.</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>The three major episodes that directly affected S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> in the second half of the fourth century
               were the successive interventions of Archidamus of Sparta, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian and
               Kleonymos of Sparta, all invited by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> to defend the Greek cities against the Lucanians and
               the other barbarians of the interior. Metapontum was presumably active in the first alliance as a member of the Italiote League and as what might
               now be called a "front-line state," though the city is not mentioned by name in the sources. Giannelli dates the start of the expedition to 344
               (a year earlier than proposed by Beloch). The campaign, which ended with Archidamus' death in 338, seems to have been defensive and inconclusive:
               there are no accounts of major battles, of territories reconquered or treaties signed. The fact that <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</persName> the Molossian was invited to attempt the same task shortly afterward indicates that Archidamus had had little success
               against the barbarians during his five years in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy.</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>Metapontum figures in several accounts of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> campaign, from its second phase
               onward. <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> arrived in late summer 334 and started by acquiring a firm base in
               Apulia, partly by military means and partly by diplomacy (spring/summer 333); once this was achieved he was able to turn his attention to Lucania
               without fear of attack from the rear (autumn 333/spring 332). An alliance was made with Metapontum<ref target="#CH1-n5">
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi>
               </ref> as a necessary preliminary to this second phase of the campaign; Giannelli thinks that such an alliance would have been welcomed by the
               Metapontines since it reduced their dependence on <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras.</placeName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n6">
                  <hi rend="sup">6</hi>
               </ref> The commentators generally agree that from this point onward <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> increasingly
               revealed his underlying ambition of establishing an empire for himself in the West to match <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander
                  the Great</persName>'s achievements in the East. Holloway dates the S. Italian coinage in his own name to this and <pb n="2"/> the later
               phases of the campaign, after his transition from mercenary captain to effective ruler of the league of Greek cities.</p>
            <p>Most scholars place next <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> expedition across Lucania to Campania, but Giannelli
               cogently argues that it would have been folly to attempt such a long-range campaign with insecure supply-lines and with the hostile Bruttians and
               only partially subdued Lucanians at his rear; it would have made much more sense to deal with the Bruttians first (summer/autumn 332), before
               tackling the Lucanians. From this period must date the beginnings of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> rift with
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> which manifested itself most clearly in his transfer of the seat of the Italiote League
               from Heraclea (a Tarentine colony) to the territory of Thurium (winter 332/1).<ref target="#CH1-n7">
                  <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
               </ref> Beloch built this incident up into a civil war between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_heraclea_lucaniae">Heraclea</placeName> on the one hand, and Metapontum, Thurium and <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> on the other. Giannelli finds this exaggerated and unlikely, although the Tarentines
               would have been understandably vexed to watch the development of "their" tame commander into a powerful and independent operator beyond their
               control. Their disapproval is in fact unlikely to have gone beyond withdrawal of active support: as Giannelli points out, the Tarentines were in
               no position to challenge a man as successful and as well equipped as <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was by then,
               nor would <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> have attempted further campaigns toward the west if he had had to
               contend with real hostility from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras.</placeName> The withdrawal of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras</placeName> would have meant a larger role for the cities that remained loyal to <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</persName> — especially Thurium, but presumably also Metapontum.</p>
            <p>With S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> from Apulia to Bruttium reasonably under control, <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> crossed Lucania, probably by land (spring-summer 331). Livy<ref target="#CH1-n8">
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi>
               </ref> suggests that he reached Poseidonia and, according to Holloway,<ref target="#CH1-n9">
                  <hi rend="sup">9</hi>
               </ref> there is archaeological evidence that he destroyed various fortified towns between Thurium and Poseidonia. The treaty between <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and Rome probably dates from this final phase of the campaign in the view of Giannelli,
               who sees it as a "nonaggression pact," intended by both parties as a way of neutralizing the threat of the Samnites; this cannot have been the
               occasion for the treaty between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and Rome.<ref target="#CH1-n9bis">
                  <hi rend="sup">9bis</hi>
               </ref> Eventually, however, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> was forced to turn back (autumn 331) as the Lucanians
               and Bruttians attacked from the rear; his troops were drawn back into Bruttium and <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</persName> himself was killed near Pandosia (November/ December 331). Metapontum had clearly supported him to the end, given that
               his mutilated remains were sent back to Metapontum before ultimately being returned to Greece.<ref target="#CH1-n10">

            <p>The Molossian expedition appears to have had some short-term successes against the Lucanians and Bruttians, but in the longer run <persName

               battle with the Lucanians near Heraclea; Croton, too, was attacked by the Bruttians.<ref target="#CH1-n12">
                  <hi rend="sup">12</hi>
               </ref> The barbarian threat seems to have diminished in the last decades of the fourth century, but thanks to the diversion of the Samnite Wars
               rather than to the efforts of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> and the Greek cities.</p>
            <p>The history of the period through to the Pyrrhic War is often confused and confusing. The sparseness of the literary account, where it even
               exists, has left the field open to speculation about precise chronologies, the motives for and the significance of the recorded events and
               treaties. Most historians emphasize that the various entities involved — <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Metapontum, the
               Bruttians and the Lucanians — were not homogeneous and unchanging groups of like-minded people, but rather were divided into factions; the views
               of one party might prevail for a while only to be reversed, sometimes within a very short space of time, when another gained the ascendancy. This
               is particularly true of attitudes toward Rome as Roman influence in S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> steadily increased
               during the last quarter of the fourth century, and — at a time when the final outcome was far from <pb n="3"/> certain — the Greeks and
               non-Greeks had to decide whether to resist or join in.<ref target="#CH1-n13">
                  <hi rend="sup">13</hi>
               </ref> It is also characteristic of the Lucanians: there were, for example, Lucanian exiles among the Molossian's troops in the expedition across
               their territory, one of whom ultimately killed <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander.</persName>
            </p>
            <p>The position of Metapontum through all the changing allegiances is far from clear. There is no mention of the city until the arrival of
               Kleonymos, again at the invitation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> in 303. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras</placeName> had been managing to maintain her position for some time without external aid,<ref target="#CH1-n14">
                  <hi rend="sup">14</hi>
               </ref> but the Roman peace with the Samnites in 304 and the combined hostility (if not formal alliance) of the Romans and the Lucanians<ref
                  target="#CH1-n15">
                  <hi rend="sup">15</hi>
               </ref> posed a sufficiently serious threat that help was again sought from Sparta. Kleonymos appeared with such massive forces that virtually all
               the Greeks found it prudent to support him. The fact that Metapontum alone remained aloof and refused to cooperate with Kleonymos suggests that
               the city did not feel threatened by the Lucanians and/or Romans, perhaps because it was protected by an earlier treaty or treaties.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n16">
                  <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
               </ref> Faced with clearly superior forces, the Lucanians made peace with Kleonymos, who then used them against Metapontum, either by instructing
               them to attack or simply by allowing natural hostilities to develop, so that he could appear as a friend and force the city to accept his
                  mediation.<ref target="#CH1-n17">
                  <hi rend="sup">17</hi>
               </ref> Metapontum was then made to pay an exorbitant amount for its recalcitrance: 600 talents and 200 girls from noble families as hostages. The
               size of this tribute, and the fact that it appears to have been paid, has been interpreted as reflecting the great prosperity of the city at the
               time, and also possibly as indicating that it had been ruled by an oligarchy which was now perhaps discredited and removed.<ref target="#CH1-n18">
                  <hi rend="sup">18</hi>
               </ref> For Meloni (and others), the Kleonymos episode is explicable as an attempt to force the city back into the Italiote League, following its
               defection as a result of hostility toward <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras.</placeName>

               </ref> All that can be said with certainty is that Metapontum, yet again, was prepared to act independently, though this need not necessarily
               indicate total rupture with the other Greek cities (compare the many modern examples of independent action within major alliances).</p>
            <p>The clash with Metapontum marked the beginning of the end for Kleonymos who — thinking that his position in S. <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> was secure — began to indulge in a somewhat unSpartan lifestyle and to broaden his field of
               interest by seizing Corcyra. The Tarentines, realizing that they had again made an error of judgment in their choice of commander, revolted
               against Kleonymos, who returned from Corcyra and sacked the city. He then moved on to a place called Triopion, which he besieged until his camp
               was attacked by barbarians. Here, since large numbers of his mercenaries were killed or taken prisoner, he judged it best to withdraw to Corcyra.
               Metapontum is not mentioned in relation to these later stages of the Kleonymos story, and it used to be assumed that the city must have been
               effectively destroyed by the Lucanians in 303. This now seems unlikely in view of the archaeological as well as the numismatic evidence, and it
               is therefore possible that Metapontum played some part in the efforts to get rid of Kleonymos.</p>
            <p>There is no literary reference to Metapontum again until the Hannibalic period, so that historians have tended to rely on numismatic evidence to
               supply clues to the role of Metapontum in the S. Italian ventures of Agathokles and Pyrrhus. Since serious doubts have been cast on the
               connection between Agathokles and the use of the triskeles symbol on coins of S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> (see
               below, p. 60–61), we are left with fragmentary and confused knowledge of <pb n="4"/> Agathokles' activities after 300. According to Strabo,<ref
                  target="#CH1-n20">
                  <hi rend="sup">20</hi>
               </ref> the Syracusan ruler was brought in by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> in yet another attempt to quell the Lucanians
               and Messapians. In fact, however, Agathokles' efforts appear to have been concentrated on Bruttium. As Giannelli says, it seems rather a
               roundabout way of dealing with the Messapians and Lucanians. Furthermore, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> had a history of
               extremely bad relations with Agathokles — starting in his youth with his ejection from the Tarentines' mercenary forces for suspected
               pro-democratic activities, and continuing with Tarentine support of Akrotatos' expedition against Agathokles — which would have made him an
               unlikely source of assistance. A summons from the Greek cities of Bruttium seems more plausible (Strabo simply has his list in the wrong
               chronological order: Agathokles <hi rend="italic">was</hi> employed by <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> but in the 320s and
               not the 290s). In any case, there is no record of Agathokles having penetrated further east than Croton, which he captured in 295, and no reason
               why Metapontum should have been involved directly in his activities.</p>
            <p>The expedition of Pyrrhus is much more fully documented, and there is no doubt that his troops must have passed through or close by the territory
               of Metapontum on their way between <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and their first major battle at Heraclea. Yet there is
               never any mention of Metapontum in the detailed accounts of Plutarch, Diodorus, etc., at this or any other stage of the campaign. The literary
               and epigraphic evidence rather implies that the Tarentines provided all of the support for Pyrrhus in the initial period and that the other Greek
               cities joined in strength only after the battle of Heraclea.<ref target="#CH1-n21">

                  <hi rend="sup">23</hi>
               </ref> It will be argued below (p. 17) that the last phase of the silver coinage and perhaps one issue of gold belong to the Pyrrhic period
               because of their resemblance to the Pyrrhic issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and Heraclea and their occurrence
               with these (apparently contemporary) coins in hoards.<ref target="#CH1-n24">
                  <hi rend="sup">24</hi>
               </ref> Aside from these coins, there is as yet no archaeological evidence to fill out the literary record on this question. It seems unlikely
               that Metapontum was completely unaffected by the conflict which mobilized the rest of S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>.
               If there had been lasting treaties with the Lucanians and/or Romans, the city would presumably have been required to render aid to its allies;
               and if it did not support them, its defection would probably have been remarked by the historians. Lévêque suggests<ref target="#CH1-n25">
                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi>
               </ref> that opposition to Rome and support for Pyrrhus came most readily from democratically governed cities; aristocracies tended to see greater
               benefits in allying themselves with the Senate. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> the Kleonymos episode marked a switch to democratic rule, as Giannotta
               proposes, this might suggest that (a) such treaties as had been made earlier by the oligarchs were no longer recognized, and (b) the city may now
               have been predisposed to support Pyrrhus. To judge from the coins and the silence of the sources, this support in any case would seem to have
               been insignificant, perhaps (as several writers have suggested) because the city had suffered a rapid decline following the Kleonymos episode.
               For example, the number of farms in the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> seems to have fallen drastically (presumably as a result of barbarian
                  attacks),<ref target="#CH1-n26">
                  <hi rend="sup">26</hi>
               </ref> and this must have had disastrous consequences for the local economy in general. Metapontum was the only Greek city of the Ionian coast
                  <pb n="5"/> that did not strike silver coins on the reduced standard, i.e. in the later phases of Pyrrhus' campaign (see below), so that such
               support as there was for Pyrrhus was short-lived as well as small-scale.</p>
            <p>Whatever the role of the city, the final outcome of the Pyrrhic War for Metapontum, as for the other Greek cities, was Roman domination for the
               remainder of the third century, until Hannibal offered an opportunity to rebel. Archaeology provides most of the evidence for the third-century
               occupation of the site, now shrunk to the area in and around the <hi rend="italic">castrum.</hi> Much of the abundant bronze coinage of the city
               seems to date from this period of reduced circumstances, about which we as yet know little.</p>

                  OBOLOS pieces almost certainly date from the mid-fourth century (see p. 47). Other bronze may belong to the Pyrrhic period, but the precise
                  dating of the bronze remains uncertain; see <persName>A. Johnston,</persName> "The Bronze Coinage of Metapontum," in <hi rend="italic"

               <hi rend="bold">Arrangement of the Issues</hi>
            </head>
            <p>In order to provide a basis for discussion of the coinage, it is clearly desirable to establish the order in which the silver issues of
               Metapontum were struck. Regrettably, however, there is little completely objective evidence on the matter. While the sequence of the major
               Classes A-D is reasonably certain, the arrangement of issues within Classes suggested here is of necessity tentative and should not be regarded
               as immutable.</p>
            <p>The one wholly reliable method of reconstructing a sequence is through <hi rend="italic">die-links,</hi> as was possible for Part 2 Class
                  VIII.<ref target="#CH1-n27">
                  <hi rend="sup">27</hi>
               </ref> Unfortunately there are very few die-links between issues in Part 3, although links are frequent within issues, and those not the most
               significant (A9.1ff., linking Demeter and Leukippos types all signed <hi rend="bold">AΓH</hi>; C11. 1ff., linking right- and leftfacing Demeter
               heads and also different reverse signatures and symbols).<ref target="#CH1-n28">
                  <hi rend="sup">28</hi>
               </ref> In the absence of die-links, or of a sequence of lettered dies (such as is found at several S. Italian mints), we must fall back on a
               combination of other factors, some of which may also have significance for the absolute chronology of the coinage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="italic">Signatures</hi> provide the simplest way of grouping the coins, though there is always the possibility that the same initials
               recurred over time. For instance, there seems no justification for placing together all the coins of Metapontum signed <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi> or
                  <hi rend="bold">ΦI</hi> (see, e.g., pp. 8, 13). In theory, <hi rend="italic">hoards</hi> should provide reasonably objective information about
               the order in which issues were struck. Up to a point they do, and the evidence of the hoards has been taken into consideration here.
               Nevertheless, the retrieval and publication of hoards (especially descriptions of the relative wear of the contents) are rarely ideal, and an
               allowance for error usually has to be made, often undermining the validity of the evidence. In any case, it is inevitably the larger issues that
               tend to be represented in hoards, so that we learn virtually nothing about the smaller issues. <hi rend="italic">Overstrikes</hi> may be helpful
               in two regards: legible and datable undertypes may permit a relative sequence of the upper types to be determined; and, where the undertypes are
               not legible, it may be reasonable to group the overstrikes roughly together if the practice appears to have occurred at irregular intervals, as
               seems to have been the case generally in S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> in the fourth century (see below).</p>
            <p>Where these criteria fail, we must rely on avowedly subjective judgments of changes in <hi rend="italic">fabric</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                  >style,</hi> hopefully more subtle than the arrangement of <hi rend="italic">BMC<placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName>
               </hi> into "Period of Finest Art" and "Period of Decline" (the majority of the issues under discussion). There are clear changes in the models
               used for the Demeter heads: from the variety of hairstyles and hair ornaments of Part 2, through the acquisition of an obligatory barley wreath,
               to a veil worn over the hair neatly gathered up under the wreath, finally to a head without veil and with the hair allowed to fall loose below
               the wreath in a riot of curls (the model used for most of the obverse dies of Part 3). Different engravers coped with these types with varying
               degrees of success, so that when assessing stylistic changes, we should try to look beyond the idiosyncrasies and incompetences of individuals to
               the broader trends, and also to avoid the facile equations "good = early, bad = late." It does not appear to be feasible to trace the development
               over time of particular features, such as the disposition of the curls on the head, because the engravers seem to have copied from established
               models (perhaps statues) rather than from the immediately preceding dies. There does appear to be a general tendency for the hair to become more
               stringy <pb n="8"/> and the wreath disproportionately large as the model was copied again and again; the face changes from that of a good-looking
               young woman to one with a much more matronly appearance.</p>
            <p>The barley ears are not easy to distinguish at first sight; they nevertheless fall into different stylistic groups. The groups can be
               differentiated by the treatment of the ear itself (the modeling of the individual grains, whether they form a tapering or a squarish, chunky ear;
               whether there are tiny, partially ripened grains at the apex), the awns (fanning out or straight and compact, close together or widely spaced,
               with or without barbs), and the leaf or leaves (straight or curly, narrow or broad and furled). It took some time for the disposition of the
               elements of the reverse type (barley ear, ethnic, symbol, signature) to become standardized. In Part 2, symbols or signatures occurred only
               sporadically until Class VIII. The inclusion of both a symbol and a signature did not become regular in Part 3 until A6, so that the layout of
               the reverse depended in part on the number of elements to be accommodated. The evolution of the "normal" layout can be traced during the course
               of Class A.</p>
            <p>Comparisons with neighboring mints can sometimes be helpful, on the assumption that similar developments were roughly contemporary everywhere in
               Magna Graecia. These similarities include changes in technique (e.g., variations in the weight standard, reuse of flans by overstriking), the use
               of abbreviated/full-length signatures, the adoption of particular types and symbols (e.g., the choice of Corinthian rather than Attic helmet for
                  <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>, apparently influenced by the influx of pegasi after the middle of the
               fourth century). Sometimes the mints shared engravers (like Aristoxenos) or even perhaps magistrates (see A6).</p>
            <p>Consideration of other coinages leads into the problems of establishing an absolute chronology for Metapontum that is compatible with our
               knowledge of the rest of S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy,</placeName> a topic which will be discussed after the full range of the
               evidence has been presented (pp. 57–59). The aim of this section is more limited: to offer an explanation for the relative sequence adopted in
               the catalogue.</p>
            <div2 xml:id="d452e1233" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi rend="bold">CLASS A</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Most of the issues of Part 3 belong in readily identifiable groups that can be seen to follow on from one another with some logic, but we
                  start with two that are not easily related to the others. The issue with caduceus symbol (A1) is one of the most puzzling, because the
                  indications of its place in the sequence conflict with one another. The obverse portrays Demeter with her hair bound up under a wreath
                  (consisting of only two visible barley ears and leaves) and no veil. It does not therefore conform to either of the models that were to become
                  standard for Part 3, where Demeter is normally veiled <hi rend="italic">or</hi> wears her hair loose (A6.7 or A6.12). The dies are very deeply
                  incised and the style resembles the heads of later Part 2 (N.507–9 in particular, note the cutting of the hair and the neck tranche). The
                  style of the obverse on its own thus points to late Part 2/early Part 3. The style of the reverse is peculiar, but insofar as its features are
                  to be found elsewhere in the coinage, the connections are with later Part 3. The disposition of the elements of the reverse type is unique.
                  Normally the symbol is found above the leaf, leaving a clear space on the other side of the barley ear for the ethnic. On A1 the elements are
                  juxtaposed, so that a large caduceus symbol occupies the space where the ethnic is usually inscribed, while the ethnic is disposed rather
                  clumsily across the leaf. The placing of the signature <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi> at the base of the ear below the symbol is unusual (the
                  "normal" position is below the tip of the leaf), though there are other instances (C8–10, also signed <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi>, and A6.7–11).
                  The signature itself does not provide any obvious clue since <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi> recurs in Part 2 and Part 3 (N.448, 483, 496–98; C6–10).
                  The lettering is large and coarse, not at all like the neat letters that are standard from Part 2 Class VIII through Part 3 Class B and for
                  much of Class C. In Class A only A4 and A7.11–16 stand out as having similarly large letters. The style of the barley ear is quite unlike Part
                  2 Class VIII or A3–4. The ear is composed of highly modeled, ripe grains with the husks clearly shown; the ear tapers toward the apex; the
                  awns are slightly splayed and the barbs usually well marked; the leaf is broad and <pb n="9"/> furled, curling slightly at the tip. A2, C4.1–4
                  and C5.2 are the closest parallels.</p>
               <p>In general, the style of the caduceus issue is idiosyncratic and it may be a mistake to try to find meaningful stylistic connections since the
                  engraver (there seems to have been only one for the issue) may possibly have been an outsider unfamiliar with the traditions of the mint, who
                  simply followed his own inclinations. Since there do not appear to be any overstrikes among the specimens of the issue, the only other
                  evidence is from a single hoard, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1933"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1933</ref>, which contained an
                  example of A1 in <hi rend="italic">fdc</hi> condition, plus A6.12 (also <hi rend="italic">fdc),</hi> A7.10 and a distater B1 with nomoi of
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period V. As we shall see below (p. 26), the suggested burial date of c. 325 would
                  allow the caduceus issue to belong to the latter part of Class A or even the beginning of Class C. One hoard is hardly a very satisfactory
                  basis for assigning A1 to a fixed position in the sequence (the other hoards in which it appeared are all much later: <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1958"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1958</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1959"
                     >1959</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1980">1980</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1985">1985</ref>,
                  Ginosa), and it seems best to leave the issue somewhat vaguely in Class A for the time being.</p>
               <p>A2 falls into the same category. Indeed the barley ear and lettering of the reverses could be the work of the same engraver as the caduceus
                  issue, even though the ethnic, symbol and signature are in the orthodox positions. The hoard evidence is even less revealing since examples
                  were found only in the big, later hoards, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1958"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1958</ref> and <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1959">1959</ref>. One specimen at least is allegedly overstruck,<ref target="#CH1-n29">
                     <hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                  </ref> which suggests that the issue belongs in Class A with the other overstruck issues (see below). The type of Zeus Eleutherios is usually
                  associated with Timoleon and more generally with the notion of Greek freedom and autonomy, both of which point to a date in the 330s for the
                  issue, when the memory of Timoleon's coinage was still fresh and when the S. Italian cities were particularly preoccupied with maintaining
                  their integrity vis-à-vis the barbarians. The labeling of the head is most characteristic of early Part 3 (compare A6.7, 6.10–12; B3). The
                  signature (?<hi rend="bold">AΔ</hi>, never truly legible), and also to some extent the style of the reverses, might indicate a connection with
                  C5 (also signed <hi rend="bold">AΔ/ΔA</hi>), but on balance the issue seems most likely to be part of Class A.</p>
               <p>Class A almost certainly overlaps with the end of Part 2.<ref target="#CH1-n30">
                     <hi rend="sup">30</hi>
                  </ref> It has been argued above<ref target="#CH1-n31">
                     <hi rend="sup">31</hi>
                  </ref> that the two small Leukippos issues (A3–4) should probably be inserted among the Demeter heads of Class VIII, partly because A4
                  occurred in hoards which otherwise ended with Class VIII (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1926"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>
                     1926</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1928">1928</ref>), partly because of the high incidence of overstriking in both, and
                  partly because the style very closely resembles that of Class VIII (in the treatment of the barley ears, the variation in the length and
                  placing of the ethnic, the erratic use of the reverse symbol). A3 does not appear in hoards. Its absence is to be expected since the issue is
                  very rare, struck from a single die-pair. Hoards thus provide no certain evidence as to the place of A3 in the sequence. It is nonetheless
                  reckoned to be the very first Leukippos type because the head is labeled with the hero's name; the style of the reverse, too, is closer to
                  Part 2 than Part 3, and the large pomegranate symbol may be related to N.490. The signature <hi rend="bold">API</hi> occurs later, on A6.7–9,
                  but the style by then is rather different and the two instances of the signature need not be contemporary.</p>
               <p>With the torch issue, A5, we reach the start of Part 3 proper. The connections with late Part 2, A3–4 and with other Class A issues are
                  strong. Like later Class VIII and A3–4, almost all the known specimens of A5 show traces of overstriking, apparently on pegasi. Again like
                  Class VIII and A6.3–5, the reverse has a signature only, without a symbol; <hi rend="bold">├H</hi> might even refer to the same person/thing
                  as the <hi rend="bold">├HP</hi> signature on N.526–7. The obverse symbol (without signature) is also characteristic of early Class A and ties
                  in with A3–4, A6.2–5, 6.10, 6.12. The style generally resembles A3–4 (the angle of the helmet, the blunt-ended ears of A5.1–8, the <pb n="10"
                  /> ethnic in small neat letters), though the modeling of Leukippos' face is more accomplished. The female head was presumably the first
                  obverse of the issue: the torch served to identify her as Demeter in the absence of a barley wreath (compare N.322 and 421); the head has
                  affinities with Class VIII, before the wreath became standard, rather than with A6.7ff., the models for the remainder of Part 3. The two
                  Leukippos obverse dies were used until they were very worn, like A4.1.</p>
               <p>The next group, A6, is made up of six small issues, each with a different obverse type and reverse symbol but all with the signature <hi
                     rend="bold">K</hi> or <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi>. Included with them is a single die-pair, A6.1, whose symbol and signature are unfortunately
                  just off the flan of all four known specimens, but its style so closely resembles that of the rest of the group that there need be little
                  hesitation about placing them all together. In addition, the fact that one example is an overstrike suggests that A6.1 belongs in the phase of
                  overstriking that began in Class VIII and continued through A3–4, A5 and A6.2–4.</p>
               <p>The range of gods and heroes chosen for the obverse types of this group is unique in the silver coinage of Metapontum — indeed, in Magna
                  Graecia. Mints were usually very conservative in their adherence to their chosen type, although engravers often achieved considerable
                  diversity in their treatment of the basic themes. (Silver fractions and bronze exhibit much greater diversity of types for the obvious
                  practical reason that the types helped to distinguish the denominations.) Metapontum had been more adventurous than most of her neighbors,
                  especially at the beginning of the doublerelief coinage before Demeter had been selected as the standard obverse type. During the late fifth
                  and first half of the fourth century Herakles, Apollo, Apollo Karneios, Dionysus and a Pan had appeared occasionally interspersed among the
                  Demeters. The Leukippos type seems to have been introduced after c. 350 and was used sporadically thereafter. As we shall see, there were only
                  three other instances of deviation from Demeter and Leukippos in the whole of the stater coinage after 350 (Tharragoras: A7.13–18;
                     <persName>Athena:</persName> C3; Herakles: D4.1–3). Five different male heads and two completely new versions of Demeter were therefore a
                  remarkable break with tradition. They could all be the work of a single engraver, very likely the same person who cut the torch issue: the
                  style is excellent, and has a flair and an assurance that is rare in the coinage of Metapontum. We can only speculate as to the reason for the
                  variety. Perhaps a talented engraver was allowed to parade his skills and at the same time display a range of gods and heroes that epitomized
                  the city's Hellenic tradition at a time when it was threatened by the Lucani.</p>
               <p>Herakles and Apollo are identified simply by their headgear (lion skin, laurel wreath), Zeus by a fulmen; Leukippos, Tharragoras and Demeter
                  are labeled with their names, and in addition Leukippos has a parazonium and Demeter a torch (on A6.12, compare A5, N.322 and 421; there may
                  have been a torch on A6.7 as well that is simply not visible on the surviving examples since they are all struck on flans much smaller than
                  the area within the dotted border of the obverse die).</p>
               <p>All the subsequent Demeter heads were based on the two models, A6.7 and A6.12. The first, A6.7, is an adaptation of the Hera type on the
                  Tarentine gold staters and half-staters which date from the third quarter of the fourth century. The details of the hair and veil are closely
                  copied, even to the way that the end of the veil trails below the neck tranche; the only change is that Demeter wears a barley wreath whereas
                  Hera wears a stephane. The other model, A6.12, does not appear to have any numismatic antecedent (unless it developed out of the type with
                  long hair, signed by Aristoxenos, N.439) and may have been derived from a statue. If the type were not clearly labeled Demeter one might well
                  be tempted to identify the youthful head with its exuberant curls and flamboyant wreath as Kore, and the more sober veiled head as Demeter.
                  The Apollo head with its tightly curled hair is closer in style to the fourth-century facing Apollo types of Amphipolis<ref

                  </ref> remarks that such a narrow <pb n="11"/> view, almost in profile, is very unusual, although the three-quarters view was fairly

               <p>The reverse dies offer less scope for virtuosity; they are very similar to the reverses of the torch issue, the barley ears chunky, the
                  lettering small and neat. The longer form of the ethnic, <hi rend="bold">METAΓON</hi>, is used on A6.2–5 for the last time on the staters —
                     <hi rend="bold">META</hi> is used invariably thereafter. On the reverse of the Herakles (A6.1) there are traces of either a symbol and
                  signature on either side of the leaf (as A6.6 or 6.12) or alternatively two symbols (as A6.7–9); it is impossible to guess what either might
                  have been. Only one reverse die of the Zeus type (A6.2–5) has a symbol, and that does not appear to have been the first (or last) of the issue
                  since a break had already begun to develop on the obverse die by the time that the die was used with the poppy seed reverse. As noted in the
                  catalogue, there are specimens of A6.4 both without and with the die break, as if more than one reverse die had been prepared and dies were
                  drawn at random from a die-box. The standard layout of the elements of the reverse was still evolving at this stage: on A6.2–5 the signature
                  is above the leaf (as on the torch issue and on the lettered series of Part 2 Class VIII), with the symbol on A6.2 above the signature — the
                  first reverse die to have both a symbol and a signature. A6.6 and 6.12 move closer to the norm, with the symbol above the leaf and the
                  signature below, but running vertically. The double symbol of A6.7–9 leaves no space for the signature below the leaf, so instead it is placed
                  horizontally at the base of the ear below the ethnic, the position where it then remained on A6.10–11 and A7.1–10.</p>
               <p>The control marks had normally been minimal prior to A6.6: either one symbol <hi rend="italic">or</hi> one signature, or at most two symbols
                  sufficed. Hereafter almost all reverse dies carry both a symbol and a signature, and many obverse dies were also signed (A6.6–12, all A7). The
                  new practice may have been copied from elsewhere or arose from changed circumstances that affected other mints too, since these same
                  signatures Kal..., Ari... and Ona... also occur together at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Thurium and Heraclea (see
                  below, p. 53). Significantly, these issues were the latest of all three mints to be included in the Palombaio hoard (<ref

               <p>A7 has three obverse types: a Demeter copied from A6.7 (A7.1–9), an unusual head of Demeter/Kore surrounded by barley stalks (A7.10–12), and a
                  helmeted male head (presumably Tharragoras again, A7.13–18). A7.10 is connected with A7.1–9 by the signature Pro..., placed on both at the
                  base of the barley ear but above a second short leaf which is peculiar to these dies. The obverse die of A7.10 then recurs with a different
                  reverse signature (Ap...) and symbol, and again (recut) with Pro... and a third symbol. The Tharragoras issue, A7.13–18, is more tenuously
                  associated with A7.10–12 on grounds of style and (possibly) the more abbreviated signatures <hi rend="bold">Σ</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Γ</hi>
                  (where A7.10–12 have <hi rend="bold">Σ/A</hi> and <hi rend="bold">ΓPO</hi>).<ref target="#CH1-n34">
                     <hi rend="sup">34</hi>
                  </ref> The group appears to be the work of two engravers, one of whom probably also cut the reverses of A6: the hallmarks of his style are the
                  chunky barley ears and small neat letters, whereas his colleague used large letters and made a narrow leaf curve up very close to the base of
                  the barley ear. The first engraver could have been responsible for the large bold Demeter heads of A7.1–9, which are deeply incised; the other
                  produced more delicate, even fussy, heads in flatter relief.</p>
               <p>All the obverse dies are signed, continuing the practice of A6.6ff., but the letters are now placed behind the head and/or under the chin. At
                  first the reverse signatures follow on from A6.7–11, at the base of the barley ear; they are then displaced to the other side of the ear by
                  the large ethnic on A7.11–12; and they end up <pb n="12"/> below the leaf, underneath the symbol on A7.13–18, the position normally used
                  thereafter.</p>
               <p>The Demeter head surrounded by barley stalks is unique, and was perhaps inspired by Sicilian models. The barley stalks symbolize the rich
                  fields of the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> around the city like the barley grains around the lion's head at Leontini, or the dolphins
                  representing the sea around the head of Arethusa at Syracuse. Thar- ragoras, like Leukippos, presumably had military connotations<ref

                     <hi rend="sup">35</hi>
                  </ref> — hence, too, the trophy and helmet symbols.</p>
               <p>The tripod issue is the only one of the three that has been found in a hoard. One example in <hi rend="italic">fdc</hi> condition was found in
                     <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1929"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1929</ref>, the "Molossian" hoard, with a <hi rend="bold"

                  among others (see p. 22); a burial date of c. 335/330 has been proposed.</p>
               <p>After the variety of A6 and A7 we come to a fairly homogeneous group of Demeter types, all based on the veiled head model (A6.7) and all
                  signed on the reverse <hi rend="bold">ΦI</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Φ</hi>. The <hi rend="bold">ΦI</hi> issues have no visible obverse signature,
                  but this may again be the accident of survival since the flans are even smaller. The style generally of A8.1–6 is unlike anything that has
                  gone before: the Demeters look weak and insipid because the modeling of the faces is poor and the eyes have not got the forceful expression of
                  the earlier versions of the head; the barley ears are small, fine-grained and tapering.</p>
               <p>The mouse issue, A8.7–28, is the largest under a single symbol to date, with six obverse dies and twice as many reverse dies. The die
                  combinations indicate that there was a die-box and probably more than one anvil was in operation. The obverse dies are now all signed under
                  the chin, like A7.14, rather than behind the head (as A6); the signatures on the reverse are almost always in the usual place under the leaf,
                  except for A8.10 (<hi rend="bold">Φ</hi> at base of ear and also under leaf) and A8.16 (above symbol). The Demeters were cut by three
                  different hands. Engraver A was responsible for the small, slightly prim-looking head with the transparent veil shown slightly above the line
                  of the curls at the top and back of the head (A8.7); engraver B produced a bolder version with large, heavy-lidded eyes and an earring with
                  bulbous central pendant (A8.10, 8.18); engraver C most closely imitates the Tarentine prototype — a soft, youthful head with full cheeks and
                  rounded chin, sometimes wearing both wreath and stephane or ampyx (A8.15, 8.19, 8.22). The reverses cannot be so easily assigned among these
                  engravers. There were at least two engravers, one cutting small neat barley ears and closely spaced ethnics (e.g., A8.7–8), the other larger
                  chunky ears and less crowded ethnics (A8.9).</p>
               <p>In spite of the size of the mouse issue, neither it nor the other <hi rend="bold">Φ</hi> issue was represented in the hoards that closed with
                  the Molossian or immediately post-Molossian issues (see pp. 28–29, Table 1). The first hoards to contain examples of A8 were buried much later
                  in the century (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1934"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1934</ref>, <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1970">1970</ref>). None of the specimens appears to be overstruck.</p>
               <p>The transition to Class B is provided by A9, a small interlinked group comprising two obverse and three reverse dies, the obverses signed <hi
                     rend="bold">N</hi> or <hi rend="bold">NI</hi> and the reverses all signed <hi rend="bold">AΓH</hi>. The connection with A8 is provided by
                  the Demeter head A9.1, which is clearly the work of engraver C of A8.15, etc., while the connection with Class B is provided by the switch to
                  a Leukippos type and (more significantly) by the signature <hi rend="bold">AΓ(H</hi>), also found on the obverses of the Leukippos head
                  distaters and staters, B1–2. The signature may well refer to the same person as the <hi rend="bold">AΓ</hi> of A8.15ff.</p>
               <p>The most remarkable feature of A9 is that almost all the known specimens of A9.1–3 are very clearly overstruck,<ref target="#CH1-n36">
                     <hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                  </ref> as if the coins were produced in great haste with little concern to obliterate the earlier types. The undertypes are all pegasi of
                  Leucas and Anactorium (see p. 38, Table 4).</p>
               <p>In contrast to the mouse issue, where the same symbol and signature recurred on more than a dozen reverse dies, each reverse of A9 has a
                  different symbol, as if the symbol was intended to distinguish the dies. The symbols are drawn from outside the normal repertoire at <pb
                     n="13"/> Metapontum (see pp. 51–52): a comic mask, a pegasus protome (a reference to the source of the flans?), a crescent. The signatures
                  are added haphazardly — retrograde between the ear and leaf, at the base of the ear below the ethnic (as A6.7ff.), or above the leaf and below
                  the symbol (as A6.2). The engraving otherwise shows no sign at all of haste or carelessness: Demeter's hair and veil and Leukippos' beard and
                  helmet are rendered with meticulous care, even to the point of showing the clips on the helmet for attaching plumes and the worked edge of the
                  neckflap, both refinements that were usually omitted.</p>
               <p>Before moving on to Class B, we should examine the possibility that the production of parallel series noted for Part 2 Class VIII continued in
                  Class A. There is in fact no obvious indication of this. The issues seem rather to proceed from one another, and although two anvils could
                  have been operating simultaneously at any stage, and almost certainly were by the end of Class A (A8.7ff.), the numbers of dies involved until
                  A8 seem too small to have required more than a single-anvil operation.</p>

                  <p>After this text went to press, new evidence emerged to confirm this point. A4.4 provides the link with Part 2: the reverse is the same die
                     as N.516 (the very end of Part 2, Class VIII), while the obverse is struck from the die of A4.1, now showing considerable wear. There can

                  </ref> belong to the time of Alexander the Molossian's campaign and more specifically to the period when Metapontum was one of his main
                  allies. The distaters are connected with the large stater issue B2 by common symbols (lion protome/head, club) and signatures (obverse <hi
                     rend="bold">AΓH/AΓ</hi> as well as <hi rend="bold">AMI</hi> on the reverse). The other large stater issue, B3, has different symbols (dog,
                  bird) and obverse signature (<hi rend="bold">Σ</hi>) but the same reverse signature (<hi rend="bold">AMI</hi>), and it so closely resembles
                  B1–2 in style that they must be approximately contemporary. The remaining stater issue, B4, is markedly different in style: instead of the
                  proliferation of control marks there is only one signature (again <hi rend="bold">AMI</hi>, but on the obverse) and one symbol (a fulmen on
                  the reverse). It is also a much smaller issue than the others — only three obverse and three reverse dies. The issue may have been struck
                  under different circumstances from B1–3, on the responsibility of Ami... without his colleagues, perhaps in response to some sudden need for
                  cash toward the end of the campaign. The engraver of B4 was clearly not responsible for B1–3, but it is almost impossible to be certain how
                  many engravers worked on the larger issues since the overall style is extremely consistent and could be the product of one man, or possibly
                  two who worked closely together. Some of the reverses have tiny extra grains at the apex of the barley ear (e.g., B3.3, 3.17), but otherwise
                  the style in general is very similar to A8.1ff.</p>
               <p>None of the examples of Class B appears to be overstruck. Hoard evidence suggests that the group was roughly contemporary with early
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period V (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1933"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>

               <p>With the exception of one small issue with <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> head (C3), Class C is entirely
                  composed of Demeter types. The veiled head type is abandoned completely and all the Demeters hereafter are based on the "long-haired" model,
                  A6.12. They are fairly evenly divided between left-facing and right-facing heads, with one attempt at a three-quarters view, C2.<ref
                     target="#CH1-n38">
                     <hi rend="sup">38</hi>
                  </ref> The issues — defined as a group with a common reverse symbol and signature — vary considerably in size. The largest (C1) required 60
                  reverse dies, four run to between 10 and 20 reverses, and the rest have six or even fewer. Two signatures, <hi rend="bold">AϴA</hi> and <hi
                     rend="bold">ΛY</hi>, recur with several symbols; the styles of these issues are in some cases sufficiently disparate that it seems unlikely
                  that they follow one another and they may have been spread across a considerable interval. Obverse signatures occur on only five issues (C1–3,
                  C5, C8).</p>
               <pb n="14"/>
               <p>There is no obvious indication as to the duration of the large plough issue (was it struck over a period of months, or years?) or the reason
                  for its size. The return to the Demeter type suggests that it was struck in peacetime: it recalls a similar phenomenon at Heraclea, where
                  there is a contemporary issue — again much larger than any previously under a single signature — showing Herakles holding the skin of the
                  conquered lion,<ref target="#CH1-n39">
                     <hi rend="sup">39</hi>
                  </ref> a type that is normally thought to be an allusion to the defeat of the barbarians by Alexander the Molossian. The style of the plough
                  issue is remarkably consistent throughout the 25 obverses and 60 reverses, and the strong affinities between C1 and B2 especially (in the
                  cutting of the tapering barley ears, the thickly barbed awns and the small neat lettering) suggest that there was no significant break in the
                  coinage between Classes B and C. This is confirmed by the hoard evidence since two important hoards close with Class B and C1 in similar
                  condition (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1960"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1960</ref>, <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1981">1981</ref>).<ref target="#CH1-n40">
                     <hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                  </ref> The plough symbol also occurs on several fractions, some of which (F2) are clearly contemporary with C1.</p>
               <p>The single variant of C1 with bucranium symbol (C1.1) provides a possible connection between C1 and the facing head issue, C2, although the
                  bull's head wears a fillet on the former and is unadorned on the latter; the style of the reverses, too, is very similar. C1.1 clearly belongs
                  with the plough issue, given the close similarities of style between the obverse and C1.2ff., and the unusual reverse signature <hi
                     rend="bold">MAX</hi>. The obverse is signed I behind the head, a signature that does not recur.</p>
               <p>The facing head issue is one of three signed <hi rend="bold">AϴA.<ref target="#CH1-n41">
                        <hi rend="sup">41</hi>
                     </ref>
                  </hi> In spite of the small number of dies (three obverse and five reverse), the pattern of die use indicates that two anvils were in
                  operation simultaneously. The obverse signature <hi rend="bold">AΓ</hi> might refer to the same person as the <hi rend="bold">AΓ</hi> of A8–9
                  or B1–2, though the commonness of Greek names beginning Ap... makes this far from certain.</p>
               <p>Another small issue, C3, again signed <hi rend="bold">AϴA</hi>, is modeled on the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122"
                     >Athena</ref> heads of the later pegasi on which the goddess wears a Corinthian helmet with a very large neckflap, and straggly locks of
                  hair protrude beneath. The style of the reverses is not unlike that of certain dies of C1 (e.g., C1.23–25), apart from the unusual position of
                  the signature between ear and leaf. As in the case of the plough staters, a companion issue of fractions was apparently struck alongside C3,
                  also signed <hi rend="bold">ΣA</hi> and with owl and locust symbol, but with Apollo Karneios in place of <ref
                     target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> as the obverse type (F7).</p>
               <p>The final issue signed <hi rend="bold">AϴA</hi>, C4 (tongs), is quite unlike C1–3 in style: the proportions of the Demeter head are very
                  different from the plough issue (though in some ways closer to A6.12); the small, neat lettering and fine-grained, tapering barley ears have
                  been replaced by less careful engraving, the barley ears coarsegrained and the ethnic in untidy letters; the obverse die is no longer signed.
                  The pattern of die use of the 11 obverses and 20 reverses again indicates a two-anvil operation for much if not all of the issue.</p>
               <p>Apart from one obverse (C5.1), the hayfork issue is very similar in style to the tongs issue and most of the dies could have been cut by the
                  same engraver. The one anomalous obverse is much closer to the Aristoxenos model (N.439) or even the Agathoklean Kore head at Syracuse (<hi
                     rend="italic">PCG,</hi> pl. 31, no.14) than to A6.12: the head is more dignified, the hair is less curly and the barley wreath consists of
                  only one pair of barley ears and leaves. It is also the only signed obverse of the issue (perhaps <hi rend="bold">ΔΩPI</hi>... was an
                  engraver?). It is not clear whether the signature on the reverse is meant to be <hi rend="bold">AΔ</hi> or <hi rend="bold">ΔA</hi> since both
                  occur: the ethnic is retrograde on two dies, but as one reads <hi rend="bold">ΔA</hi> and the other <hi rend="bold">AΔ</hi>, we are none the
                  wiser. Although there are almost as many dies as for the tongs issue, one anvil seems to have sufficed to produce the issue.</p>
               <p>The other major element of Class C are the five issues signed <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi> (C6–10). Two (C6–7) are so similar to one another (and
                  also to the hayfork issue) that they could be the work of a single engraver. Another two (C8–9, with right-facing Demeter) do not in the least
                  resemble C6–7; <pb n="15"/> both share some common features and may share one engraver. The remaining tiny issue, C10, is of very poor style,
                  clearly produced by an inexperienced workman.</p>
               <p>Some of the obverse dies of C5, C6 and C7 could easily be mistaken for each other, and only close inspection of the arrangement of the curls
                  reveals the slight differences. The reverses of C6–7 have large untidy letters similar to C5; the barbs are often barely visible on the deeply
                  incised, densely packed awns. The larger issue, with griffin symbol (C6), runs to eight obverse and ten reverse dies which are so combined
                  that a two-anvil operation seems likely; the Artemis issue (C7), with only four obverses and six reverses, is less complex in its pattern of
                  linkage.</p>
               <p>C8–10 break with the established layout of the reverse used since the end of Class A, and for some reason revert to the practice of A6.7ff. in
                  placing the signature at the base of the ear below the ethnic. Some of the obverses of the star issue (C8) show greater finesse in the
                  engraving than C6–7, though there is a tendency to make the leaves and barley ears in the wreath disproportionately large; three of the
                  obverses (C8.14ff.) are markedly inferior (one perhaps crudely recut), apparently cut by the same engraver as the much smaller Nike issue, C9.
                  (For the large number of unofficial dies of C9, see further below, p. 90.) The engraving of the altar issue, C10, is still less competent. The
                  workman lacked the skill even to reverse most of the letters as he cut a die, so that both ethnic and signatures are often retrograde, while
                  the Demeter head was far beyond his capacities.<ref target="#CH1-n42">
                     <hi rend="sup">42</hi>
                  </ref> The sharply tapering barley ear of C10.1 is quite similar to the reverse of C9.1ff., which may mean that the same personnel was
                  involved.</p>
               <p>The last group of Class C to be discussed is made up of three issues, amounting to four obverse and seven reverse dies in all, distinguished
                  by amphora, fly and alabastron sym bols. Die links show that the three belong together, even though the obverse heads are dissimilar (C11.1:
                  left-facing Demeter strongly resembling C7.2 (reversed); C11.3ff.: rightfacing Demeter resembling C5.8ff.). The same signatures, <hi
                     rend="bold">ΔI</hi> and <hi rend="bold">ΦI</hi>, recur together again in Class D.</p>
               <p>The issues of Class C can be divided into three phases:</p>
               <list type="alpha">
                  <item n="(a)"> plough, with the facing head and <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> types either following
                     immediately afterward or else contemporary with the latter part of C1.</item>
                  <item n="(b)"> tongs, hayfork, griffin and Artemis, which appear to follow on closely from one another; C11 could well belong here,
                     overlapping the hayfork and griffin issues.</item>
                  <item n="(c)"> star, Nike, altar; amphora, fly, alabastron.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These phases emerge from an evaluation of both stylistic considerations and the hoard evidence. In the first phase, which is apparently a
                  continuation of Class B, the engraving is neat and careful, the dies not deeply incised. As already mentioned, two hoards closed with the
                  early part of this phase and with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period V (<ref

                     >1981</ref>). The second phase is characterized by much bolder and untidier engraving, irregular letters, much coarser Demeter heads and
                  barley ears than before. Five hoards go down to the griffin issue and early <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period VI

                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1965">1965</ref>), of which the Taranto Via Mazzini is the most revealing (the plough issue very worn,
                  the star issue apparently fresh at the time of burial).</p>
               <p>The three phases appear to have spanned a minimum of approximately 30 years to judge <pb n="16"/> by the spread of contemporary Tarentine
                  issues, and while one could plausibly postulate steady production at the rate of five obverse and ten reverse dies (on average) every couple
                  of years, it seems more likely that there were gaps between each phase and that production was concentrated in short bursts as circumstances
                  permitted or required.</p>
               <p>The two problem issues mentioned at the beginning of Class A (A1–2) might alternatively belong in the second phase of Class C, where the
                  reverses are of compatible style and the reverse signature <hi rend="bold">AΔ</hi> and <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi> also occur, though there are
                  other difficulties which make this possibility unlikely. For instance, the idiosyncrasies of the caduceus issue are even harder to explain
                  after decades of accepted mint practice: the placing of the signature connects A1 with the final phase of Class C, though there is no other
                  common feature; and the labeling of the Zeus head, not unusual in Class A, would be incongruous in Classes C or D. Furthermore, the burial
                  date of <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1933"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1933</ref> cannot easily be pushed down far enough to
                  accommodate a much later place in the sequence for A1 because of the other contents, and the absence of any examples of the large issues of
                  Class B or the plough symbol seems improbable if the hoard were given a much later burial date.</p>

               <p>A significant break in time or organization must have ensued at the end of Class C, since the pattern of production was markedly different
                  when coinage was resumed, in that there are many changes of symbol for each change of signature, the symbols often being used for only one or
                  two dies. Furthermore, the style of both the Demeter heads and the barley ears is unlike anything that has gone before: the heads tend to be
                  large and matronly, the hair depicted in almost corrugated curls, while the barley ears are either very coarse-grained with widely separated
                  awns or else made up of many tiny grains and compact awns. The lettering is varied — some small and neat, some large and more irregular. A's
                  with broken cross-bars make their first appearance since Part 2 Class VIII.</p>
               <p>The class again falls into three main subsections: (a) no reverse signature, (b) reverse signature <hi rend="bold">├A,</hi> (c) reverse
                  signature <hi rend="bold">ΦI.</hi> The spindle issue, D1, appears to be the first of the Class since the large <placeName>Bernalda</placeName>
                  hoard (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1958"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1958</ref>), which contained a full range of issues of
                  Classes A-C, stopped with two examples of D1 and no other representative of Class D. The reverse is unsigned, for the first time since B4 or,
                  before that, A4; the signature is placed instead on the obverse, <hi rend="bold">ΔI</hi> on one die (obscured by a die break) and <hi
                     rend="bold">K</hi> on the other. The style is completely unrelated to Class C. The Demeter head still ultimately derives from the
                  "long-haired" model, A6.12, though much of the detail has been lost: the wreath consists of only three barley ears and three leaves, the curls
                  of the hair have been much simplified and there are no locks visible under the chin. D1.1 is of a rather better style than the other Demeter
                  heads of Class D, and stands in the same relationship to them as A6.12 to its less accomplished successors.</p>
               <p>The cock and satyr issues (D2), placed next, are entirely unsigned. If, as appears to be the case, the obverse of D2.6 is the same die as D3.1
                  recut, the signature <hi rend="bold">Γ</hi> was deliberately removed and the anonymous issues clearly do not form a separate (and prior)
                  group. The Demeter head of the cock issue, D2.1–4, is very similar to D1.1, the details slightly coarsened. The reverses of D2.2–4 are by a
                  different hand to D1: the ear cut small enough that the awns do not reach to the edge of the die, thus the extremities of the barley ear are
                  visible on most specimens. The ethnic is engraved in small letters (including <hi rend="bold">A</hi> with broken cross-bar). The symbol on the
                  reverse of D2.4 may be a cock obscured by die flaws.</p>
               <p>The reverses of the satyr issue are apparently copied from D1 (note the large knobbly grains and the awns have been cut too far apart). The
                  Demeter head of D2.5 appears to be by the engraver of D1 in spite of the differences in the hairstyle and the lack of a barley wreath;
                  similarly, the obverses of D2.6–8 are coarser, though even they may be by the same hand.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="bold">├A</hi> group, D3, comprises five small issues with different reverse symbols (ram's head, krater, wing,
                  candelabrum/thyrsos, amphora) and the signature ├A on the reverse, either in a <pb n="17"/> peculiar place between the barley ear and the
                  symbol (D3.1–5) or in the orthodox position (D3.6 ff). All the obverse dies are signed: <hi rend="bold">Γ</hi> (D3. 1–2, compare D4.18–19) or
                     <hi rend="bold">ΔI</hi> (D3.3–4, 3.6–11, compare D4.4–17), recut <hi rend="bold">TAP</hi> in monogram on D3.5; the letters <hi rend="bold"
                     >ΔI</hi> are cut rather tentatively on D3.6, as if the engraver had been prepared to erase them. The Demeter heads are very similar to
                  D2.6ff.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="bold">ΦI</hi> group, D4, is larger and more varied in type and symbols. The three unsigned <ref
                     target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref> dies appear to belong together in spite of their differences of style, as
                  D4.1 and 4.2 share a common reverse and D.4.3 has a symbol whose only visible part seems to be handle of a kylix. The model is quite unlike
                  the earlier types in which <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles</ref> wore the lion skin on his head; the left- and
                  right-facing heads are by different hands (note the cutting of hair, beard, eye and mouth, and the modeling of the neck on D4.1). The
                  Leukippos head, too, is a new variant of an old type, the helmet embellished for the first time with crest and wreath. The revival of these
                  two warlike types suggests that coinage was prompted by renewed military activity. Like D3, all the obverses of D4 (except the <ref
                     target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q122248">Herakles)</ref> are signed <hi rend="bold">ΔI</hi> (D4.4–17) or <hi rend="bold">Γ</hi>
                  (D4.18–19). The Demeter head, D4.7, resembles the heads of D3, while the other Demeter types appear more youthful, with the hair rendered
                  vigorously in corkscrew curls. The largest issue of the Class is the ant and cornucopiae (D4.8–14) with five reverse dies (three is otherwise
                  the maximum); the style is almost identical to the double amphora and pig issues (D4.15–19).</p>
               <p>As a tailpiece to the <hi rend="bold">ΦI</hi> group there are four closely similar die-pairs without obverse signature, two (?three) of them
                  with obverse symbols instead. On D5.5 a die break obscures either a symbol or a signature behind the head. The mint appears to have tolerated
                  such flaws, and repair was clearly not the reason for the alteration of the symbol on D5.2.</p>
               <p>It is not easy to apportion dies among engravers in Class D. There is a general similarity about the Demeter heads which might have occurred
                  if a single workman did not always copy the model in precisely the same way or if an assistant had tried to produce imitations. The obverses
                  share certain features — like the large heavy-lidded eye with prominent eye-ball and the cutting of the hair in bold strokes — and yet the
                  detailed treatment of the hair and the expressions of the faces vary. D1, D2.5 and D4.2–3 seem to show more delicate workmanship than the
                  others. The reverses ought to be simpler to assign: the knobbly grains of D1 (and perhaps D2.5ff. and D3.9) or the tiny grains of D2.2–4 and
                  D4.3 stand out at once. But is D4.18 by the same hand as the last, or by another ?</p>
               <p>The general impression is that Class D was produced within a brief time-span, perhaps in parallel series (<hi rend="bold">˫A</hi> alongside
                     <hi rend="bold">ΦI</hi>, given the recurring signatures <hi rend="bold">ΔI</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Γ</hi> on both?), perhaps
                  consecutively. The Class recalls the final phase of the coinage of Heraclea, where a few signatures are repeated with frequently changing
                  types and symbols, or the Pyrrhic coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> again with an abundance of changing
                  symbols and signatures (some of them shared with Metapontum, see below). It will be argued later (p. 31) that the Class does in fact date from
                  the Pyrrhic period. Most of the published examples come from two large hoards which seem to be Pyrrhic War burials (<ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1959"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1959</ref> and <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1980"
                     >1980</ref>), both of which contained a full range of the coinage of Part 3 and closed with examples of Class D in sharp condition.</p>
               <p>This study deliberately does not cover two silver issues that are normally catalogued with the coins of Metapontum, but which are peripheral
                  to the main coinage: the drachms of the Lucani with barley ear type and the Hannibalic silver in the city's name. There is nothing to add to
                     <persName>Robinson's</persName> brief but adequate description of the latter<ref target="#CH1-n45">
                     <hi rend="sup">45</hi>
                  </ref> in which he decisively attributes the issues to the Hannibalic occupation of the city on the basis of the Punic weight standard and
                  their occurrence in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch2016"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2016</ref> with similar coins of <placeName
                     corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period X. The drachms of the Lucani have also been dated to the Hannibalic period but are, as
                     <persName>Robinson</persName> says, more likely to belong to the beginning of the third century in view of their weight (c. 3g), which is
                  more in line with the standard of the "reduced" drachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Periods VI and <pb n="18"/>
                  VII and also of Metapontum (F1, p. 168 below). (There is, of course, a half-shekel with Metapontine types, but <hi rend="bold">ΛOYKA</hi> in
                  place of <hi rend="bold">META</hi>,<ref target="#CH1-n46">
                     <hi rend="sup">46</hi>
                  </ref> which is obviously Hannibalic.) The coins are attributed to the Lucani because of the monogram in place of an ethnic. The reverse type
                  is clearly an imitation of the standard Metapontine reverse, with the symbol (club) placed above the leaf (cp. also the fractions of
                     <persName>Rubi,</persName> see below, p. 49), but the obverse <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> is much
                  closer to Tarentine types than to anything struck at Metapontum.<ref target="#CH1-n47">
                     <hi rend="sup">47</hi>
                  </ref> There is, in fact, no solid reason why the coins should have been struck at Metapontum for the Lucani. The Lucani were presumably quite
                  capable of the limited technical competence required to produce their own coins by the early third century, and not unnaturally chose types
                  already familiar in the region.</p>

            <p>The hoards containing material relevant to our period have been set out in Table 1 (below pp. 28–29), arranged in approximately chronological
               order of burial dates which have been assigned on the basis of their total known contents, not of the Metapontine coins alone. All the usual
               caveats apply with regard to the completeness and the accuracy of recording of the hoards. In the post-Noe period, with no standard catalogue or
               listing of the issues available, there have been inevitable difficulties about the precise identification of the Metapontine pieces, especially
               where symbols or initials are illegible. In addition to the fully published hoards (and those hoards containing only a few coins of Metapontum
               that often presented no problem of identification, even without illustrations), it has been possible to give details of several hoards in the
               museums in Taranto and Reggio which I have been able to examine through the kindness of the curators, as well as some that are documented in the
               ANS archives in New York.<ref target="#CH1-n48">

            </p>
            <p>First, three hoards should be mentioned that were omitted from Part 2, Table 3, or that have now been published in greater detail.</p>
            <p>Pezza della Lita, near Cosenza, October 1974 (Guzzo, <hi rend="italic">AIIN</hi> 1974–5, pp. 203–8). Omitted from Part 2, Table 3. Only ten
               pieces were recovered from a pot-hoard originally comprising more than a hundred, therefore little weight can be attached to the evidence.
               Nevertheless, the known contents accord well with the arrangement in Part 2, Table 3. The Metapontine coins were an incuse (as N.136) and one of
               Class VIIIa (N.496); the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> pieces were one IIID1 and two IIIL4; the four of Croton were an
               incuse, a facing Hera (as <hi rend="italic">SNGCop</hi> 1801), and two eagle/tripod (<hi rend="italic">SNGCop</hi> 1795, 1797).</p>

               <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1923"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1923</ref>, Altamura, August 1961. The hoard has now been published
               very fully by Giuseppe Guzzetta ("Il tesoretto monetale da Altamura, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1923"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>

                  (<hi rend="italic">SNGOxford</hi> 957, 960, 1058) and Terina (Regling 62–3, 78) were somewhat later than those in the Paestum hoard (<ref
                  target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1925"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1925</ref>). The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>
               pieces included a full range of <persName>Evans</persName> Period III (K, L, M, N, O, P, S) but nothing later than the three examples of IVB1
                  (<hi rend="italic">fdc),</hi> while for Metapontum there was full coverage of Part 2 Class VIII (to N.512, 514, 516, 522), with no Leukippos
               or Part 3 Demeters. Guzzetta accepts the dating proposed in <persName>Noe- Johnston</persName> and suggests a burial date of 340/335.</p>

                  inadequate description by <persName>L. Sambon,</persName> who does not distinguish the Tarentine issues beyond the fact that they are horsemen
                  ("style de transition"). There were two staters of Metapontum: one "T. de Cérès et grain d'orge" (presumably N.443–4, with obverse but no
                  reverse symbol), and one "T. barbue et casquée," which could be either Leukippos or Tharragoras, probably the former and perhaps one of the
                  early issues more pro- <pb n="22"/> perly included in Part 2. The hoard presumably came from somewhere on the western side of Lucania in view
                  of the inclusion of coins of Velia and Campania.</p>

                  (to IVA-C, H and F, <hi rend="italic">fdc)</hi> and Heraclea (as Work 32), and they determine the position of the hoard in the sequence of
                  burials. The coins of Metapontum stop with Part 2 Class VIII, plus one Leukippos (A4.1), exactly like the earlier Lizzano hoard (<ref

                     <persName>Noe-Johnston</persName> p. 62). The first hoard to contain coins of the <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi> groups of Heraclea (Work 32ff.),

                  435 and 504). In addition, Selvaggi describes a nomos of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> as Evans VIA3; on any reckoning
                  this would mean that the coin was added 20 + years after the rest of the coins in the hoard were amassed, or else the piece may have been
                  unearthed elsewhere by the peasant who found the coins since the rest of the contents are remarkably consistent. All were said to be in a
                  "meraviglioso stato di conservazione."</p>

                  chronological spread of the issues in the hoard (see <persName>Noe-Johnston,</persName> p. 100), it is most fruitful to concentrate on what
                  can be deduced from those that are least worn: Metapontum A7.6 (<hi rend="italic">fdc),</hi> Velia Period V (as <hi rend="italic"
                     >SNGOxford</hi> 1182 <hi rend="italic">fdc),</hi> Heraclea (as Work 32) (extremely fine) and, most significantly, the two didrachms of
                     <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian ("fresh condition"). (The significance of the Thurian stater
                  with two fish in exergue in "very good condition" cannot be judged since the sequence of Thurian staters is not yet established. The latest
                  piece of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> that is known for certain to have been in the hoard, IIIO3, is described as
                  "very well preserved" by Vlasto; Vlasto 502, if in fact from the hoard, is classed "EF" by Ravel, and is more likely to be contemporary with
                  the Molossian didrachms.) The same type of Velia Period V had already occurred in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1925"><hi
                        rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1925</ref> with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> IVB, a pegasus of Leucas and Metapontum to
                  Part 2, Class VIII. Work 32, as we have just seen, occurred first in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1928"><hi rend="italic"
                        >IGCH</hi> 1928</ref> (again with Metapontum Class VIII, plus A4 and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> IVD), and
                  then with other <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi> group issues in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1940"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi>
                     1940</ref>. Thus, whatever the lacunae in our knowledge of the full contents of the "Molossian" hoard, the recorded issues appear to be
                  perfectly consistent with the other hoards buried in the 330s. The presence of didrachms of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                     >Alexander</persName> the Molossian, yet the absence of Metapontum Class B, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period V
                  or Velia Period VI (issues with explicitly Molossian types or symbols), suggests that <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1929"><hi

                  to the contents of the hoard, in spite of Kraay's efforts to disentangle them from <persName>Noe's</persName> notes and Vlasto's letter. A
                  card with photographs of casts and illustrations from sales catalogues survives in the ANS archives, presumably put together by Noe in
                  clarification of Vlasto's letter, which shows the four Metapontum types along with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>
                  pieces as Vlasto 537 (1 specimen), Evans VA5 and VB15 (2 specimens each, rather fine), VD1 (1 specimen, brilliant <hi rend="italic">fdc).</hi>
                  In addition, Vlasto lists in his note under <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> didrachms one "as Berlin Beschreibung
                  Tab.XII, 187" (i.e., as Vlasto 664) and a piece "as Evans Pl. V,6" – which is not a coin of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                     >Taras</placeName> but a gold fraction of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian with types of
                  Helios/fulmen; this is illustrated from <hi rend="italic">JIAN 2</hi> (1899), pl. IB', 13, so that there is no question of its being the
                  actual specimen from the hoard. Noe was puzzled by this, but does not appear to have questioned Vlasto, or the reply has not survived if he
                  did. In fact, the presence or absence of Molossian gold is not crucial to the interpretation of the hoard, though its inclusion would confirm
                  the post-Molossian burial date. The Metapontum coins are unambiguously identifiable as A1.6, A6.12 (both <hi rend="italic">fdc),</hi> A7.10ff.
                  and a distater, while the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> didrachms extend only part of the way into Period V, with <pb
                     n="23"/> only one example of the large group VB. Vlasto mentions that there were also staters of Heraclea, <persName>Thurium</persName> and
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_velia">Velia</placeName> that he was never shown, and the catalogue of his collection notes nos. 303, 451, 453
                  and 462 (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Periods II and III) are from the same hoard.</p>

                  hoard is mainly important for the Tarentine gold that it contained. The details are known from the catalogue of the Vlasto collection (from
                  which it appears that the hoard contained a full range of Evans Period V, apparently covering the whole of the large group, VB) and from a
                  letter from Vlasto to <persName>Noe</persName> which lists the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> gold types. Vlasto added,
                  "I have unfortunately no details of the important part of silver coins included in the Monteparano hoard. I have only the following note taken
                  in 1905 and given to me by a friend... There were many Tarentine didrachms of Period V, 1 tetradrachm, very good, of Metapontum; 1
                  tetradrachm, V.f. of Thurium of Type <persName>Jameson</persName> Pl. XVII, 362, not fine, but as I have not been able to trace the silver
                  coins <hi rend="italic">avec certitude</hi>, I cannot give you any further reference to this important find." Presumably there were many other
                  staters besides the distater of Metapontum, perhaps similar to those in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1960"><hi rend="italic"
                        >IGCH</hi> 1960</ref> and 1981, which contained an almost identical range of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>
                  Period VB.</p>

                  in the literature because it contained two Mars/horse's head <hi rend="bold">ROMANO</hi> didrachms, and its burial date has been shunted up
                  and down according to the view taken of the earliest Roman silver issues. The interest of the find, as <persName>Mitchell</persName> pointed
                  out, is that the Metapontine and the Tarentine coins were in each case of a single type (the plough issue; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                     >Taras</placeName> VB). In addition, some of the pieces were die- linked, which suggests that they were drawn all at once from issues
                  recently struck. One piece each of Metapontum and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> was lost before the hoard came into
                  the possession of the Museo <persName>Fr. Ribezzo</persName> in Brindisi, but given the coherence of the other coins, it is highly unlikely
                  that they diverged significantly in date from the rest and, thus, alter the burial date substantially (<hi rend="italic">pace</hi> Crawford,
                     <hi rend="italic">RRCH</hi> 12). In <persName>Mitchell's</persName> estimation the latest coin in the hoard was probably the stater of
                  Heraclea (as Work 62ff., i.e., post-Alexander).</p>

                  substantial pot-hoard of gold and silver, largely in good condition and covering a wide range of fourth- century issues. In addition to the
                  gold tetrobols of Metapontum recovered by the authorities, another 40 or 50 were dispersed, including at least four with facing Demeter "in
                  mint condition" and the Leukippos type with slanting barley ears reverse. According to a letter in the ANS, a further 100 or so nomoi of
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> were seen in the trade, all in brilliant condition and apparently all of Period VI.
                  The coins in Reggio were very thoroughly catalogued by Procopio, though he was unable to identify several pieces of Metapontum where the
                  symbols were off-flan; almost all the issues of Classes A-C were represented, including C8–10 and two examples of D1. There was also a
                  complete spread of full-weight issues of Heraclea, Thurium and Croton. The apparently reduced stater of Croton (Procopio no. 951, weighing
                  6.714g) was kindly checked for me by Dr. Maria Mastelloni, who confirms that the dies are as <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 356 (not 357), and
                  the low weight <pb n="25"/> arises from the poor alloy that seems to have been used for many of the fourth-century issues of Croton. One
                  Thurian stater weighs only 6.95g, but this is the result of its worn condition. See also the discussion of the hoard, pp. 43, 44.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Calabria Greca</hi> 3, pp. 354–62, and kindly communicated to me). The hoard was mainly composed of reduced-weight drachms
                  of Croton (as <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 421–22) and pegasi of Ravel Periods IV and V. Only a handful of other S. Italian mints were
                  represented: the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> pieces went down to Period VI (A, F), there was one stater each of
                  Velia and Thurium, and the four coins of Metapontum included two Leukippos types and one C7. There were rather more coins of eastern mints:
                  ten of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_athens">Athens,</placeName> 16 Alexanders and (most significantly for dating purposes) two of Demetrius
                  Poliorcetes, including one with the same obverse die as Newell LVII (Pella 294/3). The non-Crotoniate pieces of S. <placeName
                     corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> were clearly marginal in a find of more than 350 coins, but nevertheless the Metapontum and
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> pieces are roughly in line with the issues found in other hoards of the same
                  period.</p>

                  misplaced in his arrangement; the type would fit with the other "Nike" issues of late Period VI and VII and the <graphic url="NNM164_042.jpg"

                  important for the fractions that it contained, spread across a century and a half. The coins of Metapontum were a stater as A2 and two diobols
                  as <hi rend="italic">SNGOxford</hi> 798–801 with cornucopiae symbol (F21).</p>

                  <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1982"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1982</ref>, Taranto 1899. Another hoard composed of fractions. The
                  four staters of Metapontum ranged from Part 2 (probably N.523–24) to C1 and C11.2ff., plus three diobols (plough and "branch" = ?cornucopiae).
                  The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> pieces were five nomoi of Period VI (A1, C1, D2, E1), three drachms signed Sostratus
                  and 52 fractions (litrai, obols and hemiobols) of both full and reduced weight, some of which Gabrici connects with Period VIII. The fractions
                  of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> are not yet satisfactorily classified, however, and the hoard is not illustrated so
                  that the precise date of burial remains uncertain and might be in the first quarter of the third century.</p>

                  the plough issue, and the coins of Croton (to <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 355–56), Thurium, Velia and Neapolis also appear to stop well
                  before the last issues of those mints.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Although none of the evidence is sufficiently trustworthy to stand alone, the groups of hoards taken together provide a plausible basis for
                  discussion.</p>
               <p>The hoards of Group 1 contain none of the issues of Metapontum or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> traditionally
                  associated with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian, but the hoards do contain issues of the <hi
                     rend="bold">KAΛ/API/ONA</hi> group of Metapontum, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and Heraclea which appear to have
                  been struck just prior to, or in the early stages of, <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> campaign. This
                  impression is confirmed by the inclusion in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1929"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1929</ref> of
                  Molossian silver which is most likely to have been brought to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> by <persName
                     corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> men, if not struck locally. The contents of the hoards appear to have been
                  accumulated over a considerable time-span since there is a fairly random selection of issues for most mints, sometimes dating even as far back
                  as the incuse period or the late fifth century, and including coins of the long- defunct mints of Terina and Caulonia. In <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1929"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1929</ref>, in particular, there are long intervals between the
                  penultimate and latest issues of each mint. The find-spots, insofar as they are known, are widely scattered across Magna Graecia.</p>
               <p>The next group, 2, is much more consistent. In each of the four hoards the majority, if not all, of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                     >Taras</placeName> pieces belong to Evans Period V, and the spread of issues generally is much smaller.<ref target="#CH1-n49">
                     <hi rend="sup">49</hi>
                  </ref> Heraclea and Metapontum both go down to types which are apparently immediately post-Molossian (Heraclea: Work 62ff., Herakles standing
                  with the skin of the vanquished lion over his arm; Metapontum: the first hoards to contain the Leukippos-head staters and distaters usually
                  associated with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> [Class B], plus Demeter with plough symbol, C1). As mentioned
                  above in the descriptions of the hoards, not only is the range of issues quite limited, several of the latest pieces are die-linked,
                  suggesting that — unlike Group 1 — the contents were not long-term accumulations, but were drawn all at once from circulation and included
                  issues very recently struck. The consistency of the contents lends support to the view that the Mars/horse's head didrachms were struck in the
                  last quarter of the fourth century, perhaps even earlier than argued by <persName>Mitchell.</persName>

                  </ref> What might have prompted the Romans to strike didrachms at that time? (a) The alliance with <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                     >Alexander</persName> in the late 330s could have been the occasion. The Samnite War may then have diverted them, hence the long gap before
                  any subsequent issues were struck. In that case, the coin in Valesio could have been brought south by retreating troops after Alexander's
                  death, though it is curious that the hoards of Group 2 contain no other Campanian pieces. (b) The Roman take- <pb n="28"/>

                  </ref> is perhaps rather more likely, if <persName>Burnett</persName> is correct in his attribution, though it is still curious that the
                  ROMANO didrachms do not occur with other Campanian coins in the hoards from further south. The Benevento hoard, naturally enough, does include
                     both.<ref target="#CH1-n52">
                     <hi rend="sup">52</hi>
                  </ref> The hoards are more concentrated geographically too: all four come from Taranto and the fringes of Apulia. We can only guess that their
                  burial was occasioned by renewed barbarian attacks after <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> death.</p>
               <p>Groups 3-4 cover the hoards which close with the long span of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period VI. Brunetti<ref

                  </ref> has argued for a 25-year sequence of ephors in Period VI, but the chronology proposed here suggests a less regular emission of coinage
                  at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> in line with the bunching of issues that appears to have occurred at the same period
                  at Metapontum and Heraclea (and perhaps at Croton, Thurium and Velia also). The elements of Period VI and early VII have been arranged
                  according to the apparent sequence in which they occur in hoards (see Table 2), with consideration of the issues of other mints as well,
                  particularly where the information about the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> pieces is incomplete or where there is good
                  reason to believe that other coins are rather later in date than the latest <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras.</placeName> This order
                  may well be revealed to be spurious when there is more information about hoards, or about die-links between magistrates, but it is the best
                  that can be achieved at present.<ref target="#CH1-n54">
                     <hi rend="sup">54</hi>
                  </ref> In fact the order of magistrates that emerges does not differ radically from Brunetti's, which was largely derived by grouping together
                  similar type-varieties of horseman and dolphin-rider without any reference to hoards.</p>
               <p>The 12 hoards can be divided roughly into two groups:</p>
               <p>(a) The first nine hoards contain only the first half of the issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> VI and not all
                  the varieties of the <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi> group of Metapontum (C6–7 only, down to <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1967"><hi
                        rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1967</ref>) appear. From Heraclea there is nothing later than Work 85ff. (the <hi rend="bold">AϴA</hi> group).
                  Velia is patchily represented and does not go beyond Period VII; Neapolis occurs in only a couple of hoards which go down to Sambon 477, the
                  end of the right-facing heads, (b) The remainder of the full-weight issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> (the last
                  non-Pyrrhic Period VI) and Metapontum (the whole of the <hi rend="bold">ΛY</hi> group plus D1) are represented in <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1958"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1958</ref>. Two other hoards appear to be roughly contemporary to
                  judge from the coins of mints other than <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and Metapontum (whose coins made up too small a
                  proportion of the total to be significant). Burial can perhaps be dated to the very beginning of the Pyrrhic War.</p>
               <p>The remaining hoards, Group 5, must have been buried very shortly afterward, at some time during the Pyrrhic War, since they contain the final
                  issues of Metapontum, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> to the Pyrrhic types of the end of Period VI/early VII, plus
                  reduced staters of Heraclea and Croton in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1959"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1959</ref>. The reduced
                  standard had apparently not yet taken over completely, however, since the latest (fresh) staters of Thurium in <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1959"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1959</ref> and of Heraclea in <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1980"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1980</ref> were still of full weight. <ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1985"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1985</ref> probably dates from roughly the same period, though the
                  Metapontum and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> coins are clearly much earlier than the ultimate burial of the hoard.</p>
               <p>The majority of these hoards in Groups 3–5 were found within a rough triangle MetapontoBrindisi-Taranto (including the area just to the east
                  as far as Torre dell'Ovo); two from Bruttium (Grimaldi and Ospedale Nuovo) predictably contain few pieces of Metapontum; in <placeName>Oppido
                     Lucano,</placeName> from the mountains northwest of Metapontum, the Metapontum and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>
                  pieces are again marginal in a hoard dominated by Velia, Neapolis and Thurium. The three from the vicinity of Metapontum (<ref
                     target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1958"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1958</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1959"
                     >1959</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1980">1980</ref>) were presumably connected with attacks on the <hi rend="italic"
                     >chora,</hi> and were not recovered <pb n="31"/> afterward because the farms were destroyed or the owners died before it was safe to
                  return.</p>
               <p>All the hoards contain a long span of issues, often stretching back over the previous halfcentury or so. Most contain coins of a limited and
                  predictable range of S. Italian mints – Metapontum, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Heraclea, Thurium, Croton plus
                  Velia (usually represented by coins much earlier than the latest pieces in the hoard); the exceptions are for the most part hoards from places
                  further afield, with different patterns of circulation.</p>
               <p>The final hoards listed, Group 6, date from about 270 onward, after silver had ceased to be struck at Metapontum and so too late to provide
                  clues about chronology. It would be unwise to attach much significance to the isolated and often worn pieces of Metapontum that have been
                  reported in these hoards. Their presence may indicate that they were discarded rather than that they continued to circulate into the mid-third
                  century.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Overstrikes among the issues covered by the present volume have already been discussed briefly<ref target="#CH1-n55">
                  <hi rend="sup">55</hi>
               </ref> because the division between Parts 2 and 3 cuts across the period when overstrikes are most abundant and noticeable. Salvatore Garraffo's
               promised study of the phenomenon in Magna Graecia and Sicily appeared shortly after the publication of Noe-Johnston<ref target="#CH1-n56">
                  <hi rend="sup">56</hi>
               </ref> which makes it superfluous to provide a detailed listing here of all the known overstrikes, but at the same time invites a fuller
               discussion of all the material, especially the final phase from Part 2 Class VIII onward. As was clear from his earlier article, Garraffo<ref
                  target="#CH1-n57">
                  <hi rend="sup">57</hi>
               </ref> proposes a somewhat different chronology for the double relief issues of Metapontum, in line with his revised (lower) dating for
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> (see further below).</p>
            <p>The number of identifiable undertypes is extremely small for all the S. Italian mints in the fourth century, although a much larger number of
               pieces show traces of overstriking, usually apparently on pegasi. The identified overstrikes of Metapontum from the beginning of the coinage in
               double relief are set out in Table 4, alongside the contemporary overstrikes of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Croton and
               Velia. (The many overstrikes at Thurium have been omitted because the absence of any clear idea of the sequence of issues of that mint means that
               the overstrikes are much less informative in our present state of knowledge.) Insofar as the undertypes are legible, it appears that all the S.
               Italian mints were reusing the same flans to approximately the same degree at approximately the same periods. It seems that there was a sporadic
               incidence of overstriking throughout the first half of the fourth century (at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> in the late
               Oecist/Periods I, II and early III; at Metapontum in Part 2, Classes I-VII). For Metapontum the rate of overstriking appears on average to have
               been about the same as in the medium and dumpy incuse phases: roughly 25% of obverse dies were used to strike old flans. The increase in
               overstrikes in Part 2 Class VIII and the Leukippos issues of early Part 3 at Metapontum — to around 70 or 80% of obverse dies — is matched by a
               similarly high incidence at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> in Periods III/IV and at Croton during the issues with
               Eagle/tripod <hi rend="bold">KPO</hi> and letters.</p>
            <p>After that there are very few coins with traces of overstriking: A6.1 at the beginning of the <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi> group; A9.1–3 just before
               the large Leukippos issues of Class B, and perhaps a few examples much later.</p>
            <p>The legible undertypes provide useful <hi rend="italic">termini post</hi> for the upper types. The overstruck issues of Dyrrhachium and Leucas
               with caduceus and <hi rend="bold">Λ</hi> are generally agreed to be contemporary with late Corinth Period IV, while Corinth V is taken to begin
               at about the time of Timoleon's expedition to Sicily, which was the obvious moment for a major influx of pegasi into the West. The interval
               between the dates of the original pegasus issues and the reuse of the flans has been the subject of some debate, as already mentioned.<ref

               </ref> that if Kraay was right to suggest that the pegasi of the Corinthian colonies were struck specifically as contributions to Timoleon's

               afterward. Since his inclination is to shift the chronology downward as far as possible (see below), however, he places greater credence on
                  <persName>Jenkins's</persName> original allowance of ten years or more for their arrival and overstriking (a figure ultimately based on the
               occurrence of the pegasi in Sicilian hoards). I have already argued for a much swifter arrival and overstriking of pegasi in Magna Graecia: (i)
               there is no need for pegasi to have traveled to Sicily and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> returned (note that Timoleon spent some <pb n="34"/> time
               at Metapontum on his way to Sicily,<ref target="#CH1-n60">
                  <hi rend="sup">60</hi>
               </ref> and (ii) pegasi were not compatible with the local weight standard (unlike Sicily), and thus not part of the normal coinage in
               circulation, so that the pegasi were likely to be overstruck immediately upon arrival in S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy"
                  >Italy.</placeName>
            </p>
            <p>If the pegasi were available in quantity in Magna Graecia from c. 344 onward, the obvious occasions when the S. Italian cities needed to produce
               their own issues rapidly by reusing existing flans are the conflicts with the barbarians of the late 340s and 330s, for which <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> twice enlisted outside aid. It is perhaps not coincidental that many of the issues overstruck on
               pegasi at Metapontum have the obverse type of Leukippos (a type apparently with warlike connotations), while at <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> several of the issues with abundant overstrikes have allusions to war (<placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> armed, the horseman armed and/or accompanied by a Victory). The same signatures, even, occur on
               some of the upper types: <hi rend="bold">K</hi> on Metapontum and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>; <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi>
               on Metapontum (A6.2–5), Heraclea and Thurium (also with Nike).<ref target="#CH1-n61">
                  <hi rend="sup">61</hi>
               </ref> It is argued elsewhere that this conjunction of signatures may be indicative of a concerted defense effort.</p>
            <p>The overstrikes appear to end immediately before the large Leukippos issues (B2–3) at Metapontum and before the final groups of Period IV at
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> both some time after Corinth Period V with letter <hi rend="bold">N</hi>. Clearly the
               supply of pegasi did not end as abruptly, even if it was much reduced compared with the 340s and 330s; pegasi were sufficiently abundant to
               influence the types and even the weight standards at S. Italian mints in the last quarter of the century. Apparently the barbarians ceased to
               pose as great a threat to the Greek cities after 330, and the circumstances were not repeated in which the mints had been under pressure to
               produce large quantities of coinage by restriking pegasi. Reuse of existing coinage may well have continued during the last quarter of the fourth
               century, but the flans were either melted down or else greater care was taken to obliterate the traces of the previous types. The only subsequent
               piece with traces of overstriking would appear to be <placeName>Paris</placeName> 1196 (C11.11), clearly much later in the sequence. There does
               not appear to be any evidence of overstriking among the issues of Pyrrhic date, at Metapontum or elsewhere, although the conditions prevailing
               during the Pyrrhic War must have been similar to those in the 330s.</p>
            <p>The pattern of overstrikes thus fits into the historical context set out in Table 3.</p>

            <p>The chronology proposed by Garraffo diverges in varying degrees from the one suggested here, starting with the beginning of coinage in double
               relief. In the earlier phases, the overstrikes are not in fact particularly revealing as the undertypes can rarely be dated accurately; hoards
               therefore provide the main evidence for chronology. The fundamental source of disagreement is <persName>Garraffo's</persName> acceptance of
                  <persName>Stazio's</persName> late dating of the earliest staters of Heraclea,<ref target="#CH1-n62">
                  <hi rend="sup">62</hi>
               </ref> which leads him to reject both <persName>Kraay's</persName> date for the burial of the Oecist and Paestum hoards (the first to contain
               such staters), and <persName>Kraay's</persName> rearrangement of the early phases of the double-relief issues at Metapontum.
                  <persName>Kraay's</persName> argument was based in part on the contents of these hoards,<ref target="#CH1-n63">
                  <hi rend="sup">63</hi>
               </ref> and also on the important hoard of fractions, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1896"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1896</ref>,
               which proved that the Herakles types (N.428–31) belong among the earliest issues in double relief.</p>
            <p>His lower dating for the hoards, and therefore for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period I horsemen/late oecists and the
               early Classes of Metapontum Part 2, is then justified by Garraffo in terms of the "likely" rates of output, a procedure which he recognizes to be
               hazardous. For Metapontum, he is skeptical about <persName>Kraay's</persName> order and dating because they mean that the mint would have had to
               have used 38 obverse dies in 20 years for a coinage "che non ha affatto le caratteristiche di una coniazione di emergenza," while only about 50
               were used for the remainder of the period down to the end of <persName>Noe's</persName> sequence, i.e., from 410/405 to 330.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n63bis">
                  <hi rend="sup">63bis</hi>

                  <hi rend="sup">64</hi>
               </ref> it is impossible to allocate numbers of dies/ issues to specific time-intervals with any certainty, particularly since there may well have
               been periods without coinage. The use on average of two obverse dies per annum in any case hardly seems to denote an "emergency coinage," and the
               remainder of the coinage of Part 2 does indeed seem to have been extremely sparse up until the final phase of Class VIII (with 70 remaining
               obverse dies to be accounted for, rather than <persName>Garraffo's</persName> 50). Yet neither case is so exceptional as to invalidate
                  <persName>Kraay's</persName> analysis.</p>
            <p>For <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> too, <persName>Garraffo</persName> remarks that <persName>Kraay's</persName>
               chronology would mean that the remaining issues of Period II (after IIB1, E1 and G1 have been transferred into Period I) would have to be spread
               over 30 years, which he also finds "ben strano."<ref target="#CH1-n65">

               prima di essere impressi. E nostra impressione, infatti, anche sulla base della particolare composizione dei ripostigli italioti, che la
               penetrazione dei 'pegasi' in Italia meridionale in una certa misura ... debba essersi verificata alquanto più tardi che non in zona siceliota,
               piu direttamente esposta all'influsso corinzio attraverso la mediazione siracusana."<ref target="#CH1-n67">
                  <hi rend="sup">67</hi>
               </ref> He adds that the chronology may be even lower than his conservative estimate, and the end of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras</placeName> Period IV may be as late as 315/310. As a consequence, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> V and VI must
               then be telescoped to fit into the thirty years before Pyrrhus. The implications for the dating of the other S. Italian mints are not
               discussed.</p>
            <p>Within Evans Periods III and IV, <persName>Garraffo</persName> proposes a plausible arrangement similar to <persName>Brunetti's,</persName> based
               on types, die-links, overstrikes and occurrence in hoards (see Fig. 1).</p>
            <p>The difficulties arise only when absolute dates are attached to this arrangement. The whole of Group b (rather than the final part of it) is
               dated after 345 because of the overstrikes of III O and P on <persName>Leucas</persName> and <persName>Dyrrhachium,</persName> as well as the
               attribution of the large output with many overstrikes to the need to finance military expenditures in the years down to 335/330.</p>
            <p>The two parallel groups, c and d, are then tentatively dated between 335/330 and 320, presumably to allow at least a ten-year interval for the
               overstrikes on Corinth V. The explanation for the overstrikes in this period (offered in the conclusion) is that pegasi continued to arrive in
               payment for grain exports from S. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_italy">Italy</placeName> during the famine in Greece and were then overstruck in
               line with the traditional policy of excluding foreign coin. The rather abrupt disappearance of visible overstrikes with the final phase of Period
               IV (320–310) is not discussed. As long as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> is considered <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi>
               there is little to stand in the way of this chronology (apart from the difficulty of explaining the insistent use of the Epirote eagle on
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> VA in the last decade of the fourth century), but it does cause problems for the dates
               of the issues of other S. Italian issues related through hoards and overstrikes.</p>

               VIII (most of which are overstruck) and Heraclea to Work 31 (only in Altamura). These hoards therefore stop prior to the <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi>

                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian (Metapontum Class B, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>
               Period VA). The burial dates proposed in <persName>Noe- Johnston</persName> took account of this fact, and were also meant to accommodate the
               overstrikes in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> III/IV and Metapontum Class VIII, on the assumption that the pegasi started
               arriving in quantity with Timoleon and were almost immediately overstruck. <persName>Garraffo's</persName> chronology would mean that these
               hoards were buried more than a decade after <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> death and yet contained none of the
               large issues struck during his campaigns, even among the freshest pieces; it would have been almost the end of the century before such issues
               appeared in hoards. This lower chronology would also mean that the dating of Velia and Heraclea should be moved down, so that Velia V would start
               in the late 320s and the type of Herakles strangling the lion (taken by Work to be symbolic of the struggle between Greeks and barbarians) would
               continue at Heraclea until the end of the century instead of changing after the <persName>Molossian's</persName> expedition. At Metapontum,
                  <persName>Garraffo</persName> dates all the Leukippos types <hi rend="italic">after</hi> 330, in view of their occurrence in hoards with early
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> IV and of the overstrikes. In the case of all the mints, <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> campaigns would have had no noticeable effect on the output or types of the coinage,
               but instead production would have been rather more intense around the turn of the century, if the issues displaced downward are to be
               accommodated.</p>
            <p>These difficulties are obviated if the overstriking contemporary with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> III/IV is seen as
               largely concentrated in the 330s. The chronology then neatly fits the types, the overstrikes, the hoards and the historical context across the
               whole of Magna Graecia.</p>
            <p>Several comments are prompted by details of <persName>Garraffo's</persName> discussion. The Herakles type (A6.1) he says revives a type of the
               fifth century, "ma che e certamente da datare verso la fine del quarto," without further justification. As we have seen, the issue clearly
               belongs with the rest of the <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi> group prior to 330. At Heraclea only two overstrikes are noted: (i) Work 5 on an incuse
               stater (? of Metapontum), at least 50 years old at the time of overstriking, based on his own chronology for Heraclea; (ii) <hi rend="italic"
                  >SNGLloyd</hi> 272 = Work 32ff., on an unidentified pegasus, to which he gives a <hi rend="italic">terminus post</hi> of 370–360, whereas it
               too must belong with the rest of the <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi> group in the 330s.</p>
            <p>For the earlier period (down to the end of the incuse coinage at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum</placeName> and <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_croton">Croton</placeName>), <persName>Garraffo</persName> offers detailed chronologies and explanations of the
               circumstances in which the flans were imported into <placeName corresp="#nomisma_magna_graecia">S. Italy</placeName> and overstruck. He relates
               the influx of Sicilian coinage in the period 475–460 to the need to pay for troops and supplies during the Sicilian interventions in Magna
               Graecia under Gelon and Hieron I; the next phase (460–450) is to be explained in terms of movements of people (paid-off mercenaries and exiles)
               rather than commercial relations, which were not likely to have flourished during the political troubles between Sicily and <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_magna_graecia">S. Italy</placeName> in the fifth century; commerce may, however, be responsible for the last phase, down to
               440, as economic life recovered in Sicily. Throughout, <persName>Garraffo</persName> believes that the S. Italian cities acted in concert to
               overvalue their own coinages <hi rend="italic">vis-à-vis</hi> all others and hence all foreign coin was subject to rejection or overstriking. The
               adoption of the incuse fabric was part of this policy since it made "acceptable" coins immediately recognizable.</p>
            <p>There is much of interest in this analysis, but several points need to be made. First and foremost, it is obvious that an area like <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_magna_graecia">S. Italy</placeName> with negligible local sources of metal must have</p>

            <p>relied almost entirely on bullion from elsewhere to supply its requirements. There does not need to be a policy of over-valuation for cities to
               draw on existing coinage in order to supply their mints. Whether the flans are overstruck or melted down depends on purely technical factors
               (availability and suitability of flans, urgency of new coinage), and we cannot be sure that the recognizable undertypes of the overstrikes
               reflect accurately the full range of coinage available in Magna Graecia. <persName>Garraffo</persName> writes as if the overstruck coins were the
                  <hi rend="italic">only</hi> ones imported, whereas in fact they may have been the only flans remotely suitable for trimming and overstriking.
               Furthermore, <persName>Garraffo</persName> sees a sharp distinction between coins hoarded and overstruck, especially in the fourth century, from
               which he argues that the overstruck flans could not have been acceptable in circulation. Against this it should be noted that some hoards do
               contain non-Italian coins, often including those varieties that were also overstruck (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1874"><hi
                     rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1874</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1888">1888</ref>, <ref

                  target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1929">1929</ref>). In any case, there is a danger that the hoard evidence is unrepresentative of the
               coinage in circulation: (a) the contents of hoards are trivial in comparison with the volume of coinage from which they were drawn; (b) the
               selection of coins to be hoarded may well be strongly biased in favor of local pieces that can be expected to retain their value and to be
               acceptable immediately when the moment comes to use the money, since that was presumably the intention behind the hoard.</p>
            <p>Elaborate theories are not really necessary to explain the evidence of the overstrikes. Coins from outside Magna Graecia were likely to be reused
               by melting down or overstriking for the practical reasons that they were not as negotiable as local coinage, because struck on other weight
               standards, and they formed a useful supply of metal for local coinage. Pegasi, traditionally a major part of the foreign coin imported, happened
               to be reasonably suitable for overstriking. The major inflow was concentrated in the decade after Timoleon, which coincided with the period of
               greatest activity against the barbarians in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_magna_graecia">S. Italy.</placeName> The overstrikes were the result of
               increased pressure of defense needs and they ceased when the emergency ended.</p>

                  <persName>A. Stazio,</persName> "Contribute) allo studio delle prima fase della monetazione di Heraclea Lucaniae," <hi rend="italic">AI
                     IN</hi> 12–14 (1965–67), pp. 31–84 arrived at a date c. 390 for Work 1 by comparison with the coinage of Croton. The seated Herakles of the
                  reverse at Heraclea is supposed to have been copied from the identical type at Croton (<hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 378–79), datable from its
                  first occurrence in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1917"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1917</ref> immediately prior to the
                  Apollo/infant Herakles strangling snakes issue that was linked by Evans with the founding of the Italiote League c. 390. The facing head of
                  the Croton obverse is clearly based on the Kimonian model and closely resembles similar heads at <placeName>Hyria,</placeName> etc. which are
                  dated to c. 400–390 by <persName>N.K. Rutter</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Campanian Coinages 475–380 B.C.</hi>
                     [<placeName>Edinburgh,</placeName> 1979], p. 61). Since Stazio followed <persName>Pozzi's</persName> date for the burial of the Paestum
                  hoard at the end of the fourth century (i.e., based on the Campano-Tarentine coins that <persName>Kraay</persName> later rejected as
                  intrusive) and was unaware of the contents of the Oecist hoard, he found nothing in the hoard evidence that was incompatible with his date.
                     <persName>Kraay's</persName> dates for these hoards were, however, based on an appraisal of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the mints
                  represented and they cannot be rejected without pushing all the chronologies down by a quarter of a century. <persName>Stazio's</persName>
                  argument is too insecurely based to merit such a rearrangement. The original of the seated Herakles type appears to be one of two fifth-
                  century statues at Croton which the new city of Heraclea could have copied directly; it need not have been used first as a coin type by

            <p>Issues of gold tend to be exceptional in the coinages of Magna Graecia, and they are usually associated with abnormal military expenditures,

               organizing military relief expeditions from outside the area, struck a relatively large number of gold issues, both staters and a range of

               </ref> All three struck their gold on the Attic standard, although they used Italo- Achaean weights for their silver. For Metapotum there are
               five issues of gold fractions, which present some problems of chronology and metrology.<ref target="#CH1-n72">
                  <hi rend="sup">72</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The most straightforward issue has a female head r. on the obverse and occurs in two denominations, a third- and a sixth-stater (G1–2). All the
               evidence suggests that this was the first gold type, since it showed the most wear of the gold pieces in the <placeName>Bernalda</placeName>
               hoard (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1958"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1958</ref>). In addition, the obverse head is very similar in
               style to the Tarentine gold fractions (Vlasto 5–9,12) that were probably struck at the time of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii"
                  >Alexander</persName> the Molossian's expedition (note the fulmen symbol). There are no signatures to connect the gold with the silver, nor is
               the symbol repeated exactly on the silver (bird with wings <hi rend="italic">closed</hi> on the gold but bird with wings <hi rend="italic"
                  >open</hi> on the silver staters, B3). It does, however, seem reasonable to date the gold to the period of <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> activities when other exceptional issues were struck in silver (distaters, large
               issues of staters with Leukippos types; see p. 57). The obverse type may represent Hera instead of the more usual Demeter: she wears a stephane
               rather than the barley wreath which had become standard for Demeter, and the head is apparently directly modeled on the <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Hera type. There was, of course, a cult and temple of Hera at <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_metapontum">Metapontum,</placeName> too, but this is perhaps her only appearance on the city's coins.<ref target="#CH1-n73">
                  <hi rend="sup">73</hi>
               </ref> Imitation of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> did not, however, extend to the weight standard, which is Italo-Achaean
               — like the silver — and not Attic.</p>
            <p>The remaining gold issues, all tetrobols, are much less easily placed. The two issues with facing heads on the obverse (G3–4) are described
               together because of the similarity of their types, but they need not be contemporary with one another since they differ in the style of lettering
               and in the treatment of both the obverse heads and the reverse barley ears.<ref target="#CH1-n74">
                  <hi rend="sup">74</hi>
               </ref> The identity of the heads is uncertain: neither goddess wears a visible wreath or stephane, and <pb n="42"/> although G3 has the legend
               NIKA, this may have been an epithet of Demeter. (Compare N.450 and N.495, also labeled NIKA. The former wears an olive wreath appropriate to
               Nike, while the latter is indistinguishable from the contemporary Demeter heads.) For convenience, they will be referred to as "Nike" and "facing
               Demeter," respectively. The reverses have the standard single barley ear, the awns widely spaced and without barbs on G4, more compact on G3;
               there is a krater with two large handles as the symbol on G4 but no visible symbol on any of the specimens of G3. The weights again follow the
               silver standard (c. 2.6g). The quality of the engraving of the facing-head types, especially the Demeter, is extremely good, which makes it
               unlikely that they date from the final phases of the coinage when standards of engraving had deteriorated. The treatment of the hair and eyes in
               particular is much more accomplished than C3. It is much more accomplished, too, than the other attempts at facing heads at Metapontum, or the
               later fourth-century types at Croton, Velia and Heraclea.<ref target="#CH1-n75">
                  <hi rend="sup">75</hi>
               </ref> The facing-Demeter type has been known since the discovery of the <placeName>Bernalda</placeName> hoard in the 1930s, whereas the Nike was
               unknown until the early 1960s.</p>
            <p>Finally, there are two issues with Leukippos as the obverse type, so identified in the legend. The heads are quite unlike the Leukippos distaters
               and staters attributed to the period of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian: the helmet is now crested,
               and the bowl is decorated with the Skylla hurling a rock. Leukippos does wear a crested helmet on the late silver staters, D4.4–6, but there the
               helmet has a plain bowl encircled by a wreath and it is worn tipped back, so that the vizor is almost horizontal; the treatment of the face and
               beard, too, is quite different from the gold. On the reverse, both Leukippos tetrobols have two barley ears side by side; on G5 the ears are
               parallel (or almost), very neatly cut, whereas on G6 the stalks are close together and the ears fan out. The type fills the whole field, making
               it difficult to place the ethnic legibly. G5 has M/E on either side of the field above the leaves in the manner of some of the bronze types (<hi
                  rend="italic">BMC</hi> 175, 177 [barleycorn] or McClean 1004–6 [Nike]); on G6 the ethnic META is placed above the barley ears in a part of the
               field that is not normally visible on the silver staters since the edge of the flan usually coincides with the tips of the awns (exceptions can
               be found among the late silver issues, e.g., <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 508, 514). The two issues are similar in essentials (obverse type,
               double barley ear reverse), but there are variations in the placement of the barley ears and of the signature (on the reverse of G5, on the
               obverse of G6), and the use of symbols (none on G5, ant and locust above the leaves on G6). The same is true of the weights: for both, the
               weights are higher than the Italo-Achaean tetrobols. But while G5 conforms to the Attic standard (c. 2.85g), examples of G6 weigh between 3.24
               and 3.32g, weights which do not readily fit any system (assuming that gold/silver ratios remained constant, see further below). The double barley
               ear was presumably intended to signal the use of a different weight standard (the same device was later used as a denomination marker for the
               Hannibalic silver and the bronze, e.g., <hi rend="italic">SNGOxford</hi> 807, <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 599ff.). It is then curious that the
               two issues were not distinguished more explicitly from one another in view of the fact that the weights differ substantially.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n76">
                  <hi rend="sup">76</hi>
               </ref> Examples of both were reportedly found in the <placeName>Bernalda</placeName> hoard with the other Hera head tetrobols, so that they
               presumably circulated together.<ref target="#CH1-n77">
                  <hi rend="sup">77</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The stylistic affinities of both Leukippos issues are with the end of the silver coinage rather than with the issues for <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander.</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n78">
                  <hi rend="sup">78</hi>
               </ref> In addition to the style of the head on the obverse, note that the signature <hi rend="bold">ΣI</hi> occurs only on G5 and on the
               "reduced" drachms with owl on <pb n="43"/> olive-spray (F1); furthermore, the engraving of the reverses is similar, especially the rather fussily
               curled tip of the leaf. G6 has the knobbly barley grains and the unevenly drilled lettering of, e.g., C8 and C10; there is no exact parallel on
               the silver for the ant and locust symbols, though there is an issue with ant and cornucopiae (D4.8–14) and several with two reverse symbols.</p>
            <p>Logic would suggest that the facing-head issues followed after the Hera head because they are all struck on the same weight standard and the
               format of the reverses is the same (single barley ear and ethnic in the longer form <hi rend="bold">METAΓON</hi>, which is not found on the
               silver after A6.2–5). The Leukippos issues stand apart in using different weight standards and the double barley ear reverse type; there is
               clearly no stylistic or other connection with the early group of Leukippos silver, so that it would be tempting to place these issues much later
               in the coinage. This arrangement is to some extent confirmed by the evidence of the <placeName>Bernalda</placeName> hoard, the source of many of
               the known specimens of the gold. As already mentioned, the Hera head tetrobols in the hoard were more worn than the Leukippos pieces, but
               unfortunately the condition of the others is less revealing. The British Museum possesses casts of three specimens each of the Leukippos and
               facing-Demeter types from the hoard, and it is clear that there is little to choose between them as regards wear: both appear extremely fresh
               (compare, too, <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 396–98 and Gulbenkian 71–72, also from the hoard). Facing heads obviously show wear very quickly,
               but there is no sign at all of rubbing on the nose and hair of the Lockett specimen from <placeName>Bernalda</placeName> (compare the rubbed nose
               of the BM-Lloyd Nike). Similarly, the beard and details of the Leukippos heads are equally sharp. The gold pieces were presumably kept in some
               kind of separate purse, not mingled with the very large quantity of silver in the pot, so that they would have been somewhat protected from
               further damage after deposit; it appears that both the Leukippos and the facing-Demeter types were added almost immediately after they were
               struck. There is nothing, however, to indicate which was added first nor whether their burial was separated by a long or short interval.</p>
            <p>The known specimens of the Nike head probably came from a single hoard found about 1960, but unfortunately the other contents, if any, are not
               recorded. All show some wear, which suggests that the issue was in circulation for a while before burial. We shall have to await other
               well-documented hoard evidence to ascertain their relationship to the other gold and to establish the sequence of issues more objectively. For
               the moment let us suppose the order to be: Hera-Nike-facing Demeter- Leukippos (<hi rend="bold">ΣI</hi>)-Leukippos (ant).</p>
            <p>When and why did the mint switch from one weight standard to another (if not, indeed, to a third)? There are two possible reasons:</p>
            <p>(i) For the first gold issue the city, with no tradition of striking in gold, chose to adopt the same standard as for the silver, and this
               standard was maintained for the facing-head issues (perhaps the gold was intended primarily for payments locally and the recipients were
               accustomed to the standard). By the time of the Leukippos issue it had become clear that it would be more practical to follow the Attic standard,
               which had become widely known as a result of the large issues of Philip II of Macedon and which had been used all along by <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> for its gold issues as well as by <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName>
               the Molossian for all his coinage in gold and silver struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_magna_graecia">S. Italy.</placeName> If the gold was
               intended as payment for mercenaries, it would obviously be more acceptable if struck on a generally recognized standard. This does not explain,
               however, the heavier Leukippos issue, which fits neither standard; the only explanation, somewhat implausible though it may be, is that it might
               be equivalent to a half-stater on the reduced standard.</p>
            <p>(ii) The variations in weights may be the result of changes in the gold/silver ratio following upon the arrival of the huge Macedonian gold
               coinages in Italy. The mint may have been trying throughout to maintain the rough equivalence: 1 gold tetrobol = 4 silver staters. The first
               issues, before the gold of Philip II had made much impression in the West, were struck on the local standard with the gold/silver ratio at 12:1
               [2.6g Ꜹ = 31.2g <graphic url="NNM164_058.jpg"/>, i.e., 4 staters]. The lighter Leukippos issue, struck later when the gold of <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_philip_ii">Philip</persName> and of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander the Great</persName> had been
               absorbed into circulation, <pb n="44"/> was also equivalent to 4 staters, but at a ratio of 11:1 [2.85g Ꜹ = 31.35g <graphic url="NNM164_058.jpg"
               />]; conveniently, this also passed as an Attic tetrobol. The heavier Leukippos issue, perhaps later still, was struck when the ratio had fallen
               to 10:1 [3.25g Ꜹ = 32.5g <graphic url="NNM164_058.jpg"/>]<hi rend="italic">.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The changes in weight are hard to understand given that <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> maintained the same standard
               throughout for its more abundant gold issues, without any fluctuations in weight. Why did Metapontum not simply imitate <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> especially in view of the fact that they were probably striking gold on the same occasions ?<ref
                  target="#CH1-n79">
                  <hi rend="sup">79</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>This leads to the further problem of assigning more specific dates to the issues. The first, with Hera head, seems to date to the 330s during the
               Molossian expedition, as argued above. The Nike head, too, may well belong to the second phase of the campaign, following <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> first successes for which the type would be appropriate, though this is mere
                  conjecture.<ref target="#CH1-n80">
                  <hi rend="sup">80</hi>
               </ref> (The Leukippos gold issues, which have often been attributed to this period, are as we have seen quite unlike the Leukippos staters and
               distaters and therefore appear to belong later in the sequence.) There is no trace in the literary or archaeological record of specific campaigns
               against the barbarians in the decades immediately after <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander,</persName> although problems
               clearly continued at least for a while. The Kleonymos episode could have been the occasion for payments in gold for the defense of the city
               (?facing Demeter/first Leukippos issue), and there may have been skirmishes with the barbarians which required extraordinary expenditures at any
               time between the end of the fourth century and the successes of Pyrrhus (?Leukippos type[s]).</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi> for all the gold would appear to be the early stages of the Pyrrhic War. All the varieties had been
               issued before the burial of the <placeName>Bernalda</placeName> hoard, which in all probability dates from the beginning of the War as the silver
               contents range down to the issues immediately prior to Pyrrhus: the first of the "late" Demeters of Metapontum (Class D), most of the issues of
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period VI, Heraclea to Work 85ff. (i.e., before the final full-weight staters), Thurium
               to the last issues of full- weight staters. As noted above, the literary and epigraphic evidence implies that all of the support for Pyrrhus at
               the outset came from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> and that the other cities became involved only after the battle of
               Heraclea; the dominant role of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> is certainly borne out by the city's large issues of gold
               with Pyrrhic references. The contribution of Metapontum, if the Leukippos gold does belong to the War, was minimal. Evidence suggests that a
               mercenary's basic pay in cash was approximately 20 silver staters per month in the third century, with bonuses equivalent to 1–2 months' pay
               (i.e., 5 gold tetrobols), so that one tetrobol die-pair might have produced roughly a month's pay or a small bonus payment for 1000 men.<ref
                  target="#CH1-n81">
                  <hi rend="sup">81</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>The Leukippos varieties cannot be attributed with certainty to the Pyrrhic War, though a good case could be made. As already mentioned, the only
               association between the Attic- weight tetrobols and the silver is with the "reduced standard" drachms: both denominations were unusual at
               Metapontum but common at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> the drachms apparently from Period VI onward, even before the
               reduction in the standard for the nomos (cp. similar drachms at Croton with owl on barley wreath, <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 422). There are
               other possible connections with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> too. The signature <hi rend="bold">ΣI</hi>, found on the
               gold and the drachms but otherwise unknown at Metapontum, occurs on nomoi of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Periods VI
               (C-D) and VII (C); the Skylla hurling a rock, also unique at Metapontum, decorates the helmet of <ref
                  target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> on the Tarentine reduced weight drachms. Further- <pb n="45"/> more, there are
               issues of diobols/triobols at Metapontum (p. 48) which also copy Tarentine types and which have been interpreted as an alliance issue of some
               kind. All three issues may have been part of a concerted effort against the barbarians some time in the first quarter of the third century. The
               heavier Leukippos issue has no strong connection with any other issues of Metapontum or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and
               can not be placed with any assurance, although the lower gold:silver ratio may indicate that it is the last gold struck.</p>
            <p>The problems raised here can be resolved only when there is more information, in particular further specimens of G6 to provide better data on the
               possible weight standard and more hoards to help clarify the chronology.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">Fractional Coinage</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Silver fractions had been a feature of the coinage of Metapontum from the very outset. Although fractions were not provided with every issue of
               staters, the relative abundance and variety of smaller denominations indicates that fractions were considered an essential part of the mint's
               output. This long tradition appears to have come to an end fairly abruptly with the Apollo Karneios triobols of Part 2 Class III, after which
               there was probably an interval of more than half a century without any fractional silver. It seems unlikely to have been simply coincidental that
               bronze issues started to be struck at about the same time. Indeed, it would appear that the city henceforward opted for bronze as the most
               practical and flexible means of providing very small change, and only rarely thereafter struck silver fractions. (It is, of course, much simpler
               to produce small denominations in bronze than in silver, and bronze has the further advantage of being fiduciary and not necessarily very
               strictly regulated.) This practice is in sharp contrast with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> whose fractional silver
               coinage is copious and the bronze minimal.</p>
            <p>A preliminary study of the bronze has been attempted elsewhere;<ref target="#CH1-n82">
                  <hi rend="sup">82</hi>
               </ref> the arrangement is perforce highly conjectural, since there are relatively few connections with the silver and even fewer objective clues
               to absolute dating. The sequence and chronology can only be given a more secure base when the results of the archaeological work in the territory
               of the city are available, so that the bronze coins can be placed in the context of the pottery and other finds. Suffice it to say here that
               bronze coinage appears to have started at the very end of the fifth century (?unit and half: <hi rend="italic">SNGCop</hi> 1250, 1270), and
               continued throughout the fourth century and into the third. As on the silver, the barley ear serves as distinguishing reverse type for the city
               (or barley grains on some of the smaller denominations), and the obverse is almost always the head of a deity.</p>
            <p>The most widely known bronze types are those marked with the denomination "obol" (<hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 552–54), struck, to judge from
               the variety of flans and styles, over a number of years around the middle of the fourth century. Two smaller denominations (?half and quarter,
               distinguished by barley ear and barley grain reverse types, respectively) were also struck in the course of the first half of the fourth century;
               the dating is based largely on the similarity with the staters of Part 2 in the style of the barley ears on the reverses (and also, where
               appropriate, the Demeter heads). The obverse types are very varied: Apollo, <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>,
               Leukippos, Pan, Zeus Ammon, as well as the predictable Demeter and several unidentified heads of bearded males. In the last part of the century
               an even smaller denomination was introduced (barley ear reverse, less than 1.5g). Issues attributable to this period are not very numerous,
               perhaps because the needs for small change were adequately met by the earlier bronze coinage. Besides, some of the silver fractions belong to the
               last decades of the century and, while they clearly represented much larger denominations than the bronze, they may have been to some extent an
               alternative.</p>
            <p>The nature of the bronze coinage changes significantly in the next phase, which may well belong to the period after the last silver staters were
               struck. Instead of being produced singly, as usual hitherto, the majority of issues comprise three or four denominations (identifiable by their
               reverse types of barley ear/three barley grains/two sizes of barley ear with distinctive obverse types); each such issue has some unifying factor
               (common symbols or signatures, or else thematic connections, such as reverse symbol related to obverse type). No precise dates can be attached,
               though some of the types and symbols may be interpreted as Pyrrhic; the hoard evidence is unsatisfactory in this regard, and indicates nothing
               more definite than the third century (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch2008"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2008</ref>, <ref
                  target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch2039">2039</ref>, <pb n="48"/>
               <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1940">2040</ref>). The remainder of the bronze coinage dates from later still in the third century and
               need not concern us here since it clearly postdates the silver issues.</p>
            <p>The silver fractions are very sparse in comparison with the bronze. There is a single drachm issue, which will be discussed further below, and
               several issues of smaller fractions weighing in the region of 1g. The relationship between the fractions and the staters (or between the various
               issues of fractions) is far from clear-cut. In one instance only, F2, the fractions are obviously related to the staters, C1, with the identical
               obverse type (Demeter) and reverse symbol (plough), though with different signatures <hi rend="bold">(Γ</hi> on the fractions, <hi rend="bold"
                  >MAX</hi> on the staters). Like the stater issue, F2 is a relatively large issue (four obverse, eight reverse dies). For the rest, another
               approach is necessary since the other fractions do not correspond exactly to any stater types.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Thurium and Heraclea used exclusively <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122"
                  >Athena</ref> types for the obverses of their triobol/diobol size fractions in the fourth century. Metapontum also struck <ref
                  target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> types in four variants: crested Attic helmet decorated with hippocamp or Skylla,
               and plain Corinthian helmet with or without long neck-flap. The first two may well have been struck in imitation of — perhaps to be
               interchangeable with — the fractions of the neighboring cities, some of which are almost identical in style. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras</placeName> also struck some fractions on the reduced standard on which <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122"
                  >Athena</ref> wears a Corinthian helmet without flap, not unlike some variants of F2.</p>
            <p>The other two obverse types, Zeus Ammon and Apollo Karneios, are peculiar to Metapontum. Both were clearly part of the heraldic vocabulary of the
               city since they are also used as types for the bronze; Apollo Karneios had, of course, already appeared on the early doublerelief staters and
               fractions (N.334 ff., N.363 ff.).</p>
            <p>The reverse types with two exceptions follow the pattern of the staters: barley ear, usually with symbol (and occasionally with signature as
               well). The two exceptions are the scenes of Herakles struggling with a lion, either kneeling (F11, 15) or standing (F14). These, too, were
               standard types for the fractions of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and Heraclea, and the Metapontine versions have been
               interpreted as being part of some kind of "federal" issue of the three cities. The reverse symbols (plough, tripod, owl and locust, club,
               cornucopiae) are drawn from the same repertoire as those on the staters and cannot necessarily be matched with them.</p>
            <p>Each of the three obverse types occurs with several symbols, and it is an interesting feature that some are die-linked through obverses and/or
               reverses to form composite, and presumably roughly contemporary, issues. The links can be seen most readily in the diagram (fig. 3).</p>
            <p>Only a few of the dies are linked, but others may be identified as more examples come to light. Various interpretations of this pattern of issues
               are possible. The different obverse types might distinguish different workshops/officinae and the symbols different responsible officials, or
               batches of metal, or items of expenditure. On the other hand, the numbers of dies involved are so minute that such complexity seems improbable
               and there is perhaps no need for overly elaborate explanations. It does nevertheless seem likely that the symbols are not directly connected with
               the same symbols on the staters. Despite the spread of weights, these <figure xml:id="fig-3">
                  <graphic url="NNM164_062.jpg"/>
                  <p>Fig. 3.</p>
               </figure>
               <pb n="49"/> fractions probably represent a single denomination.</p>
            <p>Several other issues of fractions are known, in some cases with the same symbols as the die- linked issues above. There is, in fact, an <ref
                  target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> issue with owl and locust (F4) which could be added to (ii) above, although there
               is no visible signature on the reverse (as there is on the Karneios and Ammon versions). This issue bears some resemblance to the staters of C3
               in that both have <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> on the obverse (though the fractions have Attic helmet with
               hippo- camp, not plain Corinthian helmet) and the owl and locust symbol on the reverse — perhaps the badge of a prominent family, as Noe
                  suggested,<ref target="#CH1-n83">
                  <hi rend="sup">83</hi>
               </ref> and hence likely to occur more than once. The Apollo Karneios fractions with the same symbol (F7) have a similar or perhaps better claim
               to be connected with the staters, in that the obverse shares the same signature, <hi rend="bold">ΣA.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another apparently repeated symbol is the plough, which occurs with obverse <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> in
               Attic helmet decorated with Skylla or hippo- camp as well as with Demeter. The existence of the exact parallel between F2 and the stater types
               suggests that neither the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref> fractions nor the die-linked fractions with plough
               symbol (see (i) above) belong with C1. One cannot therefore argue that <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>-Skylla/
               club, F3, must belong with the Leukippos staters (B2) simply on account of the club symbol, though it is possible. (Note that the club appears
               frequently on the fractions of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and Heraclea as an adjunct of Herakles or as a symbol, and
               was also a symbol on the drachms of the Lucani [p. 18 above].)</p>
            <p>For the same reasons, the <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>/cornuco- piae issues (F21–22) may or may not belong
               with the late staters, D4.8ff. If the symbol is assumed to have Pyrrhic significance, the fractions could have been struck at any point in the
               city's involvement in the war. The issue runs to at least seven obverse dies in varying styles. Identical fractions, apart from the ethnic, were
               struck by the Apulian city of Rubi (<hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 716–19), perhaps at the same time.</p>
            <p>In view of these doubtful connections between fractions and staters, it is impossible to establish a chronology on the basis of common types and
               symbols. The hoard evidence is not as useful as it might be, partly because of inadequate publication, partly because the <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> fractions are not always clearly attributable between the later Evans periods. Torchia- rolo (<ref
                  target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1977"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1977</ref>) was clearly accumulated over a long time-span since it
               contained incuse and early double-relief staters with, for the most part, contemporary fractions. Among the latest pieces are a stater of
               Metapontum with star symbol (C8) and three of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period VII; all 1400+ <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> fractions were reckoned to be full weight, pre-Period VII. The two Metapontum fractions relevant to
               Part 3 were Demeter/ plough types, presumably struck well before the burial of the hoard. The Timmari hoard included two <ref
                  target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>/cornucopiae fractions with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>
               to Period VIII, obviously a mid- to late third century burial. Taranto 1899 (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1982"><hi rend="italic"
                     >IGCH</hi> 1982</ref>) included three Demeter/plough and <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>/"branch"
               (presumably a cornucopiae) with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> staters to Period VI, drachms to Period VII and fractions,
               including reduced. All in all, the hoards to date offer little insight into chronology.</p>
            <p>The resemblances between the fractions of Metapontum and those of Heraclea and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> in
               particular provide the best indication of relative chronology, and suggest that most belong to the period between the latter part of the fourth
               century and the Pyrrhic War. (F24, Demeter/owl, could belong with the half-shekels of the Hannibalic period: the Demeter and Tanit heads are very
               similar, and both have an owl symbol.) The drachms (F1), too, clearly echo the drachms of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>
               and Croton with similar owl types (Vlasto 1102–3; <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 421–22), dated by Evans to his Periods VI and VII in spite of the
               low weight, because some of the signatures occur on staters of Period VI.</p>
            <p>The denominations are not easy to distinguish because the pieces are small, and are often poorly preserved (or perhaps carelessly struck) so that
               margins of error in the weight may be large. The vast majority of the fractions weigh in the region of 1g and appear to have been intended to be
               interchangeable with the fourth century diobols of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> which also weigh about 1g, although in
               both cases the <pb n="50"/> weights often lie rather below the theoretical weight: diobols at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras</placeName> and triobols at Meta- pontum should have weighed about 1.3g with the nomos/stater weighing 7.8g. The Demeter/ plough
               fractions are closest to this standard (0.9–1.3g). The other fractions rarely surpass 1g and many are much lighter (0.65–0.9g); it is possible
               that the change in obverse type for the related <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q37122">Athena</ref>-Zeus-Apollo fractions may have
               indicated a change in denomination, and that these smaller fractions are in fact diobols (theoretical weight 0.86g). The drachms, too, appear to
               have been designed to match a Tarentine denomination: the "reduced" drachms. Like them, the Metapontine drachms were equivalent to half-staters
               rather than the traditional Achaean third-stater. On this weight system diobols could again weigh 1g, so that some of the fractions might be
               associated with the "reduced" drachms, metrologically at least. Even the Hannibalic standard could accommodate an eighth-shekel of about 0.9–1g
               (? F 24).</p>
            <p>The relative abundance of fractional issues — in silver but particularly in bronze — indicates, as Stazio has already pointed out,<ref

            </head>
            <p>Almost every coin of Metapontum from roughly 400 BC onward carries at least one symbol or signature and frequently has both. It should be
               remembered that these marks — which often assume disproportionate importance for the numismatist because they may provide the only way of
               grouping issues and identifying relationships between them — were usually added to dies by the mint for purely administrative purposes (so that
               there was some means of matching up the bullion consumed and the coinage struck, or of tracing a batch of coins and the person(s) responsible if
               the metal was found to be defective or if some other problem arose). Neither symbols nor signatures had any great significance after the coins
               left the mint. Symbols in particular must often have been chosen at random, so that there is now a real danger of overexplanation. Nevertheless,
               since they were sometimes picked from the repertoire of particular personal emblems that we can identify or else that made an allusion to a known
               event (such as the Pyrrhic symbols at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName>), it is worth examining them more closely and
               considering possible interpretations, in case they may provide useful information.</p>
            <p>Symbols were used at Metapontum (as elsewhere) long before signatures, first during the period of the incuse coinage (Part 1 Class V), and
               intermittently thereafter on the reverse dies of the staters. In Part 2, obverse symbols almost always serve to identify the head of the deity
               (Demeter/Persephone with torch [N.322, 421], with barley ear [N.391ff.], with barley grain [N.439ff.], with poppy-head [N.406ff.]; the exception
               is N.331, where the symbols are unexplained). This tradition continues in Part 3 (Zeus with fulmen [A6.2ff.]; Demeter with torch [A5, A6.12],
               with barley ears [A7.10ff.]; perhaps Leukippos with parazonium [A6.10]). It cannot, however, explain the retention of the torch when the obverse
               type switched to Leukippos on A5 or the obverse symbols on the other Leukippos issues (barley grain, A3; grapes, A4; lion protome or head, B1–2;
               dog, B3); the Leukippos issues do tend to have more "control marks" than other issues, a point that will be discussed further below. Obverse
               symbols do not occur at all in Class C, and are revived only at the end of Class D, where one Demeter obverse die carries a wreath symbol in
               place of a signature (D5.1), subsequently recut as a billhook (D5.2). Almost every <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> die of Part 3 appears to have
               been marked by a symbol, the only exceptions are those of A5, B4 (both with letters only), and some dies of A4 (symbol possibly off-flan) and
               A6.3ff. (where one die has both symbol and letters and the other two only the signature).</p>
            <p>In a few cases the reverse symbol may have been suggested by the obverse type (Apollo/ snake [Python?], A6.6; Tharragoras the war- rior/trophy,
               A7.13ff.; Demeter/pig, D4.18; Hera- kles/cantharus, D4.1ff.); there is a group of third-century bronze coins where this seems to be the obvious
               explanation for the selection of reverse symbols.<ref target="#CH1-n85">
                  <hi rend="sup">85</hi>
               </ref> Many of the symbols recur throughout the coinage (most notably the grasshopper), which might mean that these were the badges of prominent
               families, or that they were obvious decorative adjuncts to a barley ear (especially locust, mouse, ant, fly), or simply common everyday objects
               (plough, hayfork, tongs, the different ceramic containers); yet others are standard symbols widely used on Greek coinage (caduceus, griffin,
               grapes, tripod, bucranium). A handful of more unusual symbols are found at both Metapontum and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras</placeName> at approximately the same period and their conjunction may be significant (comic mask: A9.1 and <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> V, Vlasto 660; cock: D2.1–4 and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> VIG;
               identical form of krater on a high base: D3.3ff. and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> VIIL1, <pb n="52"/> compare the symbol
               on the obverse of bronze of Pyrrhus, Lévêque [above, n. 2], pl. 7 no. 11; two amphorae: D4.15ff. and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras</placeName> VIIC7).<ref target="#CH1-n86">
                  <hi rend="sup">86</hi>
               </ref>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, a few symbols are traditionally connected with foreigners who intervened in Magna Graecia: fulmen and eagle with <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian; triskeles with Agathokles; fulmen, star, cornucopiae, owl, amphora,
               bucranium, spear-head with Pyrrhus. Many of these emblems occur on their coinages in their own names and hence it has been tempting to connect S.
               Italian coins marked by the same symbols with their activities in the area. The associations are by no means certain, however: <persName>Andrew
                  Burnett</persName>
               <ref target="#CH1-n87">
                  <hi rend="sup">87</hi>
               </ref> has cautioned against the close link between the triskeles and Agathokles, as argued by Seltman,<ref target="#CH1-n88">
                  <hi rend="sup">88</hi>
               </ref> because the symbol appears at a number of S. Italian mints which had no direct connection with Agathokles and yet does not appear on the
               coinage of Croton, which was captured by him. At best its use may have been influenced by the example of Agathokles, but the chronological
               connection is weak. Nevertheless, <persName>Burnett's</persName> warning could drive us too far to the other extreme. It should be pointed out
               that the coinage of Croton is very patchy throughout the fourth and into the third centuries, and — since none of the issues can be securely
               dated to the period of Agathokles — the absence there of the triskeles may not be significant. While it is true that Agathokles is not known to
               have gone beyond Croton in the 290s, the possibility that the triskeles on D4.4ff. at Metapontum refers to him cannot be entirely excluded. As to
               the Epirote symbols, the fulmen of B4 seems plausibly to belong to the period of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander;</persName>
               the star (C8), amphora (D3.10), and cornucopiae (D4.8ff.) also occur on coins of Pyrrhus<ref target="#CH1-n89">
                  <hi rend="sup">89</hi>
               </ref> and on some S. Italian coinage associated with the Pyrrhic War (e.g., Croton: cornucopiae, <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 412–13; Heraclea:
               bucranium, <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 87–88). In addition, the dog on B3 is apparently a Molossian hound.<ref target="#CH1-n90">
                  <hi rend="sup">90</hi>
               </ref> The bird on the reverse of B3 does not look sufficiently aquiline to be taken for an Epirote eagle (compare N.408, showing a similar
               bird), and nor does the bird with wings closed on the reverse of the Hera-head gold: the manner of presentation is unlike the eagles of the
               Epirote coinage proper or of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period VA which Evans associated with <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander.</persName>
            </p>
            <p>What significance the symbols had as control marks cannot be guessed, and most probably changed in the course of time in any case. Clearly at the
               outset symbols were not essential since many of the issues of Part 2 lack them altogether. They could have been intended initially to distinguish
               reverse dies (and therefore batches of coins within an issue or issues) since the symbol almost invariably changes from die to die (the exception
               with the same symbol but differently placed: N.397–8).<ref target="#CH1-n91">
                  <hi rend="sup">91</hi>
               </ref> When letters are introduced they might be expected to replace symbols — which to some extent they seem to do in the parallel symbol/letter
               issues of Class VIII.<ref target="#CH1-n92">
                  <hi rend="sup">92</hi>
               </ref> There symbols and letters do not correspond exactly in that the letters are repeated on several reverse dies, whereas the symbols continue
               to change from die to die in the first part of Class VIII. Letters and symbols do not occur together on a die, i.e., clearly standing for
               different things, until Part 3 (A3, A6, etc., but not A5); the combination then becomes standard for all the remaining silver staters apart from
               a couple of issues almost at the end of the coinage (D1–2, D5.3–4: symbol, no signature). The gold, as we shall see, has <hi rend="italic"
                  >either</hi> symbol <hi rend="italic">or</hi> letters, while the silver fractions and bronze have symbols and only very infrequently letters
               as well.</p>
            <p>Another development at the beginning of Part 3 is that reverse symbols come to mark whole issues, the same symbols (often accompa- <pb n="53"/>
               nied by letters) being repeated on several reverse dies. Since the same letters may be repeated with several different symbols, the reverse
               symbol presumably now marks some subsidiary (more frequent) change such as the issue within the administrative period or the agent below the
               responsible official. Changes of symbol per signature become more frequent in Class D, perhaps indicating a batch within an issue or even an
               officina within the mint. Similar changes take place at other mints, e.g. Corinth switched from symbols only to lettered series with changing
               symbols between Ravel Periods IV and V.</p>
            <p>Letters on dies have a variety of possible explanations. Single letters on Greek coins sometimes stand for figures (A= 1, B = 2, etc.), so that
               sequences of numbered dies or issues can be reconstructed, as at Poseidonia or Thurium; this system seems never to have been adopted by
               Metapontum. Engravers occasionally signed their work with either abbreviated or full names, usually unobtrusively among the details of the
                  type.<ref target="#CH1-n93">
                  <hi rend="sup">93</hi>
               </ref> This was once a very popular explanation of large numbers of signatures, especially if the same letters recurred at several mints, since
               the work of peripatetic engravers is well documented, whereas magistrates with jurisdiction broader than the city were regarded as unlikely.
               Evans, for instance, assigned to two engravers all the dies signed <hi rend="bold">K/KAΛ</hi> and <hi rend="bold">A/API</hi> at <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Hera- clea, Thurium and Metapontum; <hi rend="bold">A/API</hi> was argued to be identical with
                  Aristoxenos.<ref target="#CH1-n94">
                  <hi rend="sup">94</hi>
               </ref> This hypothesis was neatly proved to be wrong by the discovery of a die signed <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi> recut to read <hi rend="bold"
                  >API</hi> (A6.7–8). In addition, it would be difficult to find any stylistic unity between the pieces with the same signatures. It is
               extremely unlikely that any of the signatures of Part 3 are those of engravers (apart, perhaps, from <hi rend="bold">ΔΩPI,</hi> the signature on
               the obverse of C5.1).</p>
            <p>Most of the letters must refer to individuals in some way "responsible" for the coinage, which may mean a contractor involved in the physical
               production of the coins; or a magistrate (of the city or of a league of cities) who authorized or oversaw the issue, or whose name was used as a
               convenient device to date the issue.<ref target="#CH1-n95">

               Archipolis or Archippus. At Metapontum the names are always abbreviated, usually to only two or three letters, and are never given in full as at
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> (Period VI onward) or Heraclea, so that although certain signatures recur (especially

            <p>Alternatively, letters (and symbols, too) could designate things rather than people: workshops or officinae, sources of funds, or objects of
               expenditure. At this remove we can only speculate.</p>
            <p>The earliest signatures at Metapontum— <pb n="54"/> apart from that of the engraver Aristoxenos— appear on the obverse (Part 2 Class VII), where
               they usually occur on a single die only. Signatures on the reverse start with Part 2 Class VIII (where the series of lettered reverses runs
               parallel to the symbol reverses) and they are then repeated on several dies to form groups of up to five die-pairs. With the start of Part 3
               reverse signatures become habitual from A5 onward, while most obverse dies are also signed (exceptions: B4 and D1, obverse only; D2 and G1–2,
               5–6, apparently unsigned). Since there are invariably reverse symbols, and sometimes obverse symbols as well, it is difficult to understand what
               all the control marks must have represented. The most thoroughly marked dies are those used for the Leukippos distaters and staters which have
               both symbols <hi rend="italic">and</hi> signatures on both obverse and reverse; this perhaps reflects the involvement of military as well as
               civilian personnel. Yet the gold, which might be expected to require the closest supervision, has fewer issue marks than most of the contemporary
               silver: there is either a symbol or a signature to mark each issue.</p>
            <p>The pattern of issues (i.e., groups of dies with common symbols and signatures) varies considerably. The <hi rend="bold">KAΛ/API/ONA</hi> group
               is unusual in that there are several different obverse types as well as symbols and combinations of signatures within the group. Otherwise for
               each issue the standard practice seems to have been to produce several reverse dies with the same symbol and signature (caduceus + <hi
                  rend="bold">ΛY;</hi> tripod + <hi rend="bold">ΓPO;</hi> mouse + <hi rend="bold">ΦI</hi>). The issues gradually increase in size up to 35 and
               28 die-pairs respectively for the main Leukippos issues (B2–3), reach their peak with almost 70 die-pairs for the plough issue, and then diminish
               again to smaller issues comprising 10–20 die-pairs; in the final Class (D), several changes of symbol accompany each signature, as at the
               outset.</p>
            <p>To some extent these changes in mint practice can be paralleled elsewhere. Heraclea had overall a much smaller total output and a smaller
               repertoire of symbols and signatures, but there are similar shifts from changing sym- bols/signatures (Work 24–56) to a large group all signed
                  <hi rend="bold">AΘA,</hi> and eventually to frequent changes of symbol and signature on the final stater issues (full-weight and reduced). At
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> abbreviated signatures gradually become regular in the course of Periods II and III, on
               obverse or reverse or both; in Period IV there are sometimes multiple obverse signatures in the <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi> group (perhaps local
               officials signing alongside federal authorities?); with Period V the same signatures (especially <hi rend="bold">ΣA</hi> and <hi rend="bold"
                  >Φl)</hi> recur on large numbers of dies, exactly as <hi rend="bold">AΘA</hi> at Heraclea and <hi rend="bold">ΔAI/MAX</hi> at Metapon- tum.
               Full-length names occur on the dies of Period VI with some repetition — Brunetti has arranged them in a 22-year sequence of annually-changing
                  ephors<ref target="#CH1-n99">
                  <hi rend="sup">99</hi>
               </ref>—and of Period VII. Throughout, the horseman and the dolphin-rider are presented in constantly changing ways, the latter in particular is
               caused to hold a great variety of objects that must often have done duty as symbols. In addition, symbols are occasionally added in the field
               (many of Period V, rather fewer in Periods VI and VII), which perhaps fulfil the same role as the "extra" control marks at Metapontum in certain
               issues. Up until Period VI at Velia, too, there are often several control marks per die, and then in Period VII all reverse dies are signed <hi
                  rend="bold">Φl</hi> with a single but changing symbol. Recutting of dies so as to cancel letters is common (e.g., <hi rend="italic">SNG
                  Oxford</hi> 1188, 1195, 1224, etc.; compare A6.8 and D3.5, D5.2). Croton, on the other hand, managed without any signatures and with a very
               small repertoire of symbols in the fourth century.</p>
            <p>The general impression given by the symbols and signatures on the coinage of Metapontum is that the mint was closely supervised and administered,
               with a rather bureaucratic concern for keeping track that may have been true of other aspects of public life now lost to us. The careful
               surveying and layout of the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> also suggests an orderliness of approach to practical matters from an early date. There
               are interesting implications for city administration if the common initials on dies of Metapontum and of neighboring cities do in fact indicate
               the organization of coinage at a "federal" level, but the evidence at present is too flimsy, apart perhaps from the <hi rend="bold">KAΛ</hi>
               group of issues.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Little can be said of fabric in general since there are often greater variations between specimens of a single issue than between issues. At the
               end of Part 2 and the beginning of Part 3 the obverses tend to be struck in high relief and the reverses are often markedly concave where the
               metal has been pushed down into the obverse die. The large number of overstrikes in Class A mean that many of the flans are irregular in shape.
               Dies throughout Part 3 are about 20 mm in diameter, whereas flans are often as little as 17 mm and sometimes as much as 22 mm. The flans of the
               facing-head issue (C2) and the ant/cornucopiae issue (D4.11ff.) stand out as uniformly small and dumpy, while the tongs issue (C4) is mostly
               struck on larger flans, and the obverses tend to be in high relief.</p>
            <p>There is little variation in weights of well- preserved specimens: the average hovers around 7.7–7.8g, with a few overstruck pieces noticeably
               higher or lower. Even in the final phase of the stater coinage the weights remain high (7.8g or more), although at other S. Italian mints there
               is some evidence of weights tending to drift down even before the reduction in the standard. Weights below 7.5g at Metapontum very often indicate
               a plated coin, or a poor alloy.</p>
            <p>After the incuse period the dies were not fixed; there is no consistency even among coins struck from the same pair of dies. Consequently,
               die-axes have not been noted in the Catalogue.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">Chronological Implications</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A picture of the chronology emerges gradually from the evidence presented above, starting with Part 2 Class VIII (Table 5). The parallel series
               and the close die-linkage of Class VIII suggest relatively high levels of production, and this is further confirmed by the above-normal incidence
               of visible overstrikes toward the end of the Class. The first Leukip- pos types (a type appropriate to warlike activities) were probably struck
               toward the end of Class VIII or at the very beginning of Part 3. These factors taken together are consonant with measures being taken to defend
               the city against the barbarians. Similar trends can be seen in the coinage of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> in late
               Period III- early Period IV (possibly several officinae, much die-linkage, overstrikes, warlike types and symbols). The <placeName
                  corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> issues are also overstruck on pegasi of the same groups and they are found in the same hoards as
               the Metapon- tum coins (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1923"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1923</ref>, <ref
                  target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1925">1925</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1926">1926</ref>, <ref
                  target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1928">1928</ref>). A <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> for these issues is provided by the
               overstruck pegasi of Leucas and Dyrrha- chium which probably started arriving in the West in quantity after 344, hence the coins could belong to
               the period of Archidamus' unsuccessful campaign in the late 340s and early 330s.</p>
            <p>The same features continue sporadically in the early phase of Part 3: overstrikes, much die- linkage within issues (and also obverse dies allowed
               to deteriorate without repair), choice of Leukippos and other types suitable to accompany efforts to defend a Greek city against barbarian attack
               (Herakles, Zeus Eleutherios, Tharragoras). One group of issues is connected by the recurrence of the three signatures <hi rend="bold"
                  >KAA/API/ONA</hi> in various combinations, and these same signatures are found at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Hera-
               clea and Thurium; it is possible that they were coordinatingofficials coordinating defense efforts at a federal level. The hoards and the
               overstrikes indicate that these issues of Metapontum are contemporary with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> Period IV and
               perhaps early V (see <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1928"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1928</ref>, <ref
                  target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1929">1929</ref>, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1940">1940</ref> and overstrikes on Corinth
               Period V with letters <hi rend="bold">E</hi> and <hi rend="bold">N).</hi> The obvious association is with the military build-up and the early
               stages of the campaign itself, when <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian still appeared to act for the
               Greek cities rather than for himself.<ref target="#CH1-n100">
                  <hi rend="sup">100</hi>
               </ref> According to Holloway and Giannelli, it was only with the later campaigns that he began to assert himself as an empire- builder, and it
               may have been only then that specifically Molossian symbols were introduced on the coinage.</p>
            <p>At Metapontum the staters and associated distaters with Leukippos heads and the common signatures <hi rend="bold">AΓH</hi> and/or <hi rend="bold"
                  >AMI</hi> of Class B undoubtedly belong to this latter phase of <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> campaign
               when Metapontum and <placeName>Tarentum</placeName> were left as his remaining allies. The issues are far larger than hitherto, indicating a
               changed rhythm of production: 17 and 11 obverse dies for B2 and B3 respectively, as against 2 or 3 maximum for most of the preceding issues.
               Class B is equivalent in size to the whole of Class A and the actual output of the dies was probably higher because production was continuous and
               dies were used until they were broken and replaced. The symbols of the dog (a Molossian hound ?) on B3 and fulmen on B4 have Epirote rather than
               local associations; the lion (protome/head) of B1 and B2 is also exceptional. Furthermore, distaters were never otherwise struck at Metapontum,
               though they were a standard denomination at Thurium. Some of the gold fractions (with Hera and Nike heads) may well date to the same period or
               slightly earlier. At <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> the eagle symbol of <pb n="58"/> VA was linked with <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> by Evans, and there are also gold issues which resemble the types of <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander's</persName> own coinage. At both mints the visible overstrikes have ceased by this point, and none
               can be recognized among the coins of this or later periods. The supply of pegasi from Corinth and colonies may have tailed off as pegasi were
               produced in Sicily, or the mints may no longer have resorted to the laborious adjustment and reuse of flans for reasons of technical expediency.
               Hoard evidence for this period is not revealing, since none of the hoards so far known stops with the issues of this group.</p>
            <p>After the major Leukippos issues the coinage has few remarkable features. Almost all the subsequent issues have Demeter as the obverse type, with
               symbols and signatures that appear to have only local significance. The issues vary in size from 25 to 2 obverse dies per signature/ symbol.
               Hoard evidence indicates that these issues (Class C) are contemporary with later <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> V/early
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> VI and the <hi rend="bold">AΘA</hi> group at Heraclea, which are similarly uneventful
               phases of coinage at those mints.</p>
            <p>The last phase of the silver coinage is characterized by many small issues within two main groups, the symbols changing with almost every reverse
               die while the same signatures (<hi rend="bold">ΔI/ΘI</hi>) recur throughout. The traditional Demeter heads, now sometimes of rather poor style,
               are accompanied by a revival — after an interval of perhaps half a century — of the Leukippos and Herakles types. A similar pattern can be
               observed in the latest issues of full- weight staters at Heraclea.<ref target="#CH1-n101">
                  <hi rend="sup">101</hi>
               </ref> These final full- weight issues of Metapontum, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and Heraclea occur together in two
               hoards from Meta- ponto (<ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1959"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1959</ref>, <ref
                  target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1980">1980</ref>), confirming that the coinage of the city ended at roughly the same time as the
               transition to the reduced standard elsewhere, rather than at the time of the disastrous intervention of Kleonymos about 300, as was once thought.
               The reduction appears to have occurred after the arrival of Pyrrhus, since there are full-weight issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras</placeName> and Heraclea with Epirote symbols and with allusions to Nike. The tiny issues with changing symbols at Metapontum could
               have arisen out of the need to strike frequent, relatively small issues to meet expenditures as the campaign developed. (The Leukippos gold, as
               well as some of the bronze, may belong to this period, too.) Pyrrhus was still in Italy at the time of the reduction because the early
               reduced-weight issues of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Thurium, Heraclea and Croton all include references to Pyrrhus'
               elephants and to victory. <persName>Frances Van Keuren</persName> has suggested<ref target="#CH1-n102">
                  <hi rend="sup">102</hi>
               </ref> that the reduction was forced upon Pyrrhus soon after his campaign began, as a result of shortage of cash to pay his forces after the
               battle of Heraclea in 280. A more plausible time, in view of the number of full-weight issues with Nike references, may be after the battle of
               Ausculum the following summer, by which time the funds contributed in the first flush of enthusiasm for the campaign would have been exhausted
               and payment of mercenaries could not have been postponed (as it could after Heraclea, when it was clear that the fighting was not yet over). In
               any case, by the time of the reduction the silver coinage of Metapontum had come to an end. The early withdrawal from the campaign may have been
               the result of impoverishment, perhaps in the wake of the attacks on the <hi rend="italic">chora</hi> that are being revealed by excavation, or of
               a willingness to make peace for purely political reasons, or perhaps a mixture of the two.</p>

               <hi rend="bold">Metapontum and its Coinage in Retrospect</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The silver coinage of Metapontum lasted for roughly two and a half centuries, a period that saw very great changes in the life of the city. At
               the beginning of the incuse coinage in the late sixth century the Greek settlement was well established and was perhaps in its most powerful and
               aggressive phase, marked most notably by the destruction of Siris and Sybaris and the dedications in the great sanctuaries of mainland Greece.
               Metapontum was one of the first <hi rend="italic">poleis</hi> of Magna Graecia to strike coinage, in particular well before her later rival
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> — which suggests a willingness to innovate, as does also the production of fractional
               coinage virtually from the outset. The choice of the barley ear type is interesting: the other cities all selected types related to their
               principal cults or foundation myths, whereas Metapontum alone chose instead to be represented by her major product, since it must be recalled
               that Apollo Lykeios was the main deity in the early period.<ref target="#CH1-n103">
                  <hi rend="sup">103</hi>
               </ref> We can only speculate as to the reasons for this difference. Was the culturally mixed population more able to identify with the barley ear
               emblem than with any single cult or myth, or was the city's prosperity more narrowly based in agriculture than that of other cities that had more
               diverse resources (minerals, industry, harbor facilities) ? Whatever the reason, the barley ear badge endured throughout the coinage, and only
               very exceptional issues of bronze did not use it as major obverse or reverse type.</p>
            <p>The fifth century seems to have been a time of consolidation, strongly marked by the influence of Pythagoreanism. The most remarkable features of
               the coinage are first the retention of the incuse fabric long after it had been abandoned by all the other cities, except Croton — a conservatism
               frequently attributed to some connection with Pythagoreanism — then the variety of obverse types once double relief had eventually been adopted,
               again in contrast to other S. <orgName type="ethnic">Italian</orgName> cities where types changed rarely. Toward the end of the century the early
               introduction of bronze indicates a readiness to experiment, apparently successfully, in view of the large numbers of subsequent bronze
               issues.</p>
            <p>The life of the city seems to have been dominated by agriculture, and presumably the trade related thereto, down to the middle of the fourth
               century. This is reflected on the coinage by the preponderance of Demeter types, with the occasional Hygeia variant perhaps elicited by concerns
               with flooding and disease. The rhythm of production was slower than in the incuse phase, probably including intervals without coinage; there is
               no evidence of any sudden spurts of output until the end of this period.</p>
            <p>From the mid-fifth century the general impression is of a city largely minding its own business, joining in Greek cooperative efforts when
               necessary (such as the Italiote League), but not initiating action and leaving the role of leader to the Tarentines. If Thucydides' account is
                  correct,<ref target="#CH1-n104">
                  <hi rend="sup">104</hi>
               </ref> the Metapontines' involvement in the Sicilian expedition may have been typical of their general attitude: the Athenians called in at
               Metapontum and persuaded the city to supply 300 men and two triremes, but clearly nothing was volunteered. Nonetheless, the extent of the <hi
                  rend="italic">chora</hi> made the city's economic base particularly vulnerable as the barbarian attacks increased in the middle of the fourth
               century, and Metapontum was obliged to participate fully in the attempts to drive the Lucani and the other tribes back into the interior.</p>
            <p>These new demands on the city are probably the reason for the apparent stepping-up of mint output, the hasty overstriking of pegasi and the <pb
                  n="62"/> sudden appearance of the founding warrior- hero, Leukippos, on the coinage. Metapontum's behavior during the expedition of <persName
                  corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander</persName> the Molossian is revealing. Whatever reservations the authorities may have had about
                  <persName corresp="#nomisma_alexander_iii">Alexander,</persName> they maintained their commitment through to the end. The episode may have
               convinced them that it was better to try to deal with the Lucanian problem in their own way, probably through negotiation, rather than rely on
               the whims of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras</placeName> and the uncertain success of imported condottieri—hence the reluctance to get
               involved with Kleonymos and its disastrous aftermath. There seems to have been a real contrast with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras"
                  >Taras,</placeName> always ready to embark on an adventure; Metapontum seems to have been much more cautious. By the time of Pyrrhus there was
               perhaps little choice, if the city's resources had indeed been eroded by payment of the enormous tribute to Kleonymos and by the attacks on the
                  <hi rend="italic">chora.</hi> The coinage that can plausibly be associated with the Pyrrhic War seems not to have been on anything like the
               scale of the issues struck at the time of the Molossian expedition, even if the city could still muster the wherewithal for a couple of small
               gold issues.</p>
            <p>The silver coinage ended in very different circumstances to the wealth and power of the sixth century, when the first incuse staters were struck.
               On the whole, it is not a coinage to arouse passions: there are few question-marks beyond the routine ones of chronology, and the artistic level
               only occasionally rises above the average (or, for that matter, falls below it). Reasonable standards of production were maintained throughout,
               and the importance of the fractions in silver and then in bronze is perhaps the most distinctive feature. Nevertheless, the coinage is
               significant as an element in our knowledge of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_magna_graecia">S. Italy</placeName> before <orgName type="ethnic"
                  >Roman</orgName> domination. After all, the most flamboyant and intrusive political units that dominate the written historical record — such
               as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_taras">Taras,</placeName> Syracuse or <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName> — are not the most
               typical, and must be seen in context. It is to be hoped that this study of the coinage of Metapontum will help to create a more balanced
               perspective of the period down to Pyrrhus than the highly Tarantocentric view that has tended to prevail ever since Evans' impressive work on the
               horsemen provided a framework for analysis. Ideally all the coinages of Magna Graecia need to be treated in depth, and coordinated with each
               other and with the findings of the archaeologists; this is at least a step in that direction.</p>

                  </ref> followed Vlasto in distinguishing between ancient forgeries, "barbaric imitations" of very poor style, and "trial strikes" of more
                  plausible appearance, occasionally apparently die-linked to the "official" series. The latter coins frequently showed signs of plating,
                  whereas the barbaric imitations were often of debased silver; in both cases the weights were much below the norm for the series (usually under
                     7g).<ref target="#CH1-n106">
                     <hi rend="sup">106</hi>
                  </ref> For Part 2, Noe included some of the plated pieces and copies alongside the regular coins; he specifically mentions N.333–34, 338, 394
                  and 438 as plated;<ref target="#CH1-n107">
                     <hi rend="sup">107</hi>
                  </ref> note also the "barbaric imitations" N.343–44, 399, 417, 432, 457 and 523, while others were relegated to the final plates headed
                  "Plated Coins" (N.530–47). A number of other possibly questionable pieces were included in the main catalogue without comment, although their
                  weights are low and the quality of engraving inferior (e.g., N.339–42, 388–89).</p>
               <p>Among these plated issues there are a couple of instances of hybrids, where the obverse is copied from one issue and the reverse from another
                  (N.540, 542); in one case an obverse of Metapontum is also known with a reverse of Croton (N.541 and <hi rend="italic">Jameson</hi> 42/<hi
                     rend="italic">SNGANS Bruttium</hi> 349); in another, an inappropriate ethnic has been added (N.531–32: <hi rend="italic">Taerinon).</hi>
                  Otherwise most of these irregular pieces are obvious copies of a particular issue, imitating more or less successfully the details of the head
                  on the obverse and the placing of the legend and (where appropriate) the symbol on the reverse. By no means every issue is copied, especially
                  where there are many varieties of reverse symbol as in Classes VII and VIII, but almost every obverse type is to be found among the doubtful
                  pieces. Suspicions are aroused first by the style (generally cruder than the originals), then by the low weights and sometimes by
                  irregularities in the flans (the inner core is sometimes revealed where the surface silver has burst — as nos. 12, 16 below — or where the
                  edge has been tested with a file or knife). Many are known from only a single specimen and can be dismissed without much heart-searching as
                  ancient or modern forgeries.</p>
               <p>The pieces that cause the longest hesitation are those that appear to be die-linked, whether to "official" pieces or to each other.<ref
                     target="#CH1-n108">
                     <hi rend="sup">108</hi>
                  </ref> Noe suggests in the catalogue that the reverse of the full-weight piece N.335 is struck from the same die as the plated coins N.333–34,
                  but in the text he says that it is "almost identical" — which is a very different matter.<ref target="#CH1-n109">
                     <hi rend="sup">109</hi>
                  </ref> On the other hand, at least one of the examples of N.336, <hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 287, is of very low weight and is described as
                  "plated?" although it appears to have been struck from the same dies as the full-weight examples. This Apollo Karneios issue is the most
                  puzzling of Part 2 since only one obverse die out of eight is unquestionably genuine — it is struck with three reverses, N.335–37, the
                  majority of specimens weighing at least 7.8g — but even so there are doubtful coins like the ANS piece among them. Of the others, four
                  die-pairs are linked together in sequence (N.338–41), one of the specimens certainly plated and the rest of low weight; another three that
                  share an obverse die (N.343–44, <pb n="90"/> plus <hi rend="italic">SNGFitzwilliam</hi> 479) produced coins that are not obviously plated
                  though they are of crude workmanship and somewhat low weight (7.45–7.64g); yet another is the die-pair mentioned above, N.334, which shares a
                  reverse die with N.333, all specimens apparently plated. Two other pieces, of poor style and low weight, are not linked to any of the others
                  (N.342, <hi rend="italic">SNGCop</hi> 1188).</p>
               <p>How are we to explain such a preponderance of substandard pieces? Some of the flans are irregularly shaped and may be of low weight because
                  they have been adjusted and overstruck, though there are no visible undertypes. The rather poor engraving may be the handiwork of an
                  inexperienced die-cutter rather than a forger (the quality is hardly outstanding even on N.335–37). Is the series to be considered as
                  "official" but produced at a time when supervision of the mint was lax and standards low (perhaps allowing some "unofficial" use of dies)? Or
                  should all except the high-weight specimens of N.335–37 be dismissed as forgeries (which might incidentally explain why there are so few
                  specimens of the type in hoards and none in <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch1900"><hi rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 1900</ref>) ?<ref
                     target="#CH1-n110">
                     <hi rend="sup">110</hi>
                  </ref>
               </p>
               <p>Several other suspect pieces in Part 2 are die- linked together, though not to the same extent as the Apollo Karneios issue: N.388 = 389
                  (obverse); N.544 = 545 (obverse); N.546 = 547 (obverse); N.539 = 540 (obverse) = 541 (reverse) = <name type="pname">
                     <hi rend="italic">Jameson</hi>
                  </name> 428 (obverse, with reverse of Croton). Almost all of these are known in only a single specimen and are presumably forgeries.</p>
               <p>For Part 3 there is a similar pattern of plated pieces/copies, with at least one dubious die-pair for most issues and a few hybrids (no. 2:
                  mule of two Leukippos issues, the obverse as A5 and the reverse as A3; no. 6: mule of a Tharragoras obverse with a Part 2 reverse; no. 34:
                  mule of types of a late Demeter [as D2.8ff.] and a plough reverse [as C1]). There are often several examples extant per die-pair (e.g., nos.
                  4–5, 20–21), which indicates that many of the pieces were in fact struck. The one example which appears to reproduce two genuine dies (no. 18)
                  may have been cast from a genuine coin.</p>
               <p>Plated pieces are relatively most common among the types of the small later issues with symbols griffin, Artemis-Hekate, altar and especially
                  Nike. Like the Apollo Karneios issue of Part 2, there are more suspect than genuine examples of the Nike issue: only C9.1–3 (all die- linked)
                  are full-weight and not plated, while nos. 27–30 are plated. One of the obverse dies involved appears with a variety of reverse symbols: the
                  Demeter head is an extremely close copy of C8.10, and it turns up with tongs (no. 21), star (no. 25), satyr (no. 32), as well as Nike (no.
                  29). The same satyr reverse occurs with a different obverse die (no. 33), in turn muled with a plough reverse appropriate to C1 (no. 34). The
                  style throughout is fairly plausible, though the weights are much too low. After some hesitation another satyr piece has been retained in the
                  main catalogue although the weight of the only known specimen is on the low side and the Demeter head faces left instead of right, apparently
                  copying the obverse of the spindle issue. On the other hand, the reverse is apparently die-linked to D2.6; if rejected, this leaves only
                  D2.6–8 as indubitably genuine die-pairs of the satyr issue. The spindle issue obverse is again copied on no. 31, despite the lack of visible
                  symbol. It is interesting that small, relatively rare issues were so often copied, and that this spate of plated coins ceases abruptly with
                  the spindle and satyr issues (no copies appear to be known of the many varieties of the final group of staters of Class D). If the suspect
                  coins are modern, this would suggest that they were produced before the hoards containing many examples of these types appeared on the market
                  in the 1930s.</p>
               <p>Suspect specimens also exist of gold types and fractions. Despite Giesecke's vigorous defense, no. 37 is an obvious forgery of particularly
                  grotesque style and impossible weight. As noted, G6 itself may not be genuine, though the style is infinitely more plausible and the weight is
                  the most disturbing feature. Similarly, some of the fractions retained in the catalogue should perhaps be rejected, but it is difficult to
                  judge for certain when the surviving specimens are in poor condition.</p>

               <p>Allusion has already been made to the divergence of scholarly opinion as to the status of plated pieces, which are relatively common among the
                  issues of <name type="pname">Magna Graecia.</name>

                  </ref> Numismatists earlier in this century sought refuge in the notion of "trial strikes," which would account for the fact that there is
                  often associated with an issue one die-pair of passable style used to strike low-weight/plated pieces. The logic of the argument is hard to
                  follow, since a test carried out with substandard dies on substandard flans would not be very helpful to the personnel of the mint—why not use
                  proper dies and flans and melt down the unsuccessful trial pieces ? Even if the mint did go to the trouble of preparing special plated flans
                  for such purposes, why should they have been kept and why should they have survived? It seems much more likely that some kind of deliberate
                  deception was being practiced, whether by the mint or by private counterfeiters of varying degrees of skill.<ref target="#CH1-n112">
                     <hi rend="sup">112</hi>
                  </ref> The motives of the latter group are obvious enough. As to the mint, it is possible to conceive of circumstances in which a token
                  coinage of sorts might have been issued, with a promise to redeem the substandard pieces when funds were available, though one would then
                  expect the entire issue to be plated or debased and marked unambiguously to that effect. Other explanations are less honorable: <name

                  </ref> postulated that the very common plated issues of Velia might have been struck to pass off on the less sophisticated tribesmen of the
                  interior —and anyone else who was foolish enough to accept them. There is no solid evidence of the barbarians of S. <name type="place"
                     >Italy</name> producing imitations in the manner of the <name type="place">Sicels</name> in <name type="place">Sicily,</name> whose coins
                  circulated alongside regular issues (see the contents of the Agrigento hoard, <ref target="http://coinhoards.org/id/igch2086"><hi
                        rend="italic">IGCH</hi> 2086</ref>, almost entirely composed of imitations of types of Syracuse, Leontinoi and <name type="place"
                     >Gela</name> mixed with genuine specimens); the Brettii and Lucani could easily have done likewise.</p>
               <p>Counterfeiting was extremely common in the ancient world to judge from the widespread attempts to deter the practice and punish offenders.
                  Plated pieces quite often show marks of having been tested on the edge (see no. 6), suggesting that they had not passed undetected. Examples
                  of plated pieces are known from every S. Italian mint, covering issues throughout the fifth and fourth centuries, but they are especially
                  common from Croton and Velia. The Apollo/tripod issue of Croton, like some of the Metapontine issues, seems to have been predominantly plated
                  or of poor alloy. The ANS collection even has a bronze core of a plated coin of one such (<hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 405), as well as a
                  die-linked sequence of silver-covered specimens (<hi rend="italic">SNGANS</hi> 399–402). According to <name type="pname">Andrew
                     Burnett,</name>
                  <ref target="#CH1-n114">
                     <hi rend="sup">114</hi>
                  </ref> a thickly plated example of a Mars/horse's head Romano didrachm was found in the <name type="place">San Giorgio Ionico</name> hoard,
                  showing that these forgeries were probably made quite soon after the genuine issues were struck.</p>
               <p>Among modern counterfeits of Metapontum, the three examples of Becker's work are readily identifiable (nos. 43–45). No. 9 (Leukippos) would
                  appear to be a rather fanciful modern concoction. Like the latter two Becker efforts, it bears only superficial resemblance to any actual
                  issues. Much more serious for scholarly purposes is the information revealed by Ravel that a Sicilian forger was very active in the 1930s,
                  producing high-quality counterfeits with dies cast from coins; he came to be controlled by one of the major Italian dealers, who passed off
                  his work mixed in with genuine pieces, all ostensibly from hoards. These coins could be distinguished by the lack of patina and the pitting of
                  the surface.<ref target="#CH1-n115">
