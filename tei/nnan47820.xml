            <p>The American token was the subject of the tenth anniversary Coinage of the Americas Conference, sponsored annually by the American Numismatic
               Society. Since its inception, this program has enjoyed the enthusiastic support of the Society's governing Council as a forum for the
               dissemination of emerging research in the coinage and currency of <placeName>North and South America</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The purpose of these conferences is to facilitate the exchange of information. Toward this end, experts in the field are invited to present
               papers, collectors are invited to exhibit, and notice of the conference is circulated widely to encourage attendance by all who have an interest
               in the topic. The Society also mounts an exhibition from its holdings and invites registrants travelling to the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> area to come to know the Society's collections and library better during the days
               surrounding the conference.</p>
            <p>A number of special exhibits were mounted on the theme of COAC 1994 and remained on view at the Society for several months. In addition to a
               survey of the token in America installed by the ANS, the American Numismatic Association lent the Virginia Culver Memorial Exhibit of Civil War
               Tokens for the occasion. Individual exhibitors included <persName>Daniel Freidus</persName> and <persName>Steve Tannenbaum</persName>;
               on display also were important items from the <persName>Donald Groves</persName> Collection.</p>

            </head>
            <p>The present volume presents the papers given at the tenth in our series of Coinage of the Americas Conferences. This meeting represented a
               milestone, for two reasons. First, the very fact that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the tenth in an ongoing series, one conceived and announced
               by <persName>Harry W. Bass, Jr.</persName> as part of the Society's 125th anniversary celebration in 1983, shepherded into existence one
               year later, and continued annually, chaired by no fewer than five ANS curators—the present writer, <persName>Alan M. Stahl</persName>, <persName>William L. Bischoff</persName>, <persName>William E. Metcalf</persName> and <persName>John M. Kleeberg</persName>, in that
               order—represents, I think, a development in modern American numismatics which has no parallel anywhere else. The COAC meeting has, in fact,
               become a welcome, valuable, and eagerly anticipated event in the American numismatic calendar. This tenth member of the series suggests that the
               entire program is alive and well, a continuing force for the study and dissemination of new information about <placeName>America's</placeName>
               money.</p>
            <p>But this particular gathering was a milestone for another reason. With the exception of the 1988 COAC, which was devoted to the coinage of the
               Spanish Viceroyalty of <placeName>El Perú</placeName> and its successor states, this meeting represented the most ambitious conference to
               date, in terms of the size of the research topic. Beginning with the 1730s, our speakers moved all the way down to the end of the nineteenth
               century, as they addressed the longest chapter in the entire story of our numismatics: the unofficial, private response to a shortage of
               official, public coinage or currency. We call this response the token.</p>
            <p>Born of necessity, the token was with us virtually from the beginning of European settlement. And it still lingers: at the time I joined the
               American Numismatic Society as a Curator in 1974, subway tokens, which then cost thirty-five cents, were often pressed into service as
               thirty-five cent coins, enriching the local numismatic scene and proving that the latest waves of immigrants were as ingenious and practical as
               their distant counterparts. This sort of <pb n="x"/> response continues as we end the twentieth century, and we may expect it to be with us in
               the years to come. The papers included herein will give us one of our best and widest views of "The Token: America's Other Money."</p>
            <p>The ten presentations contained in this volume suggest that research into the American token is entering a new phase, one which puts it at the
               forefront of numismatic study in this country. This is appropriate if overdue: the token frequently served as the linchpin of the lower portions
               of the nation's monetary system, and it is presentations and studies such as the ones contained herein which are serving to bring a recognition
               of the importance of America's "other money" into the wider numismatic community. Such dawning recognition is certain to bring additional
               research, additional publication in the field of the American token.</p>
            <p>The authors represented here have one trait in common: they are prepared to go beyond the received wisdom of earlier studies, to get to the
               bottom of a particular series or object, to find out the truth for themselves.</p>
            <p>They are prepared to do so in various ways. For <persName>Daniel Freidus</persName>, the process involves stripping back generations of
               misapprehension concerning a token series, combined with a close attention to the chemical composition of the Higley coppers. He has already
               gotten notable results, and we can anticipate more to come as he progresses with his research in this area. In January 1995, the ANS awarded him
               a <persName>Groves</persName> Fund research grant for this purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>John Kleeberg</persName> has performed a similar task for the Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                  York City</placeName> token of the late 1790s; but his tools will be found in a systematic perusal of old drawings and prints rather than in
               metallurgical analysis. Both types of methodology are valuable: but they must be combined with a discernment and a will for hard work to yield
               the results seen in these two papers.</p>
            <p>The Higley coppers and the Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token share a common attribute:
               both are rare, making research into their origins a real challenge. For <persName>Q. David Bowers</persName>, the difficulty arose not from
               the rarity of his subject but from its very abundance: as he wrote to me, countermarked American copper cents were long seen simply as mutilated
               coins, thus beneath the attention of the serious collector. His study, based on diligent research into the origins and nature of the copper
               countermarks, can be expected to change the reception of this type of material.</p>
            <p>
               <persName corresp="#viaf_64112980">Eric P. Newman</persName> has also worked with abundance rather than with rarity, as his research
               addresses Hard Times tokens in a fashion which few of us had previously considered possible. His patient <pb n="xi"/> inquiries into
               nineteenth-century pamphlets, broadside, and especially newspapers, has resulted in a particularly satisfying piece of work, one of the high
               points of a most distinguished career as a numismatic researcher.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>George S. Cuhaj</persName> presents us with a different type of token, the vecture. His work is based on a long and intimate
               acquaintance with the story of the development of the transportation network of America's largest city, whose growth (and that of the nation as a
               whole) occasioned the augmentation of a general, public money supply with a specialized, private one. In the present article, <persName>Cuhaj</persName> has demonstrated an analytical approach to his subject—reasoning things through and taking nothing for granted—which we saw
               earlier at the Coinage of the Americas Conference and this book which is its result; a critical spirit which lies at the heart of the significant
               new discoveries being made in the field of the American token.</p>
            <p>The critical spirit continues as we move through the nineteenth century. Robert Leonard demonstrates an admirable persistence and skill, bringing
               a solid presence to a most ghostly figure, <persName>A. M. Abrahams</persName> of <placeName>Missouri</placeName>. The career of this
               immigrant and his need to circulate money of his own go to the heart of the American story from the days of the colonies to the present; and we
               look forward to other specialists doing what <persName>Mr. Leonard</persName> has done for other issuers.</p>
            <p>The <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens of the 1850s are rare, offering particular challenges to the researcher. Those of the following
               decade are far more common, but they present challenges as well. For such a huge corpus, we know very little of a concrete nature about Civil War
               patriotic tokens and store cards—about who made them, who issued them, and why. But <persName>George Fuld</persName> performs a useful
               service by bringing together what is currently agreed upon, setting the stage for his own future research as well as that of others.</p>
            <p>The cent-sized tokens were an answer to monetary scarcity on the bottom of the scale during the American Civil War. Encased postage stamps were a
               response to scarcity at a slightly higher level. The inventor and purveyor of the curious mica-and-brass stamp holders was <persName>John Gault</persName>, while the best-known issuer was probably <persName>J. C. Ayer</persName>, purveyor of a patent medicine, who allied
               public-spiritedness with the profit motive, gaining a notoriety which was far in excess of the dubious merits of the product he hawked. <persName>Wayne Homren's</persName> research is currently centered on <persName>Messrs. Gualt</persName> and <persName>Ayers</persName>, and his careful consideration of the actual pieces and contemporary newspaper reporting concerning them stands as another
               example <pb n="xii"/> of current numismatic excellence in token research.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Jules Reiver's</persName> paper shows that investigations into the American token need not be confined to original specimens: in
               his discussion of struck copies of early tokens, he has provided a signal service to researchers and collectors of early materials, by
               pinpointing and describing those enigmatic products of earlier American collectors, scholars and rogues. Their wares were tokens in two senses of
               the word: not only were they replicas of real tokens, but—as stand-ins for the genuine article, meant to fill holes in a collection until the
               real items could be procured—they were tokens in a second sense.</p>
            <p>Finally, <persName>Russell Rulau's</persName> paper has brought American tokens, their myriad issuers, and those who collect them and
               investigate their histories, into a synthesis, granting us a last affectionate look at what was once considered a stepchild of American
               numismatics, but which is now claiming its full birthright. As researchers consider these homely pieces, as they investigate their humble
               issuers, gaining bits and pieces of the past from hard work in new directions and attention to detail in old, and as more and more of the mosaic
               comes clear, they are, I think, creating American numismatics in a way possible for few investigators in other branches of our nation's monetary
               past. For they are making visible progress, whose steps are not recorded in a new die state or subvariety of a well-known coin or note, but in
               entire new types, new issuers, new connections.</p>
            <p>I personally look forward with pleasurable anticipation to new chapters in the story of "The Token: America's Other Money." When you read the
               contents of this book, I think you will agree with me.</p>

               <p>Much of the history of the <persName>Higley</persName> coppers is still based on legend rather than documented sources. No contemporary
                  reference to their manufacture or use is known. The earliest reference I have been able to locate is a drawing in The Library Company of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-1">fig. 1</ref>). This is the work of
                     <persName>Pierre Eugène Du Simitière</persName>, probably drawn in the 1770s.<ref target="#CH1-1">1</ref> This voracious collector had
                  seven <persName>Higley</persName> coppers, which he referred to as "deer money." Even then he could not find all varieties in good enough
                  condition to make out the legends.</p>

               <p>Numismatists have been trying to fill in the blanks in our knowledge about these intriguing coppers for over two centuries. Even their name
                  can be misleading. They are often known as <placeName>Granby</placeName> coppers despite the fact that <placeName>Granby</placeName> did
                  not exist until 1786 and the site of the mines has been in East <placeName>Granby</placeName> since <placeName>Granby</placeName> was
                  divided in 1858. In the 1730s the mine which is the purported source of the <persName>Higley</persName> coppers was in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>.</p>
               <p>We have no reason to doubt the evidence on the coins themselves. They were made in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> between the years of
                  1737 and 1739. Beyond that, what is known about copper from <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>?</p>
               <p>It is well documented that copper was discovered in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> in 1705. The
                     <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> Town Clerk still has the records of town meetings during this era. At a town meeting in December <pb n="3"/> 1705, it was decided to appoint two men to pursue a report of the discovery of "either silver or copper" in the town.<ref target="#CH1-2">2</ref> In May 1707, the town organized what was the first copper mining company in the colonies. These proprietors tried
                  to lease the mines and receive royalties on copper produced but five years of disputes ensued and it appears that while development of the
                  mines did start, no significant production occurred during the period.</p>
               <p>In 1712 a new 30-year lease was signed with <persName>Rev. Timothy Woodbridge, Jr</persName>. of <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>,
                     <persName>William Partridge</persName> of <placeName>Newbury, Massachusetts</placeName>, and <persName>Jonathan
                     Belcher</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> (later Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> and then Governor of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName>).</p>
               <p>Soon after the 1712 lease was signed, development of Copper Hill began. Housing for miners was built as well as a stamping mill for crushing
                  ore. <persName>Belcher</persName> traveled to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> and returned with 12 miners
                  and a refiner. Perhaps to have oversight of the refining, he set up the refinery in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>
                  and had the ore transported to the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> River and then by ship to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. Supposedly because of insufficient volume, he decided to shut this refinery and simply send the
                  ore directly to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, for refining after about
                  1720.</p>
               <p>By 1717, <persName>Belcher</persName> had bought out his father-in-law and <persName>Rev. Woodbridge</persName> had sold his share
                  to <persName>Jaheel Brenton</persName> of <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName> and two <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City merchants, <persName>Charles Crommeline</persName> and <persName>Elias Boudinot</persName>, an ancestor of the Director of the <placeName>U.S. Mint</placeName> by that name.</p>
               <p>The other lessees operated somewhat independently of <persName>Belcher</persName> and organized a refinery in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>. They hired a refiner from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, <persName>John Hoofman</persName>, and also brought over skilled workers from Germany.</p>
               <p>While there is no indication that great riches ever came out of any <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> mines, large sums were definitely spent
                  to develop them. <persName>Belcher</persName> complained of losses and mentioned that he invested £15,000 over the 30 years he was
                  involved with these mines (1712-41). This amount corresponds to just over $1 million in current dollars.<ref target="#CH1-3">3</ref> When the
                  30-year leases expired, mining activity ceased for decades since nobody thought the endeavor would be profitable.</p>
               <p>During this period the copper mines in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> were not the only ones in the colonies and probably not the largest.
                  The <placeName>Schuyler mine</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> (which shipped its ore to
                     <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>) had produced 1,400 tons of ore by
                     1731.<ref target="#CH1-4">4</ref> This point is important because, while the <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> Copper mining experience is
                  a milestone, perhaps the most significant part of this story is not about copper but about steel.</p>
               <pb n="4"/>
               <p>This is where <persName>Samuel Higley</persName> enters the picture. <persName>Higley</persName> was born in 1687, the son of a
                  wealthy merchant who had moved to <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> in 1684. He was well educated and apparently studied medicine with <persName>Samuel Mather</persName> and <persName>Thomas Hooker</persName>.<ref target="#CH1-5">5</ref> In 1714, he received land from
                  his father's estate and he built a house on the property when he married in 1719. In 1728, the General Court granted <persName>Higley</persName> the exclusive right to make steel in the Colony for a period of 10 years.<ref target="#CH1-6">6</ref>
                  <persName>Higley</persName> did not have the first copper mine in the colonies. He didn't even have the first copper mine in his town.
                  There is no indication that his steel-making ever became a successful commercial venture, but he may well have been the first skilled enough
                  at the wide variety of tasks required to make steel, make tools from that steel, and use those tools to make coins.</p>
               <p>In 1728, <persName>Higley</persName> bought 143 acres about 1.5 miles south of <placeName>Copper Hill</placeName>. We know that copper
                  was mined on that land. We also know that <persName>Higley</persName> was considered enough of an expert that, in 1732, when there was a
                  dispute about the quality of ore coming from <placeName>Copper Hill</placeName>, <persName>Belcher</persName> called <persName>Samuel Higley</persName> to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> to resolve the matter.<ref target="#CH1-7">7</ref> However, <persName>Belcher</persName> accused <persName>Higley</persName> of dishonesty, saying he had found the ore to
                  contain 25% copper when he analyzed it in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> but only when 15% copper when he analyzed the same batch of ore
                  for <persName>Belcher</persName> in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. <persName>Belcher</persName> often
                  complained about his losses from this mining investment, a fact which may have colored this accusation.</p>
               <p>It is fortuitous that someone as prominent as <persName>Belcher</persName> was associated with copper mining in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> because many of his letters have been saved. Perhaps the only contemporary reference we still have to <persName>Higley's</persName> mining activity is in a letter from <persName>Belcher</persName>. In 1733, he wrote to his attorney, who lived in
                     Hartford:<ref target="#CH1-8">8</ref>
                  <q>I find after all the mines at <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> are not worth the working – It had been well for me those works had ceased
                     some years ago, but it avails very little to look back – I observe <persName>Higley</persName> is very slow, and dilatory in the
                     business – having made out only one ton of ore to this day, and there are but three months more before the winter will be upon him, so he
                     may perhaps make out in a whole year 2 or 3 tons of ore – which is a poor story – I am indeed sick of all this affair and the sooner it is
                     entirely at an end the better.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Unfortunately, while there are approximately 90 <persName>Belcher</persName> letters referring to <placeName>Simsbury</placeName>
                  copper over the three decades he was involved in the mines, none are known from the period May 1735 to August 1739. Hopefully, some of <persName>Belcher's</persName> letters from this critical <pb n="5"/> period will eventually be found.</p>
               <p>So why do we believe that these copper tokens are indeed the work of <persName>Samuel Higley</persName>? Basically, we have two lines of
                  evidence. First, family lore. Not to be totally discounted, but neither should these legends be considered totally reliable. Second, his known
                  ability as a steelmaker. While many people in <placeName>Simsbury</placeName> were skilled metalworkers, most would have been familiar only
                  with copper or iron work. Striking coins required the ability to work with steel. The evidence points to <persName>Samuel
                     Higley</persName>. His will was written in 1734 and mentions his mine but nothing about coining equipment. He is believed to have died in 1737,
                  so who struck the 1739 coppers remains a question. A number of sources have claimed that <persName>Higley's</persName> work was continued
                  by his elder brother, <persName>John, Jr.,</persName> and various other associates. None of these claims has been substantiated. If <persName>Samuel Higley</persName> died in 1737, the minter of the later issues is still a mystery.</p>
               <p>While there is still much historical work remaining to be done on the origins of these coppers,<ref target="#CH1-9">9</ref> we do have dozens
                  of the coins themselves to study. Preliminary results of a metallurgical analysis are presented here, followed by a description of the coins
                  by die varieties and a census of the specimens held in both public and private collections.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Another avenue of research I have undertaken on the <persName>Higleys</persName> is neutron activation analysis. I have done this work in
                  collaboration with <persName>Adon Gordus</persName> at the University of <placeName>Michigan</placeName>. Basically, we rubbed about
                  10 micrograms of copper off the edge of a <persName>Higley</persName> (museums are typically more receptive to this procedure than
                  collectors) and put the rubbing in a nuclear reactor where it was bombarded with neutrons. A small proportion of the atoms of many metallic
                  elements are changed into radioactive isotopes and the energy of the radiation given off is measured which allows determination of the
                  elemental composition of the piece being studied. We looked at genuine <persName>Higleys</persName>, some suspected fakes, ore I
                  collected from <persName>Higley's</persName> mine, and contemporary British copper coins. We hoped that the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> ore would have some trace elements which would allow us to distinguish British from American copper. While the analysis
                  was useful for detecting fakes, all the genuine copper coins of the period were roughly similar in elemental composition. But we did debunk
                  the myth that <persName>Higleys</persName> are rare because they are pure copper and thus were used by goldsmiths for alloying. All the
                  early eighteenth-century copper coins were over 95% copper (mostly 98-99%). The one caveat is that our analysis could not detect tin. <pb n="6"/> For this study therefore, all specimens analyzed were assumed to contain no tin. If <persName>Higleys</persName> were
                  perceived as purer, it may have been a eighteenth-century myth that led to their selective use by goldsmiths, not an eighteenth-century fact.
                  Further study of the elemental composition of <persName>Higley</persName> coppers and other contemporary coppers coins should be done
                  using techniques which can detect tin.</p>
               <p>In addition to studies of the elemental composition of these Coppers, I believe that other metallurgical studies would be fruitful. There
                  remain many questions about the manufacture of these intriguing tokens. Exactly how were they struck? How many impressions were made from a
                  given die? How were planchets cut and annealed? Were double-struck coins annealed between strikes? Were any dies made after <persName>Samuel Higley's</persName> death? Who struck these Coppers after his death and why did they eventually stop?</p>
               <p>Finally, what was the role of these tokens in local economic life? What was the geographic range of their circulation? How many years did they
                  circulate? The die numbering system I have used continues long held assumptions about the order of striking, based mainly on the legends on
                  these coppers. But were these legends really responses to the acceptance, or lack thereof, of the first <persName>Higley</persName>
                  coppers on which he tried to annoint upon a half pence worth of copper the value of 3 pence? All in all, the <persName>Higley</persName>
                  coppers represent a significant chapter in the economic and industrial growing pains of this country. As we learn more about them, we also
                  learn more about economic and technological changes which were simultaneously occuring on the larger scale more commonly considered by
                  historians studying colonial America.</p>

                     1.3, no letters touch the line. The location of the deer's hind legs relative to the dot beneath distinguishes 1.1 (on which the dot is
                     somewhat in front of a point directly below the foot) from 1.2 and 1.3 (on which the dot is directly below <pb n="8"/> the foot). Finally,
                     the spacing of the letters "PEN" differs among the three dies.</p>
                  <p>The position of the horns is another diagnostic. On die 1.1 the right horn points between "O" and "F", while on 1.2 it points a bit further
                     to the right, i.e. the left edge of "F". While this distinction is small, this horn can be more easily used to distinguish 1.1 and 1.2 from
                     on 1.3, where it is seen to point to the middle of "F".</p>
                  <p>The <persName>Bolen</persName> copy made in the mid-nineteenth century is an imitation of die 1.2. There are, however, a number of
                     significant differences. The circle around the deer is complete on the <persName>Bolen</persName> copy. The copy also has a dot in the
                     C on PENCE. Some worn <persName>Bolen</persName> copies are known, but even these are readily distinguishable (<ref target="#fig-3">fig. 3</ref>).</p>

                  <p>If the word "VALVE" is not sharp, Type 3 may be distinguished from Type 2 by other diagnostics. The star is rotated differently and there
                     is a dot between "PLEASE" and the star which follows it. In addition, on Type 2, the spaces between the words "ME AS YOU" are greater than
                     the spaces between these words <pb n="9"/> on all three dies of Type 3. There is also a distinctive die cud in the field of die 2.</p>

                  <p>Distinguishing between the 3 dies of Type 3 is difficult because so many specimens are well worn. The most useful diagnostic features are
                     the positioning of the letter "L" in PLEASE and the position of the deer's horns. Also useful is the position of "III" relative to the line
                     above. On 3.1 the line is a single broad line while on 3.2 and 3.3 it is a double line. On 3.2 the first and third "I" touch the line
                     above, while none touch on 3.1. (On one impression of 3.2 [in the ANS], "III" does not touch the line above. Therefore this is not a result
                     of die cutting but rather the Roman numerals were so close to the line that this thin piece of metal did not last long and broke off the
                     die.)</p>
                  <p>Finally, on die 3.3, there are only two arcs below "III", with more on 3.1 and 3.2.</p>

                  <p>B.a can be distinguished from B.b using spacing of letters in the legend: "OP" is farther apart on B.a while "PP" is closer on B.a. In
                     addition, "1737" is spaced wider on B.a and the dot before the hand is lower on B.a (i.e. closer to the center of the coin). The dot after
                     "COPPER" is lower and further away on B.a (relative to the letter "R"). Finally, the ornament between "COPPER" and "1737" is smaller on B.a

                  <p>Attributing <persName>Higley</persName> coppers can be time consuming on worn specimen. In addition, a number of specimens are known
                     which have been double struck. Given the uneven planchets, I believe that many of these double strikes are not errors but attempts to
                     improve coins which did not receive an adequate initial impression. When using relative position of design elements, one should be aware of
                     whether or not the coin at hand is double struck as this will, of <pb n="12"/> course, affect alignment of elements from the two strikes.
                     The fact that the second strike often leaves much of the first impression visible indicates that the faces of the two dies were often not
                     quite parallel. This suggests that these coppers were hammer struck, though further study is neccesary to determine whether the dies were
                     hinged together to provide some degree of alignment or whether the dies were completely unattached.</p>
                  <p>There is one specimen which presents another mystery. The ANS owns a copper which looks unlike any other <persName>Higley</persName>
                        (<ref target="#fig-12">fig. 12</ref>). This may be a counterfeit or a reengraved piece but differs so dramaticaly in quality of
                     engraving that it is difficult to imagine that it is from the same hand as any of the other <persName>Higley</persName> coppers.
                     Further study of this specimen is warranted to determine the method and date of its manufacture as well as the identity of its maker.</p>

               <p>The following census information should be considered a snapshot of a process rather than a definitive finished product. There are <persName>Higleys</persName> which I have been told of but which I cannot verify because I have seen neither the coin nor its photograph.
                  Surely there are also those which have not even come to my attention. Readers who know of specimens not included in this census are asked to
                  contact the author through the ANS.</p>
               <p>A name followed by a number indicates a specimen's owner and lot number if sold at auction or accession number if owned by an institution. If
                  sold at auction, the cataloger and date of the sale follow in parentheses. An asterisk following an entry indicates the <persName>steward</persName> of a specimen at the time of this writing. Entries followed by a dash indicate that the current location is not known to
                  the author.</p>

            <p>Coins and tokens provide the evidence not only for portraits, but also for vanished edifices.<ref target="#CH2-1">1</ref> The most spectacular
               example of this is the Colosseum sestertius issued under the <persName>Emperor Titus</persName>, which shows us the Colosseum as a perfect
               circle, with the crowds inside, and on the outside, the baths of <persName corresp="#nomisma_titus">Titus</persName> and a column, the <placeName>Meta Sudans</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-13">fig. 1</ref>), which survived until the 1930s but was then destroyed by <persName>Benito Mussolini</persName>. Ironically, although we have a good idea of how the 2,000 year-old Colosseum looked, we have many
               problems when we try to figure out how the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre looked, which is less
               than 200 years old. I have been assured by a Roman numismaist,<ref target="#CH2-2">2</ref> however, that it is far easier to reconstruct these
               buildings when there are substantial remains, as in the case of the Colosseum.</p>

            <p>In the case of the Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token, not only is there disagreement as
               to the appearance of the actual building, but there is disagreement as to which building is represented. <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Damia Francis</persName> concluded the token showed the First Park Theatre, and <persName>Walter Breen</persName> adopted their
               conclusions in his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia</hi>
               <ref target="#CH2-3">3</ref>
               <persName>Francis W. Doughty</persName>,<ref target="#CH2-4">4</ref> however, argued at a meeting of the American Numismatic Society on
               February 17, 1886, that the building depicted on the token is not the First Park Theatre, but rather the <persName>John Street
                  Theatre</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-5">5</ref> Recently <persName>Michael J. Hodder</persName> has revived this argument, who, when he
               reviewed the ANS benefit auction by <persName>Stack's</persName> in the <hi rend="italic">C4 Newsletter</hi>, said, "The Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token is correctly described as showing the <persName>John Street
                  Theatre</persName>, not the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> as had been believed before (and as is in the Red Book and <persName>Breen</persName>)."<ref target="#CH2-6">6</ref> This revision has been incorporated into the 1995 edition of the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book of

               <p>The Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token has had an unfortunate cataloguing history.
                  Cataloguers of the British token coinage of the eighteenth century have rejected it as American; cataloguers of early <pb n="21"/> American
                  coins have rejected it as British. <persName>James Conder</persName>, one of the earliest cataloguers of the tokens of the late
                  eighteenth century, commented about American pieces, <q>I have in my possession fifty-five different American pieces, some minted there, and
                     others in <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>; several of which, circulated in this country, were improperly included in the lists that
                     have been published, as the Medalet of "<placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>,"<hi rend="bold"/> "<placeName>United States</placeName>," "<placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Tokens;" but such are
                     wholly omitted in this arrangement. They may be collected as American Pieces, but can never be regarded as British.<ref target="#CH2-8">8</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>James Atkins</persName> in 1892 followed <persName>Conder's</persName> arrangement and did not include these tokens.<ref target="#CH2-9">9</ref>
                  <persName>Richard Dalton</persName> and <persName>Samuel H. Hamer</persName>, fortunately, did include the Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token in their catalogue of 1910 (<persName>Dalton-Hamer</persName>.Middx.l67), as did <persName>R. C. Bell</persName> in 1978 (<persName>Bell</persName>.S.40), although <persName>Bell</persName> calls it a "problem piece."<ref target="#CH2-10">10</ref>
               </p>
               <p>In the American literature, <persName>Crosby</persName> did not include this token, although he did include the Franklin Press
                  token—which is another Conder token. Although shunned by the reference books, the token appeared occasionally at important <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> auctions. The earliest appearance I have found was the <persName>McCoy</persName> auction by
                     <persName>Woodward</persName> (1864), where the token realized $21, being sold to <persName>Levick.</persName>
                  <ref target="#CH2-11">11</ref> This same specimen was sold in <persName>Woodward's</persName> auction of <persName>Levick's</persName> collection of 1884, which had a photographic plate as frontispiece.<ref target="#CH2-12">12</ref> This is the earliest
                  illustration I have found; however, it depicted only the obverse of the token (as did the plate in the <persName>John Story
                     Jenks</persName> sale auctioned by <persName>Henry Chapman</persName> in December 1921).<ref target="#CH2-13">13</ref> The token was
                  accepted into the American series as the result of the work of <persName>Dr. Benjamin P. Wright</persName> and <persName corresp="#numismatics_adams_edgar">Edgar H. Adams</persName>. In <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> for October 1899, Wright listed the
                  token we know and the muling in tin of the Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token and the
                  "Antient Scottish Washing" reverse. <persName>Wright</persName> gave them variety numbers <persName>Wright</persName>. 1130 and
                     <persName>Wright</persName> 1130A. <persName>Wright</persName> also published a crude but fairly accurate line drawing of the
                  token and the muling; although the obverse appeared in the photographic plate of the <persName>Levick</persName> sale, this is the
                  earliest illustration of the reverse and the muling.<ref target="#CH2-14">14</ref>
                  <persName>Adams</persName> was charged by the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Numismatic Club
                  with editing a list of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> storecards. This work began by reprinting in
                  1913 the listing of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> State storecards which had been published in the
                     <hi rend="italic">Coin Collector's Journal</hi> for 1884-86.<ref target="#CH2-15">15</ref> Neither of these catalogues included the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre token. In 1920, however, <persName corresp="#numismatics_adams_edgar">Edgar H. Adams</persName> published a comprehensive catalogue of tokens from all the states, and this did
                  include the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre token. <persName>Adams</persName> probably
                     <pb n="22"/> picked it up from an auction catalogue, such as the auction of the <persName>Levick</persName> collection, or from <persName>Wright's</persName> listing.<ref target="#CH2-16">16</ref>
                  <persName>Adams</persName> listed two varieties: one with a lettered edge (<persName>Adams</persName>.892; listed in <persName>Breen</persName> as <persName>Breen</persName>.1055) and one with a plain edge (<persName>Adams</persName>.893; <persName>Breen</persName>. 1056). From there it was introduced into <persName>Wayte Raymond's</persName> standard coin and token
                     catalogues.<ref target="#CH2-17">17</ref> After <persName>Raymond's</persName> death his catalogue continued to be published for a few
                  years, although <persName>Yeoman's</persName> "Red Book" gradually replaced it in the marketplace. The token, however, did not get into
                  the Red Book until the 1972 edition, which appeared in July 1971, and even then it did not rate a photograph—nor has it ever obtained one
                     since.<ref target="#CH2-18">18</ref> Of course, it is much larger than most of the coins listed in the Red Book, so perhaps it took up more
                  space than the book could spare.</p>

               <p>The inscription of the engraving says, "The New Theatre." We know the date of this engraving, because it was bound in with the city directory
                  of 1797, and it is specifically referred to on the title page of the directory. It is not an accidental binding of two extraneous things. This
                  engraving was intended for the 1797 directory. This theater was new in 1797. The <persName>John Street Theatre</persName>, which <persName>Doughty</persName> and <persName>Hodder</persName> proposed for the token, was built in 1767, and could not be called "the
                  New Theatre" in 1797; in fact, it was referred to at the time as "the Old Theatre."<ref target="#CH2-23">23</ref> The <persName>Park
                     Theatre</persName>, which was first called the New Theatre, to distinguish it from the <persName>John Street Theatre</persName>, had its
                  cornerstone laid on May 5, 1795.<ref target="#CH2-24">24</ref> After many delays in construction, it finally opened on January 29, 1798.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City directories in this early period were made to be ready by the
                  fourth of July. They were dated by "the year of American independence." One reason was that May first was "moving day," when many <placeName>New Yorkers</placeName> changed their domiciles; and <pb n="24"/> so directories were prepared after that date. We know that the
                  custom of "moving day" already existed in the eighteenth century, because in <persName>William Dunlap's</persName> play of 1789 (<hi rend="italic">The Father of an Only Child</hi>) we find the phrase, "His head is like <placeName>New-York</placeName> on May day, all
                  the furniture wandering."<ref target="#CH2-25">25</ref> The preface to <persName>David Longworth's</persName>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City directory of 1796 is signed June 11, 1796.<ref target="#CH2-26">26</ref> In the text of <persName>Longworth's</persName> 1797 directory, there is a reference to an agreement between the <placeName>United States</placeName> and the Spanish consul in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> on May 17, 1797<ref target="#CH2-27">27</ref> so the directory must have been typeset after that; but it would have to
                  be ready in time for July fourth. The engraving therefore shows the theater as it appeared in or before the spring of 1797. The theater was
                  then still under construction; and a careful examination of the engraving reveals that the theater does not yet have a roof: the sunlight is
                  hitting the interior rear wall. We do know when the roof was put on the <persName>Park Theatre</persName>; the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> merchant <persName>Walter Rutherfurd</persName> wrote to his son, <persName>John Rutherfurd</persName> on October 2, 1796, saying, "Our great buildings make good progress....The Play House is roofed and the
                  States Prison has three hundred men at work on it,"<ref target="#CH2-28">28</ref> which suggests that <persName>Tisdale's</persName>
                  drawing antedates October 1796. The engraving therefore shows the theater under construction, as it was in the autumn of 1796; this is the New
                  Theatre, which later was called the <persName>Park Theatre</persName>.</p>
               <p>In short, the First <persName>Park Theatre</persName> attribution, proposed by <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Damia Francis</persName> and by <persName>Walter Breen</persName>, is correct, and the <persName>John Street Theatre</persName>
                  attribution, proposed by <persName>Doughty</persName> and revived by <persName>Hodder</persName>, is wrong.</p>
               <p>There are some small differences between the token and the engraving, but <persName>Jacob</persName> has been fairly faithful,
                  particularly in his depiction of the eagle. <persName>Jacob</persName> has changed the Corinthian pilasters to Doric ones, and he has
                  omitted the ironwork on the balcony, but generally he has made an almost slavish copy.</p>
               <p>The frontispiece depicting the theater in <placeName>Longworth's</placeName> 1797 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                     York City</placeName> City directory exists in at least two versions. The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York

                  sc[ulpsit]." This particular version was already catalogued by <persName>Stauffer</persName> (<persName>Stauffer.</persName>3258).<ref target="#CH2-29">29</ref> The American Antiquarian Society copy of the directory has what is probably the
                  second version, which is signed "<persName>J. Allen sc[ulpsit]</persName>
                  <persName>Tisdale del</persName>[inavit]," which means that the picture is by <persName>Tisdale</persName>, but the engraving work
                  was done by Allen.<ref target="#CH2-30">30</ref> Presumably <persName>Tisdale</persName> first did both the drawing and the engraving,
                  but the engraving was found to be unsatisfactory, whereupon <persName>Allen</persName> was called in to redo it.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Tisdale</persName> is <persName>Elkanah Tisdale</persName>, a painter and engraver, who spent most of his life in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> but was living in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City at this
                  point. <persName>Stauffer</persName> says that he was born in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>,
                  about 1771, and was still alive in 1834, although this is contradicted by my reading of the census, which leads me to believe that he was born
                  in 1761 and was dead by 1810.<ref target="#CH2-31">31</ref>
                  <persName>Tisdale</persName> came from a family in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, who
                  traditionally gave their menfolk names from the Old Testament beginning with the letter "E." The 1790 census lists three <persName>Tisdale</persName> households in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, Windham County, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>: <persName>Elijah Tisdale</persName>, whose household had seven free white males of sixteen and over, including himself, four free white males under
                  sixteen, and seven free white females; <persName>Ebenezer Tisdale</persName>, who was living with three free white females; and <persName>Eliphalet Tisdale</persName>, who was living with two free white females. Presumably <persName>Elkanah</persName> was the son
                  of <persName>Elijah</persName>, one of the free white males above the age of sixteen in his household. These peculiar names beginning
                  with "E" were thus a family custom, although Old Testament names were common in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>. There were at least two
                  other <persName>Eliphalets</persName> in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName> in 1790; other remarkable Puritan Old Testament names included
                     <persName>Amaziah Chappel</persName> and <persName>Flavel Clark</persName>. There was one lady with a more traditional Puritan
                  name: Experience Brewster. Of the 574 families in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, nineteen owned slaves, most only one or two or three; the
                  one exception was <persName>Elijah Mason</persName>, senior, who owned 28 slaves, or more than 1% of all the slaves in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. The 1800 census for <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, showed <persName>Ebenezer Tisdale</persName>, then aged 45 or more, living with a free white female aged 26-44 and another free white female aged
                  45 or more; presumably the former was an unmarried daughter, the latter a wife. <persName>Elkanah Tisdale</persName> headed another
                  household in <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>: his household had two free white males aged 10 to 15, one free white male aged 16 to 25, and
                  one free white male, presumable <persName>Elkanah</persName> himself, aged 45 or over; the free white females included three aged 16 to

                  <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, was a good place to be from; some of the Trumbull family came from

                  troops were quartered there during the American <pb n="26"/> War of Independence in 1780, <persName>Lauzun</persName> commented, "Only

                  <persName>Tisdale</persName> did another frontispiece for <persName>Longworth's</persName> directory: the 1796 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City Directory has a frontispiece signed "<persName>Tisdale</persName>,"
                  depicting the <placeName>Tontine City Tavern</placeName>, with the title below it, "A View of the <placeName>New CITY
                  TAVERN</placeName>." Early <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> directories liked to add views and maps of the

               <p>
                  <persName>Tisdale</persName> was a good miniaturist, but a poor engraver, which may be why the engraving was given to someone else,
                  namely <persName>Joel Allen</persName>, who was also from <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. About <persName>Joel
                     Allen</persName> we know very little. <persName>Stauffer</persName> says he was born in 1755 at <placeName>Southington</placeName>,
                     <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, and died in 1825; he later settled in Middletown, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. <persName>Allen</persName> served in the American War of Independence. The only trace I have found of him in the census is in the second
                  census of 1800, which shows him living in Southington,<placeName>Hartford</placeName> County, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. <persName>Joel Allen</persName> is aged 26 to 45, and heads a household including a free white male aged under 10, another free white male
                  aged 16 to 25, a free white female aged under 10, and a free white female, presumably his wife, aged 26 to 45.<ref target="#CH2-39">39</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Allen and <persName>Tisdale</persName> were both employed in making the engravings for the American edition of <persName>George
                     Henry Maynard's</persName> translation of the works of <persName>Flavius Josephus</persName>. This American edition, like many early
                  American editions, used the same sheets as the British edition, but changed the title page (at least twice: for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and for <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName>) and added
                  sixty engraving.<ref target="#CH2-40">40</ref> It is possible that that is how <persName>Tisdale</persName> and <persName>Allen</persName> came into contact, but the directory and the edition of <persName>Josephus</persName> were made for different publishers
                     (<persName>Thomas Swords</persName>
                  <pb n="27"/> published the directories, <persName>William Durrell</persName> published <persName>Josephus</persName>).</p>
               <p>There is a drawing which deceived the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City theater historian,
                  Professor <persName>George C.D. Odell</persName>, amongst others, into believing that it was an original. This is a sketch, or very
                  possibly a tracing, of the <persName>Tisdale</persName>/<persName>Allen</persName> engraving, which <persName>Odell</persName>
                  came across in the collection of the <placeName>New-York</placeName> Historical Society. It is clearly copied from the <persName>Tisdale</persName>/<persName>Allen</persName> engraving, because it uses cross-hatching to represent shadows, which are only needed on an
                  engraving, and are unnecessary for a pencil drawing. It is also slightly cruder than the <persName>Tisdale</persName> and the <persName>Tisdale</persName>/<persName>Allen</persName> engravings.<ref target="#CH2-41">41</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Did the engraving faithfully depict the theater? The answer is yes and no. A painting of 1798 by <persName>Milbourne</persName> shows us
                  what is now Park Row, with the New Theatre, and we can see that the eagle frieze was not used, and that the ironwork on the balcony is
                  slightly more elaborate (<ref target="#fig-16">fig. 4</ref>). I think the engraving had added to it some elements to make the theater appear
                  as if it were finished: the frieze was added, the balcony added, and probably the glass in the windows. But aside from these falsifications,
                  the engraving is a faithful depiction made from a picture done in situ: a comparison of the topography with the engraving shows it to be
                  accurate. On the right of the <persName>Tisdale</persName> engraving we see the steeple of the North Dutch church, very low down, which
                  is correct, because the streets to the east of Park Row drop steeply toward the East River.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Richard Beamish</persName>, the biographer of the theater's architect, <persName>Brunel</persName>, says of the theater,
                  "The cupola by which it was surmounted is said to have resembled that in Paris over the Corn Market, while in boldness of its projection and
                  in the lightness of its construction it was far superior."<ref target="#CH2-42">42</ref> It is true the theater had a dome, but it was an
                  interior dome, not visible from outside. Beamish's accounts of Brunel's life in the <placeName>United States</placeName> are not always
                  reliable, possibly based on inaccurate family anecdotes.</p>
               <p>The reverse of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre token depicts two ships at anchor, a bail,
                  an anchor, and a cornucopia, with a blank exergue where we would expect a date (<ref target="#fig-17">fig. 5</ref>). The one type which occurs
                  elsewhere in <persName>Jacob's</persName> work is the cornucopia; there is a close parallel in the reverse of his penny depicting the
                  House of Commons of 1797 (<persName>Dalton-Hamer</persName>.Middx.173; <ref target="#fig-18">fig. 6</ref>). On both obverse and reverse
                  the lettering is done by hand, not with punches. This is characteristic of the work of <persName>Benjamin Jacob</persName>, and is
                  unusual for this period, when most diesinkers used punches. The reverse is found combined with no other token of the period. This is unusual
                  for British tokens of the late eighteenth century (the Conder series), where muling is very widespread. This led <persName>Arthur W.
                     Waters</persName>, writing in 1954, to suggest that the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre token
                  was actually made up for some commercial purpose, rather than just for collectors.<ref target="#CH2-43">43</ref> I shall discuss this question

               <p>The edge of the ANS specimen reads, "I PROMISE TO PAY ON DEMAND THE BEARER ONE PENNYx". A different specimen with this same edge reading was
                  auctioned as part of the <persName>Colonel Walter Cutting</persName> Collection by <persName>Lyman H. Low</persName> in May
                     1898.<ref target="#CH2-44">44</ref> The 51st sale of New Netherlands, lot 180, reports that reading.<ref target="#CH2-45">45</ref>

                  <persName>Stack's</persName> reported the <persName>Roper</persName> specimen as also having that reading.<ref target="#CH2-47">47</ref>
                  <persName>Breen</persName>, however, gives the edge as "WE PROMISE TO PAY ON DEMAND THE BEARER ONE PENNYx" "as on other <persName>Jacobs</persName> tokens" and says that "the rumor of two minor varieties remains unconfirmed."<ref target="#CH2-48">48</ref> All
                  the <persName>Jacob</persName> penny tokens I have examined, however, read "I PROMISE," as in the ANS, Cutting, New Netherlands, <persName>Garrett</persName> and <persName>Roper</persName> specimens, not "WE PROMISE." A third potential variety is that catalogued
                  by <persName>William E.Woodward</persName> as lot 2463 of the <persName>Levick</persName> sale: "I promise to pay the bearer one
                     penny."<ref target="#CH2-49">49</ref> A fourth possible variety of edge lettering was listed by <persName>Henry Chapman</persName> in
                  lot 5508 of the <persName>Jenks</persName> Collection, where he sold a Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New
                     York City</placeName> token with the edge variety reading, "WE PROMISE TO PAY THE BEARER ONE PENNY."<ref target="#CH2-50">50</ref> Until
                  confirming evidence emerges, it appears that the correct edge reading is "I PROMISE TO PAY ON DEMAND THE BEARER ONE PENNYx" and that <persName>Breen</persName>, <persName>Woodward</persName>, and <persName>Chapman</persName> erred in transcribing the edges.</p>
               <p>Many <persName>Jacob</persName> tokens do show slippage of the edge dies, so that the T of THE is right next to or over the D of DEMAND.
                  This slippage is perfectly possible with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre tokens, so
                  cataloguers should keep an eye out for edge errors.</p>
               <p>Another possible edge variety is a Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token with a plain
                  edge. The oldest listing I have found of this is the listing by <persName>Edgar H.Adams</persName> in 1920 (<persName>Adams</persName>.<placeName>NY.</placeName>893).<ref target="#CH2-51">51</ref>
                  <persName>Breen</persName>, however, could not confirm the existence of this token, and calls it "unverified." If discovered, one would
                  have to ascertain that it was a true plain edge, and not filed down. <persName>Samuel H. Hamer</persName> comments about this pernicious
                  practice: <q>
                     <persName>Charles Pye</persName> refers to the Collector who, when he finds it difficult to procure a scarce variety of a coin, by
                     means of filing and chasing a common impression of the same coin, contrives to patch up an imitation of a rare variety. Unfortunately, the
                     evil which such men do lives after them, and as a result, an unpublished "Plain edge, in collar," may appear. A careful examination may
                     show traces of filing, in which instance the specimen should be regarded as an ordinary one, the edge of which has been tampered with; or,
                     an apparently genuine "Plain Edge <pb n="30"/> in Collar" may have been produced by "turning" the edge in a lathe; but as such treatment
                     would render the specimen smaller in diameter than the ordinary ones, a comparison will reveal the true character of the piece.<ref target="#CH2-52">52</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A further source of varieties is the die axis. <persName>Jacob's</persName> tokens show much variation in the die axes. The die axis of
                  the ANS specimen of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre token is just slightly off six
                  o'clock, which is presumably the same as that reported for the <persName>Norweb</persName> specimen, "195 degrees"; any other die axis
                  would be worthy of remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Donald Scarinci</persName> has estimated that there are at least 14 tokens still extant.<ref target="#CH2-53">53</ref> None of
                  the tokens appears to have experienced any circulation. All are proofs.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Breen</persName> warns against the existence of casts and electrotypes, although I have never seen a fake Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token of any kind.<ref target="#CH2-54">54</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There is one mule of this token. This combines the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre obverse
                  with "Antient Scottish Washing." This was listed by <persName>Wright</persName> as part of his collection, writing, <q>I have another
                     with the following reverse: A woman treading clothes in a tub between sprigs of thistles. Inscription, "Antient Scottish
                     Washing—*Honi.Soit.Qui.- Mal.Y.Pense.*" The metal resembles Tin. This appears as the reverse of the Loch Leven penny. The edge is plain and
                     is a remarkable specimen of a unique muling. It has never been published before.<ref target="#CH2-55">55</ref>

                  <persName>Brunel</persName> won an architectural contest to design the new theater; he had his friend Pharoux, whose plan lost out, do
                  much of the interior decoration.<ref target="#CH2-63">63</ref> When the Theatre was opened, one newspaper named as the architect not <persName>Brunel</persName> or <persName>Pharoux</persName>, but the Mangin brothers, of <pb n="32"/> whom Joseph-François would later
                  be one of the architecs of City Hall and old <persName>St. Patrick's</persName> Church (formerly the Roman Catholic Cathedral) at <placeName>Mott</placeName> and <placeName>Prince</placeName> streets. <persName>Joseph-François</persName> and <persName>Charles Mangin</persName> were also architects of the State Prison erected in <placeName>Greenwich Village</placeName> in 1796-97, located
                  north of <persName>Christopher Street</persName>, between <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> Street and the
                     <persName>Hudson River</persName>. By 1803 <persName>Joseph-François Mangin</persName> was also serving as City Surveyor, and
                  drew a map of the city that year.<ref target="#CH2-64">64</ref> All these French emigrants got along very well, and they shared their work; so
                  it is possible that all four men, namely <persName>Brunel</persName>, <persName>Pharoux</persName>, and the <persName>Mangins</persName>, had a hand in the design of the theater. Later <persName corresp="#viaf_66496514">Alexander Hamilton</persName> hired
                  another French emigrant, <persName>Major L'Enfant</persName>, to design the defenses of the Narrows, and <persName>L'Enfant</persName> turned much of the work over to Brunel.<ref target="#CH2-65">65</ref> L'Enfant designed Federal Hall in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, which so impressed Washington that he chose L'Enfant to be the designer of
                  Washington, DC.<ref target="#CH2-66">66</ref>
               </p>
               <p>There was a large French emigrant population in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City at this time.
                  The number of French refugees increased rapidly in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City after the
                  outbreak of the revolution in <placeName>Saint-Domingue</placeName> (<placeName>Haiti</placeName>) in August 1791. We know of no fewer
                  than two French language newspapers published in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City in the 1790s.
                  The first was the short-lived <hi rend="italic">Journal des Révolutions de la Partie Française de Saint-Domingue</hi> of 1793. The second
                  began publication on July 6, 1795, under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Gazette Française et Américaine</hi>, with alternate columns
                  written in French and English. On July 17, 1795, the publisher was given as <persName>John Delafond</persName>. On October 2,1795, it was
                  bought and published by Labruere, Parisot &amp; Co. On May 18, 1796, it changed its name to the <hi rend="italic">Gazette Française</hi> and
                  thereafter was published wholly in French. From July 2, 1797, it was published by <persName>Claude Parisot</persName> &amp; Co., who in
                  early 1798 published it at 21 Beekman Street. The last known issue is dated October 4, 1799.<ref target="#CH2-67">67</ref>
                  <persName>Brunel</persName> would not have approved of the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, for it supported the revolutionary French
                  Republic, and tried to make light of any differences between the <placeName>United States</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>, such as the XYZ affair. (<persName>Brunel</persName> himself was designing cannon foundries
                  and defenses of the Narrows because the <placeName>United States</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName>
                  were on the verge of war.) The <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> was rather torn; it was pro-Republican, but it was also pro-slavery, for many of
                  its readers were slaveowners. A regular feature was advertisements for runaway slaves. It also has regular advertisements for at least one
                  French bookshop.<ref target="#CH2-68">68</ref> Unfortunately, it makes no mention of <persName>Brunel</persName>, <persName>Mangin</persName>, or the opening of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre, preferring to
                  concentrate on news from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_france">France</placeName> and the Caribbean, which is what <pb n="33"/> chiefly
                  interested its readers. They wanted to know when it would be safe to return to their homes. It would have been interesting to learn what <persName>Brunel's</persName> French contemporaries thought of him. <persName>Brunel's</persName> biographer <persName>Beamish</persName> mentions that two other French emigrés found employment at the New Theatre. A nobleman, <persName>Baron de
                     Rostaing</persName>, acted on the stage; while a barrister, <persName>M. Savarin</persName>, played in the orchestra—turning the
                  avocations of their past into a gainful employment.<ref target="#CH2-69">69</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The important point is that there was a large French population in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>
                  City in the 1790s, many highly educated and talented, who provided a useful injection of skills for the young <placeName>United
                     States</placeName>. The <placeName>United States</placeName> certainly needed architects and engineers. Many of these Frenchmen knew each
                  other, and shared the work around.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Brunel</persName> is listed in only two years of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City
                  directories; in <persName>David Longworth's</persName> directory of 1797 (published in June 1797) there is an entry for "<persName>Brunel's,</persName> manufactoy, 17 Murray Street," and in <persName>Longworth's</persName> directory for 1798 (published in
                  June 1798) there is an entry for "<persName>Brunel's</persName>, manufactoy, 38 George Street."<ref target="#CH2-70">70</ref>
                  <persName>Brunel</persName> evidently tried to set up a factory in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> City making use of some of his inventions, but soon decided he might succeed better in a more developed country, namely <placeName>Britain</placeName>. <placeName>Britain</placeName> also had the advantage that she was waging war against <persName>Brunel's</persName> own enemy, revolutionary France. A further reason to leave was the collapse of the Castorland scheme and the accidental
                  drowning of <persName>Brunel's</persName> friend Pierre Pharoux while crossing the great falls of the Black River, up from <placeName>Sackets Harbor</placeName> (near what is now <placeName>Watertown</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>)<ref target="#CH2-71">71</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>Brunel</persName> left <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City in 1799, carrying a letter
                  of recommendation dated February 6, 1799, from <persName corresp="#viaf_66496514">Alexander Hamilton</persName> to <persName>Rufus King:</persName>
                  <q>This will be delivered to you by <persName>Mr. Isambard Brunell,</persName> French by birth but Anti-Jacobin by principle, and by
                     necessity an Inventor of Ingenious Machines. He goes to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> to endeavour to
                     obtain a patent for one, which he has contrived for the purpose of copying. He has a passport from <persName>Mr. Liston</persName> and
                     I believe our Secretary of State. This letter is to ask for him such patronage as in your situation and in his may be prope.<ref target="#CH2-72">72</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>Brunel</persName> went to <placeName>Britain</placeName> to set up his block machinery, which proved invaluable to the Royal
                  Navy in the struggle with <persName>Napoleon</persName>. A happy side-benefit was that the <persName>Wood</persName> shavings could
                  be used to make hatboxes and pillboxes, and he established a factory for this <pb n="34"/> purpose in Battersea in 1808, of which <persName>Brunel's</persName> biographer <persName>Beamish</persName> writes: <q>To these important economic advantages to the public
                     was added the high gratification to <persName>Brunel</persName> himself of being able to employ young children in the manufactory. The
                     love of the young was a distinguishing and abiding feature in <persName>Brunel's</persName> character, and now, after a few hours'
                     instruction and one day's practice, he had the happiness to reflect, that for a large number of these special objects of his sympathy he
                     had provided the means of earning for themselves an honest and sufficient livelhood.<ref target="#CH2-73">73</ref>

               </head>
               <p>The property upon which the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> was built—Section 1, Block 90—was originally known as the "Vineyards" or
                  the "Governor's Garden." It was subsequently acquired by <persName>John White</persName>. <persName>John White</persName> was
                  attainted and his property forfeited (presumably because he was a patriot during the Revolution; <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> was loyalist), but the property was afterward restored to his wife <persName>Ann White</persName> (widowed by February 1795) who divided the property into lots and made the early conveyances. The names of the <persName>Whites</persName> are commemorated by <persName>John</persName> Street, and one block north, <persName>Ann</persName>
                  Street, notorious as the residence of that tooler of large cents, Smith. On April 14, 1786, <persName>Isaac Stoutenburgh</persName> and
                     <persName>Philip Van Cortlandt</persName>, the Commissioners of Forfeiture, made a grant to <persName>Ann White</persName> of the
                  entire block.<ref target="#CH2-74">74</ref> The lots which became the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> are lots 6, 7, and 8. There is a
                  map of the property surveyed by Evert Bancker on October 28, 1797, among the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> City real property libers.<ref target="#CH2-75">75</ref> This shows the theater as a trapezoid, with the part toward Park Row
                  (then called Chatham Row) being rectangular, but the section on Theatre Alley (then called the Mews) being at an angle to the rest of the
                  building. The lot runs 78 feet along Park Row, 130 feet to Theatre Alley, 85 feet southerly along Theatre Alley, and then 165 feet westerly to
                  Park Row.<ref target="#CH2-76">76</ref>
                  <persName>William C. Young</persName> came across and reproduced an architectural ground plan of the theater in the collection of the
                     <placeName>New-York</placeName> Historical Society, ascribed to <persName>Brunel</persName>, and this attribution seems secure: in
                  every way I could check it, the plan corresponds to the dimensions of the lot and to what we know of how the theater looked, including the
                  northern annex which contained the green room and other rooms for the actors. This annex is visible, to the left, on the <persName>Tisdale</persName> engraving and on the token.<ref target="#CH2-77">77</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The theater sought to extend its portico to cover the sidewalk, <pb n="35"/> and petitioned the Common Council for this on June 1, 1795, but
                  its petition was rejected.<ref target="#CH2-78">78</ref> As can be seen from the token and the <persName>Tisdale</persName> engraving,
                  the portico as constructed remained flush with the rest of the theater. If the portico had been extended, the theatre would look rather like
                  the buildings on the <persName>Rue de Rivoli</persName> in Paris, which have porticos which extend over the sidewalk, which may well have
                  been <persName>Brunel's</persName> inspiration. The plan for the portico would not die, however; <persName>John K.
                     Beekman</persName> and <persName>John Jacob</persName> Astor petitioned for it again in 1821, when they rebuilt the theater, and the
                  Streets Committee of the Common Council rejected the plan.<ref target="#CH2-79">79</ref> Permission to extend the portico over the sidewalk
                  (not more than five feet) was finally granted in July 1828, to <persName>Edmund Simpson</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-80">80</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The details of the property are summed up in an indenture recorded in the Real Property Files of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City Register on May 16, 1850, presumably in the course of the settlementt of the
                  Estate of <persName>John Jacob</persName> Astor, deceased. This document explains that in October 1794, <persName>Lewis
                     Hallam</persName> and <persName>John Hodgkinson</persName> proposed the construction of a theater. Each subscriber was to put up $375,
                  which would raise "a sum sufficient for the purposes of purchasing Ground, building a Theatre, and providing Scenery, Machinery etc. for the
                  exhibition of Dramatic entertainments." There were 115 subscribers.<ref target="#CH2-81">81</ref> Each subscriber could receive a free ticket
                  plus interest at 5%, or no free ticket and interest at 7%. $42,700 was raised from the subscribers. <persName>Jacob Morton</persName>,
                     <persName>Carlile Pollock</persName> and <persName>William Henderson</persName> were appointed the trustees. Lots 6,7 and 8 were
                  bought from <persName>Ann White</persName> for $15,000. On January 1, 1797, because of delays in construction, the builders borrowed more
                  money from <persName>Daniel McCormick</persName>, <persName>Joshua Waddington</persName>, <persName>John B. Coles</persName>,
                     <persName>John McVicker</persName> and <persName>John C. Shaw</persName>. They bought from <persName>John
                     Hodgkinson</persName> his lot for $1,750. <persName>Edward Livingstone</persName> became an additional trustee. But still more money was
                  needed. The promoters borrowed $20,000 from the Bank of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> for nine
                  months at 6%; they borrowed $17,000 from the Branch Bank of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the City of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, also for nine months at 6%. But the theatre did not make enough money to survive.
                  Furthermore, some of the trustees either went bankrupt or died. On February 10, 1804, the property was auctioned off at the <persName>Tontine Coffee House</persName> by <persName>Thomas Cooper</persName>, Master in Chancery, and struck off to <persName>McCormick</persName>, Waddington, <persName>Coles</persName>, <persName>McVicker</persName> and <persName>Shaw</persName> for
                     $43,000.<ref target="#CH2-82">82</ref> They in turn sold the Theatre plus the <persName>Hodgkinson</persName> lot to <persName>John Jacob Astor</persName> and <persName>John K. Beekman</persName> for $50,000 on April 21, 1806.<ref target="#CH2-83">83</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Theatre opened on January 29, 1798, with a performance of "As You Like It." It was announced by the following <pb n="36"/> advertisement:

                  <q>The offensive practice to Ladies, and dangerous one to the house, of smoking segars, during the performance, it is hoped, every gentleman

               <p>The prices are in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> shillings, which is a very logical <pb n="37"/>
                  monetary system, because one shilling is l2 1/2 Federal cents. In Federal money, it cost a dollar to sit in a box, seventy-five cents to sit
                  in the pit (the orchestra), and fifty cents to sit in the gallery (balcony).</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, the contemporary newspaper accounts of the opening confine themselves to describing the interior of the theater. The only
                  remark in the literature which helps us to determine the external appearance of the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> is the remark by
                     <persName>Thomas Allston Brown</persName>, "in cold weather two blazing fires were kept up at either end of the lobbies"<ref target="#CH2-85">85</ref> This corresponds to the two chimneys at either end of the building which are visible on the token and the <persName>Tisdale</persName> engraving. In terms of the overall "feel" of the building, the building which still exists today which best
                  conveys an idea of the First <persName>Park Theatre</persName> (and of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> City public edifices of the 1790s) is the church of <persName>St. Mark's</persName>-in-the-<placeName>Bouwerie</placeName>, which is an almost exact contemporary: it was begun in 1795 and consecrated in 1799. (The steeple and the porch are,
                  however, nineteenth century additions.)<ref target="#CH2-86">86</ref>

                  <persName>Beamish</persName> says that when the theater opened, <persName>Brunel</persName> constructed a mechanical <persName>windmill</persName>, in which he and a friend hid; the <persName>windmill</persName> appeared on stage, and the friend then
                  recited various satires, which revealed an intimate knowledge of the foibles of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> society. An uproar ensued, and the audience advanced to destroy the <persName>windmill</persName>, but <persName>Brunel</persName> maneuvered the machine over a trapdoor, down which he and his friend descended, and they departed that night for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-87">87</ref> Unfortunately, this incident
                  is recorded by none of the American theater histories (such as Odell), which are otherwise very detailed. If this incident did take place, it
                  must have occurred on some night other than January 29, 1798.</p>
               <p>Even when it opened in January 1798, the theater was still in an unfinished state. It was only in November 1798, when the theater reopened—its
                  opening was slightly delayed because of a yellow fever epidemic in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName>—that the interior dome was finished by Charles Ciceri, the great scene painter of his day.<ref target="#CH2-88">88</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The theater was first called the New Theatre,<ref target="#CH2-89">89</ref> and was on Chatham Row, which led to Chatham Square (named for
                     <persName>William Pitt</persName> the Elder, the <persName>Earl of Chatham</persName>, who had had the Stamp Act repealed). It
                  was in a part of the city where everything unwanted had been put: the prison (Bridewell), the Alms House, and the graveyard for
                  African-Americans. This was partly because of the insalubrious swamps surrounding the Fresh Water Pond (Foley Square continues to flood
                  regularly even today). Development was further delayed by the uncertain title to this area, because <persName>John White</persName>, the
                     <pb n="38"/> landowner, had had his property declared forfeit during the War of Independence. By the 1790s, however, the rest of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City had become too built up, so that the only large lots remained in
                  this area to the north of the city. <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Hospital was built there in 1791,
                  followed by an insane asylum in 1808, which later moved to <placeName>Bloomingdale</placeName> (now <persName>Columbia
                     University</persName>). The construction of City Hall and the development of City Hall Park (with fountains courtesy of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Waterworks) dramatically changed the part of the neighborhood close to Broadway,
                  making it quite fashionable; the area further to the northeast, which flooded, remained notorious as the "Five Points" slums.<ref target="#CH2-90">90</ref> When City Hall Park was developed in the first decade of the nineteenth century, the theater began to be called
                  the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> and the name of its street was changed to Park Row. At some point, probably before 1806, a
                  remodelling of the outside took place, which eliminated the pilasters. Another addition was a statue of Shakespeare which was set up in the
                  central niche (converted from a window) on the second floor. By 1806, the exterior was very plain, because when the interior was remodelled
                  then by <persName>Mr. Holland</persName>, the <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>New-York Evening Post</persName>
                  </hi> praised the interior highly, but added, "We speak of the interior only, for the outside remains just as it was, a standing libel on the
                  taste of the town"<ref target="#CH2-91">91</ref> This simplification of <persName>Brunel's</persName> design is probably the origin of
                     <persName>Ireland's</persName> remark, that "It is doubtful if they [<persName>Brunel's</persName> plans for construction] were
                  ever carried out—that for the exterior, which included a range of fluted pilasters by way of ornament, certainly was not, and for many years
                  the front wall remained perfectly plain and barn-like in appearance"<ref target="#CH2-92">92</ref> This is not correct. The basic design was
                  faithful to the plans of <persName>Brunel</persName> in its number of stories and windows. The pilasters must have existed at one time,
                  because they are depicted in the <persName>Tisdale</persName> engraving and independently confirmed by the <persName>Milbourne</persName> painting. The plainness remembered by <persName>Ireland</persName> in the 1850s was probably the result of a
                  remodelling done before 1806.</p>
               <p>The Theatre had a huge seating capacity—about 2,000. After the theater was remodelled and reopened in 1807, the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>New-York</placeName> Evening Post</hi> gave the suspiciously accurate figure of 2,372.<ref target="#CH2-93">93</ref> This is
                  about the size of Avery Fisher Hall. The audience in the pit and the gallery did not sit in individual chairs at this period, but rather on
                  backless benches; anyone who has sat in the <persName>Sheldonian Theatre</persName> in <persName>Oxford</persName> will have a good
                  idea of the seating arrangements of a seventeenth and eighteenth century theater.<ref target="#CH2-94">94</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The audience did not spend the entire evening sitting on these uncomfortable backless benches. The programs were very long by <pb n="39"/>
                  modern standards, with two plays an evening, lasting from 6:30 or 7 until 10:30 at night; the texts of the plays were often cut in a quite
                  arbitrary fashion. The lights were not turned out in the auditorium (the Park was only lit by gas after 1827) and the audience could and did
                  wander about, only returning for the great set pieces. Italian opera in this period took account of this foible, including <hi rend="italic">arie di sorbetto</hi>, during which the audience could go out for ice cream.</p>
               <p>It was very difficult to fill this huge theater; the total population of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> City (<placeName corresp="#geonames_5125771">Manhattan</placeName> only) in 1800 was 60.489,<ref target="#CH2-95">95</ref>
                  which meant the theater could contain 3.3% of the population of the city. In other words, if the theater staged one play for over a month to
                  packed houses, every man, woman and child in the city would have seen it. For a time <persName>William Dunlap</persName> had some success
                  with his translations of the German playwright (and Russian agent) <persName>August von Kotzebue</persName>, but <persName>Dunlap</persName> ended a bankrup.<ref target="#CH2-96">96</ref>
                  <persName>Stephen Price</persName>, who eventually succeeded <persName>Dunlap</persName>, filled the theater by resorting to the
                  blockbuster, the star system, importing big names from Europe such as <persName>George F. Cooke</persName> (November 1810) and <persName>Edmund Kean</persName> (1820). In 1811, <persName>Cooke</persName> appeared as <persName>Lear</persName> at the <persName>Park Theatre</persName>, opposite <persName>John Howard Payne</persName> as Edgar.<ref target="#CH2-97">97</ref> At a very
                  early date in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City the inhabitants were seeing world class actors.
                  Both <persName>Cooke</persName> and <persName>Kean</persName> were over the hill when they came to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, having abused alcohol for far too long, but they gave some brilliant performances.
                     <persName>Odell</persName> has criticized <persName>Price</persName> for this, saying that the star system destroyed healthy
                  stock companies in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, but it seems unlikely that <persName>Price</persName> could have filled his theater otherwise. The size of the theater dictated what he had to show.</p>
               <p>The one event at the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> which I would have liked to see was the first <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> performance of <persName>Mozart's</persName>
                  <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni</hi> on May 23, 1826, with <persName>Manuel Garcia's company</persName>, including <persName>Maria Malibran</persName> in the role of <persName>Zerlina</persName>. What made this performance remarkable is that it was done at the
                  urging and in the presence of the librettist, <persName>Lorenzo Da Ponte</persName>, who, having proven himself too disreputable for
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_2761367">Vienna</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, had to live out his final years in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City.<ref target="#CH2-98">98</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The bustle around the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> at nighttime was a great annoyance to the neighbors, who complained about parking
                  problems. On December 18, 1815, the neighbors to the theater complained to the Common Council about the hackney carriages parked on their
                  streets when plays were on at the <persName>Park Theatre</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-99">99</ref>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Astor's</persName> purchase in 1806 was dictated more by his love of the theater than his sense of profit; in fact, it was an
                  unusual departure from his normal method of property investment, which was to buy <pb n="40"/> vacant lots. It is said of Astor that he
                  "seldom missed a good performance in the palmy days of the 'Old Park'," and even on the evening he learned that his ship the <hi rend="italic">Tonquin</hi> had been lost, he still went to the theater, not wishing to abandon his favorite evening's amusement. <persName>Thomas A. Cooper</persName>, an actor whose best part was <persName>Macbeth</persName>, leased the theater from <persName>Astor</persName> for $2,100 quarterly, which he found difficult to pay, so that his surety, <persName>Stephen Price</persName>, was often
                  called to make up the deficiency. In September 1814, <persName>Price</persName> told <persName>Astor</persName> that he would have
                  to give up the theater unless the rent was reduced, arguing that he could get out of his lease because of the War of 1812. <persName>Astor</persName> refused to consider it.<ref target="#CH2-100">100</ref>
               </p>
               <p>Fire is always a danger in theaters, and the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> was attacked by several fires. The Common Council was
                  aware of this danger, and in 1803, established Fire Engine House Number 4 in a room at the northeast corner of the theater, depositing 30
                  buckets there.<ref target="#CH2-101">101</ref> At one in the morning on May 25, 1820, a disastrous fire burned the First <persName>Park Theatre</persName> to the ground, and was thus described in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>New-York</placeName> Evening Post</hi>: <q>Fire—Just before one o'clock this morning, our inhabitants were alarmed by the
                     dreadful cry of fire, and it was soon apparent, from the tremendous glare of light that reached to the most remote parts of the city, that
                     it proceeded from some building of uncommon size; which proved to be the Theatre. No effort could check its progress, nor was it possible
                     to do any thing more than stand by, and witness the complete destruction of the building, and almost every thing it contained. After all
                     the enquiries that have been made it is impossible to tell precisely the manner in which it originated. It has, however, been
                     satisfactorily ascertained, that the first appearance of the fire was near the ridge of the southeast corner of the roof, and it could not,
                     therefore, have arisen from any fireworks employed in the course of the entertainments of the early part of the evening, as has been, by
                     some, erroneously supposed. Nor is there the least grounds to suppose that it was designedly set on fire, but it must have been owing to
                     accident or negligence.</q>
                  <q>The person, whose constant business it has been for some years, to see every thing is safe, by going about the house from top to bottom,
                     after everyone has departed, once before and once after every light is extinguished, had performed that duty last night, as usual, and lain
                     down on his bed in his clothes, from which he was rous- <pb n="41"/> ed by the crackling of the fire, and looking up saw the blaze just
                     making its appearance at the place we have mentioned.</q>
                  <q>We learn that there was no insurance on the building, and but a partial one on the scenery or other property. The most distressing loss
                     falls upon individuals connected with the establishment, whose number we understand to be not less than 200 persons, including mechanics
                     and laborers.<ref target="#CH2-102">102</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>John Jacob Astor</persName> at once had the theater rebuilt. This altruistic gesture failed to impress at least one of the wits
                  of the town, who wrote in the <hi rend="italic">

               <p>This, which is known as the Second <persName>Park Theatre</persName>, continued to resemble <persName>Brunel's</persName> design,
                  for the number of windows, of stories, and the portico all remained the same. The superficial appearance was different because of the change
                  in architectural taste: the tops of the windows and porticos were square, rather than round. The statue of <persName>Shakespeare</persName> remained.<ref target="#CH2-104">104</ref>
               </p>
               <p>After the fire of 1820, <persName>Price</persName> sponsored the appearance of <persName>Edmund Kean</persName> in a theater on
                     <persName>Anthony Street</persName>, and was so successful that in January 1821, he threatened <persName>Astor</persName> and
                     <persName>Beekman</persName> that he would build his own theater unless they complied with his proposals for the reconstruction of the
                  Park. In May 1821, however, <persName>Price</persName> signed a lease of the Second <persName>Park Theatre</persName> at a rent of $
                  13,000 a year. <persName>Henry Brevoort</persName>, <persName>Astor's</persName> nephew, remarked, "The Theatre will be beautiful,
                  but I fear it will never support such an enormous rent charge." But these fears were unfounded: in 1823 the <persName>Park
                     Theatre</persName> was assessed at $80,000, and on September 1, 1828, it was leased to <persName>Edmund Simpson</persName> for seven years
                  at an annual rental of $ 16,000; the theater was then estimated to be worth $150,000. The theater was totally remodelled in 1834, after which
                  it was valued at $200,000. In 1846, however, one of its owners valued it at only $60,000, although this may have been a low estimate for tax
                     purposes.<ref target="#CH2-105">105</ref>
                  <persName>Astor</persName> himself died on March 29, 1848, and he left much of his fortune to establish <pb n="42"/> the library which
                  eventually became the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Public Library. <persName>Simpson</persName> remained the manager until his death on July 31, 1848, after which the theater was leased to <persName>Thomas S.
                     Hamblin</persName>, who had formerly leased the <persName>Bowery Theatre</persName>. But the Second <persName>Park Theatre</persName>
                  burned to the ground in the early evening of Saturday, December 16,1848. The journalist from the <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>New-York Evening Post</persName>
                  </hi> really appreciated a good fire, writing <q>At a quarter past six o'clock the scene which was presented to the hundred thousand citizens
                     congregated in the Park, and the one hundred thousand on the tops of the buildings throughout the city, was one of the grandest
                     conceivable; the flames leaped and frolicked to the height of at least three hundred feet from the ground and giving forth a light which
                     enabled persons at the distance of a mile to read the finest manuscript. The sublimity of the scene was now much increased by the gloomy
                     darkness of the night.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The building this time was insured for $80,000. Unfortunately, there was a loss of life in this fire: a fireman named <persName>Anderson</persName> from <persName>Hose Co.</persName> No. 33 was struck by a piece of burning timber, and killed. The firemen were given
                  refreshments of meat and coffee and tea in the <persName>Astor House</persName> and at the <persName>"Shakespeare"</persName> on
                  Park Row. There was a rumor that <persName>William B. Astor</persName> would not rebuild the theater, but erect an extensive hotel on the
                  site, which rumor had begun after the death of <persName>Simpson</persName>. This rumor turned out to be true, in part; the <persName>Astor Estate</persName> did not rebuild the theater, but they did not build a hotel, either, preferring to sell their interest in
                  the lots.<ref target="#CH2-106">106</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The <persName>Astors</persName> had been remarkably indulgent landlords. In the summer of 1832, a terrible cholera epidemic raged through
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, and the theater was temporarily closed. Three consecutive
                  rent checks of <persName>Edmund Simpson</persName> bounced as a result, but <persName>William B.</persName> (son of <persName>John Jacob</persName>) decided to overlook the problem, and wrote to the partner <persName>John K. Beekman</persName> on
                  August 4, 1832: <q>I have received your favor of the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ulto: And will take an early opportunity to get the alteration
                     in the policies of the Theatre made. —Since I wrote you <persName>Mr. Simpson's</persName> check for rent has been returned as unpaid
                     and we have also a second check from him which is unpaid, but which he says he will make good in a day or two: To day we shall receive
                     another check so that unless he makes good the checks we already have in the course of this day we shall have three unpaid. I presume you
                     are <pb n="43"/>
                     <persName>willing</persName> under the present distressed state of the city to indulge him. Indeed to urge him at present would be I
                     am sure of no avail. I deposit to day the $1000 to your credit in the Bank of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                        City</placeName>. My father has bought Coster's lot.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <persName>Astor Estate</persName> chose not to rebuild the theater again, and split up the lots, so the three lots (Section 1, block
                  90, lots 6, 7 and 8) which were occupied by the First and Second Park Theatres are now occupied by two different buildings. The <persName>Astor Estate</persName> sold most of their interest in the block around 1850, but they continued to have some involvement into the
                  twentieth century. Later theaters were established on Park Row, but they tended to be cinemas, not legitimate theaters. One such cinema was
                  the Park Row Theatre at 923 Park Row. In May 1937, the Park Row Theatre was showing <persName>Kay Francis</persName> as <persName>Florence Nightingale</persName> in "The White Angel," with the enticing advertising motto, "She spurned one man's arms...to

               <p>The most adventurous fate remained for lot 6. On January 17, 1908, there is a deed recording a grant from the Park Row Realty Company to <persName>Nathaniel M. Rothschild</persName>, <persName>Alfred C. de Rothschild</persName> and <persName>Leopold de
                     Rothschild</persName> of lots 4-6, 22 1/2, and 25. On July 10, 1909, the same parties engaged in the same transaction, only in the reverse
                     direction.<ref target="#CH2-109">109</ref> We have not examined these deeds in detail, but it is possible that the involvement of the
                  Rothschilds is related to the construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which was financed by the <persName>Rothschilds'</persName>

                  <persName>Belmont</persName> served as chairman of the board of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and of the Rapid Transit Subway
                  Construction Company.<ref target="#CH2-110">110</ref> The IRT would have been hurt by the Panic of 1907, and it is possible that these
                  property transfers are an emergency injection of funds by the Rothschilds into a property subsidiary of the IRT to keep the IRT alive. Some of
                  the sub-basements on Park Row, which are now closed off, extend all the way to the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station of the east side
                     IRT,<ref target="#CH2-111">111</ref> so it is possible that the IRT planned to extend its stations or tracks eastward to Park Row. The lots
                  on Park Row are currently occupied by branches of J&amp;R, the retailers of computers and other electronic equipment.</p>
               <p>Although the First and Second Park Theatres have long disappeared, their site is still remembered by the name of the street which runs between
                     <persName>Ann Street</persName> and <persName>Beekman Street</persName>: Theatre Alley. (Unsurprisingly, the two other streets
                  commemorate earlier property owners, <persName>Ann White</persName> and <persName>John K. Beekman</persName>.) This street appears
                  on a map drawn in 1796 and published in 1797, but is then called "The <pb n="44"/> Mews."<ref target="#CH2-112">112</ref> (This map also shows
                  the New Theatre and the Old Theatre.) We know that plans were already afoot to change its name, because the indenture of February 6, 1795,
                  between <persName>Ann White</persName> and <persName>William Dickson</persName> refers to "Theatre Lane."<ref target="#CH2-113">113</ref> On a map of 1808, published by <persName>David Longworth</persName>, its name is "Theatre Alley," which is what it has been

                     of copper money and dealers to a great extent, yet scarce an instance can be adduced of their having any concern in the coinage or in the
                     colouring of base silver: neither are they extensive dealers in any other base money but coppr.<ref target="#CH2-118">118</ref>

                  of tokens, which were sold from their shop at 123, High Holborn, but made at their works at 15, Coppice Row, Clerkenwell.<ref target="#CH2-119">119</ref>

                  <persName>Waters</persName> suggested in 1954 that the Theatre at <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                     City</placeName> token, because, unlike so many other <persName>Conder</persName> tokens, its reverse is found muled with nothing else, was
                  issued for commercial purposes made up at the order of the theaer.<ref target="#CH2-120">120</ref>
                  <persName>Don Taxay</persName> suggested it was used as an admission ticket, similar to the <persName>Rickett's Circus</persName>
                     piece.<ref target="#CH2-121">121</ref> This is not possible, however. We know from contemporary newspaper advertisements (which I have
                  quoted above) that there were three prices to sit in the theater: 8 shillings (one dollar) to sit in the boxes; 6 shillings (75 cents) to sit
                  in the pit (orchestra); and 4 shillings (50 cents) to sit in the gallery (balcony). An admission ticket would have to have a method of
                  distinguishing these three Price ranges, and the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Theatre token has no
                  such distinction. The token also lacks a date, which would be essential if it were given to subscribers who rented their boxes by the season.
                  The earliest documentation of certificates in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City for places in
                  boxes (in this case, for the <persName>John Street Theatre</persName>) found by <persName>Dunlap</persName> was in the summer of
                  1786, when the following notice appeared: <q>Theatre. The public are respectfully informed, that on account of a number of complaints relative
                     to unfair preference in boxes, many of which have been lately taken without being occupied, the managers, ever ready to show their
                     attention to the accommodation of their friends and patrons, have adopted a mode to prevent any similar infringement in future by having
                     tickets for the night, which will be delivered by the box-keeper, on payment, to the gentlemen taking boxes, with the number of places
                     particularized; a measure which they flatter <pb n="46"/> themselves will meet with general approbation. <persName>Hallam</persName>
                     and <persName>Henry</persName>.<ref target="#CH2-122">122</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>All these tickets were of paper. By 1826, it seems that someone who wished to sit in a box at the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> would
                  go to the box office and put his name down on a written list. <persName>Lorenzo Da Ponte</persName> writes, <q>I went to the theatre in
                     the forenoon and found his name written in the usual list of allocations, and, there being room for me also in the same box, I had my name
                     registered there at once. He was already in his chair when I arrived. I seated myself at his side.<ref target="#CH2-123">123</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This indicates that the theatergoer would sign up for a box, but would not be assigned a specific seat within that box.</p>
               <p>We should keep in mind, however, that the distinction between "coins struck for collectors" and "coins struck for circulation," although a
                  real enough distinction today, did not truly exist at the end of the eighteenth century. Consider the <persName>Talbot</persName>, <persName>Allum</persName> and <persName>Lee</persName> tokens, which most assuredly were made for circulation, and even served as the
                  stock for half cents and a few large cents. Although they were struck for circulation, numerous wild mulings of their dies exist, including
                  one with the prison reformer <persName>John Howard</persName>. So this token, originally struck for circulation, then becomes a muling
                  made for collectors. Yet this very muling is also known with a countermark of <persName>John</persName> the Baptist for circulation on
                  the Island of Malta.<ref target="#CH2-124">124</ref> The way the <persName>Talbot</persName>, <persName>Allum</persName> and <persName>Lee</persName> tokens fluidly move between "struck for circulation" and "struck for collectors" and then "struck for circulation"
                  again shows that this is not the hard and fast distinction it is today, when it is nearly impossible to spend the Marshall Islands "coins."
                     <persName>Benjamin Jacob</persName> and <persName>Peter Skidmore struck</persName> tokens neither for circulation nor for
                  collectors, but solely to make money, and they would sell into whatever market was attractive at the time. They may have thought that they
                  could get some <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> order by making up tokens depicting the theater. After
                  all, <persName>Peter Kempson &amp; Co</persName>. had obtained an order from <persName>Talbot</persName>, <persName>Allum</persName> and <persName>Lee</persName> for two tons of cents and <persName>Obadiah Westwood</persName> was trying to obtain a
                     <placeName>United States</placeName> coinage contract.<ref target="#CH2-125">125</ref> If the speculation failed, and they could not
                  sell it to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, they knew they certainly could sell the tokens in the local
                  collectors' market. British collectors at this time loved anything American; there was a great cult of Washington. This was partly because of
                  the horrors of the French revolution, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> provided a good example that <persName>Anglophones</persName> knew how to conduct revolution in a civilized fashion, <pb n="47"/> as opposed to the excitable Latins.
                  This intense love affair was ended by the War of 1812. In the 1790s, however, anything "American" met with a ready sale.</p>

               <p>There are five more numismatic items associated with the <persName>Park Theatre</persName>. The first three are the three varieties of
                  the enigmatic ADMIT and PAID tokens of 1817 (<ref target="#fig-22">figs. 10</ref>-<ref target="#fig-23">11</ref>). The earliest description of
                  the ADMIT token which we have found is in <persName>William E. Woodward's</persName> auction of the <persName>John F.
                     McCoy</persName> collection on May 17-21, 1864, lot 2294, which reads, "<persName>Park Theatre</persName> check, Admit,' 1817, copper,
                  rare" and was sold to <persName>Hoffman</persName> for 40 cents.<ref target="#CH2-126">126</ref> The next listing I have found is in the
                  list of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> state storecards, which was published in <hi rend="italic">The Coin Collector's Journal</hi> of March 1885. This listing, possibly by <persName>Lyman H. Low</persName>, says: "This token is
                  generally believed to be an admission ticket to the old <persName>Park Theatre</persName>, Park Row, <placeName>N.Y.</placeName> We
                  have been able to obtain no information either for or against this attribution."<ref target="#CH2-127">127</ref> The PAID token was not
                  listed. <persName>Lyman H. Low</persName> sold three pieces in his auction of the collection of <persName>Benjamin Betts</persName>
                  (brother of <persName>Charles W. Betts</persName>), on January 11-12, 1898: two varieties of the ADMIT token, and one example of the PAID
                  token. The lot realized 40 cents, being sold to <persName>Daniel Parish</persName>, Jr., who then donated the pieces to the ANS
                  (accession number 1898.4). Low wrote of the tokens, "Unquestionably <persName>Park Theatre</persName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, about 1820-24, notwithstanding other places of amusement in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> as well as the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> have been credited
                  with it."<ref target="#CH2-128">128</ref> Low did not give any reason for his attribution other than his personal statement. One thing wrong
                  with his statement is the date: the token bears the date 1817, and the First <persName>Park Theatre</persName> burned down on May 25,
                  1820, so his later date for the use of the token is unlikely. Assuming the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> attribution is correct, we
                  should re-date the token to 1817-20. <persName>William E. Woodward</persName> may be close enough in time, however, so that his
                  attribution to the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> should be given some weight.</p>

               <p>There is no mention of these tokens by the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City theater historian
                  George Odell, but he is usually concerned with plays and <pb n="48"/> cast lists. The <persName>Park Theatre</persName> ran an
                  advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName>New-York</placeName> Evening Post</hi> every night it had a performance, and in the advertisement of September 18, 1817, a
                  new phrase is added: "Ladies and Gentlemen are requested to purchase their tickets at the Box-office, as the Door Keepers are strictly
                  forbidden to receive money at the door."<ref target="#CH2-129">129</ref> This phrase does not show up earlier in the year, and it appears in
                  every advertisement afterward for the next several weeks. It may indicate when the system of "ADMIT" and "PAID" tokens was introduced, perhaps
                  because one of the doorkeepers was taking in cash and embezzling the funds. This is only conjecture, however.</p>
               <p>The ADMIT token, but not PAID, was listed by <persName>Wright</persName> in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> in January 1898.<ref target="#CH2-130">130</ref>
                  <persName corresp="#numismatics_adams_edgar">Edgar H. Adams</persName> also listed the ADMIT token, but not the PAID token
                     (Adams.NY.41).<ref target="#CH2-131">131</ref> The earliest photograph of these tokens which I have found is in <persName>Wayte
                     Raymond's</persName> article on early <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> store cards in the <hi rend="italic">Coin Collector's Journal</hi> of June 1934, which showed both the ADMIT and the PAID tokens.<ref target="#CH2-132">132</ref>
                  The tokens were also discussed by <persName>Melvin</persName> and <persName>George Fuld</persName> on their "Token Collector's Page"
                  in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> of April 1961,<ref target="#CH2-133">133</ref> were listed in <persName>Donald
                     Miller's</persName> 1962 catalogue of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> tokens<ref target="#CH2-134">134</ref> and
                  since then have been taken up into <persName>Rulau's</persName> token catalogues.<ref target="#CH2-135">135</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The Betts catalogue included (but did not depict or describe in any detail) two varieties of the ADMIT token. (The lot sold to <persName>Daniel Parish, Jr.</persName> and donated to the ANS.) An examination of the specimens in the ANS collection and a comparison of
                  the photographs in <persName>Raymond</persName> and <persName>Fuld's</persName> listings distinguishes these two varieties. The
                  first variety (visible in the <persName>Raymond</persName> photograph of June 1934) is from the same punch set as that used to make the
                  PAID token, with small letters with large serifs; the ADMIT does not touch the oval of pearls. The second variety, which is the one in the
                  Fuld photograph (and which is shown in <ref target="#fig-22">fig. 10</ref>), is from a different punch set: the punches are large letters,
                  small serifs on the 1s of the date, the 7 is larger than the 1s; this variety may easily be distinguished because the T and the A of ADMIT
                  touch the oval of pearls. I have not noticed any die links among the tokens, and so far have noticed two varieties for ADMIT, made from two
                  pairs of dies, and one variety for PAID, struck from one pair of dies. The reverse die for PAID is easily distinguishable because of a large
                  die defect in the oval of pearls above the 7 of 1817.</p>
               <p>Presumably the theater first had the ADMIT and PAID tokens made up, and then they ran out of ADMIT tokens, so they put in another order, and
                  the manufacturer used a different punch set from the <pb n="49"/> first order. The tokens are not rare, and since we have a good idea of how
                  many would have been struck to begin with (two thousand PAID, based on a sold-out theater), that is not surprising. I am more than willing to
                  believe that these tokens were issued by the <persName>Park Theatre</persName>, but there is only <persName>Woodward's</persName>
                  and <persName>Low's</persName> authority for this.</p>
               <p>Another numismatic item is associated with the Second <persName>Park Theatre</persName> and should be more straightforward. This is a
                  1799 dollar (variety <persName>Bolender</persName>.16, <persName>Bowers-Borckardt</persName>.158; the photographs are not good
                  enough to die state accurately, but it might be die state II), formerly in the <persName>Maurice M. Gould</persName> collection, which
                  has engraved upon its obverse, <persName>Seymour Harris</persName> / <persName>Park Theatre</persName> / No. / N - Y / August 9th,
                  1834 and engraved upon the reverse WR (catalogued by Rulau; Rulau-E-<placeName>NY</placeName>-42).<ref target="#CH2-136">136</ref> It is
                  holed at about 9 o'clock on the obverse, so that it may be worn with the script letters reading correctly, although this tilts the bust of
                  Liberty so she faces downward. One would think it would be the name of a leading actor at a benefit at the theater; but there is no <persName>Seymour Harris</persName> listed among the cast lists for the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> which have come down to us.
                  The matter becomes yet more mysterious in that I could find no <persName>Seymour Harris</persName> listed in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City directories from 1832 to 1840. Directories at this period only listed a small
                  fraction of the inhabitants of any city; but if <persName>Seymour Harris</persName> existed, he should be listed in the Federal census;
                  and the indices to the Federal census of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> State for 1830 and 1840 show
                  no <persName>Seymour Harris</persName> either. The matter will have to remain a mystery.</p>

                  <persName>Odell</persName> tells us that the Park at this point was open for its summer season, and was performing <persName>Daniel-François</persName>-Esprit <persName>Auber's</persName> opera <hi rend="italic">Gustave III ou le Bal Masqué</hi>,<ref target="#CH2-137">137</ref> which is perhaps more familiar to the opera goer in the version of Giuseppe Verdi, <hi rend="italic">Un Ballo

                  </hi> for August 11 and August 12, 1834, does not mention anything special happening at the <persName>Park Theatre</persName> on the
                  night of August 9.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this engraved piece was worn by a box attendant at the theater. Similarly engraved and holed pieces were used as tickets and passes in
                     <placeName>Britain</placeName>, but they almost never have an exact date written on them. They also usually indicate which part of the
                  theater the owner is to sit, whether the gallery, the pit, or a box.<ref target="#CH2-139">139</ref> It is thus unlikely, despite its outward
                  resemblance, that this piece served as a ticket or pass to the <persName>Park Theatre</persName>.</p>
               <p>Finally, on the opening of the Second <persName>Park Theatre</persName> in 1821, a gold medal of the value of $50 and the freedom of the
                  Theatre was offered to the best opening address. This contest was won by Charles Sprague of the State Bank, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>.<ref target="#CH2-140">140</ref> We have no idea, however, what the gold medal would have been, and
                  it might well be a common stock award medal with no specific reference to the Theatre.</p>

               <p>An examination of some of <persName>Jacob's</persName> other tokens reveals how he worked. Skidmore had <persName>Jacob</persName>
                  sink the dies for his halfpenny series of London churches and gates. A comparison of the token of <persName>St. Andrew</persName>
                  Undershaft (<persName>Dalton-Hamer</persName>.Middx.596; <ref target="#fig-24">fig. 12</ref>) shows that it is taken from a larger
                  eighteenth century copperplate engraving. This was probably from one of several Histories of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> which were produced in the second half of the eighteenth century.<ref target="#CH2-141">141</ref> The engravings of St.
                  Andrew Undershaft are too close in design to decide whether <persName>Jacob</persName> used <persName>Chamberlain</persName> (1770),
                     <persName>Harrison</persName> (1775) or <persName>Thornton</persName> (1784) (they are all views from the northwest), but the
                  likeliest is <persName>Thornton</persName>. Depicted here is a reproduction from <persName>Harrison</persName> (1775; <ref target="#fig-25">fig. 13</ref>).<ref target="#CH2-142">142</ref>

               </figure>
               <p>The engraving, unfortunately, was rather inaccurate; the steeple of St. Andrew's Undershaft is much narrower and taller than depicted in the
                     engraving;<ref target="#CH2-143">143</ref> and <persName>Jacob</persName> copied these errors. <persName>Jacob</persName>, in
                  short, worked from existing copperplate engravings which depicted buildings; he would simplify these engraving, although he generally followed
                  them more or less faithfully; the accuracy (or lack thereof) of the engraving decides the accuracy of <persName>Jacob's</persName>
                  depiction. There is no indication that <persName>Jacob</persName> ever bothered to examine in person the buildings he depicted on the
                  tokens.</p>
               <p>Regrettably, this reduces the historical importance of these tokens, because they are not independent sources, but depend upon the engravings
                  they copy.<ref target="#CH2-144">144</ref> If the engravings exist —and often they do, although they can be difficult to locate—it is
                  preferable to base our reconstructions of old buildings upon them, rather than upon the tokens, because all the tokens (and <persName>Jacob's</persName> especially) simplify and falsify further the engravings they copy. The tokens can be <pb n="52"/> useful in dating some
                  engravings, however. For example, a token which shows the <persName>Leadenhall</persName> (<persName>Dalton-Hamer</persName>.Middx.
                  104; not by <persName>Jacob</persName>) copies and simplifies an engraving of the <persName>Leadenhall</persName>, which has been
                  dated to "the seventeenth or eighteenth century," which is believed to show the <persName>Leadenhall</persName> as it looked much
                     earlier.<ref target="#CH2-145">145</ref> The style of the lettering of the engraving, however, suggests that it is from the late eighteenth
                  century, and the token which shows the <persName>Leadenhall</persName> says that the Hall was built in 1419 and taken down in 1794. The
                  token strongly suggests that the engraving depicted the <persName>Leadenhall</persName> as it was in the 1790s, just before its
                  destruction.</p>
               <p>Two points are important: first of all, many of the diesinkers for the city-view tokens never went and looked at the buildings they depicted;
                  they copied engravings. Further research in British eighteenth century tokens should be directed toward identifying these engravings.
                  Secondly, coins and tokens in the modern period are only rarely sources in their own right, because often the engravings which they copied
                  survive. If original papyrus drawings of the Colosseum existed, the Colosseum sestertius would be rather less significant. It is a basic
                  principle of the use of sources that one follows the stemma until one can go no further: the earliest manuscript in a particular tradition
                  should be the best (philologists call this principle the <hi rend="italic">eliminatio codicum descriptorum)</hi>.<ref target="#CH2-146">146</ref> Since many of these engravings do survive, I think the task is not to use the tokens alone as sources, but rather to find the
                  engravings which were copied by the tokens, to produce iconographical studies informed by <hi rend="italic">Quellenforscbung</hi>.</p>

                  <p>The earliest edition of a <persName>Raymond</persName> catalogue that I have found which lists the <pb n="54"/> token is that of 1934.
                     Although the catalogue is for 1934, its copyright date is 1933; the ANS copy of the catalogue was donated to the Society on October 23,
                     1933, which gives us a terminus ante quem. The catalogue also includes a photograph of the token. The same photograph was reused for all
                     the later editions of <persName>Raymond's</persName> Standard Catalogue—<persName corresp="#viaf_75915787">Wayte

                  <p>The indenture gives the number as 115. <persName>Dunlap</persName> gives two figures: 130 and 113. <persName>Odell</persName> has
                     suggested, almost certainly correctly, that 130 was a dictation error for 113—$42,700 divided by $375 results in 113 whole subscribers, and
                     86 and 2/3 hundredths of another subscriber. This suggests to me that the correct number was 115 subscribers, and some subscribers were in
                     arrears with their payments; 115 may be easily misread as 113; and 113 then misheard as 130. <persName>Dunlap</persName>, <hi rend="italic">History</hi> (above, n. 25), vol. 2, pp. 8, 10; <persName>Odell</persName> (above, n. 41), p. 4.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Someday I would like to write a large and wide-ranging book on counterstamped large cents. In fact, this book-to-be has been longer in the
                  making than anything I have ever written, for in 1955, when the idea of collecting counterstamped large cents was a fresh subject in my eyes,
                  I first dreamed of writing about the stories behind the coins. In a way, part of this book has been written, in the form of two studies, the
                  monograph, <hi rend="italic">The Strange Career of <persName>Dr. Wilkins</persName>: A Numismatic Study</hi> (1987) and the book-length
                  effort, <hi rend="italic">The Water-ford Water Cure: A Numismatic Inquiry</hi> (1992). In addition, I have written numerous articles on the
                  subject for <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist, Penny-Wise, Coin World</hi>, and other forums in print. Someday, the "big book;" for now, this
                  study outlining features of this interesting numismatic specialty.</p>
               <p>Counterstamps hold their secrets well, and unlike date and mint-mark varieties of regular <placeName>United States</placeName> coins, which
                  are for the most part mentioned in Mint reports and correspondence and otherwise documented, few stamped pieces have left a paper trail.</p>
               <p>It has been left up to numismatic scholars to study the pieces and learn what they can, often in connection with looking through nineteenth
                  century directories, newspapers, and other sources. What one student or writer delineates, another builds upon. <persName>Frank G.
                     Duffield</persName>, <persName>Maurice M. Gould</persName>, <persName>Kenneth L. Hallenbeck</persName>, <persName>Russell
                     Rulau</persName>, and <persName>Dr.Gregory G. Brunk</persName> have each, in that order, taken the work of their predecessors one step
                  forward. Doubtless, another generation of counterstamp enthusiasts will learn much which is presently unknown to us.</p>
               <p>The mystique of such pieces is what makes them so interesting. It is always a thrill to find a name in a directory or other source and match
                  it with a counterstamp seen on a cent. Sometimes I have spent a day, or several days, looking through nineteenth century printed matter
                  without discovering a thing. But this has spurred me to look further. It wouldn't be half as much fun to collect these pieces if everything
                  were known about them. My Waterford Water Cure and <persName>Dr. Wilkins</persName> books, each about one specific issuer of
                  counterstamped cents, each occupied several months of my life; several very enjoyable months, I hasten to add.</p>
               <p>Every numismatic study should have its purpose. I propose that as counterstamped coins have been interesting for me to own and collect, the
                  purpose of this brief study is to share with you the characteristics of various large cent counterstamp types, and give sketches of several
                  representative issuers.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In 1955, I acquired a set of monthly issues of <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> from 1904 to date, and as time out from my high
                     school studies and coin dealing activities permitted, I skimmed each issue, pausing to read articles of interest. Part way through the
                     issues of the year 1947 I encountered in the July number an article, "Counterstamped or Countermarked <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Large Cents," bearing <persName>Maurice M. Gould's</persName> byline.<ref target="CH3-1">1</ref> I read the article word by word, then read it again. By the time I encountered <persName>Gould's</persName> article I had
                     a passing acquaintance with the subject of counterstamps in general, mostly knowledge I had gained from reading <persName>Frank G.
                        Duffield's</persName> serial article on counterstamps which began in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi> in 1919 and continued until
                     1921.</p>
                  <p>Counterstamped large cents seemed to be incredibly fascinating, and I had bought several dozen of them here and there, largely by writing
                     letters to dealers who advertised in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatic Scrap-book Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi>.
                     As part of the search I telephoned <persName>Mr. Gould</persName>, and he responded by sending me a selection of pieces priced on the
                     average of a dollar each. I simply had to have all of the counterstamped large cents I could find!</p>
                  <p>Time went on, and I studied the cents in my own possession and further contemplated the listings in the 1947 <persName>Gould</persName> article. Up to that time very little had been written concerning the counterstampers themselves. Listings were comprised
                     of the inscriptions found on the cents, and little else.</p>
                  <p>I paused to think. Why would someone counterstamp a cent, and how would they do it? In the "how would they do it?" category I realized that
                     a long-ago counterstamper would have had to have possessed a punch or die to do the work. As making a punch or die with a name on it isn't
                     something to be done casually just to mark a large cent or two, there must have been another purpose for creating same. What type of
                     activities during the early nineteenth century-during the large cent era-required the use of a metal punch in the ordinary course of
                     business?</p>
                  <p>Silversmiths! I recognized that certain punches of the hallmark type (with raised letters) that I had seen on large cents were similar in
                     concept to the punches used by silversmiths and jewelers to mark the undersides of spoons, dishes, and other metal ware. I contacted <persName>Maurice M. Gould</persName> and mentioned this connection to him, and he <pb n="68"/> suggested that I investigate further.
                     Apparently, no one had ever thought to investigate this area.</p>
                  <p>I sought and found several guides to silversmiths' marks, and was rewarded by identifying a dozen or more on large cents! As simple as this
                     may seem now, to a generation of numismatists schooled in the history of counerstamps, tokens, and other merchants' pieces, in 1955 it was
                     a revelation. In a follow-up article in <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi>, July 1957, <persName>Gould</persName>, noting that I
                     was a "well-known dealer" (albeit only 18 years old, which he did not mention), credited me with this finding. I was thrilled beyond all
                     measure!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi rend="bold">Several Collections Acquired</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometime around 1957 <persName>Gould</persName> offered me his personal collection of counerstamps, which he had been gathering for
                     over 25 years. I lost no time in acquiring his holding en bloc, paying something like a dollar a coin for the lot. Not long thereafter the
                     collection of counterstamped coins formed over a long period of time by large cent specialist <persName>John Gilbody</persName> was
                     offered to me, and I acquired it as well. By August 1959 my holding of counterstamped cents comprised slightly over 600 pieces, including
                     25 examples of cents counterstamped by silversmiths. As the years passed, I acquired about 1,500 more cents, probably turning down twice
                     this number (pieces stamped with stray letters, etc., which did not fit my requirements).</p>
                  <p>In 1984 I made the acquaintance of <persName>Roy H. Van Ormer</persName>, and in 1985 I made arrangements to purchase his collection
                     of counterstamped cents, which had been quite a few years in the making and which comprised several hundred truly outstanding pieces, plus
                     others of peripheral interest. In 1984 and 1985 I acquired a large number of counterstamps from <persName>John J. Ford,
                     Jr</persName>., who had purchased them years earlier from the collections of <persName>F.C.C. Boyd</persName> and <persName>Hillyer C. Ryder</persName>. In addition, <persName>John</persName> had his own interest in counterstamp, and numerous examples had
                     been acquired here and there since the 1950s, especially during the course of his involvement with the management of the New Netherlands
                     Coin Company.</p>
                  <p>The firm of <persName>Rossa &amp; Tanenbaum</persName> was another source for many pieces during the 1980s, including a collection of
                     cents stamped with eagle motifs and several dozen cents stamped with the mark of <persName>Dr. G.G. Wilkins</persName>.</p>
                  <p>It is always fun to be first on the scene and to acquire an unsorted group of counterstamps. Such an opportunity presented itself in 1989
                     when a hoard of nearly 200 pieces was put up for bids in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. The group, which had
                     never been examined by a specialist <pb n="69"/> in counterstamps, was jumbled together loosely in a box and had been gathered over a long
                     period of years by the late <persName>Don Corrado Romano</persName>, proprietor of the <persName>Worthy Coin Company</persName>
                     in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, which bought coins from the public via printed premium Price guides, à la
                        <persName>B. Max Mehl</persName>. The hoard yielded several silversmiths' stamps and a dozen or so other prime pieces. There were,
                     of course, quite a few coins of lesser interest, including those with stray initials and letters. However, enough scarce varieties existed
                     to make the purchase worthwhile. My purchase was effected by <persName>Miles Coggan</persName> of the <persName>J.J. Teaparty
                        Co</persName>.</p>
                  <p>In 1985, <persName>Dr.Gregory G. Brunk</persName>, associated with the University of Oklahoma, contacted me about my collection of
                     counterstamped large cents. He planned to write a book on all American counterstamps, large cents and all other denominations, and wanted
                     to come to my office to see what I had. Arrangements were concluded, and during that summer <persName>Greg</persName> spent a week in
                     our conference room, examining a couple thousand large cents and taking detailed notes on them while selecting pieces for photography.
                     Released in 1987, <persName>Dr. Brunk's</persName>

               </head>
               <p>Large cents possess a special fascination. I am writing not of counterstamped cents, but of "ordinary" pieces bearing dates from 1793 onward.
                     <persName>Dr. William H. Sheldon</persName>, in <hi rend="italic">Early American Cents</hi>
                  <ref target="CH3-2">2</ref> wrote with authority when he stated that sooner or later the experienced numismatist will turn from other series,
                  even ones containing great rarities, and return to the collecting of humble large cents. Such pieces, according to <persName>Sheldon</persName>, seem to possess an almost living warmth and personality not encountered in any other metal; the big cents are something
                  more than old money; look at a handful of cents dated before 1815, when they contained relatively pure copper, and you see rich shades of
                  green, red, brown, and even deep ebony, together with blendings of these not elsewhere matched in nature, save perhaps in autumn leaves.</p>
               <p>Counterstamped large cents go one step further. The surfaces of early cents, usually worn to begin with, were damaged or enhanced (depending
                  upon your viewpoint!) by being stamped with a person's name, or a silversmith's Hall mark, or a trade slogan.</p>
               <p>Large cents were first minted in 1793 and last coined in 1857. Although counterstamping seems to have occurred from the 1790s onward, it seems
                  likely that most activity took place from about <pb n="70"/> 1830 to 1856. It was not until just a few years ago that I even saw, yet alone
                  owned, a counterstamped large cent dated 1857.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Why Were Cents Counterstamped?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Why did people counterstamp large cents? To begin with, cents were ubiquitous; they were everywhere, at least in the northeastern part of the
                     <placeName>United States</placeName>. Cents did not circulate actively in the American West, nor were they popular in the South, and
                  this is why cents (of the Indian design by this time) were not coined at the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_san_francisco">San Francisco
                     Mint</placeName> until 1908 and not at the <placeName>Denver Mint</placeName> until 1911, and never at the <placeName>Carson
                     City</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> facilities. However, from <placeName>Illinois
                     eastward</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_4971068">Maine</placeName> and south to about <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254928">Virginia</placeName> the Copper cent was the main coin used in everyday transactions involving small amounts of
                  money. Substantial numbers of cents circulated in the southern areas of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>,
                  particularly in <placeName>Ontario</placeName> and <placeName>Quebec</placeName> during the 1850s and 1860s.</p>
               <p>As cents (called large cents by a later generation, after the "small" cent of the Flying Eagle design reached circulation in May 1857)
                  circulated extensively, they were carried into every area of American life, from the White House to the most humble farm dwelling, from Main
                  Street to Wall Street. Equipped with a handful of cents in, say, the year 1830, a traveler could buy a good meal, complete with a glass of
                  beer, stay overnight in a travelers' stop, travel on a turnpike or canal, or gain admittance to a circus. Cents were a vital part of the
                  American scene, of everyday American life.</p>
               <p>Traveling from hand to hand, from village to village, the typical cent saw and did many things. It was but a logical step for a tradesman or
                  firm to realize that an advertisement stamped on a cent would cost virtually nothing to produce, would last a long time, and would be carried
                  far and wide.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Imagine if you will a typical silversmith's shop of the early nineteenth century. On hand were one or several hallmark punches with which to
                  mark spoons, forks, ladles, chafing dishes, porringers, and other wrought items made in the shop or purchased from a manufacturer elsewhere.
                  Such a Hall mark was a symbol of pride, the mark of a quality product. At the same time, cents, usually worn by the passage of time, were
                  received and spent across the counter, and carried in the workers' pockets when they bought lunch or stabled their horses. To advertise the
                  business it took but a moment to take a copper cent, place it face upward on a firm, level surface, posi- <pb n="71"/> tion the hallmark punch
                  carefully, and whack it with a hammer. Spent a few minutes, hours, or days later, the cent was on its way to spread the word, just as leaves
                  falling in a stream are carried downstream to the sea.</p>
               <p>That silversmiths did such is evidenced by the many counterstamped cents known today, the vast majority of which show the hallmark punches
                  carefully positioned on the obverse. The counterstamping was done carefully and with an eye for posterity.</p>

               <q>1. 1831 cent in VF-30 grade, with attractive, pleasing surfaces.</q>
               <q>2. 1831 cent in VG-8 grade, quite worn, but bearing on the obverse a counterstamp reading STONE &amp; BALL / SYRACUSE / <placeName>N.Y.</placeName>, having been so stamped circa 1853-54 by a partnership of jewelers comprised of <persName>Seymour H. Stone</persName> and

               </q>
               <p>How about your choice of these two?</p>
               <q>1. 1802 cent, Good-4 grade, attractive in all respects.</q>
               <q>2. 1802 cent, worn nearly smooth, but counterstamped with this legend: MESCHUTTS / METROPOLITAN / COFFEE ROOM / 433. BdWAY, a souvenir of a
                  long-forgotten restaurant in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City.</q>
               <p>Or, how about picking one of these?</p>
               <q>1. 1841 cent, VF-30 grade, attractive in every way.</q>
               <q>2. 1841 cent, VF-20, counterstamped VOTE THE LAND / FREE, by the Free Soil Party in the election of 1848, when that group contended that <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> should be free from slavery.</q>

                  enthusiastic about them today.</p>
               <p>While the counterstamps just mentioned have been attributed to their issuers, a far greater number remain as mysteries, although year by year
                  more and more marks are identified. Who was the person who stamped <persName>H.S. BURGES</persName> carefully in a horizontal position on
                  the obverses of many large cents? What was the occupation of the individual who stamped the <persName>N.J. TRACY</persName> name on a
                  large number of coins? What type of patent medicine (if it was one) was OIL OF ICE, as advertised on large cents, and what claims were made

               </head>
               <p>Once a stamp has been identified through research in old directories and newspaper, or is evident from the address given on the counterstamp
                  itself, then this question arises: What else can be learned about the counterstamper?</p>
               <p>In my collection I have a well-worn cent of the 1836 era stamped on the obverse with the inscription: WM. GRUMBINE / COACH / MAKER / HANOVER,
                  PA. I know nothing about Grumbine apart from what the cent tells me. I can suppose that the logotype punch used to counterstamp the cent was
                  made for other purposes, perhaps to stamp brass fittings or ornamentation on his coaches, or to mark a maker's nameplate. What a thrill it
                  will be if in some dark barn, or corner of some museum, a coach by Grumbine is found, and it bears this identical mark!</p>
               <p>Such a thing happened to <persName>Roy H. Van Ormer</persName>. He owned a large cent counterstamped with the inscription: <persName>J. YOUS</persName>, otherwise unidentified. Nothing was known about <persName>Yous</persName>, and published numismatic
                  references were of no help. Then <persName>Roy</persName> had a stroke of good fortune: He found the identical stamp on a rifle known to
                  have been made by <persName>Joshua Yous</persName>, who practiced his trade as a gunsmith in <placeName>Greencastle</placeName>, <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> from 1854 to 1861. All of the sudden an ordinary countermark, undistinguished and unidentified, came to
                  life with a history!</p>

               <p>Counterstamps arrange themselves into three main categories. Interestingly, little attention has been paid to these categories by past
                  writers, with the result that a survey of literature on the subject fails to disclose which names were counterstamped with what I call
                  logotype punches and which were made with hall mark punches. The three categories are as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">(1) Logotype punches</hi>: Cents stamped from these punches have the lettering recessed or incuse in the surface. The vast
                  majority of counterstamped cents were created by using logotype punches. A relatively small amount of metal had to be displaced to create a
                  counterstamp of this nature, and the result was that a light blow from a hammer could create a distinctive notation on a coin. The inscription
                  could be quite lengthy, as evidenced by the MESCHUTT'S / METROPOLITAN / COFFEE ROOM / 433. BdWAY mentioned earlier, and by the once-popular
                  USE / G.G.G. / <hi rend="italic">&amp; /</hi> G.G.G.G.</p>
               <pb n="73"/>
               <p>Logotype punches were used in commerce by many different types of tradesmen, particularly those who worked in harder metals such as steel and
                  brass. The common counterstamp, CAST STEEL, known in many punch variations, was originally used to mark such varied products as carpenters'
                  tools, agricultural implements, and builders' hardware.</p>
               <p>Most logotype punches are of single names, sometimes with the given name or initials, or initials alone, but often with just a surname.
                  Examples of such logotype punches with initials alone include T.J.S. and S.S.K, while counterstamped cents with initials and a surname include
                     <persName>E.C. MARSH</persName>, <persName>J. DODGE</persName>, <persName>C.C. DYER</persName>, <persName>H.
                     REES</persName> (a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> blacksmith who also marked his wares
                  with this stamp), and <persName>E.P. EVERETT</persName>, among thousands of others. In no more than a few percent of known counterstamps
                  is the first name of a counterstamper represented by more than a single initial. Rare exceptions include <persName>WALLACE
                     BARNES</persName> (a Bridgeport, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> maker of clock springs, who used this stamp to mark his output) and WM.
                     <persName>MILLER</persName>, among others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">(2) Hallmark punches</hi>: Cents stamped from these punches have the lettering raised within a small depressed rectangle or
                  other border. It seems that the majority of hallmark punches were originally used by tradesmen who worked in softer metals such as silver,
                  gold, copper, and pewter. These were the punches originally used to mark such wares. Examples include <persName>J. FISHER</persName>
                     (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> city silversmith), Hall &amp; ELTON (<placeName corresp="#geonames_2660646">Geneva</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> silversmiths), and
                  STONE &amp; BALL (<placeName>Syracuse</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> jewelers).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">(3) Design or motif punches</hi>: Cents stamped from these punches show objects such as eagles, dogs, and other motifs,
                  sometimes incorporating lettering as well. Eagles are most often seen and are often from punches originally used to mark guns and other
                  military and sporting goods.</p>

               <p>The lettering found on counterstamps, also a subject which has not been studied earlier, can be divided into several styles:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">(A) All upper case letters</hi>: This is the most often seen style, with all letters in capitals or upper case. Examples

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">(B) Letters in upper and lower case</hi>: This style is much rarer and usually has the initials or first letters of a name
                  in upper case and the rest of the name in lower case. Examples include <persName>T.E. Fisk</persName>, <persName>D.L.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">(C) Italic type</hi>: A few countermarks are known in italic (or slanting) type, which may be in upper case or a combination
                  of upper and lower case. Examples of italic names in upper case include <hi rend="italic">I. <persName>KINSEY</persName>, <persName>E.O. POLLARD</persName>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">(D) Script</hi>: Very few countermarks, these usually being of the hallmark style, are known with the name of the maker
                  expressed in script. An example is the hallmark of J.N. Hall expressed in flowing script within a border.</p>
               <p>It may be that some future student of the series will examine counterstamps carefully, measure the height and width of the inscriptions, and
                  note their general categories, perhaps using an outline such as that just given. A counterstamp of the 2-B style thus would be from a logotype
                  punch and have a mixture of upper case and lower case letters.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Who Did It and Why</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Counterstamps were placed upon large cents for many purposes. Here are some reasons that come to mind:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">1. Advertising</hi>: Seeking to advertise their trade to a wide audience, many different types of businesses stamped cents,
                  making them virtual "little billboards." Patent medicine compounders, hotel owners, jewelers, doctors, restaurateurs, and others marked cents
                  with their names and, occasionally, with their addresses. Some advertisers used punches made expressly for the purpose of counterstamping
                  large cents (and other coins). Such stamps were designed so that the inscriptions fit easily within the boundaries of a cent's surface, and
                  were used so prolifically that it seems that advertising on cents was the primary purpose of creating such a punch. Well-known examples
                  include <persName>DR. G.G. WILKINS</persName> (a <placeName>Pittsfield</placeName>, <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> dentist
                  whose logotype punch features his name in a curved arc, so as to fit conveniently in the field of a cent in front of Miss Liberty's face) and
                     <persName>DEVINS</persName> / &amp; / <persName>BOLTON</persName> / <persName>MONTREAL</persName> (druggists who advertised
                  extensively on Canadian and American copper coins).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">2. Metalsmitbs</hi>: Silversmiths, jewelers, gunsmiths, munitions makers, manufacturers of tools, stencil makers, and others
                  who used logotype or hallmark punches in the ordinary course of business to mark manufactured items often employed these same punches on large
                  cents. While some metalsmiths undoubtedly intended to advertise, probably a larger number of individuals simply marked cents as a whim.
                  Certainly the many known stray stampings of CAST STEEL, often seen on cents, without an accompanying name, indicate that this practice was
                  prevalent. Related are stray stampings <pb n="75"/> of place names such as <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york">New York</placeName>, etc. Motif punches, such as dogs, sunbursts, eagles, deer, etc. were intended for
                  other purposes (such as marking munitions, toys, and other products) but were sometimes impressed upon cents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">3. Political</hi>: A few varieties of counterstamps were issued for political purposes, prominent among these being the Free
                  Soil Party's VOTE THE LAND FREE marking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">4. Commemorative</hi>: The <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>-<persName>Lafayette</persName> counterstamp of 1824, issued to mark the return visit to the <placeName>United States</placeName> of the French hero
                  of the American Revolution, is in this category.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">4. Commerce</hi>: Some cents were stamped for use in commerce, as tokens for drayage or transportation fares, with numbers
                  for use as baggage, key, or claim checks, or with other markings for use as receipts. As these usually lack addresses, they are difficult to
                  identify. Thus, a holed cent marked "E.H. 123" may have been attached to a key for room 123 of the Eagle Hotel, but in the absence of other
                  information, we will never know for sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">5. Revaluation</hi>: Cents exist with counterstamps relating to the West Indies, and the suggestion has been made that these
                  were so stamped to permit American large cents to circulate there at specified values.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">6. Personal:</hi> Some individuals may have expended money to create logotype or hallmark stamps with their names, in order
                  to counterstamp coins, but this scenario is highly unlikely. I mention it here as this category offers a popular explanation for otherwise
                  unknown names. I suggest, however, that otherwise unidentified names on cents were marked by persons who possessed punches for other reasons.
                  In this category are certainly the numerous punches which were too large to completely fit on a cent's surface, so that only a part of the
                  inscription could be transferred. Such punches obviously were made for purposes other than stamping cents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">7. Overstrikes</hi>: Large cents were sometimes used as planchets for tokens and medals or to test dies of these. Certain
                  varieties of Hard Times tokens are known overstruck on large cents, for example, as are certain medals struck by <persName>J.A.
                     Bolen</persName>, <persName>Springfield</persName>, MA diesinker. Several different clothing button designs are known stamped on early
                  cents, possibly to test punches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">8. Whimsy</hi>: Mention should also be made of stray letters, numbers, and other markings sometimes seen on cents, as well
                  as names, memorial inscriptions, etc. stamped on cents one letter at a time for souvenir purposes. As these were not made from prepared
                  multiple-letter logotype or hallmark punches they are more in the category of so-called "love tokens" and are mostly one-of-a-kind.</p>
               <pb n="76"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">9. Fantasies</hi>: In recent decades some enterprising individuals have counterstamped cents with modern punches pertaining
                  to Wells Fargo, Texas, western saloons, etc. to create pieces to sell to collectors. These have little value or interest to the serious
                  numismatist.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">When It Was Done</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Large cents first appeared in circulation in 1793, and it is probable that soon thereafter certain pieces were counterstamped. The practice of
                  counterstamping coins was in vogue by that time, and many foreign coins were marked by silversmiths, goldsmiths, jewelers, and others. Some of
                  these individuals also marked large cents once they became prevalent in American circulation.</p>
               <p>Judging from the dates seen on extant counterstamped cents, and making due allowance for the fact that earlier-dated cents are in general
                  harder to find than later-dated ones, it is still obvious that most counterstamping activity took place after about 1830, with the height of
                  activity probably being in the 1850s.</p>
               <p>Large cents were minted continuously from 1793 to 1857, with the solitary exception of the year 1815. The Act of February 21, 1857, provided
                  for the replacement of the large cent with the new Flying Eagle design. The retirement of earlier-dated cents began immediately. I believe it
                  probable that most counterstamping of large cents ended by early 1857, and as evidence of this I point to the fact that in the course of
                  examining approximately 10,000 counterstamped large cents over the years, I have only encountered one large cent bearing the date 1857! In
                  1857, the public was aware that such coins were to be withdrawn. Thus, there was no point in counterstamping them and passing them along in
                  circulation.</p>
               <p>A survey of 3,348 counterstamped cents was conducted by the author in 1990.<ref target="CH3-3">3</ref> In theory, the number of counterstamps
                  surviving from a particular year should be in proportion to the number of cents struck bearing that year's date, but in practice there are
                  many discrepancies. This would seem to verify that die dating was not strictly observed at the Mint in the early years, and it was common
                  practice to use dies on hand from previous years, until they became worn or broken.</p>
               <p>The following figures may well be of interest to large cent collectors in general. Note, for example, the findings on the rarity of cents
                  dated 1808. The survey of surviving counterstamped cents in this sample yielded the following distribution of dates:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dates in the 1790s</hi>: 1793 (4), 1794 (8), 1795 (12), 1796 (6), 1797 (16), 1798 (34), 1799 (none).</p>
               <p>Commentary: The 1793 cents included two Chain cents and two <pb n="77"/> Wreath cents. Considering the size of the sample, the distribution of
                  the cent dates is about as expected, except for 1793, for which the ratio is higher. The larger number of 1793 cents may be explained by the
                  fact that worn examples with counterstamps, even though they would have been considered "damaged," were saved from circulation by collectors
                  in the cradle days of numismatics in the 1840s and 1850s, when other earlier counterstamps would have been ignored.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dates in the 1800s</hi>: 1800 (18), 1801 (30), 1802 (61), 1803 (101), 1804 (1), 1805 (16), 1806 (19), 1807 (33), 1808 (8),
                  1809 (4).</p>
               <p>Commentary: According to the mintage figures published in the <hi rend="italic">Guide Book of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Coins</hi>, the following quantities were originally coined: 1800: 2,822,175; 1801: 1,362,837; 1802: 3,435,100; 1803:
                  3,131,691; 1804: 96,500; 1805: 941,116; 1806: 348,000; 1807: 829,221; 1808: 1,007,000; and 1809: 222,867. The ratio of surviving counterstamps
                  does not match the published mintage figures, perhaps indicating that the mintage figure for 1806 in particular is too low, for it seems to be
                  more plentiful than 1805. Cents dated 1808 should be about four times more plentiful than those dated 1809, but this is not reflected by the
                  number of surviving pieces. It seems likely that the published mintage for 1808 included cents bearing one or more earlier dates, with 1807
                  being a glaringly obvious candidate. It becomes increasingly apparent that the survival ratio of counterstamped cents may be a guide to
                  original mintages.<ref target="CH3-4">4</ref>

               <p>Commentary: There are no surprises here. There is a nice correlation between the earlier-mentioned 1809, with a mintage of 222,867 and 4
                  surviving counterstamps, and the 1811, of which 218,025 were made, and of which 4 counterstamps were also seen in the sample. Further, unlike
                  surveys that might be made of unmarked cents in collectors' hands, the preceding data are not affected by the survival of thousands of <persName>Randall Hoard</persName> cents (dated 1816-20), as none was counterstamped.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Commentary: More 1821-dated counterstamps exist than the low mintage of 389,000 would seem to imply, suggesting that coins dated 1821 may have
                  been included in the mintage of 1822 or later years. For example, the 1821 (mintage: 389,000 as noted; 28 counterstamps surveyed) and 1825
                  (mintage: 1,461,100; 27 counterstamps surveyed) do not square with each other. Additional comparisons could be given.</p>

               <p>Commentary: The ratios of surviving counterstamps and the original mintage figures seem to be fairly consistent, except for the dramatic
                  rarity of 1857 cents, of which the author has only seen a single example. The rarity of the 1857 may be explained by two factors: (1) Most of
                  the 333,456 reported minted may never have been released, and (2) By early 1857 the public was aware that oldstyle "large" cents would soon be
                  a thing of the past, and there was no longer any point in counterstamping them for advertising or publicity purposes.</p>
               <p>The number of known early-dated counterstamps cannot be directly compared to the number of known later-dated examples, as the longer a cent
                  remained in circulation, the more opportunities it had to be counterstamped. Thus a cent dated early in the 1800s had been in circulation for
                  many decades by the 1850s and had been subjected to many opportunities to be stamped. On the other hand, if we are to assume that widespread
                  counterstamping of large cents diminished sharply after 1856, then a cent dated 1851, for example, would have had just five years of
                  opportunity for stamping by that time.</p>
               <p>There are, however, exceptions to the preceding, and among them are the two most prolific counterstamps in North America. The stamp of <persName>Dr. G.G. Wilkins</persName>, of Pittsfield, New Hampshire, is believed to have been applied mostly from about 1857 through the
                  early 1860s, using earlier-dated large cents, and the stamp of <persName>Devins</persName> &amp; <persName>Bolton</persName>, <persName>Montreal</persName> druggists, was primarily applied in the 1860s, during which time there was an abundant supply of <placeName>United States</placeName> large cents in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>.</p>

                  <persName>Dr. G.G. Wilkins</persName> created two stamps with his name, <persName>DR. G.G. WILKINS</persName>, curved in an arc to
                  match the space on the obverse field of a large cent just in front of Miss Liberty's face, and in that location he applied the vast majority
                  of his counterstamps. VOTE THE LAND / FREE was created on a stamp to fit nicely on the surface of a large cent, as were several other
                  advertising or political punches.</p>
               <p>It was the practice of many silversmiths to place their punch carefully on the obverse of a cent, right on the head of Miss Liberty, because
                  this was the thickest part of the coin and thus was the best area to receive the deeply impressed hallmark. Also, in this position the
                  hallmark could be better seen by subsequent owners of the <pb n="80"/> cent.</p>
               <p>The stamps of <persName>H.S. BURGES</persName> and <persName>B. PARKER</persName> usually were placed in a horizontal position on
                  the obverse of cents, although <persName>Burges</persName> was less careful and often placed some of his diagonally. Each was a fairly
                  wide logotype punch, and care had to be taken so that the complete punch would be placed across the cent. The <persName>H.
                     REES</persName> counterstamp applied by <persName>Henry Rees</persName>, a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> blacksmith, was nearly always situated on the obverse of a cent at the top of Miss Liberty's head.</p>

               <p>It is a dangerous practice to call anything "first," for the moment such reaches print, someone discovers something to antedate it. However,
                  it is certainly correct to state that <persName>Edouard Frossard's</persName> October 6, 1892 catalogue of the Collection of <persName>Joseph Hooper</persName>, Esq., Part II and Addenda, contained one of the most extensive listings of counterstamped large cents to
                  appear in a sale catalogue up to that date.<ref target="CH3-6">6</ref>

               <p>
                  <persName>Frossard</persName>, born in <placeName>Switzerland</placeName> in 1837, came to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in 1858, and by 1872 was a member of the numismatic collecting fraternity.<ref target="CH3-7">7</ref> In 1876 he became editor of the <hi rend="italic">Coin Collector's Journal</hi>, published by <persName>J.W. Scott</persName>
                  Stamp &amp; Coin Co. In 1877 his own house organ, <hi rend="italic">Numisma</hi>, made its debut and quickly became a point of controversy and
                  discussion, as Frossard gave his unvarnished views of his competition and the contemporary numismatic scene, all of this in a day before libel
                  suits were in vogue. His first auction sale, bearing the date of September 6, 1878, inaugurated a series which would eventually comprise 175
                  such events, including 15 conducted by his son after <persName>Frossard's</persName> death in 1899. <persName>Frossard</persName> is
                  remembered today as a leading scholar of his era, particularly in the field of <placeName>United States</placeName> large cents, and as a
                  competent catalogue. By 1892, when the two <persName>Hooper</persName> sales were conducted, <persName>Frossard</persName> was among
                  the leaders in the numismatic profession and was widely respected.</p>
               <p>His consignor, <persName>Joseph Hooper</persName>, a prominent numismatist of his era, lived in <placeName>Port Hope,
                     Ontario</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, and was a frequent contributor to <hi rend="italic">The
                     Numismatist</hi>, his "Hooper's Restrikes' column attracting especial attention. He later served as President of the American Numismatic
                  Association from 1898 until he was succeeded by <persName>Dr.Benjamin P. Wright</persName>, a prominent collector of tokens, in 1901.
                  Like many other collectors of his era, <persName>Hooper's</persName> interests were eclectic.</p>
               <pb n="81"/>
               <p>The title page of the auction catalogue in question, Part II of the <persName>Hooper</persName> Collection sold as <persName>Frossard's</persName> 113th sale on October 6, 1892, reflected the diversity of the consignor's numismatic interests and noted that the sale
                  comprised: <q>Coins and medals of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName>, gold, silver and bronze coins of ancient <placeName corresp="#nomisma_greece">Greece</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_rome">Rome</placeName>; silver coins of <placeName>Brunswick</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_3164603">Venice</placeName>, and other countries; foreign copper coins;
                     English war medals; tradesmen's penny and halfpenny tokens; American and foreign medals and tokens; <persName>Bolen's</persName>
                     medallic issues; <placeName>United States</placeName> dollars, cents, half cents; rare colonial coins; gold coins of <persName>Ferdinand</persName> and <persName>Isabella</persName>; <persName>Vernon</persName> medals; numismatic works; coin cabinets.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The sale of 502 lots, stated to be "without reserve," was conducted by Messrs. <persName>George A. Leavitt</persName> &amp; Co.,
                  auctioneers with premises at 787 and 789 Broadway, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City, at 2:00 in
                  the afternoon of Thursday, October 6, 1892. Lots could be examined by prospective bidders on the day of the sale from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the
                  Leavitt Art Gallery. It was the custom of the time for a professional numismatist, such as <persName>Frossard</persName>, to prepare the
                  sale catalogue, and for the auction itself to be held by a separate auction gallery.</p>
               <p>The group of counterstamped cents was described as follows: <q>[Lot No.] 416. <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName>

                     collectors of American tokens and coins of the <persName>Jacksonian</persName> period. No duplicates, struck on very fair to fine
                     Cents and two half Cents. 133 pcs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The lot of counterstamped pieces realized five cents per coin, for a total of $6.65, a Price consistent with the valuation of unmarked cents
                  of the period. In other words, the counterstamping neither added to nor detracted from the value. In the same sale four die varieties of
                  unmarked 1826 cents, Good and Very Good grades, fetched five cents each, as did three examples of non-stamped 1837 cents, each Very Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Frossard</persName> was somewhat careless in his cataloguing, or perhaps in the proofreading of what he had written, for "<persName>J.F. McKenny</persName>" should have been <persName>J.F. McKenney</persName>, "<persName>E.C. March</persName>" was
                  really <persName>E.C. Marsh</persName>, "<persName>A.D. Sweetser</persName>" was given instead of the correct <persName>A.D. Sweetsir</persName>, and <persName>A.J. Tuttle</persName> was listed incorrectly as "<persName>A.J. Tutle</persName>." Eighty
                  specific counterstamps were enumerated, plus "letters" (Apparently coins stamped with stray letters), two varieties of eagles, a hound, a
                  shield, and the enigmatic "etc." Which counterstamps appeared on the two half cents in the lot was not disclosed.</p>
               <p>What happened to the <persName>Hooper</persName> counterstamps is not known. Perhaps they were retained as a lot and remain today in some
                  dusty corner of an attic, or in a safe deposit box, unnoticed and forgotten. Or, more likely, they were dispersed and exist today in scattered
                  collections of persons other than counterstamp specialists. At least a few of the coins have been forgotten, for they were unknown to
                  Duffield, Gould, Hallenbeck, and Brunk, all of whom were apparently unaware of <persName>Frossard's</persName> catalogue listing. For
                  example, <persName>Brunk</persName> knew of the <persName>YOUNG</persName> / THE / MAGICIAN stamp on an 1841 dime, an 1842 half
                  dollar, and on Spanish-American silver two-real pieces dated 1774 and 1809, but not on a large cent as owned by <persName>Hooper</persName>.</p>

               <p>So far as I am aware, <persName>Maurice M. Gould</persName>, co-owner with <persName>Frank Washburn</persName> of the <persName>Copley</persName> Coin Co. in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, was the only person in the 1950s who
                  made a specialty of collecting counterstamped large cents.<ref target="CH3-10">10</ref> I engaged in far-ranging correspondence with dealers,
                  collectors, and numismatic societies at the time, and no one else ever stepped forward to claim an interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Gould</persName> was more of a casual than an intense collector, but over a period of 25 years he had accumulated several
                  hundred pieces, most as gifts from dealers and collectors who knew of his interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Kenneth Hallenbeck</persName>, who like <persName>Gould</persName> contributed several articles <pb n="84"/> on the

               <p>Both <persName>Gould</persName> and <persName>Hallenbeck</persName> formed collections of several hundred coins or more, and
                  arranged them in order. In the 1980s <persName>Roy Van Ormer</persName> collected hundreds of pieces and was probably the main buyer of
                  counterstamped cents in auctions and mail bid sales during the early part of that decade. <persName>Steve Tanenbaum</persName> formed a
                  date collection of large cents and other coins with the <persName>DR. G.G. WILKINS</persName> imprint. Several collectors, and the museum
                  collection of the <persName>Bank of Canada</persName>, have formed holdings of counterstamped large cents and other coins bearing the

Schilke</persName>, <persName>Jules Reiver</persName>, and <persName>John Gilbody</persName>, among others, collected counterstamped large cents as a
                  sideline but not as their main numismatic interest. A major boost in appreciation for counterstamps occurred in the 1980s when Krause
                  Publications issued <persName>Russell Rulau's</persName> series of Price guides to early American tokens, and listed counterstamped coins
                  among them. The publication of Brunk's <hi rend="italic">American and Canadian Countermarked Coins</hi> in 1987 increased interest even
                  further.</p>
               <p>Several sketches of specific counterstamped large cents are given below, representative of the research that beckons to the interested
                  collector; as will be noted, the G.G.G. and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>-<persName>Lafayette</persName> counterstamps are still in the "to be continued" category.</p>

               </head>
               <p>When I began collecting counterstamped large cents in 1955, among the first items I acquired were several pieces counterstamped with the
                  enigmatic slogan, USE / G.G.G. / &amp; / G.G.G.G. What all of these Gs stood for was anyone's guess. The conjecture of <persName>Maurice M. Gould</persName> was that it was an advertisement for <persName>Goddard's</persName> Great Goose Grease, and that the
                  abbreviated counterstamp sometimes seen, USE / G.G.G., represented <persName>Goddard's</persName> Goose Grease. This contention was
                  repeated by <persName>Russell Rulau</persName> in his book, <hi rend="italic">American Merchants Tokens, 1845-1860</hi>.</p>
               <p>Why anyone would want goose grease is a matter for debate, but <pb n="85"/> in the nineteenth century it was apparently popular, at least in
                  certain quarters. A dictionary-size hardbound catalogue, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>McKesson</persName> &amp; <persName>Robbins'</persName> Prices Current</hi>, 1883, indeed lists non-branded goose
                  grease at the wholesale Price of 75 cents per pound. It seems reasonable that someone named <persName>Goddard</persName> might have sold
                  goose grease just like <persName>McKesson</persName> &amp; <persName>Robbins</persName> did, and implored American citizens to
                  partake of the benefits of the grease by stamping <placeName>United States</placeName> cents with the suggestion "USE / G.G.G."</p>
               <p>Another theory suggested that one of the Gs stood for gonorrhea, and that G.G.G. and its expanded cousin, G.G.G.G., were cures for this
                  unfortunate affliction in the days before penicillin.</p>
               <p>Although cents dated as early as 1798 are known with one or the other of these counterstamps, most cents and other pieces, including silver
                  denominations as small as the three-cent coin, are from the 1840s and 1850s, particularly the 1850s, with the latest known coin being a large
                  cent dated 1857. No Flying Eagle and Indian cents are known with these impressions. It seems probable to me that the counterstamping of "USE /
                  G.G.G.," and "USE / G.G.G. / &amp; / G.G.G.G." inscriptions took place in the decade of the 1850s, until and including 1857, and probably
                  occurred mainly circa 1854-57 using current as well as earlier-dated coins.</p>
               <p>In 1985 when <persName>Brunk</persName> visited my office in connection with the research he was doing for his book on counterstamps (he
                  preferred the word countermarks), among the subjects we discussed was the meaning of G.G.G. and G.G.G.G. Neither of us had any new ideas. In
                  1987 his manuscript was completed, and the printing deadline drew near. It was anticipated that alphabetically under the "G" category in the
                     <persName>Brunk</persName> book would appear a listing for G.G.G. and G.G.G.G., probably with the notation that the meaning of these
                  terms was not known, and that a theory or two had been proposed. As the G.G.G. and G.G.G.G. counterstamps were well known and as nearly every
                  collector of counterstamps beyond the dilettante stage had one or several pieces, it was indeed unfortunate that the maker could not be
                  identified.</p>

               <p>Enter <persName>Robert Sagers</persName>, a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> collector of counterstamps,
                  who at the last minute—just before the book went to press—located a worn 1838 cent which provided the answer. The mystery was solved!</p>
               <p>When <persName>Brunk's</persName> book, <hi rend="italic">American and Canadian Countermarked Coins</hi>, appeared in print in 1987, on
                  page 75 this notation was included: <pb n="86"/>
                  <q>G.G.G. <persName>GOODWIN'S</persName> GRAND GREASE JUICE. For one hundred years collectors have argued about what was advertised by
                     the slogan USE G.G.G. Maurice <persName>Gould</persName> advanced the popular theory that the initials mean "Goddard's Goose Grease,"
                     while others have claimed that this is a gonorrhea cure. <persName>Robert Sagers</persName> has solved the problem, causing us to stop
                     the presses to include his identification. He has just found a large cent with a longer slogan reading USE / <persName>GOODWIN'S</persName> / GRAND / GREASE JUICE / FOR THE HAIR / G.G.G.<ref target="CH3-11">11</ref>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Separately, <persName>Mr. Sagers</persName> corresponded with me about his find and sent me a photograph of it.</p>
               <p>Time passed, and in October 1989, I received a catalogue from Coin Galleries describing coins to be offered in a mail bid sale closing on
                  November 15. Lo and behold! Lot 2983 was described as follows: <q>2983. <persName>GOODWIN'S</persName> / GRAND / GREASE JUICE / FOR THE
                     HAIR / G.G.G. c/s in five lines on obverse of an 1840 large cent. (<persName>Brunk</persName> '15395'). Apparently the second known
                     specimen. Stamp complete, coin Very Good with full date. (The word "USE" was inadvertently omitted from the catalogue description.)</q>
               </p>
               <p>I sent in my bid and won the lot for $300 plus 10% buyer's fee, or $330, probably a world's record Price for an 1840 cent worn nearly smooth!
                  However, the all-important <persName>Goodwin's</persName> notation was on the face of the coin, and this made the difference. Here was
                  the second known specimen, a piece slightly finer than the Sager coin dated 1838.</p>
               <p>The story might have ended here, but it didn't. At the Coinage of the Americas Conference on October 29, 1994, following a presentation
                  related to this present article, there was a question-and-answer period. <persName>Dr.George Fuld</persName> commented rather casually
                  that G.G.G. coins were listed in <persName>Horatio Storer's</persName> book published more than a half century ago, <hi rend="italic">Medicina in Nummis</hi>.<ref target="CH3-12">12</ref> When I returned home, I secured a copy by mail from the American Numismatic
                  Association Library in Colorado Springs. Lo and behold! Storer identified G.G.G. as his No. 7446, "<persName>Godwin's</persName> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Grand Grease Juice (for the hair), <placeName>USA</placeName>."! This goes to show that history, and, often,
                  numismatic research, goes in circles!</p>
               <p>Storer cited the appearance of the mark on a large cent dated 1836 and a quarter dollar of 1876. In view of later surveys, I cannot help but
                  think that the 1876 date was recorded in error, and that a well-worn quarter of an earlier date was intended.<ref target="CH3-13">13</ref>

               <pb n="87"/>
               <p>
                  <persName>Goodwin's</persName> Grand Grease Juice must have been a pomade or oil for the hair, an early-day version of "greasy kid
                  stuff." As unappealing as the brand name may seem today, in the nineteenth century it fit right in with other nostrums. <persName>Goodwin's</persName> Grand Grease Juice equated nicely with G.G.G. and solved the riddle, except why weren't the initials given as G.G.G.J.,
                  or was "juice" a generic description suggesting that the grease was in juice form? And what about the related G.G.G.G. product; what did the
                  extra G stand for?</p>

               <p>Then there was the matter of <persName>Goodwin</persName>. Who was he? From previous excursions into the field of research for patent
                  medicines I knew that most such potions and lotions were compounded in the northeastern <placeName>United States</placeName>. In
                  particular, the state of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> was a hotbed of activity in this regard. <persName>Ayer's</persName> Sarsaparilla advertised on encased postage stamps. <persName>Lydia Pinkham</persName> plastered newspapers
                  nationwide with advertisements for her cures for female ills. Moxie Nerve Food claimed to heal just about every affliction known to mankind.
                  They all hailed from the Bay State.</p>
               <p>A shelf in my library is devoted to New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> directories of the mid-nineteenth
                  century, and before checking listings for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City and other northeastern
                  locations I headed for the New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> bookshelf to see what I could find. First in hand
                  was <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Directory</hi> for the year 1852. In keeping with the
                  era's penchant for ornateness and embellishment, I should mention that the full name of the book as given on the title page is <hi rend="italic">The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Directory for the Year 1852, Embracing the City Record, a
                     General Directory of the Citizens, and a Business Directory, with an Almanac, from July, 1852, to July, 1853</hi>, published in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> by George Adams, No. 91 <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> Street, 1852.</p>
               <p>Scanning the volume, I located on page 107 some 41 different <persName>Goodwins</persName> who lived in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. <persName>Benjamin Goodwin</persName>, a grocer, lived on <placeName>Ferry
                     Wharf</placeName>; <persName>Elisha Goodwin</persName>, a broker, did business at 17 Brattle Square and lived in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2653941">Cambridge</placeName>, etc. Piquing my interest was one particular entry: "<persName>Goodwin, Geo.
                  C</persName>. chemist, 97 Union, h. at <placeName>Lexing</placeName>." Here was a <persName>Goodwin</persName> who was a chemist (the
                  nomenclature at the time for an apothecary or pharmacist) and who might indeed have sold patent medicine. Nearly all pharmacists did. His
                  business was located at 97 Union, and he made his home in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> suburb of <placeName>Lexington</placeName>.</p>
               <p>Skipping ahead a few years in time I found that <hi rend="italic">The New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>
                     Business Directory</hi> for the year 1856, also published by <persName>Adams</persName>, listed under "medicines" on page 217 the
                  following: "<persName>Goodwin</persName>, G.C. 99 <pb n="88"/> Union." This listing was in good company with <persName>Holman's
                     Nature's Grand Restorative</persName> (located at 77 <placeName>Cornhill</placeName>), <persName>Putnam's Eradicative</persName> (456
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>), <persName>Wright's</persName> Indian Vegetable Pills (43 <placeName corresp="#geonames_2910831">Hanover</placeName>), and other purveyors of cure-alls.</p>
               <p>The next <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> Directory in my library was dated 1860 and contained entries as of July 1,
                  1859. Here I had some real luck, for on page 8 was a quarter-page notice reading: <q>

               </p>
               <p>Here was <persName>George C. Goodwin</persName> &amp; Co., seller of patent medicines, who specifically advertised "hair preparations,"
                  obviously an excellent candidate for the source of <persName>Goodwin's</persName> Grand Grease Juice for the hair. Unfortunately, no
                  trade names of <persName>Goodwin's</persName> hair preparations were mentioned, so I can only surmise that G.G.G. was among them.</p>
               <p>On page 171 of the same 1860 directory it was stated that <persName>George C. Goodwin</persName> &amp; Co. was owned by <persName>William B.

On page 171 it was stated that <persName>Hibbard</persName> boarded at 41 <placeName corresp="#geonames_2910831">Hanover</placeName>. <persName>George C.

               <p>Looking elsewhere in my library I located a copy of <hi rend="italic">For Bitters Only</hi>, a book by <persName>Carlyn Ring</persName>,
                  which describes varieties of patent medicine bottles known as bitters, typically consisting of flavoring laced with alcohol, <persName>Drake's</persName> Plantation Bitters being a prominent example. Under the entry for Indian Vegetable and Sarsaparilla Bitters it
                  was noted that this elixir was produced by <persName>George C. Goodwin</persName> &amp; Co. and that the author had located the firm's

               <p>Later, through the kindness of <persName>Anne Bentley</persName>, I spent a day at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Historical Society, where I consulted <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> directories of all
                  years from 1840 through 1860. A year-by-year synopsis follows:</p>
               <p>1840: <persName>George C. Goodwin</persName> is affiliated with <persName>Byam &amp; Goodwin</persName>, a match factory operated
                  with <persName>Ezekiel Byam</persName>, at Union, corner of Blackstone. His home was at 17 Minot.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">Summary</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Fearing that trivial details might get out of hand, I propose to stop giving citations at this point, and to summarize the situation:</p>
               <p>1. Two <placeName>United States</placeName> one-cent pieces are known to me, one dated 1838 and the other 1840, stamped with the
                  inscription "USE / <persName>GOODWIN'S</persName> / GRAND / GREASE JUICE / FOR THE HAIR / G.G.G." In addition, Storer recorded an
                  1836-dated cent when he did his research for <hi rend="italic">Medicina in Nummis</hi>.</p>
               <p>2. Numerous cents and other coins are known stamped with the inscriptions "USE / G.G.G." and "USE / G.G.G. / &amp; / G.G.G.G.," the latest of
                  which is dated 1857.</p>
               <p>3. The counterstamping of the "USE / G.G.G." and "USE / G.G.G. / &amp; / G.G.G.G." pieces probably took place circa 1854-57. The
                  counterstamping of the "USE / <persName>GOODWIN'S</persName> / GRAND / GREASE JUICE / FOR THE HAIR / G.G.G." pieces took place in 1840 or
                  later, probably antedating the other G.G.G. counterstamps.</p>
               <p>4. G.G.G. stands for <persName>Goodwin's</persName> Grand Grease (Juice), a preparation for the hair. What G.G.G.G. represents is
                  unknown.</p>
               <p>5. Some counterstamps are marked G.G.G. and others are marked G.G.G. &amp; G.G.G.G. However, no counterstamps exist with G.G.G.G. without an
                  accompanying G.G.G. Thus, it seems that G.G.G. was the earlier of the two preparations, and when G.G.G.G. was formulated at a later date, the
                  two were advertised together. For what it may be worth, more older dates are stamped with just G.G.G.</p>
               <p>6. George C. <persName>Goodwin</persName> &amp; Co., of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, was a seller of hair
                  preparations in the late 1850s, during which time someone stamped coins with these inscriptions: "USE / G.G.G.," and "USE / G.G.G. / &amp; /
                  G.G.G.G."</p>
               <p>7. It seems probable that <persName>George C. Goodwin</persName> &amp; Co. was the counterstamper.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The jewelry firm of <persName>Stone &amp; Ball</persName> was founded in <placeName>Syracuse</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in 1853 by two young men, <persName>Calvin S. Ball</persName> and <persName>S.H. Stone</persName>, who succeeded the partnership of <persName>Norton &amp; Hotchkiss</persName>.<ref target="#CH3-n18">18</ref>
                  <persName>Stone &amp; Ball</persName> lasted until about 1869, after which <persName>Ball</persName> carried on the trade alone, <pb n="93"/> finally giving up the business in 1903 by selling out to <persName>Stetson &amp; Crouse</persName>.</p>
               <p>During the first year of business the entrepreneurs are said to have embarked upon a scheme of advertising by counterstamping quarter dollars
                  with the inscription: STONE &amp; BALL / <placeName>SYRACUSE</placeName> / <placeName>N.Y.</placeName>
               </p>
               <p>An article in <hi rend="italic">The Syracuse Herald</hi>, June 27, 1897, based upon an interview with <persName>Calvin S.
                  Ball</persName>, noted that quarter dollars stamped by the firm earlier have "come back like the cat; some have knocked about nearly 44
                  years."</p>
               <p>The text further noted: <q>None but 25-cent pieces were stamped, and the work was all done during the first two years of the partnership; but
                     for 44 years these quarters have been heard from in many unique and unexpected ways.</q>
                  <q>Immediately upon the breaking out of the [Civil] war most of them disappeared, and it is the opinion of <persName>Mr. Ball</persName>
                     that they were hidden away down South; and not until about 1880 did they begin to make their reappearance.<ref target="#CH3-n19">19</ref>
                     He now has about $10 worth of stamped quarters that have been returned to him by both acquaintances and strangers from all parts of the
                     country. A great many letters are also received, all of which he answers and supplies whatever information is asked....</q>
                  <q>Often I meet people in the street who hand me one of our old coins. It is easy for people to find us, as I believe that I am the only
                     merchant, excepting <persName>S.I. Ormsbee</persName>, who is still carrying on the book and paper business, who has continued in the
                     same business in this city during the 44 years without change.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By 1853, when <persName>Stone &amp; Ball</persName> was founded, the idea of counterstamping coins was not new to at least one of the
                  partners, for a jeweler's hallmark, <persName>C.S. BALL</persName>, was used by <persName>Calvin S. Ball</persName> earlier and is
                  known today on large cents dated 1829, 1837, and 1838, as well as several varieties of Canadian tokens.<ref target="#CH3-n20">20</ref>
               </p>
               <p>The counterstamps of <persName>Stone &amp; Ball</persName>, said to have been applied only in the years 1853 and 1853, are of at least
                  three types: (1) <persName>STONE &amp; BALL</persName> in a rectangular hallmark punch; (2) <persName>STONE &amp; BALL</persName> in
                  a logotype punch; and (3) <persName>STONE &amp; BALL</persName> / <placeName>SYRACUSE</placeName> / <placeName>N.Y.</placeName> in
                  three lines in a logotype punch.</p>
               <p>Only the latter style contained the address, and it was quarter dollars of this style which were the subject of the 1897 recollections by
                     <persName>Ball</persName>. He forgot that numerous coins other than quarters had been so marked, including large cents, dimes,
                  quarters, half <pb n="94"/> dollars, and various foreign coins. However, judging from the frequency of specimens seen on the numismatic market
                  today, quarter dollars were dominant.</p>
               <p>The hallmark-style punch of <persName>C.S. BALL</persName> and the later hallmark punch of <persName>STONE &amp; BALL</persName> are
                  typical of those used by manufacturing jewelers and silversmiths; however, modern authority <persName>D. Albert Soeffling</persName>
                  feels otherwise:<ref target="#CH3-n21">21</ref>
                  <q>Contrary to the popular literature on silver marks, Stone &amp; Ball were not silversmiths. As a general rule, much of the silverware of
                     the nineteenth century is stamped with the retailer's mark. This practice was known as backstamping or store stamping. The practice has
                     caused no end of confusion in identifying the actual manufacturers of nineteenth century silver. In terms of silverware, <persName>Stone &amp; Ball</persName> only sold it. They were trained jewelers, however, and repaired clocks and watches. The firm had the contract
                     for keeping the school clocks in Syracuse in repair and also erected the first illuminated clock in Syracuse in front of their store.</q>

                     numerous. <persName>Brunk</persName> lists the following: <q>Large cents dated 1816, 1817, 1818, 1820, 1822 (2), 1823, and one of

                  <p>The <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>-<persName>Lafayette</persName> counterstamp is said to have been
                     among the early work of <persName>Charles C. Wright</persName>, who was quite possibly the most skilled and accomplished of all
                     American engravers of the nineteenth century.</p>
                  <p>Presently, the writer is engaged in research on the numismatic aspects of <persName>Lafayette's</persName> 1824-25 visit, and the
                     biography of <persName>Wright</persName>. Much information, including a manuscript biography, has been found concerning the latter,
                     but, so far, not a single contemporary mention of counterstamped <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>-<persName>Lafayette</persName> coins. Hopefully, some future year may see a COAC presentation on Lafayette and engraver Wright, or,
                     perhaps even a monograph on the subject.</p>

                        cent, adding an eagle motif for good measure, was probably not a numismatist! The style of the hallmark indicates that he was probably a

                        presumably when this piece was marked, telegraphs were a booming industry. Most probably, research into American telegraphy would

                        1820 cent, was made from several single line punches, carefully (more or less) positioned. As the preparation of this piece required
                        time and care, it was probably made as a souvenir or pocket piece, rather than specifically for advertising. <persName>John W.

                     <p>13. The imprint DERINGER / PHILA in two lines on the obverse of an 1817 cent is the same mark used by this famous manufacturer of
                        firearms to identify its pistols, one of which was used to assassinate <persName>President Abraham Lincoln</persName>. The <persName>Deringer</persName> firm, owned by <persName>Henry Deringer</persName>, was located on Front Street for many years; in
                        1819, the address was 370 North Front Street. The company was active from about 1806 until a few years after <persName>Deringer's</persName> death in 1868.</p>

                        prolific counterstamper of coins within the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in terms of the entire North American continent,

                        author on a cent of that date. By this time, large cents were an anachronism, and there was little point in stamping them for
                        advertising purposes. While it is known that G.G.G. stands for <persName>Goodwin's</persName> Grand Grease, a hair preparation, it

                     <p>16. USE / GOLD PILE / SALVE / WARRANTED / TO / CURE /J.H.D. nicely imprinted on the reverse of an 1843 cent. The size of the stamp
                        indicates that it may have been made specifically for advertising purposes on cents. On the other hand, this piece is a great rarity,
                        and if advertising was the intention, only a few were ever made. Another possibility is that the stamp may have been used to imprint
                        metal cases containing the product. Undoubtedly, J.H.D. was the compounder.</p>

                        forms—curved (rare) and straight line (as shown here on an 1847 cent). Many dozens of specimens are known, indicating a large original
                        production. Tracy probably worked in soft metal and was a silversmith, pewterer, or Coppersmith, although no directory listings had been

                        connection with a hotel of that name, quite possibly tableware or key tags. Tremont House was a popular name for lodging places,
                        including one in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> operated by <persName>Gage Bros</persName>. &amp;

                        This was the rallying cry of the Free Soil Party, and is believed to have been used in the presidential election of 1848 (as no cents
                        are known of dates later than that), although the party remained active through the early 1850s. The slogan referred to using the ballot
                        box to keep land free from slavery.</p>

                        diminished for cross-referencing it to the actual issuer, <persName>John Q. Public</persName>. It really should be listed as "P.,

            <p>To find the elusive origin of an important coin or token over 150 years after its issuance is welcome numismatic data. When this occurred with
               respect to the American Anti-Slavery tokens dated 1838 it is of particular significance because of the present emphasis on securing, safeguarding
               and studying the civil rights of individuals. The common variety of this token (Low 54, <persName>Rulau</persName> 81) contains the well
               known motto AM I NOT A WOMAN &amp; A SISTER surrounding a black woman in chains and thus emphasizes women's civil rights as well as the then goal
               of freedom from slavery (<ref target="#fig-72">fig. 1</ref>).</p>

            <p>A review of the extensive numismatic literature as to American Anti-Slavery tokens discloses much speculation as to their origin and specifically
               urges further research to reveal their actual background.<ref target="#CH4-n1">1</ref> Their substantial circulation as token money in the <placeName>United States</placeName> is well known from the natural wear evident on most pieces.</p>
            <p>The location of their origin was initiated by serendipity. An article written by <persName>Robert W. Julian</persName> revived a portion of
               a letter dated December 2, 1837, from <persName>Robert M. Patterson</persName>, Director of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint, to <persName>Levi Woodbury</persName>, Secretary of the Treasury.<ref target="#CH4-n2">2</ref> That letter stated in part: <q>The Emancipator of the last week advertises a new emission ‘similar in appearance to new cents—nearly
                  as heavy and made of pure copper' for sale at the Anti-Slavery office on Nassau street. They have anti-slavery devices on them.</q>

               original and selected articles on the subject of SLAVERY, religious, literary, miscellaneons and news items of a valuable character will find

            <p>On November 23, 1837, <hi rend="italic">The Emancipator</hi> published the following advertisement: <q>MEDALS</q>
               <q>An artist in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> has manufactured some Anti-Slavery COPPER MEDALS, similar in
                  appearance to new <pb n="116"/> cents. They are nearly as heavy and are made of pure Copper. On one side is a female slave, in chains, in an
                  imploring attitude, with the motto, "Am I not a woman and a sister?" The execution is admirably well done. On the reverse side is, in the
                  center, the word "LIBERTY", surrounded by a wreath–and outside, in a circle, "<placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States of
                     America</placeName>." These medals can be had at the Anti-Slavery Office, No. 143 Nassau Street in any quantity, at one dollar a hundred which
                  merely covers the actual cost.</q>
               <q>It is proposed to make similar medals, with a man, kneeling in chains, with the motto, "Am I not a man and a brother?" The Price will be the
                  same. The friends of liberty have it in their power now to put a medal into the hands of every person in the country, without cost, containing
                  a sentiment of immense value. It is a tract that will not be destroyed. If it falls into the hands of the enemy of liberty, he will "read and
                  circulate."</q>
               <q>Orders are solicited from all parts of the country, post paid. Newspapers friendly to the cause of liberty, are requested to copy this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>No evidence of the reprinting of the advertisement has been found in subsequent issues of <hi rend="italic">The Evangelist</hi>. In spite of the
               offer to other newspapers "friendly to the cause of liberty" to publish the advertisement's content no such insertions have been located. The
               advertisement clarifies many of the matters concerning the tokens. It gives the date of issue of the female slave token as prior to its actual
               1838 dating included on both faces. It points out that the female slave token was prepared by a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> artist. It shows that the American Anti-Slavery Society was primarily interested in the "immense" propaganda value of their
               use. According to the organization's statement it was only covering their actual cost which included mailing them postpaid anywhere in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. The sale price of one cent each was their intended circulating value. Either the coiner or someone else was
               obviously profiting on the matter.<ref target="#CH4-n4">4</ref> The 17½ cent price of copper per pound for tokens with a mean weight of 10.26
               grams each makes the intrinsic value of the metal in one hundred tokens only 39½ cents.<ref target="#CH4-n5">5</ref> The tokens are specifically
               described as medals rather than as money in order to attempt to be lawful, but the admission that they are "similar in appearance to new cents"
               would have been a harmful admission in a criminal proceeding.</p>
            <p>The advertisement also furnishes the first evidence of the background of the 1838 male slave token (Low 54a, <persName>Rulau</persName>
                  82).<ref target="#CH4-n6">6</ref> It <pb n="117"/> conveys the fact that such a token was "proposed" on November 23, 1837, and therefore its
               existence has its first historical support (<ref target="#fig-75">fig. 4</ref>). The advertisement indicates the male and female slave tokens had
               the same sponsor.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-75">
               <graphic url="COAC10_117.jpg"/>
               <p>4</p>
            </figure>
            <p>As will hereafter be shown the illegality of the issuance of this style of tokens had already been strongly asserted under <placeName>United States</placeName> law. The design of both tokens carried a wreath similar to the then current <placeName>United States</placeName>
               cents: the legend <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">United States of America</placeName> in circular form was in the same general
               position as on such <placeName>United States</placeName> cents; and the word LIBERTY 1838 in two lines in the center of the wreath was in a
               deceivingly similar position and appearance to ONE CENT in two lines in the center of the wreath on <placeName>United States</placeName>
               cents. In addition to the foregoing, the tokens were virtually the same diameter, weight and thickness as <placeName>United States</placeName>
               cents.</p>
            <p>One may therefore draw a logical conclusion from the threat of enforcement of the law. The large issue of the female slave token contains an
               obvious error in that the N in UNITED is a mirror image, the diagonal stroke of the N improperly rising from lower left to upper right.<ref target="#CH4-n7">7</ref> This mistake might have been deliberately left uncorrected because of circumstances. Recutting a new die would have
               cost precious time as would trying to make a correction to an existing hardened die. It was probably determined that time was of the essence and
               that distribution of the anti-slavery tokens had to be done immediately, or it might be prevented altogether by the enforcement of the law.</p>
            <p>The same logic can be used to explain the rarity of the American 1838 male anti-slavery token (Low 54a, <persName>Rulau</persName> 82). The
               female token had obviously been struck in quantity first. The female tokens had just begun to be offered for sale to the public. While waiting to
               see how quickly the sale of the female tokens was taking place and gathering funds from that source to pay for striking a quantity of the male
               anti-slavery tokens, the threat of law enforcement could well have discouraged the issuers from ordering a substantial production coinage of male
               anti-slavery tokens.</p>
            <pb n="118"/>
            <p>Four days after the female anti-slavery token was advertised in <hi rend="italic">The Emancipator</hi>, the following news item appeared in the
                  <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Journal of Commerce</hi>: <q>SPURIOUS COPPER COINS —We are glad to
                  see that measures are likely to be adopted to put an end to the high handed business which has been so boldly carried on, of counterfeiting
                  the copper coin. It has been done with all sorts of devices, and to complete the assortment, the Abolitionists have set up the manufacturing
                  of cents with a chained negro on them—and poor fellow, he will remain chained for ever, in spite of any thing his especial friends will do for
                  his deliverance. Some of the market women make a regular business of buying light cents and "no cents" by the quantity, at a discount, and
                  passing them off in place of real cents. The anti-slavery coin we believe, is of full weight. The whole business is doing great mischief, and
                  ought to be stopped forthwith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The editor was cruelly critical of the anti-slavery cause. He does admit the token is full weight. He refers to the slave on the token as a male,
               describing the figure as a negro, as a poor fellow and uses masculine pronouns. No female anti-slavery token was mentioned. A male anti-slavery
               token therefore had been examined, thus proving that at least some examples of it had been struck by November 27, 1837.</p>
            <p>A few strikings from the male anti-slavery token dies could have been all that were made. Thus there is an answer to the challenge "It has never
               been discovered as to why Low 54a has remained unknown for over 70 years."<ref target="#CH4-n8">8</ref> There was apparently no production
               coinage and the few examples of the 1838 male anti-slavery token remained unnoticed by numismatists during the nineteenth century. The 1838
               American male slave token was obviously adapted from the undated (ca. 1796) British anti-slavery tokens which contained the legends, AM I NOT A
               MAN AND A BROTHER and MAY SLAVERY &amp; OPPRESSION CEASE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD (<ref target="#fig-76">fig. 5</ref>).</p>

            <p>The identity of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> diemaker and coiner of the anti-slavery tokens leaves two

               <persName>John Gibbs</persName> of <placeName>Belleville</placeName> was the founding member of the firm of <persName>Gibbs</persName>, <persName>Gardner &amp; Co.</persName>, known as the "<placeName>Belleville Mint</placeName>" (<ref target="#fig-77">fig. 6</ref>; Low 150, <persName>Rulau</persName> 202). <persName>Gibbs</persName> was born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, in 1809, and came to <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> where he joined <persName>John Gardner</persName> in the production of die struck
               metal buttons, metal store cards, metal tokens and copper coins for foreign countries. That enterprise obtained its sheet metal from <persName>Stevens</persName>, <persName>Thomas</persName>, &amp; <persName>Fuller</persName>, a brass rolling mill firm situated on
               the same <placeName>Belleville</placeName> property so they could easily work together. <persName>William Stevens</persName> of that firm
               was an English trained diesinker.<ref target="#CH4-n11">11</ref>
               <persName>Gibbs</persName>, having struck the 1833 Liberian one cent token, should have had priority for selection to make anti-slavery
               tokens. This <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> evidence seems to correct a speculation that the "piece was struck
               by Scoville[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Manufacturing Co."; an assertion that the dies were engraved by <persName>Edward Hulseman</persName>
               who worked in Attleboro, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City and whose initial H is on many Hard Times Tokens; and a comment that the Token was

               <ref target="#CH4-n13">13</ref> and for the 1837 directory the information had to be gathered in late 1836. Thus <persName>Hulseman</persName> could not be the die cutter according to the advertisement in <hi rend="italic">The Emancipator</hi> naming a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> craftsman. The delicacy of the slave design would indicate a highly skilled
               engraver (in spite of the lettering error) and thus the English training of <persName>Stevens</persName> swings the probability in favor of
               the "Belleville Mint" (<persName>Gibbs</persName>, <persName>Gardner</persName> &amp; Co. jointly <pb n="120"/> with <persName>Stevens</persName>, <persName>Thomas &amp; Fuller</persName>) being engravers and makers. The punches and style clearly indicate that the
               dies for both the female and male anti-slavery tokens were made by the same die cutter and both were dated 1838.</p>
            <p>During the same month when the advertisement of the anti-slavery tokens was printed most newspapers in the <placeName>United
                  States</placeName> were running extensive accounts, editorials and discussions of the murder of Reverend <persName>Elijah Parish
                  Lovejoy</persName> (1802-37), a Presbyterian minister in <placeName>Alton</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4896861">Illinois</placeName>. He was the first American martyr to freedom of the press. He had previously been forced out of his pulpit in St. Louis
               County, <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, for being editor of the <hi rend="italic">
                  <persName>St. Louis Times</persName>
               </hi> and the <hi rend="italic">St. Louis Observer</hi>, both of which continuously published strong anti-slavery material. Thinking that it
               would be helpful to move from a slave state (<placeName>Missouri</placeName>) across the <placeName>Mississippi River</placeName> to a free
               state (<placeName corresp="#geonames_4896861">Illinois</placeName>), he transferred his press to <placeName>Alton</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_4896861">Illinois</placeName>, where he published the <hi rend="italic">Alton Observer</hi>. He continued to
               promote the anti-slavery movement by his powerful diatribes against slavery and inflamed those who supported slavery. His anti-slavery feelings
               were based upon moral and religious grounds. Each of his first three presses were thrown into the <placeName>Mississippi River</placeName> by
               his opponents and on the arrival of a fourth press a mob set fire to the warehouse where the press was stored when unloaded from a riverboat. In
               climbing to the roof to extinguish the flames Lovejoy was shot and killed on November 7, 1837. It is a coincidence that during the period of
               production of the anti-slavery tokens the anti-slavery movement took both a major advance and a major setback from his martyrdom.</p>

                  <hi rend="bold">The Need for Copper Tokens</hi>
               </head>
               <p>As is well known, the suspension of specie payments by American banks on May 10, 1837,<ref target="#CH4-n14">14</ref> resulted in the
                  withdrawal from general circulation of virtually all silver and gold coin and the emergency issue of paper money by individuals, businesses,
                  cities, and counties. Specie promptly sold at a premium. The paper money consisted primarily of fractional parts of a dollar and the lower
                  dollar denominations, being derisively called "Shinplasters," a term which had previously been applied to Continental Currency and other
                  American paper money of doubtful value. Copper <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> cents and pre-<placeName>U.S. Mint</placeName> copper coins, although remaining in circulation, could not fill the need for minor transactions without the presence of
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> half dimes, dimes and quarters and Spanish and Spanish-American ½, 1 and 2
                  reales. Even the <placeName>U.S. Mint</placeName> was sometimes reluctant to disburse cents during the period as evidenced by the following
                  letter <pb n="121"/> to the editor printed in the October 26, 1837 <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Public Ledger</hi>: <q>The Mint — It has
                     been generally believed that our citizens could obtain for gold or silver, coppers from this institution, and until recently such has been
                     the case. Whether the officers are tired of disbursing this latter species of coin, and wish to check the demand for it, we cannot say, but
                     certain it is that they refuse to give "pennies" for silver coin of a less denomination than fifty-cents.</q>
                  <q>American quarter dollars, on the authority of the "folks inside" alone, are unhesitatingly rejected. Can any body about the Institution
                     answer our queries - Why, and by what right is this course pursued? We pause for a reply.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PECUNIA</p>
               <p>Thus the opportunity arose for private interests to coin tokens to fill the need. This was further stimulated because the intrinsic value of
                  the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> copper coin was far below its circulating value and there was a reasonable
                  profit available in coining copper tokens of equal weight and size to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> copper
                  coinage. In addition there was an opportunity for business advertising as well as political and economic satire to enliven the faces of the
                  tokens.</p>
               <p>The introduction of copper tokens in the fall of 1837 caused comment in the October 4, 1837 <hi rend="italic">U.S. Gazette</hi> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, describing Low 62, <persName>Rulau</persName> 20 (<ref target="#fig-78">fig. 7</ref>): <q>A Currency</q>

                     "1837." A painful exhibition of the signs of the times.</q>

               <p>The easiest way to promote the introduction and sale of tokens for circulation was by offering them at a discount. This practice was described
                  in the November 14, 1837 <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Journal of Commerce</hi>: <q>Copper Coin — There are great
                     quantities of copper pieces in the market which circulate as cents, but which are not so. They are generally too light; but the worst part
                     of their construction is the bad metal they are made of, and their consequent tendency to become foul. Worst of all, they are a vile
                     debasement of the current coin, by which individuals, very improperly, make a large profit at the public expense, their spurious coins
                     being generally sold by the bushel, at 50 to 60 cents the hundred. They are all stamped with some device other than that of the national
                     cent; for to put on that, would subject the operator to consequences not profitable. It is quite time for the public to refuse this trash
                     altogether. * * * We hope that the same course will be pursued with the dirty "no cents" which are attempted to be put forth so

               <p>The distribution of Hard Times Tokens also led to newspaper advertisements or notices, at least in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, as
                  well as for the Anti-Slavery tokens in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>E.H. Merrill</persName> was a <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> commission merchant who routinely
                  placed separate newspaper advertisements covering each type of merchandise he had for sale, such as Britannia Tea Pots; silk, wool and fur
                  hats; cork inkstands, boots, shoes and brogans; pins; bone buttons; percussion caps; tape, etc. On October 30, 1837, and for the next two
                  days, he placed the following advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">American and Commercial Daily Advertiser</hi> (known as the <hi rend="italic">Baltimore American</hi>):</p>
               <p>SPECIE — 1 cask, 15,000 Copper Counters</p>
               <p>Just received for sale by <persName>E. H. Merrill</persName>
               </p>
               <p>No. 24 South Charles st.</p>
               <p>The advertisement showed that a newly arrived cask of "Counters" contained 15,000 pieces, but no price was indicated. Assuming that these were
                  copper tokens they would pass for an aggregate of $150.00 and would have a total weight of about 340 pounds. The use of the word "Copper
                  Counters" would ordinarily mean discs made of copper, struck with a design, intended to be used for counting box or counting board
                  calculations, and better known as casting counters or jetons. No such meaning was actually <pb n="123"/> intended in the advertisement. The
                  pieces were identified in a <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> newspaper comment in <hi rend="italic">The
                     Sun</hi> on December 2, 1837, as having legends of MILLIONS FOR DEFENCE and NOT ONE CENT FOR TRIBUTE (Such types are known as Low 21-36

                  291-93). They were obviously Hard Times Tokens struck either in <placeName>Waterbury</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, or

               </figure>
               <p>This use of the word SPECIE in the <persName>Merrill</persName> advertisement was to draw attention to it. Specie means gold and silver
                  but does not include copper. In the <hi rend="italic">Baltimore American</hi> of October 11, 1837, <persName>Samuel Winchester</persName>
                  used the word SPECIE when offering to buy "whole, halves and quarter dollars" at a premium.</p>
               <p>The <persName>Merrill</persName> advertisement was deliberately deceptive and audacious. It is no wonder that the authorities were
                  promptly advised.</p>
               <p>The opinion that copper tokens in general were illegal and were cheating the public was published in the November 2, 1837 <hi rend="italic">

                        <p>SIR — The Secretary of the Treasury has referred to this office a communication received from <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName>, transmitting the enclosed copper coin. It is stated to be a specimen of such as are
                           extensively put into circulation there, and advertised in the newspaper by a commission house, which is retailing them to any one who
                           applies for them. I have to request that you will cause inquiry to be made into the truth of these statements, and if such be the
                           fact, institute proper legal proceedings without delay. The second section of the act of 8th May 1792 provides that "no copper coins
                           or pieces whatsoever, except the said cents and half cents, being those coined at the Mint of the <placeName>United
                              States</placeName>, shall pass current as money, or shall be paid, or offered to be paid, or received in payment for any debt, demand,
                           claim, matter or thing whatsoever; and all copper coins or pieces, except the said cents and half cents, which shall be paid or
                           offered to be paid, or received in payment, contrary to the prohibition aforesaid, shall be forfeited; and every person by whom any
                           of them shall have been so paid, or offered to be paid, or received in payment shall also <pb n="126"/> forfeit the sum of ten
                           dollars; and the said forfeiture and penalty shall and may be recovered, with costs of suit, for the benefit of any person or persons
                           by whom information of the incurring thereof shall have been given."</p>

               <p>The threatened prosecution under Section 2 of the Act of May 8, 1792, as above quoted was a substantial error. The omitted language of Section
                  2 just prior to the quoted portion required newspaper notices to be published after $50,000 in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> copper coin had been minted in order to make the law effective. This was never done and that portion of the law was never in
                     force.<ref target="#CH4-n18">18</ref> In addition the law was repealed by Section 25 of the Act of March 3, 1825, which specifically
                  defines an illegal piece as being "in resemblance or similitude of any copper coin which has been or may hereafter be coined at the Mint of
                  the <placeName>United States</placeName>." However the law also required "intent to defraud"; and this would be a decision for the jury and
                  would have been very difficult for the prosecution to prove, as there was no such intent by either the manufacturer or by those who circulated
                  the tokens. It was an obvious and open money substitute.</p>
               <p>Five constables in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> made separate purchases of the copper tokens advertised by
                     <persName>E.H. Merrill</persName> on October 30-November 1, 1837, and identified each such purchase with their name on the tag. This
                  evidence was used for five separate prosecutions resulting on December 12, 1837, in five fines for $10 each or a total of $50. Comments by the
                  press ranged widely. Since the constables were entitled to receive the full amount of the fines personally they were accused of abusing their
                  position. On the other hand the verdict was deemed too light for an influential merchant "above the reach of ordinary pecuniary troubles * * *
                  which makes our laws like spiders webs, which allow the large flies to break through while the small ones are strangled and devoured." Others
                  complained in the press that illegal paper money was condoned while prosecution for distribution of copper tokens was enforced. Since the
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Post Office had received and paid out the tokens it was suggested that the
                  government prosecute its own agency.<ref target="#CH4-n19">19</ref> Thus the propriety or impropriety of the token affair was somewhat clouded
                  by extraneous <pb n="127"/> views.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, on November 25, 1837, there was a meeting in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> of bankers
                  from all parts of the <placeName>United States</placeName> who, after many differences of opinion, postponed their conclusions as to when
                  specie payments would be resumed. The tokens bearing SUBSTITUTE FOR SHINPLASTERS and the date Novr 1837 (Low 45-48 as well as <persName>Rulau</persName> 56-57 and 66-67) had been prepared as propaganda in favor of copper token money and confirm the date of the
                  beginning of their distribution (<ref target="#fig-81">fig. 10</ref>).</p>

                        <p>Sir:</p>
                        <p>An Attempt was made here some time ago to put spurious copper coins in circulation in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> and they were actually advertised for sale by one of our
                           merchants. The unlawful proceeding was, however, promptly put a stop to; and our District Attorney, <persName>Mr.
                              Read</persName>, brought the matter before the Grand Jury of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> District
                           Court who after attending to the representations made by Mr. Read and myself, made a presentment upon the subject, which was
                           published in some of the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> papers.</p>
                        <p>I find that the same offense has been committed at <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> and that you have
                           candid measures to be taken to arrest the evil there.</p>
                        <p>I now write for the purpose of calling your attention to the great extent to which, as I have reason to believe, spurious copper
                           coins are circulated in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. A <pb n="128"/> gentleman has
                           recently brought me from there ten different varieties, some of them such imitations of the legal coins that I think they might be
                           brought under the Act of March 3, 1835 against counterfeiting. All of this comes within the terms of the Act of May 8, 1792, Section
                           2.</p>
                        <p>The greater part of these spurious coins are evidently made at the same establishment as they have the same face or the same
                           reverse.</p>
                        <p>Most of them are very light, some not exceeding three quarters the weight of the cent for which they are passed. The circulators of
                           some of these spurious coppers may be easily found, since they have had their addresses marked on the reverse of the coins — one is
                              <persName>Ezra B. Sweet</persName>, No. 200 Canal Street, <placeName>NY</placeName> — Another is <persName>Smith
                              Clock</persName> Establishment, No. 74 Bowery, <placeName>NY</placeName> — Another is <persName>Robinson</persName>, <persName>Jones</persName> &amp; Co. — Another <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Joint Stock
                           Exchange Company, No. 6, Tontine Building, <placeName>Wall St</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>I have just had brought to me the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Observer of this day in
                           which is the following Statement:</p>
                        <p>"Immense numbers of spurious Cents are in circulation in this city. The Journal of Commerce says they are generally light and "sold
                           by the hundered (sic) at 62 cents a hundred and that the market women make a regular business of buying light cents and "no cents" by
                           the quantity at a discount and passing them off in place of real cents." The Emancipator of last week advertises a new emission
                           "similar in appearance to new cents — nearly as heavy and made of pure copper" for sale at the Anti-Slavery office on Nassau Street.
                           They have anti-slavery devices on them."</p>
                        <p>I am told that spurious copper coins are largely in circulation in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, but I
                           have no exact information on this point.</p>
                        <p>The coinage of copper is the only operation of the Mint by which any profit is made; and if this illegal interference with our
                           functions is arrested the profit will be so considerable as very appreciably to reduce the expenses of the establishment.</p>

               <p>Patterson continued the prior error of referring to the obsolete May 8, 1792 Act and failed to realize the March 3, 1835 Act only applied
                  prior counterfeiting laws to branch mints. He did not mention Section 21 of the Act of March 3, 1825 (the effective counterfeiting law), and
                  possibly someone was confused by the ten year difference to the day between the Acts of March 3, 1825 and March 3, 1835. The token matter was
                  brought to the attention of the Grand Jury of Philadelphia, where Patterson and the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName>
                  District Attorney testified. The newspapers gave the matter publicity and according to Patterson the practice was stopped there without any
                  indictments. Actually new issues were stopped, advertising the tokens was stopped, but tokens already distributed continued to circulate.</p>
               <p>On December 4, 1837, the Secretary of the Treasury wrote Director Patterson of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName>
                  Mint that a letter to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> District Attorney in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> had been written about enforcing the law as to spurious copper coins (the tokens) and
                  that a similar letter would be promptly sent to the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Attorney in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>.<ref target="#CH4-n21">21</ref> This spread the warning to the four principal commercial cities of

               <p>The production of politically motivated Hard Times Tokens had appeared quickly and ceased in due course. No one was economically harmed to any

               Hall, was viewed as overcrowded with pedestrian and horse traffic. Many prominent businessmen and politicians agreed that something should be
               done to transport workers and merchants quickly, safely and cheaply within the irregular colonial streets which exist below 8th Street.</p>
            <p>In 1821 the City Council published a plan for expansion of the city. This included widening of streets and mapping of the remaining undeveloped
               area of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125771">Manhattan</placeName> Island into the street-avenue grid pattern from river to river.<ref target="#CH5-n2">2</ref> Although drawn on a map, many of these blocks were not graded or marked into lots until the mid-1850s, except for the
               small hamlets of <placeName>Yorkville</placeName> and <placeName>Harlem</placeName> on the east side, and Bloomingdale on the west side of
               the island.</p>
            <p>The first transportation token associated with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> is, to my mind, a <placeName corresp="#geonames_5101760">New Jersey</placeName> issue. The U.S.M. Stage issue of <persName>John Gibbs</persName> was good for
               travel on his stage operating from the manufacturing town of <placeName>Belleville</placeName>, <placeName>NJ</placeName>, to the <placeName>Hoboken Ferry</placeName>, and thence to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-84">fig. 1</ref>).<ref target="#CH5-n3">3</ref> Whether the stage dropped passengers off at the ferry or took them all the way

            <p>What we do know is that <persName>Mr. Gibbs</persName> operated a button manufacturing plant, which expanded into trade checks, several Hard
               Times Tokens, coinage for <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName> and tokens for <placeName>Liberia</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Gibbs</persName> is reported to have operated his stage starting in 1829 and it is listed in newspaper notices of 1831. <persName>Gibbs</persName> may have operated the stage as late as 1846 when he relocated to Forsythe Street in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125771">Manhattan</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Gibbs</persName> later moved to <persName>Williamsburg</persName>, <persName>Brooklyn</persName>, and <persName>soon thereafter vanishes</persName> from the public record.</p>
            <p>The first railroad on <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125771">Manhattan</placeName> Island, the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and <placeName>Harlaem</placeName>, was chartered in April 1831, to construct a
               double track route along Fourth Avenue from East 23rd Street to the <placeName>Harlem River</placeName>.<ref target="#CH5-n4">4</ref> In
               February of the following year permission was granted <pb n="137"/> to extend the line southward along Fourth Avenue to Union Square and then on
                  <placeName>Bowery</placeName> to <placeName>Prince Street</placeName>. It was on this southern extension that track was first laid, and
               on November 14, 1832, service commenced using two 20-passenger cars riding on rails and pulled by a team of two horses each. The service
               eventually ran cars every 15 minutes or so, and passengers could board at any block along the route. In the first seven years of operation the
               fare varied between six and twelve and a half cents for a single trip, regardless of distance.</p>

            <p>Examples of the token are known in white metal, pewter and copper. They also exist with three distinct counterstamp, a rosette (<ref target="#fig-85">fig. 2</ref>) and a dog's head on the white metal issues, and a palm branch on the copper issue. Regular and extended use is
               indicated in that most of the extant examples are well worn. The reason for the various counterstamps is not documented. The initials B &amp; S
                  <placeName>NY</placeName>, under the coach have been associated with the firm of <persName>Bale</persName> &amp; <persName>Smith</persName>, jewelers, the probable engravers and manufacturers of the token. It is beleived that these tokens were not used after 1840.</p>
            <p>The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and <placeName>Harlaem</placeName> Railroad was split in 1859
               when the first Grand Central Terminal was planned. The railroad became exclusively distance travel steam locomotives which ended service at the
               new 42nd Street terminal. The tracks in the city streets south of 42nd Street, and along other routes, became the "City Line," using horsecars
               exclusively.</p>
            <p>The era of the Omnibus for <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City seems to begin around 1830, but the
               first listing of omnibus operators in a city directory does not appear until 1850, when 22 different firms are listed operating with 589
                  vehicles.<ref target="#CH5-n5">5</ref> They operated 27 approved routes varying in length from two and a half to four miles. All but two of
               the routes operated south of 48th Street. Why there is little mention of omnibuses before 1850 in contemporary sources is not known; however only
               the firms listed after 1850 match the token issuing firms. The City's population in 1850 had risen to 515,547.<ref target="#CH5-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>The omnibuses were true stages, they had flat, not flanged wheels, and early ones even had side doors, rather than the refined rear entrance
               door. Of the 22 companies listed in 1851, only six issued tokens. Five of the six tokens were struck in lead the sixth was struck <pb n="138"/>
               in brass. Only three of the six operators ran more than one route, and as the tokens bear the legend "Transfer Ticket" it seems very likely that
               the intention of the tokens was for use between companies. The common obverse depicts an omnibus of four windows, with divided panes of glass,
               and stairs leading from the rear door. The reverse of the tokens list the route or line name and the operator's name with some added
               ornamentation.</p>
            <p>The issuers of the type metal tokens are: The Eighth Avenue Lines of <persName>Finch Sanderson</persName> &amp; Co. who operated two routes
                  (<ref target="#fig-86">fig. 3</ref>). The first route started at 42nd Street, down Eighth Avenue to 4th Street, over to Sixth Avenue down
               through <placeName>Carmine</placeName>, <placeName>Bedford</placeName> and <placeName>Houston</placeName> to <placeName>Broadway</placeName>, then to <placeName>Maiden Lane</placeName> to the <placeName>Fulton Ferry</placeName>. The second route began at 23rd
               Street and went down Eighth Avenue through <placeName>Bleeker to Broadway</placeName>, then down to <placeName>Whitehall</placeName> and
                  <placeName>South Ferry</placeName>. This firm's token also exists in a rare variety with the <persName>Sanderson</persName> name
               scratched out on a full struck token.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Avenue Line of <persName>Hasking</persName> &amp; <persName>Wilkins</persName> operated one route from East 32 Street down
               Fourth Avenue to <placeName>Broadway</placeName>, then on <placeName>Broadway</placeName> to <placeName>Whitehall</placeName> and the
                  <placeName>South Ferry</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-87">fig. 4</ref>). An engravers' error in the die renders the operator's name as
                  <persName>Haskins</persName>, with an "S" rather than a "G".</p>

            <p>The Chelsea Line of <persName>Kipp</persName> &amp; <persName>Brown</persName> operated three routes (<ref target="#fig-88">fig.
                  5</ref>). One started at 48th Street southbound on Ninth Avenue to <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, then <placeName>Canal</placeName> to
                  <placeName>Broadway</placeName>, and down <placeName>Broadway</placeName> to <placeName>Bowling Green</placeName>. <pb n="139"/> The
               second route started at 28th Street and followed the same route to <placeName>Bowling Green</placeName>. The third route began at 31st Street
               and went down Tenth Avenue to 14th Street to <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, down to <placeName>Chambers</placeName> to <placeName>Greenwich</placeName> to Battery Place.</p>
            <p>The [5th &amp;] 7th Avenue Lines of <placeName>Marshall</placeName> &amp; Townsend operated from 42nd Street down Seventh Avenue to <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>, over to Sixth Avenue to <placeName>Amity</placeName> over to <placeName>Broadway</placeName> then south
               to <placeName>Fulton</placeName> and east to the <placeName>Fulton Ferry</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-89">fig. 6</ref>). The die was
               originally engraved as 5th and 7th Avenue. Three varieties of the tokens exist: struck with the full legend, which included 5th, the "5th"
               scratched out on a struck token, or a large rectangle blocking over "5th &amp;" in the die. The operator's misspelling to a plural "Marshalls"
               remained uncorrected.</p>

            <p>The Sixth Avenue Line run by <persName>Young</persName> &amp; <persName>Ward</persName> operated two similar routes (<ref target="#fig-90">fig. 7</ref>). They both started at 34th Street and proceded south on Sixth Avenue, one turned at 8th Street, the other at
               6th Street to turn south on Broadway to <placeName>Whitehall</placeName> and the <placeName>South Ferry</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Telegraph Line of <persName>William Tyson</persName> &amp; Co. operated from the East River's <persName>Williamsburg
                  Ferry</persName>, through Grand Street to and down <placeName>Broadway</placeName>, to <placeName>Canal</placeName>, through <placeName>Canal</placeName> to <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>, down <placeName>Greenwich</placeName> to <placeName>Cortlandt</placeName>, to the <placeName>Jersey</placeName> City Ferry on the <placeName>Hudson</placeName> River (<ref target="#fig-91">fig. 8</ref>).<ref target="#CH5-n7">7</ref> These are the only tokens issued in brass in the series. There are two major reverse die
               varieties: the first with the legend along the edge of the field, and the second with an arched legend nearer the center. Two sub-varieties are
               distinguished by the placement of stops in the operator's name.</p>
            <pb n="140"/>
            <p>As there were many meeting points of one or more routes and all of the routes converge along Broadway somewhere between <placeName>Canal</placeName> Street and City Hall, thus if a transfer were to take place, it would/should/could have been in that area. However there is no
               documentation of this, nor as to the amount of the fare shared between the company of origin which took in the money and the company of receipt
               which took the transfer token.</p>
            <p>The operator of a omnibus rode on the top outside front. The fare box was located inside the front, under the driver, who had a viewing hole in
               his area from which he could see the fare deposited, and pass down to the passenger the required change or transfer token. All the tokens in this
               group were issued with a small hole, so that they could be strung when kept by the driver.</p>
            <p>At a later date, to assist in the collection of the fare, a grooved track was placed on a interior wall of the coach to roll a coin fare into the
               collection box, which remained at the front.</p>
            <p>To the collector, these groups of tokens are a challenge, as only the brass <persName>Tyson</persName> &amp; Co. Telegraph Line is readily
               available. All the firms share a single obverse die. Thus it is safe to say all were struck by the same firm, but we do not know that firm's name
               nor why the tokens were not struck in a more durable metal than lead.</p>
            <p>Within the 1850s alone, the fare changed from 2 cents per mile to a flat 6 cents, rose to 10 cents, and after business was lost to competing
               horsecars, compromised at 8 cents. Cash was the method of payment for the fare, and change was given in cash until the mid-1850s whe the omnibus
               operators substituted for change cardboard tickets valued at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 cents, good for future fares. The chits were accepted by the
               public with protest, and were withdrawn from use by 1864.<ref target="#CH5-n8">8</ref>
            </p>
            <p>A survey of traffic passing the corner of Broadway and Chambers Streets was conducted in 1852 by one <persName>Jacob Sharp</persName>. He
               reported that in a 13-hour period, 3,035 omnibuses and 4,779 other vehicles passed uptown, and 3,162 omnibuses and 4,723 other vehicles passed
               downtown. This puts the omnibus service at a 13-second headway.<ref target="#CH5-n9">9</ref> Quite frightening. Quite crowded. In time, <persName>Mr. Sharp</persName> would be granted a horsecar franchise, so this tabulation was done with some underlying self-interest.</p>
            <p>What happened to these companies? By 1854, <persName>William Tyson</persName> no longer owned his franchise, and by 1857, all of the
               original 22 owners had changed. The franchises were being operated by other owners, or had been merged into one of three larger companies. For
               how long these transfer tokens remained in use, or whether they were used by any successor firms is not known. The omnibus route <pb n="141"/>
               listings disappear from the City Directory after 1862. However, omnibuses continue to be mentioned in newspaper accounts, and exist in
               photographs well into the 1880s.</p>
            <p>In late 1852 and early 1853, the City Council halted the granting of additional omnibus route franchises and turned their attention to the
               granting of railroad franchises on Second, Third, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Avenues. These "railroads" are really what we today call horsecar
               companies. To gain the lucrative franchises, the railroads enhanced each of the City Council members by amounts between $200 and $1,000 for each
               franchise granted.<ref target="#CH5-n10">10</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Of these five companies, only the Third Avenue Rail Road issued tokens, and they used four. All four are made of lead. The first two show an
               Omnibus, but with a coach design different than that of the previous group of issues (<ref target="#fig-92">fig. 9</ref>). The second two tokens
               depict a railcar with platforms at either end, as would be used for a horsecar route (<ref target="#fig-93">fig. 10</ref>). Several questions
               arise. Why depict an omnibus when using Rail Road in the firm name, especially when additional franchises were no longer being granted; and why
               the reverse designations of <placeName>Yorkville</placeName> and <placeName>Harlem</placeName>?</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-92">

               <p>10</p>
            </figure>
            <p>The franchise grant stipulated a 5 cent fare for any distance between Park Row and 61st Street, with a 6 cent fare for the ride to <placeName>Harlem</placeName>. Although the railroad was approved to lay tracks on Third Avenue all the way to the <placeName>Harlem
                  River</placeName>, in actuality tracks initially were only laid to <placeName>Yorkville</placeName>. The extra distance seems to have been
               handled by the holders of the Third Avenue Omnibus franchise—<persName>Murphy &amp; Flynn</persName>, who just happen to be two of the
               twelve directors <pb n="142"/> of the Third Avenue Railroad.<ref target="#CH5-n11">11</ref> So our set of four tokens can probably be tied to the
               transfer northbound or southbound from omnibus or horsecar, and the collection of the extra fare.</p>
            <p>The noticeable changes in the Omnibus from the previous group of tokens are the single pane of glass in each window and the fact that the front
               wheel of the coach comes just to the bottom of the car body. The issue depicting the railcar shows in good detail an 1850s coach which would be
               pulled by horses on rails laid in the street. The very small wheels and lack of a double and more ornate roofline would place it nicely in the
               pre-Civil War period.</p>
            <p>Of particular note on both obverse designs, in the ground area under the vehicle, is a small letter "L." On the omnibus design it is by the left
               wheel; on the railcar it is under the right wheel (<ref target="#fig-94">fig. 11</ref>). Could this be an obvious engraver's initial? Could it be
               a <persName>Lovett</persName>? If it does point to a <persName>Lovett</persName>, one must be remember that there were four <persName>Lovetts</persName> active as engravers in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> at this time:
                  <persName>George</persName>, <persName>John</persName>, <persName>Robert</persName> and <persName>Thomas</persName>.<ref target="#CH5-n12">12</ref> This is an exciting discovery, and one which requires further research.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>A problematic token in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> series is the <persName>Durkee</persName> &amp; Co. Omnibus token (<ref target="#fig-95">fig. 12</ref>). The 1830 City Directory has a <persName>Nathan
                  Durkee</persName> as a carte,<ref target="#CH5-n13">13</ref> and in 1835 as a hotel operator. No other years through the 1850s place a <persName>Durkee</persName> near an Omnibus franchise.</p>
            <pb n="143"/>
            <p>The size of the token, near that of a small cent, may place it in the Civil War years, but there are no listings in the City Directories of that
               era either. A popular issue for the collector, but for the time, a research puzzler.</p>

            <p>The five early horsecar companies collected 31.7 million fares in 1857, using 288 horsecars and 1,722 horses.<ref target="#CH5-n14">14</ref> The
               drivers and conductors worked six 12- to 15-hour days and were paid under $2 a day.<ref target="#CH5-n15">15</ref> For the owners, the profit was
               1.7 cents per 5 cent fare, or 34% of revenue!</p>
            <p>With the end of the Civil War, the city grew rapidly, and by 1870, the city's population of 942,000 lived equally north and south of 14th
                  Street.<ref target="#CH5-n16">16</ref> By 1875, most of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125771">Manhattan</placeName> Island was served by
               12 horsecar companies and they collected nearly 167 million fares for the year. The Elevated Steam Railroad franchises began construction and
               were soon operating along Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Avenues. None were to issue tokens.</p>
            <p>In 1875, Chapter 606 of the Laws of the State of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, called the Rapid
               Transit Act, curtailed further expansion of horsecar routes within the city, but allowed existing routes to continue operation. Steam elevated
               routes were expanded, a discussion of cable propelled systems was entertained, and once again, the proposal for a subway was made and
               defeated.</p>
            <p>The 1880s saw a rapid succession of mergers of smaller horsecar operators into either the Third Avenue Railway Company or the very much larger
               Metropolitan Street Railway Company. In most cases to conserve funds the horsecars were not repainted, and thus the old familiar route names
               continued (<ref target="#fig-96">fig. 13</ref>). A merger of the 42nd Street, <placeName>Manhattanville</placeName> and <persName>St.
                  Nicholas</persName> Avenue Railway into the Third Avenue system caused a now scarce white metal token to be issued. The reverse informs us that it
               was good at 86th Street to <placeName>Boulevard</placeName> or <placeName>Amsterdam Avenue</placeName>. "<placeName>Boulevard</placeName>" was the term used for upper Broadway, then still largely undeveloped. Both of these transfer destinations were served by
               the cars of the Third Avenue system, the new parent firm.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Horsecars</persName> continued in service on the streets of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5125771">Manhattan</placeName> until
               1917. In the city's ongoing quest for better transportation, a franchise was granted in 1883 to construct a cable powered railway, <pb n="144"/>
               similar to the system successfully employed in <persName>San Francisco</persName> in 1873. The cable was housed in a buried conduit as a
               central third rail. Although cleaner than the horsecars, it required a high capital expenditure to commence operation, and vigilant maintenance
               of the machinery and cable network. Its utility in relatively level <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> was
                  short-lived.<ref target="#CH5-n17">17</ref> Within a few years advancements in technology would bring about reliable electric power and the
               introduction of streetcars to replace both horse and cable routes.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The last nineteenth century <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> token was for a transfer from the Third
               Avenue Railroad to the Cable Line for One Fare Going West (<ref target="#fig-97">fig. 14</ref>). This 23mm white metal issue is a bit of a
               puzzler, as it is good for a passenger transferring from the Third Avenue Streetcar (not the Elevated, which was also operating) to a cable car.
               But why only in a westerly direction? Why not a transfer in the easterly direction from the Cable Line to the Third Avenue route? Again, there
               are no currently reliable sources for answers.</p>
            <p>The discussion to this point has stressed the token, and little has been advanced for the cause of the ticket. Ironically, in the beginning there
               were tickets for stages, and now 170 years later there are tickets (or as high tech <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>
               calls it—Fare Cards) again. Stage <pb n="145"/> Companies, omnibus operators, horsecars, steam elevated railroads, ferries, cable railroads,
               streetcars and by 1904 the subway too, all used the ticket as their main fare collection control device. Many of the horsecar companies
               considered themselves railroads, and after all, railroads used tickets.</p>

                  Co.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>The tickets show advancements in printing from basic letterpress (<ref target="#fig-98">fig. 15</ref>) to fine intaglio work (<ref target="#fig-99">fig. 16</ref>) worthy of banknotes. Tickets were sometimes reusable,<ref target="#CH5-n18">18</ref> but more often than not
               were for one time use, and of course, non-refundable. Prior to the twentieth century, the fare box was just a large collection box. It could
               accept coins, tokens and any variety of card ticket a company wanted to issue, but kept no tallies. Most companies accepted coins or one color
               ticket for a full fare and sold other color tickets in groups of two, three, five or fifteen at a discount to reward frequent use. At other
               times, companies issued a card pass valid for a week or a month, <pb n="146"/> which had to be shown to the vehicle operator. Without a doubt,
               even when a cash fare was quite acceptable, that company also issued tickets.</p>
            <p>Thus, with <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City transportation as our example in the nineteenth century,
               it is the ticket rather than the token which really received wide use by the public. The several omnibus tokens would have only been handled by
               thousands, whereas the ticket in the post Civil War years was handled by millions.</p>
            <p>The token as a fare collection alternative does not find its way into everyday use until after World War I. It was only then that the <persName>Johnston</persName> Fare Box Company was able to produce their 1914 development of a tabulating fare box which accurately recorded
               several sizes of tokens and all coin denominations.<ref target="#CH5-n19">19</ref>

            <p>The Far West has fascinated Americans since the nation was founded. Following the explorations of <persName>Lewis</persName> and <persName>Clark</persName>, fur buyers retraced their route to <placeName>Oregon</placeName>. At the same time, traders took manufactured
               goods into <placeName>Mexican</placeName> territory to exchange for gold, silver, and horses. Later, emigrants used these trails to settle in
               these territoies.<ref target="#CH6-n1">1</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>Beginning in the 1840s, migration to the Far West increased substantially. The <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName> Trail, opened in 1821, led from
               Independene, <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, to <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName>, <placeName>New Mexico</placeName>, or—by an extension
               known as the Old <placeName>Spanish</placeName> Trail—to Los Angeles. It saw an increase in traffic from an average of about 150 people a year
               in 1843 to many thousands in the 1850s. Better known was the <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail, also called the <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> and <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail. It, too, began in Independene, <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, and terminated in <placeName>Astoria</placeName>, <placeName>Oregon</placeName>. The <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> Trail branched off beyond the Rocky Mountains and led to Sacramento. Beginning with a single
               party migrating to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> in May, 1841, over 1,400 people left for <placeName>Oregon</placeName> in 1844 and 3,000 more in 1845. With the Gold Rush, over 20,000 people left <pb n="151"/> for <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> from <placeName>Missouri</placeName> in April 1849 alone—and thousands more followed in May.
               By 1852, it is estimated that 100,000 people had taken the <placeName>Oregon</placeName> Trail west.</p>
            <p>The outfitting of all these wagon trains brought prosperity to Independence (<ref target="#fig-100">fig. 1</ref>), Westport, and other nearby
               assemblage points, such as <placeName>Weston</placeName>, <placeName>Missouri</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-101">fig. 2</ref>).
               Independence and <placeName>Weston</placeName> made the most of their role in the Westward movement. As recorded in an 1867 publication, <placeName>Weston's</placeName> "frontier position renders it a favorable starting-point for the emigrants to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName>, etc., and the vast extent of this emigration, in years past, opened a ready market for cattle,
               provisions, etc., at excessively high prices."<ref target="#CH6-n2">2</ref> Independence is described in the same book as "a thriving town...and
               a place where many of the emigrants to <placeName>Oregon</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName>
               procure their outfit.... The prodigious tide of emigration which passed through this place for years, created a demand for horses, provisions,
               and merchandise, at prices which enriched the farmers and traders of this vicinity."<ref target="#CH6-n3">3</ref>

He first appeared in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> city directory for 1837, compiled in 1836. At that time, in his mid-20s, he was listed as a trader, living at 342 S. 2nd

            <p>When the Census of 1840 was taken in October (<ref target="#fig-102">fig. 3</ref>),<ref target="#CH6-n4">4</ref> there were nine persons living
               in the <persName>Abrahams</persName> household: <persName>A. Abrahams</persName>; his wife; <persName>Eleanor</persName>; <persName>Michael</persName>; <persName>Morris</persName>, then a newborn; two women, <pb n="153"/> aged 15-20, possibly younger sisters
               or servants; and two elderly people, probably a grandfather, born about 1765, and grandmother, born about 1770. At that time <persName>Abrahams</persName> resided in the 1st Ward, <placeName>Southwark</placeName>, <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>. (The suburb of <placeName>Southwark</placeName> was incorporated into the city of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> in 1854.) He was still living at the same address in 1836, when the Directory for 1840 was compiled,<ref target="#CH6-n5">5</ref> but now his occupation was listed as "waterman," that is, operator of a water taxi across the <placeName>Delaware</placeName> to
                  <persName>Camden</persName>, <persName>N.J.</persName> The Directory for 1841 also gives this occupation, but the <persName>Abrahams</persName> family had then moved to 9 Catherine Street, only a few doors from the <placeName>Delaware</placeName> River. He was
               possibly associated with <persName>Jacob Larson</persName> of 9 <placeName>German</placeName> Street, another waterman who is listed two
               lines below him in the census.</p>
            <p>A waterman is one of those extinct occupations that one finds while researching the past. The only information that I have come across is in a
               juvenile book, <hi rend="italic">The Book of Trades</hi>, published in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in 1804, and
               reprinted many times; the first American edition was published in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> in 1807. The original watermen plied for fares across the <placeName>Thames</placeName>, before the bridges were
               built. <hi rend="italic">The Book of Trades</hi> states, "A waterman requires but little to enable him to begin business, viz. a boat, a pair of
               oars, and a long pole with an iron point and a hook at the lower end, the whole cost of which is not more than twenty pounds. Sometimes two men
               belong to one boat; in other cases, a boat belongs to a single waterman."<ref target="#CH6-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName>Joseph H. Abrahams</persName>, another son, was born in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> about 1843. Shortly thereafter, his
               first wife apparently died while only in her late 20s. A year or two later, <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q9181">Abraham</persName>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> married <persName>Phebe</persName>, then about 22 or 23, who was born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>. Around this time he moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName> State, where another son, <persName>Elias</persName>
               <persName>M. Abrahams</persName>, was born about 1846.</p>
            <p>Soon afterward, <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q9181">Abraham</persName>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> moved again, this time to <persName>St. Louis</persName>, where he was in the tobacco business for a
               number of years. In 1853, his sister had a retail dry goods business on 8th St. in <persName>St. Louis</persName>, and he had a brother
               living there in November 1854, though I don't know whether they preceded him there or not.<ref target="#CH6-n7">7</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In <persName>St. Louis</persName>, <persName>Abrahams</persName> learned of the huge profits to be made in the <placeName>Mexican</placeName> trade. In 1849, or early in 1850, he moved to <placeName>Jackson</placeName> County, <placeName>Missouri</placeName>,
               where he formed a partnership with a <persName>Mr. Rosenthal</persName>, a fellow Jew, to freight goods from Independence to <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName>, hiring an employee, <persName>Mr. Van Epps</persName>, to supervise their wagon trains.<ref target="#CH6-n8">8</ref> They were instantly successful: their first mention in <persName>Louis Tappan's</persName> Mercantile Agency, in
               March 1850, reported "Jews do a heavy business and presumed entirely good for any costs they <pb n="154"/> make." At the Census of 1850, taken in
               August, he was listed as a merchant in Blue Township, <placeName>Jackson</placeName> County, <placeName>Missouri</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-103">fig. 4</ref>), near or in Independence. At the time of the census there were eight persons in his household: his wife,
               daughter, all of his sons, a <persName>Sarah Levi</persName>, 19, who was born in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName>, and a slave! <persName>Michael</persName>, <persName>Morris</persName>, <persName>Joseph</persName>, and <persName>Elias</persName> were all in school. <persName>Sarah Levi</persName>, possibly a kinswoman of his wife, was probably a
                  servant.<ref target="#CH6-n9">9</ref>

            </figure>
            <p>Another credit report, from January 1851, was also positive. On May 8, 1851, his son bought 1/4 gallon of molasses from the store of Lemuel Shore
               in Independence for 15 cents, putting it on account, and on January 9, 1852, <persName>A.M. Abrahams</persName> came in and settled his
               account <pb n="155"/> for 75 cents (<ref target="#fig-104">fig. 5</ref>). Whether The Peoples Outfitting Store was opened as soon as <persName>Abrahams</persName> came to Independence and was the name for his freighting business, or whether it was a separate enterprise, is
               unclear, but it would seem to have been operating before June 5, 1852, as he registered a Deed of Trust on that day for a chattel mortgage for
               all the goods, wares, merchandize, clothing, etc. in the Store House, part of Lot No. 51 in the city of Independence.<ref target="#CH6-n10">10</ref> His credit was sufficient for a <persName>Mr. Jabez Smith</persName> to advance him $2,000 on this security. And it is not hard
               to see why; Lot No. 51, at the corner of <placeName>Lexington</placeName> and Liberty Streets, faced Court House Square in the center of the
               city (<ref target="#fig-105">fig. 6</ref>).</p>

            <p>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> credit reports continued good through February 1853, though the credit reporter, perhaps out of antisemitism,
               was suspicious of <persName>Abrahams's</persName> worth as a businessman and at one point in 1853, accused him of making false statements.
                  <persName>Abrahams</persName> was thus able to borrow another $4,200, apparently using the same security, according to another Deed of
               Trust dated May 17, 1853. The lenders were <persName>Joshua Hobbs</persName> and <persName>Elihu C</persName>. Rice.<ref target="#CH6-n11">11</ref> He continued to operate his retail and wholesale tobacco business on Chestnut street in <persName>St.
                  Louis</persName> into 1853, selling to "his brethren," according to the credit reporter. Another reporter of this period wrote that he did not
               think that <persName>Abrahams</persName> could raise more than $3,000, but added, "His character and habits are good. He is a cautious man
               and rated an honest Israelite."<ref target="#CH6-n12">12</ref>

            <p>By fall, however, problems had begun to arise. The November 1853 credit report said that he was "cramped for funds." Conditions worstened in
               December; the reporters wrote that <persName>Rosenthal's</persName> actions—not described—had left their business "much disarranged, but
               entirely safe," though it was rumored that they were dissolving their partnership.<ref target="#CH6-n13">13</ref> Nevertheless, on December 16,
               1853, <persName>Abraham M.</persName>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> and Phebe <persName>Abrahams</persName>, "his wife," sold two residential lots, Lots 11 and 12 in <persName>Henry Rubey's</persName> Addition, to the <pb n="158"/> City of Independence, located four blocks south of his store (<ref target="#fig-106">fig. 7</ref>); when they originally purchased these lots is not known.<ref target="#CH6-n14">14</ref> About this same time,
               he bought the east half of Lot 17 in nearby <placeName>Westport</placeName>, <placeName>Missouri</placeName> (<ref target="#fig-107">fig.
                  8</ref>),<ref target="#CH6-n15">15</ref> and may have moved his family there. On February 8, 1854, it was recorded that the $2,000 chattel
               mortgage of June 5, 1852, was satisfied in full.</p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-107">

               <p>8.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>On the same day, a mortgage was recorded on his lot in <placeName>Westport</placeName>, showing $3,500 owing to Miles <persName>W.
                  Buford</persName> and <persName>Jabez Smith</persName>, and a promissory note signed for this amount by <persName>A.M.
                  Abrahams</persName>. A Deed of Trust recorded February 18, 1854, gave as security the east half of Lot No. 17 in the town of <placeName>Westport</placeName>; all the goods, wares and <pb n="159"/> merchandise in the Store house on this lot; and all the goods, wares and merchandise
               in the Store Room "now kept and occupied by said <persName>Abrahams</persName> &amp; Co. in the City of Independnce."<ref target="#CH6-n16">16</ref> So by February 18, 1854, he had a second store in <placeName>Westport</placeName>, though he still controlled the Independence
               store. I am not certain what distinction is to be read into the several deeds that refer to the Independence location as a "Store house" until
               the <placeName>Westport</placeName> store opened, then <placeName>Westport</placeName> is called a Store house and Independence a Store
               Room. It seems unlikely that such a prime location as that on Court House Square would be converted to a mere warehouse; perhaps he no longer
               lived there, or perhaps he just occupied less of the building: "rooms" instead of the whole "house." On April 28, 1854, he paid off the $4,200
               loan of May 17, 1853.</p>
            <p>At this point <persName>Abraham M</persName>. <persName>Abrahams</persName> had two stores and no debt except for his <placeName>Westport</placeName> mortgage of $3,500, plus advances from the local merchants. But the firm of <persName>Abrahams</persName>
               and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> was in a weakened condition: a few days later, on May 1, they took out yet another mortgage and chattel
               mortgage on his lot in <placeName>Westport</placeName> and his stock of goods in both <placeName>Westport</placeName> and Independene, but
               were able to borrow only $1,140 from a <persName>William Rice</persName>, at 6% interest.<ref target="#CH6-n17">17</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Through the summer, <persName>Abrahams</persName> and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> continued to send a considerable amount of goods
               to <placeName>New Mexico</placeName> and <placeName>Chihuahua</placeName>, but said in July that they could not get returns from Mexico and
               asked for 12 months time. Some creditors were willing to wait, but others apparently cut them off, and the credit reporter began to express the
               suspicion that they were planning to cheat.<ref target="#CH6-n18">18</ref> On August 12, <persName>Abrahams</persName> made a partial
               payment of $2,250 to <persName>Buford</persName> and <persName>Smith</persName> on the Westport mortgage.</p>
            <p>Conditions worstened in the fall of 1854. In October, it was reported that <persName>Abrahams</persName> had left Independence for <persName>St. Louis</persName> aboard the steamboat <hi rend="italic">Polar Star</hi>, ostensibly to pick up a government draft with which he
               would pay all demands. <persName>Abrahams</persName> and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> were said to be in debt $12,000 and unable to
               pay, and the local merchants were planning to attach their 80 mules if not satisfied. <persName>Abrahams</persName> and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> then threatened to make assignments to prefer other creditors over those in Independence if sued, and this—coupled with
               continued promises to pay—stopped this action.<ref target="#CH6-n19">19</ref> But when <persName>Abrahams's</persName> mortgage on his lot
               in <placeName>Westport</placeName> fell due unpaid, <persName>Buford</persName> and <persName>Smith</persName> foreclosed for the
               balance on November 2. On Saturday, November 25, 1854, the east half of Lot 17 in <placeName>Westport</placeName> was sold at auction for cash
               at the east front door of the Court House in Independence to a <persName>Louis Vogel</persName>, for $1,670.<ref target="#CH6-n20">20</ref>
            </p>
            <p>This transaction cancelled <persName>Abrahams's</persName> note: of the $3,500 borrowed, <pb n="160"/> he had paid $2,250 and Vogel $1,670,
               for a total of $3,920—more than enough to cover the interest and expenses of sale. He may even have received some money back. But he was
               definitely out of business in Westport by November 25, 1854. Naturally, <persName>Abrahams</persName> and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> had no credit by this point, though both had returned to Independence and still promised to make good on all debts. But to
               avoid attachment of the mules, <persName>Abrahams</persName> and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> drove them 150 miles into Howard
               County, <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, only to be caught in flight. However, <persName>Abrahams</persName> had signed the herd over to
               his brother in <persName>St. Louis</persName>, thwarting his creditors, and similar steps had been taken to shield their holdings in <persName>Santa Fe</persName>. By now the Independence business community had decided that both men were running "a large swindling
                  operation."<ref target="#CH6-n21">21</ref>
            </p>
            <p>On December 1, 1854, the firm of <persName>Abrahams</persName> and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> was dissolved. While they continued
               to promise that they would make satisfactory settlement of all debts, the local credit reporter wrote "It appears evident that a fraud is about
               to be imposed on creditors here." Their outstanding debts were variously reported in November and December at from $2,000 to $20,000. There were
               rumors that <persName>Abrahams</persName> had received $12,000 in September and $2,000 more in October—which he denied. Both <persName>Abrahams</persName> and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> moved to <persName>St. Louis</persName> in December 1854. The last
               credit report on them, for January 1855, is succinct: "Broke up; run off; put out and gone, leaving little but some large debts and reputation of
               infamous scoundrels as we unhesitatingly endorse it." The reporter added that <persName>Abrahams</persName> had told creditors in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> that the mule transaction was a "sham."<ref target="#CH6-n22">22</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Did <persName>Abrahams</persName> and <persName>Rosenthal</persName> really set out to defraud their creditors from the start? It seems
               unlikely. Certainly their businesses failed, perhaps due to poor management on <persName>Rosenthal's</persName> part. Their Independence
               creditors wavered between suspicion based on bigotry and speculation based on greed, letting the latter get the upper hand as they continued to
               extend credit to a troubled operation. And <persName>Abraham M</persName>. <persName>Abrahams</persName> showed his own wiliness as he
               tried to salvage something from his bankruptcy. But it is improbable that a 42-year-old man with a reputation for good character and honesty
               would turn into a ruthless swindler within 18 months.</p>

               <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q9181">Abraham</persName>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> is not found in the <persName>St. Louis</persName> City Directory for 1854-55. He may have operated The
               Peoples Outfitting Store in <placeName>Weston</placeName> from late 1854 through late 1855 or even into 1856, though there is no record of him
               in <placeName>Weston</placeName>. More likely, though, he remained in <persName>St. Louis</persName>, for he was listed as a merchant in
               the St. <pb n="161"/>
               <persName>Louis</persName> City Directory for 1857; two years later, <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q9181">Abraham</persName>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> was shown as a commission merchant and trader, with son Morris, 20, working for him as a clerk and <persName>son Michael</persName>, 18, boarding at the same hotel as <persName>Michael</persName>.</p>
            <p>Between 1858 and July, 1860, when the census was taken, the <persName>Abrahams</persName> family had taken up still another occupation:
                  <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q9181">Abraham</persName>, <persName>Joseph</persName> and <persName>Elias</persName> were all
               listed as pawnbrokers. He was then living at <persName>C.A. Dallam's</persName> boarding house, and evidently the census taker obtained his
               information from the other boarders, since his surname and place of birth are incorrect, as are the ages of <persName>Joseph</persName> and
                  <persName>Elias</persName>, whose place of birth is shown merely as <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> His wife
               was listed as being born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, but her name was given as Mary, not Phebe, and she was
               shown as being 10 years older than she actually was. Because of the other inaccurate information, I am reluctant to consider this evidence for a
               third wife.</p>
            <p>While he was omitted from the Business Directory for 1863, his <persName>son Michael was</persName> listed, and even took out a quarter page
               ad (<ref target="#fig-108">fig. 9</ref>). <persName>Abrahams</persName> returned to the Directory the next two years as a clerk, though his

               College). A <persName>Benjamin Abrahams</persName>, probably a nephew, was in partnership with his <persName>son Joseph</persName>. By
               1865, he appeared as a broker, with other members of the family listed as pawnbrokers or brokers.</p>

            <p>Fortune seemed to smile on him once again, for the Directory for 1867 carried a listing for <persName>A.M. Abrahams</persName> of <persName>Abrahams</persName> &amp; Co., a partnership with <persName>E. Edwin Abrahams</persName>, probably another nephew, to operate

               pawnbroker at his old address. None of the <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q9181">Abraham</persName>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> family remained in the <persName>St. Louis</persName> City Directory for 1870.</p>
            <p>But the story doesn't quite end there, because "<persName>Abrahan Abrahms</persName>," white, born in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, 61, was living in the 5th ward, 10th subdivision, of the City of <persName>St. Louis</persName> when the Census of <pb n="163"/> 1870 was taken. Retired for certain at the age of 60—he would have been 61 on his next birthday—he had finally become independently
               wealthy in the West. No trace has been located of him after that.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>A.M. Abrahams</persName> is remembered today for the brass tokens he issued for his outfitting stores. There are two varieties,
               for The Peoples Outfitting Store in Independence or <placeName>Weston</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Independence variety was the first to be published, in <persName corresp="#viaf_67750325">Charles I</persName>. <persName>Bushnell's</persName> 1858 work on tokens (<ref target="#fig-110">fig. 11</ref>).<ref target="#CH6-n23">23</ref> Though published in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in 1858, <persName>Bushnell</persName> states in the advertisement
               that it had been ready for the press for "more than two years,"<ref target="#CH6-n24">24</ref> though additions had been made to it from time to
               time. The <persName>Abrahams</persName> token was probably not one of these additions, as it is illustrated on plate 2. <persName>Bushnell</persName>, therefore, probably had this Independence token in his collection as early as 1856.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The second <persName>Abrahams</persName> token, marked <placeName>Weston</placeName>, was also listed in the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue
                  of American Store Cards</hi> prepared by a committee of the Numismatic Society of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> and published by Edward Cogan in 1859. The <persName>Abrahams</persName>
               tokens are the first two items listed. <persName>Dr. Mark</persName>
               <persName>W. Collet</persName>, a prominent member of the committee, owned a <placeName>Weston</placeName> token apparently as early as
               this. In any case, <persName>James Ross</persName> Snowden had collected one for the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint Collection in 1859 or 1860, exhibiting it on <persName>Washington's</persName> birthday, 1860.<ref target="#CH6-n25">25</ref> When first known, both <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens were considered great rarities and very desirable, because of the
               bust of Washington on the obverse. <persName>W.C. Prime</persName>, in 1861, lists both pieces at the astonishing price of $1.50 each —more
               than for a half dollar of 1794 or 1795.<ref target="#CH6-n26">26</ref>
            </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-111">

               <p>12. ANS (W.12).</p>
            </figure>
            <p>Both tokens share the same general type (<ref target="#fig-111">fig. 12</ref>). The obverse <pb n="164"/> has a bust of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> right, with "<persName>M.A. ABRAHAMS</persName>" above and "10" below, and three
               six-pointed stars on either side. There is a border of denticles. This die is used with both reverses. According to <persName>Ben
                  Fauver</persName>, the portrait of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> was selected because of his non-partisan
               appeal in a time of heated political debate. While well executed, the portrait has been described as "by no means a flattering one of the Father
               of His Country."<ref target="#CH6-n27">27</ref> The reverse has "THE PEOPLES OUTFITTING STORE" and a single five-pointed star around the
               location, in two lines. As on the obverse, there is a border of denticles. The edge is reeded.</p>
            <p>Though this is the general type, there is a surprising variation among individual specimens. Many seemingly almost uncirculated pieces are weakly
               struck and have a flat strike on the hair. All, or virtually all, of the <placeName>Weston</placeName> tokens have some degree of die
               deterioration on the reverse denticles, including severe die breaks extending to the rim and the denticles over "STORE" looking more like pellets
               than denticles. The obverse centering is uneven, with many specimens off-center toward the top. Planchet cracks are common, and laminations are
               known. There is an astonishing variation in weight from specimen to specimen of more than a gram, from a low of 8.32 g to a high of 9.50 g for
               high grade pieces, and a worn example is as light as 8.09 g. Apparently the mint was not able to control very well the thickness of the brass
               strip from which the planchets were cut.</p>
            <p>Even the diameter varies slightly. This is because, as <persName>John Ford</persName> kindly pointed out to me, the <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens are not struck in a closed collar! The reeding was somehow applied to the blanks first—by broaching, I think—and they
               were allowed to expand after striking, instead of the way used universally today of reeding the edge of a coin or token, by striking it in a
               grooved collar. The evidence of this unusual minting method may be seen in an occasional bifurcated letter, where the metal was allowed to expand
               outward, and in the radial flow lines from the denticles.</p>
            <p>It is clear that the <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens were not made by the leading nineteenth-century maker of merchant tokens, The
               Scovill Manufacturing Company. They are not of the usual Scovill work, are not mentioned in the Scovill correspondence, and were not included in
               the restrikes of Scovill tokens made about 1858-59. Since the head of <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> is not
               used on any other token, the prolific <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> manufacturers can probably be excluded also. Because of <persName>Abraham's</persName> English wife and servant, I thought that they were possibly struck in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName>. However, I showed a piece to Tim <persName>Miller</persName> of Baldwin's, who was the editor of <persName>R.N.P</persName>. <pb n="165"/>
               <persName>Hawkins's</persName> definitive book on makers of <placeName>British</placeName> nineteenth-century metallic tokens and checks,
               and he assured me that they were not of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_london">London</placeName> or <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName> die work.</p>
            <p>Michael Pfefferkorn has suggested that they were made in <persName>St. Louis</persName>, and that there were several die sinkers there at
               that time capable of such work. <persName>Abrahams's</persName> several business and family connections there make this very likely.
               Wherever the mint was located, though, it must have been just starting out with token production, since it had yet to master the niceties of
               strip rolling, die hardening, and edge reeding.</p>
            <p>Why were these tokens issued? There are two possible explanations — as a metal store card or as a trade token. During the 1850s, so many store
               card tokens imitated the design of current <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> gold coins, chiefly $10 gold pieces, for
               use as game counters or poker chips, that <persName>Michael Pfefferkorn</persName> has written of this era as the Spiel Marke Period. The
                  <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens are struck in brass, are the same size as a $10 gold piece, and are even marked with a "10" on the
               obverse. However, they lack both the Liberty head and eagle.</p>
            <p>If they are trade tokens, the "10" must stand for 10 cents. Though there is no precedent for this, half dime tokens of <placeName>German</placeName> silver were issued by <persName>Nicholson's Grocery</persName> of <persName>St. Louis</persName> about this time.
               Certainly there was a shortage of small change along the frontier: <persName>William Paxton's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Annals of Platte County, Mo</hi>. notes, under June 20,1852, "The small coin has all left the country and 'shin-plasters' are
               issued by merchants, redeemable when $5 is presented."<ref target="#CH6-n28">28</ref> While 10 cents seems like a small sum compared to the cost
               of an outfit to travel to <placeName>Oregon</placeName>, <persName>Abrahams</persName> may have needed tokens to pay the local farmers
               for meal, etc. just as twentieth-century general store proprietors did, as Mike Pfefferkorn has suggested to me, or simply to make change for
               purchases by his resident trade. Another possible trade token use is as a metal coupon, to be distributed in <persName>St. Louis</persName>
               to induce emigrants to call on The Peoples Outfitting Store in order to receive their discount.</p>
            <p>While we can only speculate, my preference is for the coin shortage trade token explanation. Though some <persName>Abrahams</persName>
               tokens seem to have sliding wear that we might associate with game counter use, they are not known with the heavy wear often seen on such pieces.
               The design doesn't look much like a gold coin, and they don't seem to turn up in groups, as we might expect for counters. If they were passed out
               in <persName>St. Louis</persName>, there ought to be more Independence tokens than there are, and they should be found there; instead,
               examples with definite find locations have come from the Independence area.</p>
            <p>One of these, no. 1.9 in the appended corpus of Independence <pb n="166"/> tokens, was hoed up about 10 years ago on property originally owned by
                  <persName>Jackson</persName> County pioneer <persName>Dr. Lyddall</persName>
               <persName>W. Twyman</persName>, who lived near the find spot at the very time <persName corresp="#wikidata_Q9181">Abraham</persName>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> kept his store in Independence. This location is west of Independence, close to where the <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName> Trail passed on its way to the <placeName>Missouri</placeName> River. From the 1850-era dime, large cent, and early glass
               also found in the vicinity, the finder, Don Parish, thought that a store may have stood on this site in the 1850s.<ref target="#CH6-n29">29</ref>
               This find is certainly more suggestive of currency than spiel marke use. The token is in rather poor condition, and was not improved by being
               cleaned with a wire brush!</p>
            <p>Another local find is no. W.60 in the appended <placeName>Weston</placeName> corpus, a bad condition piece "found in some junk" and donated to
               the <placeName>Weston</placeName> Historical Museum in 1978, by a non-collecting couple from <placeName>Kansas</placeName> City, <placeName>Kansas</placeName>. Unfortunately, they are no longer at the same address they were in 1978, and have not been located so that more
               details can be learned.</p>
            <p>While the corpus of <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens of Independence and <placeName>Weston</placeName> is very incomplete, especially
               for the <placeName>Weston</placeName> tokens, it at least allows us to establish a minimum number of survivors. For Independence, there are at
               least 10 and probably 11 different specimens among the 18 appearances shown; of course, there are probably more in existence than this. This will
               necessitate a revision of <persName>Bruce Smith's</persName> estimate of from 5 to 8 survivors. <persName>John</persName> Ford wrote me
               that he estimates the rarity to be High R6 to Low R7, on the Sheldon scale, or about 10 to 20 pieces. This seems to me to be about right.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>Weston</placeName> token is probably too common to be counted accurately by a census such as this, as many are held in smaller
               collections which are generally missed. Incomplete as it is, the corpus nevertheless contains at least 41 and probably 44 different pieces out of
               about 100 appearances mentioned. Once again, Bruce Smiths estimate of 50-75 pieces in existence seems low, though I cannot prove that more than
               75 specimens exist. However, other specialists have provided me with much higher numbers: Steve Tanenbaum, over 100; <persName>George
                  Fuld</persName>, 150 or more; and <persName>John Ford</persName>, Rarity 3 "at best" on the Sheldon scale, or 201 to 500! My own guess,
               subject to revision, is about 100 to 150, or about three to four times the minimum number known. I think that the higher estimates are due to
               these tokens tending to concentrate in the hands of a few specialists, and thus seeming to be commoner than they really are. In fact, they are
               quite scarce compared to other tokens of the period.</p>
            <p>Can we estimate the original mintage with any degree of confidence <pb n="167"/> from these figures? Assuming that the Independence token was
               issued first, a characteristic ratio of 2% would give an original mintage of 500 to 1,000 if 10 to 20 pieces exist. This would equal a face value
               of $50 to $100 if the tokens were intended as dimes, which seems reasonable to me. We are probably unlikely to get any closer than this, though I
               favor $50 face as a more reasonable amount.</p>
            <p>But if even 500 pieces were minted, you may well ask, where are the other 480 to 490? I suspect that <persName>A.M. Abrahams</persName>
               destroyed them himself when he relocated his store, sending those on hand back to the mint to be recoined with his new address. This would
               explain the total absence of high grade pieces. The <placeName>Weston</placeName> pieces, on the other hand, are mostly leftovers, with very
               few worn pieces, since the second store was open such a short time. The original mintage was probably about the same, say 500.</p>
            <p>When I started this project I thought that the high grade pieces might be restrikes of the 1860s, as the price of <placeName>Weston</placeName> tokens fell from $1.50 in 1861 to 12 cents in 1884. However, as a result of studying the degree of die deterioration for
               specimens of various conditions, it appears that at least one well-used piece is from a more deteriorated die than another piece in nearly
               uncirculated condition. So I now think that all <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens are original strikes of the 1850s, and that the
               uncirculated/about uncirculated pieces are simply remainders.</p>
            <p>There is one other mystery that is not yet cleared up, however: the date of issue of the <placeName>Weston</placeName> tokens. As stated
               earlier, there is no record of <persName>Abraham M</persName>. <persName>Abrahams</persName> ever being in <placeName>Weston</placeName>. This is all the more surprising, since Paxton's <hi rend="italic">Annals of Platte County</hi> lists all the business men at
                  <placeName>Weston</placeName> year by year from the 1840s through the 1860s, yet <persName>Abrahams</persName> is never mentioned at
               all.</p>
            <p>We know that all the <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens have a die sinker's error on the obverse: his initials are given as "<persName>M.A</persName>." instead of the correct "<persName>A.M</persName>." Apparently the die sinker was <hi rend="italic">also</hi> a
               beginner at the token business, for after carefully laying out the name "<persName>ABRAHAMS</persName>" in the correct letter order over the
               head of Washington, he next punched in the initials "<persName>A.M</persName>." so that they looked correct on the die. Unfortunately, he
               forgot that this reversed them on the actual token!</p>
            <p>Could he have made an even more egregious error on the second reverse die? We know that <persName>Abrahams</persName> had a store in
               Westport, <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, during most of 1854. Westport is the closest town to Independence, while <placeName>Weston</placeName> is a considerable distance farther up the river, though it was much more famous at this time. Suppose that <pb n="168"/>
               <persName>Abrahams</persName> never was in <placeName>Weston</placeName>, as seems likely, but when he ordered the tokens for his store
               in Westport he did so orally, and the die sinker—who perhaps had never heard of Westport—thought he said <placeName>Weston</placeName>? Or
               perhaps the die sinker simply neglected to make a memorandum of the order, and just assumed that <placeName>Weston</placeName> must have been
               the West- town meant.</p>
            <p>Bizarre as this sounds, there are a number of similar die sinker's blunders in the Civil War token series of about 10 years later. And the only
                  <placeName>Weston</placeName> token with a record of being found in <placeName>Missouri</placeName> known to me came from the <hi rend="italic">
                  <placeName>Kansas</placeName> City</hi> area, adjacent to Westport (which has now been swallowed up by <placeName>Kansas</placeName>
               City, <placeName>Missouri</placeName>) but quite far from <placeName>Weston</placeName>. If this theory is correct, then, the "Weston"
               tokens were actually issued in Westport, <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, between late 1853 and November 1854.</p>

               <p>I have had so much help in preparing this paper that my efforts amount almost to a synthesis of the work of others rather than an original
                  study. First, anything said about the <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens necessarily builds on the research of <persName>Bruce
                     Smith</persName>, who first examined the Census of 1850 record for <persName>Abrahams</persName> in detail. Of great value has been the
                  research of local historian Ray Maier of Sibley, MO, who generously shared his findings with me, sent marked copies of the original
                  documentation, provided information on the <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName> Trail Association 1993 symposium, and answered my question. Mike
                  Pfefferkorn of <persName>St. Louis</persName> made a special trip to the <persName>St. Louis</persName> Public Library to check the
                     <persName>St. Louis</persName> city directories and census records for 1860 to 1890, providing copies of the originals in many cases.
                  Steve Tanenbaum looked up <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the <persName>Abrahams</persName> families in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> directories in his library for the time when <persName>Abrahams</persName> is presumed to have lived there. <persName>Joe Levine</persName> checked the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> directories that he has on microfiche from 1837 through 1847, and provided
                  data on auction sales of <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens. <persName>Richard Doty</persName> checked the <persName>St.
                     Louis</persName> city directory for 1847 and 1848 for <persName>Abrahams</persName> listings. <persName>Pat O'Brien's</persName>
                  research on <persName>Louis Tappan's</persName> credit reports, as presented in his paper, "Jewish Traders on the <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName> Trail," at the <placeName>Santa Fe</placeName> Trail Association symposium, September 25, 1993, proved extremely
                  valuable in interpreting <persName>Abrahams's</persName> activities in Independence and <persName>St. Louis</persName>. <persName>Mrs. Etta M. Brill</persName>, curator of the <placeName>Weston</placeName> Historical Museum, provided quotations from early
                  historical records, photographs, and information on the tokens in their collection. Mark Goldberg allowed me to consult the Superior Stamp
                  &amp; Coin/A-Mark library. Paul Bosco advised me of the sale of an <persName>Abrahams</persName> token in one of his auctions. And a
                  number of museum curators, collectors, and dealers in merchant tokens have generously shared information on their holdings, going so far as to
                  weigh their <persName>Abrahams</persName> tokens for me. Whenever possible, I verified the sources cited, and all conclusions presented
                  are my own.</p>

            <p>The Civil War token occupies a unique place in American numismatics. Used as a substitute for money, it filled a specific need for the populace
               and the merchants alike, and ushered in a new industry. The method of selling and delivering these tokens probably started in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> in the seventeenth century. Route salesmen, already selling hard goods to the local merchants, took
               on the line of custom advertising tokens (manufactured by one of the major die sinkers such as <persName>Scovill</persName>, Child's or
               Staunton). If the merchants couldn't afford approximately $8.50 per thousand custom tokens, the peddlar would sell one of his stock issues for
               $6.50 or so per thousand—still enough to realize a decent profit. These were sold throughout the Eastern <placeName>United States</placeName>
               (mainly <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>) and the Central <placeName>United States</placeName>. The
               amazing success of this merchandising system resulted in over 10,000 different varieties of tokens being produced with a total outpouring of well
               over 25,000,000 copies in circulation. A small percentage of these tokens were issued or reissued (restrikes) for private collectors (such as
                  <persName>Edward Groh</persName> and <persName>J. N. T. Levick</persName>), but the vast majority of these varieties circulated
               extensively. The writer received a specimen in his pocket change in the 1950's, which may have been an accidental loss from a collection.</p>
            <p>The Civil War gave rise to many innovations in coinage and currency as well as introducing various emergency specie. The Civil War period not
               only produced the Civil War token, but other widespread changes in our monetary system. The paper money of today is such an essential part of our
               everyday life that it is hard to realize that a valid system of paper currency (basically the green-backs) has existed only 135 years. The first
               fractional currency (shinplasers) were issued during the war. Towards the end of the war, the two cent piece and nickel three cent were struck.
               The now familiar motto "In God We Trust" was introduced, eventually finding its way to all coins except the cent. The first bronze Indian head
               cents were issued as patterns in 1863 and achieved general circulation in 1864. These sweeping changes have had a lasting effect on our current
               monetary system. We have only mentioned currency in the North to date. The Confederacy issued numerous forms of paper currency—government, state,
               county and private issues. Until recent years these "emergency" issues have never received the numismatic prominence they deserve. Even the
               metallic issues of the Confederacy, although very limited, are a very important reminder of the fiscal chaos that existed in the South. One can
               assume that the virtual lack of tokens issued in the Confederate States was due to the fact that all established private minters were located <pb n="183"/> in the Norh.<ref target="#CH7-n1">1</ref> The few issues by border states are mostly non-contemporary in nature.</p>
            <p>The Civil War gave rise to numerous forms of emergency specie (for small change), the variety and ingenuity of which has never been equalled.
               Early in 1862 all metallic currency was gradually withdrawn from circulation because citizens anticipating the possible increase in the value of
               all metals, commenced hoarding gold, silver and even copper. One can imagine the chaos that was created in the conducting of everyday business.
               There was no way to make change and the merchants were forced to resort to some means of promoting a method of exchange.</p>
            <p>The first attempt at making change (without metal) was the use of ordinary <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> postage
               stamps. Because of their flimsy nature, these stamps had a very short circulation life. Next, the merchants obtained very small envelopes,
               generally with an advertisement printed on them, so that stamps could have some protection. These envelopes were generally measured about 2×1½
               inches (oblong), printed by merchant stationers in black ink, mostly from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName> City. All issues surviving are very rare. In 1862, <persName>John Gault</persName> patented a novel brass encasing for the
               stamps, with a mica cover so that the stamps could be readily visible, a topic dealt with in detail by <persName>Wayne Homren.</persName>
               <ref target="#CH7-n2">2</ref> They were exclusively manufactured by <persName>Scovill</persName> Manufacturing Co. in <placeName>Waterbury</placeName>, Conn, with merchants' advertisements on one side and circulated in denominations of one to ninety cents. These encased
               stamps had one major disadvantage which limited their use—they cost too much to issue since the stamps alone represented face value.</p>
            <p>The use of copper tokens as a method of trade was started back in 1789 with the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName> Mott tokens, the <persName>Talbot</persName>, <persName>Allum</persName> and <persName>Lee</persName> tokens of
               1794, and reached a high point during the hard times period of 1830 to 1837.<ref target="#CH7-n3">3</ref> Most of these tokens were of large cent
               size, had a considerable amount of copper making them relatively expensive. The manufacturing of the <persName>U.S.</persName> small cent in
               1857, led to the issue and acceptance of tokens in this small size containing only a fraction of a cent of copper. These tokens were not only a
               convenience to the merchants; they profited several tenths of a cent on each coin put into circulation.</p>
            <p>Due to further need of change substitutes, various forms of fractional, privately issued paper currency appeared. Because it had so little
               intrinsic value (hard currency backing), it did not meet wide acceptance even though it circulated rapidly at first. Small size card-board scrip
               circulated in small denominations (several issuers of tokens also issued this type scrip). It disappeared quickly so that <pb n="184"/> all
               issues are quite rare. Concurrently banks and municipalities issued paper currency in values under a dollar. Since the solvency of many of these
               entities also was questionable, they were mistrusted from their inception and forced better currency out of circulation according to <placeName>Gresham's</placeName> law.<ref target="#CH7-n4">4</ref>

            <p>The most popular and realistic form of emergency specie was the small copper coins. Often imitative of Government cents, they first circulated in
               Cincinnati and <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> in late 1862. These coppers, generally the size and near
               the weight of the small bronze cent, met with general acceptance.<ref target="#CH7-n5">5</ref> In the spring of 1863 the Lindenmueller tokens
               were issued in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>—a million pieces being struck.<ref target="#CH7-n6">6</ref>
               <persName>William H. Bridgens</persName> then issued the Knickerbocker ones (many of the patriotic type—see following paragraph) in
               quantities in many varieties.</p>
            <p>Two general types of tokens were issued—the patriotic tokens and the tradesmen's cards. The patriotic series, mainly issued in and around <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, had patriotic slogans on the coins, and bore no merchant's advertisements.
               Many of the specimens were in general an imitation of the currently popular Indian cent. Today, after five editions of the Fuld monograph, the
               number of patriotic varieties has grown from slightly over 1,500 to over 1,800 varieties.<ref target="#CH7-n7">7</ref> The tradesmen's cards were
               issued from 23 states and almost 300 towns. As listed in the 1972 edition of "<placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U. S.</placeName> Civil
               War Store Cards,"<ref target="#CH7-n8">8</ref> there were 8,555 varieties listed. An additional 180 or so new varieties were added by <persName>Jon Harris</persName> from studies of the ANS collection and incorporated in the second edition of <persName>Fuld</persName> in
               1975. Others have been published in the CWTS Journal over the years, and will be incorporated in a forthcoming third edition.</p>
            <p>These tokens, mostly of the small cent size (a few were large cent size and some on two cent size flans) were commonly accepted as a means of
               exchange for the value, which was almost always one cent. It should be emphasized that merchants could make a tidy profit (in the preinflation
               days when a cent could actually buy something), as the copper value in them was only 23/100ths of a cent. They also were undoubtedly a source of
               great relief and convenience.</p>
            <p>However, since they could not be redeemed in quantity for <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U. S.</placeName> currency they became a
               problem that soon attracted the attention of the Federal government. <persName>Hetrich &amp; Guttag</persName> stated that the Third Avenue
               Railroad of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> requested <persName>Lindenmueller</persName> to redeem
               a large number of tokens, which they had accepted in the course of business, but this he laughingly refused to do so.<ref target="#CH7-n9">9</ref> The railroad had no recourse, and it is likely that incidents such as this <pb n="185"/> forced the hand of the government. The
               outpouring of bronze cents and fractional currency were still not sufficient to suppress the Civil War cents then current. Finally, in 1864, an
               act of Congress for-bade any private individuals to issue any form of money. As far as one can ascertain the Federal government did not try to
               press counterfeiting charges against any of the die sinkers before 1864.<ref target="#CH7-n10">10</ref> Thus ended an era—one that has been slow
               to be recognized by numismatists.</p>
            <p>In 1952, my father <persName>Melvin</persName> and myself contacted <persName>Scovill</persName> Mfg. Co. in <placeName>Waterbury</placeName>, <placeName>CT</placeName>, to see if they had any information on tokens issued by their firm in the nineteenth century.
               Fortunately, they had a retired employee, <persName>Edward H. Davis</persName>, who served as historian for them until his death in his late
               nineties in 1977. He was a member of the 1900 class at MIT and had a keen interest in <persName>Scovill's</persName> historical past,
               especially their buttons, tokens and medals. Several articles, mostly indexing series on Civil War Tokens were written jointly with <persName>Davis</persName> and published in the NSM in the early 1950s.<ref target="#CH7-n11">11</ref>
               <persName>Davis</persName> also authored a most intriguing monograph about the <persName>Lafayette</persName> button of 1824.<ref target="#CH7-n12">12</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Although a good deal of early <persName>Scovill</persName> records were destroyed by two serious fires in the 1830's and one in February
               1881, <persName>Davis</persName> indicated that many of the remaining records were stored at <placeName>Waterbury</placeName>, and others
               given to the Library of Congress.<ref target="#CH7-n13">13</ref> If memory serves, <persName>Walter Breen</persName> and the writer
               attempted to view the documents at the Library, but were told they were unavailable. Recent inquiries by our convener, <persName>Richard
                  Doty</persName>, elicited the location of 400 volumes of <persName>Scovill</persName> data that were initially at <placeName corresp="#geonames_2293888">Yale</placeName> and now at the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4938981">Harvard</placeName> Business School's <persName>Baker</persName> Library in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. When a 65-page summary index was obtained in
               the summer of 1994, there were almost a dozen volumes of various records of the 1860-65 period. A trip to the library, with the aid of their
               research archivist, <persName>Laura Linard</persName>, resulted in volumes of decayed leather dust but little hard evidence.</p>
            <p>The "Day Books" in the <persName>Scovill</persName> collection, Volumes 7, 8, and 9, recorded all the day by day invoicing of various
               merchandise from the Waterbury plant.<ref target="#CH7-n14">14</ref> This included such diverse products as sabres, cannon, eagles and eagle
               plates, reflectors, rivets, bugles and trumpets, but for further processing included brass (soft, scrap, oval wire and coarse), <placeName>German</placeName> silver, lead, silver, spring scrap and sheet plate but no specific references to tokens or medals in the period
               examined (over 1,000 pages).</p>
            <p>One of the few direct numismatic entries stated that 300 copper blanks were sold to <persName>J. Bolen</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_2633563">Worcester</placeName> on May 5,1864 (COD <pb n="186"/> basis), at 5 cents apiece.<ref target="#CH7-n15">15</ref> Direct
               evidence exists that <persName>Scovill</persName> made many of the tokens. We found about eight different completely unknown mulings of
               Civil War tokens, well struck and uncirculated, from the tool box of the noted engraver <persName>Jarvis E. Ellis</persName> at the factory.
               The mules include the following (all patriotics), Fuld nos. 174/233, 174/189, 189/231, and 231/399.<ref target="#CH7-n16">16</ref> There were
               several store card mules, listed in the store card book, but a diligent search would be required to recall them. This list is only partially
               complete, but the existence and background of these unique mules has not been previously published. The mules made no logical sense, no
               duplicates have ever been found, and they are retained as part of the historical records of Scovill. When we examined all the retained examples
               of <persName>Scovill</persName> over the course of several years, it is obvious that a large number of pieces, including some English medals
               and tokens, were competitive samples accumulated for comparison. Somehow, the records of these <persName>Scovill</persName> issues are not
               noted in the Day Books we examined, and we did not feel comfortable assuming that they called them buttons as a disguise. We examined what few
               letters were available (especially in 1828-30 period) but found no further record of tokens. I remember that <persName>Davis</persName>
               found a record of the <persName>Gasquet</persName>, Parish token of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_orleans">New Orleans</placeName> and
               mintage at one time, we but could not locate this in the <placeName corresp="#geonames_4938981">Harvard</placeName> holding.<ref target="#CH7-n17">17</ref>

            <p>The evidence of the dies that remained at <persName>Scovill</persName> in the early 1950s must be considered. <persName>Davis</persName> thought that most were useless historically, the majority thought to be late issues. In the early 1970s, <persName>Bruce Bazelon</persName> of the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> Historical Society helped to distribute the dies.<ref target="#CH7-n18">18</ref> Items from as early as 1840 were found. Because of the <persName>Fulds</persName>' special interest, <persName>E.H.
                  Davis</persName> tried to find Civil War token dies among the remainders. A single die was found, which matches <persName>Fuld</persName>
               patriotic die no. 174, a relatively common patriotic piece which circulated in the <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName> area. This was a massive die, round in shape, measuring nearly 3" in diameter and 4" high. The top was <pb n="187"/> a 1" square
               hub for attachment to the coining press, and the die was engraved on the flat bottom surface—no collar was evident. We did make several strikings
               (or splashers) from the die in lead and gold. Unfortunately the die disappeared in the early 1960s, after a coin exhibition. I recall seeing a
               die trial of the 174 die in lead with no date, but am not aware where it reposes (see Fuld 174/Inc). This "lost-again" die was presented to the
                  <persName>Fulds</persName> with company management permission about 1953. It did show some discoloration from a fire, but the surfaces
               were intact.</p>

            <p>The literature on Civil War tokens up to the epic publication of <persName>Hetrich</persName> and <persName>Guttag</persName> in 1924
               is interesting, but quite spotty. The first publication noted was by <persName>Pliney E. Chase</persName> in the Journal of the American
               Philosophical Society in 1863.<ref target="#CH7-n19">19</ref> It listed several hundred pieces but with no detail. In an irregular serial listing
               in <hi rend="italic">AJN</hi> from 1866 to 1869, an anonymous listing of "Copperheads" appeared.<ref target="#CH7-n20">20</ref> This series might
               have been authored by <persName>Edward Groh</persName> or <persName>J.N.T. Levick</persName>. Some years later, another anonymous
               listing of "Civil War Tokens" appeared in <persName>Scott's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">Coin Collector's Journal</hi> in 1882 and 1883.<ref target="#CH7-n21">21</ref> Then in 1916, <persName corresp="#numismatics_adams_edgar">Edgar H.

The <persName>Adams</persName> listing was fully illustrated and the plates and text were the initial basis for <persName>Hetrich</persName>
               and <persName>Guttag</persName>. In addition, there were a number of fine articles, mostly on single merchants, in <hi rend="italic">The
                  Numismatist</hi> from 1912 to 1920, mostly by Edgar <persName>Adams</persName> and <persName>Waldo C. Moore</persName>. Publication
               activity on Civil War tokens ceased for the most part when <persName>Hetrich</persName> and <placeName>Guttag's</placeName> opus appeared
               in 1924.<ref target="#CH7-n23">23</ref> This was a complete listing (at that time) of all Civil War patriotic and store cards known.</p>
            <p>Serious written research began again 20 years later when the next major contribution to the literature as a series was a group of articles by
                  <persName>Joseph Barnett</persName> in the 1943 and 1944 issues of <hi rend="italic">The Numismatist</hi>, concluding in the 1945 <hi rend="italic">Numismatic Review</hi>,<ref target="#CH7-n24">24</ref>
               <persName>Barnett</persName> completely revised both the patriotic and store card series adding about 1,000 new varieties and correcting
               listings of about 200 pieces in an erratum. Little additional information about Civil War tokens as a whole was published until 1959 with the
               appearance of the <persName>Fuld</persName> publications.<ref target="#CH7-n25">25</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Various specialized books or articles allude to Civil War tokens; there are also some articles on single issuers, many of which were first listed
               in these specialized publication. These include <persName>W.S. Baker</persName> (1885);<ref target="#CH7-n26">26</ref> Howard Kurth in

            <p>It is important to emphasize the complete involvement of the Civil War Token Society (CWTS) in the furtherance of Civil War token knowledge.
               Starting in 1967, the <hi rend="italic">CWTS Journal</hi> has continually published articles by various authors, especially in regard to detailed

               <persName>Dr. Larkin Wilson</persName> has pioneered the study of the composition of off-metal varieties of the Civil War tokens, mostly
               published in the CWTS Journal.<ref target="#CH7-n35">35</ref> It is interesting to realize that although Copper was the main token fabric, brass
               was used for many issues (with <pb n="191"/> no copper intended), mainly in the <placeName>Albany</placeName> and <placeName>Troy</placeName>
               <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> area. In a paper presented to the 1985 ANA convention, <persName>Dr. Wilson</persName> summarized all the readily obtainable characteristics of the various planchet types of Civil War tokens.<ref target="#CH7-n36">36</ref> There are listed 13 (2 types occur only on storecards) different metal types, excluding struck overtypes as shown
               in Table 1. The various "simple" characteristics readily obtainable (see Table 2) are diameter and thickness (mm), weight (g), ping or ring
               characteristic, color (most useful on uncirculated specimens), touchstone procedure, magnetism, and the slightly more difficult specific gravity
               requiring a scale with at least two-place accuracy and a method to weigh in water. Electron microprobe analysis has been run on a number of
               specimens, but this does have a moderate cost at an independent testing laboratory (university connections might have this done at no cost).<ref target="#CH7-n37">37</ref> The amount of data assembled by the <persName>Wilson</persName> project is voluminous. the following is a
               summary of one of the more interesting results. The <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> area used a material
               previously called "lead"—however X-ray microprobe studies show that the bluish types with an oxide layer are mainly lead with a specific gravity
               of 10.0-11.0, while the dark black pieces are mostly zinc with a specific gravity of 7.0-7.3. These "lead" pieces circulated almost exclusively
               in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>. A number of issues are known struck over <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> copper-nickel (C-N) cents, and on rare occasions over <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> liberty seated dimes (as well as sometimes over quarters and some English silver).</p>

            <p>Many issues are known in early die states in the various off-metals. (Did the private collectors contract to have off-metals struck at the very
               beginning of the issue?) With the large collector base of Civil War tokens today, maybe the time has come to make a concerted study of the issue
               order of the off-metal varieties. At present, all off-metal varieties are collected as fully contemporary (with a few obvious exceptions).
               Exceptions for instance, are the use of a Civil War die with merchants or addresses only valid after 1865 for the other side.</p>
            <p>It has now been almost 50 years since I attended the 1947 ANA Buffalo Convention, an altruistic lad of 15. There I met two "diehard" collectors,
                  <persName>Bill Jacka</persName> of <placeName corresp="#geonames_5165418">Ohio</placeName> and <persName>Bill Wild</persName> of
                  <placeName corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</placeName>. They convinced me that collecting regular <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> coins was frivolous, and I should collect patterns and Civil War cents. I heeded their advice and
               traded in my entire <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> collection (it wasn't too bad) in 1949 to <persName>Dave
                  Bullowa</persName> for the <persName>Joseph Barnett</persName> collection of Civil War tokens. My father and myself became immersed in this
               field—for the next 40 years—not only were they interesting, but the base cost in 1948 was six cents apiece for unpicked pieces.</p>
            <pb n="193"/>
            <p>Certainly my involvement with the tokens has been rewarding and we have made friends throughout the <placeName>United States</placeName> with
               fellow enthusiasts. I only hope that some of the younger numismatists of today can find as an exciting field of study that is in need of some
               scholarly study.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Throughout history, times of war have been times of great upheaval and change. Hostilities greatly alter local and national economies. The
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Civil War brought about vast changes in the circulating money of the nation.
                  Citizens on both sides of the conflict began hoarding gold and silver, and before long there was a severe shortage of coins in circulation.
                  Commerce began to suffer, and soon the population resorted to all manner of substitutes for small change.</p>
               <p>Some grocers took to filling packets with 25 cents worth of flour, to be given in change in place of quarters. Other merchants and individuals
                  began printing their own paper money in small denominations to be used as change. These promissory "scrip" notes could be redeemed only by
                  their issuers. Shoppers found themselves with pocketfuls of IOU's at the end of the day, each good only at the place of issue.</p>
               <p>Postage stamps were also pressed into service. While these had a universal value, they also had a severe drawback: once soiled by circulation,
                  they would be worthless as postage. The adhesive backing posed further problems. Humidity and moisture from people's hands caused the stamps
                  to stick to whatever surface they came in contact with.</p>
               <p>One solution was to place stamps inside protective envelopes, with the value written on the outside of the envelope. Printers and merchants
                  eased the burden by producing small envelopes with values printed on the outside. While the envelopes protected the stamps, they did not

               </head>
               <p>An entrepreneur from <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName> named <persName>John Gault</persName> devised a solution
                  to this dilemma: the encased postage stamp. <persName>Gault's</persName> invention provided a way to protect stamps while still allowing
                  them to be seen. The stamps were laid on a brass disk with a small piece of cardboard backing between. Atop the stamp was placed a disk of
                  clear mica. Finally, a brass frame was bent around the sandwich, locking <pb n="199"/> the components together. About the size of a quarter,
                     <persName>Gault's</persName> encasement allowed stamps to circulate without fear of damage or fraud.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Gault</persName> received a patent for his invention on August 12, 1862, and contracted their production to the <persName>Scovill</persName> Manufacturing Company. Since encased stamps would circulate at the face value of the stamp, <persName>Gault</persName> needed a way to cover the cost of their manufacture (not to mention his profit margin). His solution to this problem was as
                  American as apple pie: he sold advertising on the back of the stamp case!</p>
               <p>Merchants would pay <persName>Gault</persName> a premium to produce encased postage stamps with their message on the back. Eventually 31
                  merchants (including <persName>Gault</persName> himself) would advertise 34 different products on his encasements. Each piece carried its
                  message from person to person as it changed hands in the marketplace. <persName>Gault's</persName> advertisers included some of the
                  biggest merchandisers of the day. Amazingly, some of these businesses are still in operation today: the Lord &amp; Taylor department store
                     (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>), Shillito's department store (Cincinnati), and Bailey, Banks
                  &amp; Biddle jewelers.</p>
               <p>Eight denominations of stamps were used in <persName>Gault's</persName> encasements: 1<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, 5<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, 10<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, 12<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, 24<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, 30<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, and 90<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>. The four smallest denominations corresponded to circulating coins and are the most common. The larger odd-value denominations were
                  used only for postage and would have been more difficult to use in circulation. The 24<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, 30<hi rend="sup">¢</hi>, and
                     90<hi rend="sup">¢</hi> encasements are very rare.</p>

                  <persName>John Gault</persName> was born in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> in 1831 to Irish immigrants
                     <persName>John Gault, Sr</persName>. and <persName>Mary Ann Magee</persName> (born 1798). He had two brothers and one sister:
                  older brother <persName>Henry</persName> (born 1827), younger brother <persName>Samuel</persName> (born 1839) and sister <persName>Ann. Around</persName> 1840 the family moved to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>. The senior <persName>Gault</persName> passed away in 1847. The discovery of gold in 1849 enticed young <persName>John</persName> to <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> in search of his fortune. He embarked on a ship sailing around the Horn of <placeName corresp="#geonames_6255146">Africa</placeName>. He visited several <placeName>South American</placeName> countries along the six
                  month voyage. After five years in <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> he returned to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, where he worked in a machine shop and lived with his mother and 16-year-old brother Samuel.</p>
               <p>
                  <persName>John Gault's</persName> skill as a machinist, combined with his entrepenurial zeal, led him to patent several inventions,
                  including a lock stitch device for sewing machines, an illuminated coal hole cover, and an eraser sharpener. As the nation headed toward the
                  Civil War, he turned his attention to armaments, patenting three kinds of artillery <pb n="200"/> shells. <ref target="#fig-125">Fig. 1</ref>

               <p>Later that same month, on July 24, <persName>Gault</persName> applied for the patent for which he is known in numismatic and philatelic
                  circles today—a "Design for Postage Stamp Case" (<ref target="#fig-126">fig. 2</ref>). The patent drawing is still on file at the National
                  Archives in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName>. The drawing shows seven figures of varying sizes. The
                  accompanying documentation has been lost over the years. The original patent model somehow escaped that fate. It was recently sold at auction
                  by <persName>Bowers and Merena</persName>. The patent model features a 10 cent <placeName corresp="#geonames_4140963">Washington</placeName> stamp. The reverse shows the words "<persName>John Gault</persName> Business Card" in script lettering. Attached is
                  a file card inscribed with the name and date of the patent (<ref target="#fig-127">fig. 3</ref>).</p>

                  <persName>John Gault</persName> was 31 years old when his Encased Postage patent was granted on August 12th, 1862. Four days later, on
                  August 16th, his younger brother <persName>Samuel</persName>, now 23 and employed as a bookkeeper, enlisted with the 38th Regiment of the
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName> Volunteers. <persName>Samuel</persName> was commissioned as a
                  captain on December 4th, 1862. In that same year their 64 year-old mother was diagnosed with insanity.</p>

               <p>With his mother under medical care and his younger brother off fighting the war, <persName>Gault</persName> began manufacturing his new
                  product. Among the first encased postage stamps produced were those bearing the name of the inventor. These were undoubtably created by <persName>Gault</persName> to double as advertising pieces for his own business and samples for potential advertising clients. These pieces
                  were inscribed simply "Pat Aug 12, 1862" (top) and "<persName>J. Gault</persName>" (bottom). These encasements were produced in all eight
                  standard denominations:</p>

               <p>Since <persName>Gault</persName> had lived in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_boston">Boston</placeName>, it seems natural that many of
                  the issuers of encased postage stamps were based in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6254926">Massachusetts</placeName>. The largest of these
                  was <persName>J. C. Ayer</persName> &amp; Co. of <persName>Lowell, MA. Ayer</persName> manufactured medicines (<ref target="#fig-129">fig. 5</ref>). His products were used around the world. Three different <persName>Ayer's</persName> messages graced
                     <persName>Gault's</persName> encased postage stamps: <persName>Ayer's Cathartic</persName> Pills, <persName>Ayer's</persName> Sarsaparilla, and Take <persName>Ayer's</persName> Pills. <persName>Ayer's</persName> pieces are the most common
                  of all encased postage stamps. A total of six New <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName> merchants issued <persName>Gault's</persName> encasements.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>James Cook Ayer</persName> was born in <placeName>Ledyard</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> on May 5, 1818.
                  His parents were <persName>Persis Cook Ayer</persName> (born May 8, 1796) and <persName>Frederick Ayer</persName> (born August 17,
                  1792). His younger brother <persName>Frederick Ayer, Jr</persName>. was born on December 8, 1822. There were two sisters, <persName>Fanny</persName> and <persName>Laurisa</persName>.</p>
               <p>When the senior <persName>Ayer</persName> died in 1825, <persName corresp="#nomisma_persis">Persis</persName> moved the family to
                  the nearby town of <placeName>Preston</placeName>, where her father operated a flannel mill. Young <persName>J.C. Ayer</persName> had
                  his first mechanical training in the mill. He later moved to <persName>Lowell, MA</persName> to live with his uncle <persName>James Cook</persName>. <persName>Cook</persName> had served as a corporal in the War of 1812; he was a manufacturer and was one of the
                  early mayors of <persName>Lowell</persName>. As brother <persName>Frederick</persName> wrote many years later: <q>Uncle <persName>James Cook</persName>...became acquainted with my brother, took a fancy to him, took him with him to <pb n="204"/>
                     <persName>Lowell</persName>, and sent him to Westford Academy to complete his education. After graduation, <persName>James</persName> took a clerkship with <persName>Mr. Robbins</persName> in his drugstore [in the summer of 1838], and boarded with
                     Uncle <persName>James</persName>; and as Uncle <persName>James</persName> had no children, I have always understood that my
                     brother supplied that place to some extent, making himself both useful and entertaining, for both of which qualities he had a rare gift.
                     During his leisure hours in the store he applied himself to the study of the compounding of medicine, and qualified as a physician. <persName>Mr. Robbins</persName>' place, being a leading drug store in the city, was much visited by the physicians which gave <persName>James</persName> a rare opportunity of becoming familiar with them, and many of them became interested in him to the extent of
                     taking him with them if they had unusual cases or operations.</q>
                  <q>After about two years with <persName>Mr. Robbins James</persName> purchased the store and ran it under his own name.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>J. C. Ayer</persName> purchased the drug store in April 1841. He was just 23 years old. The purchase Price was $2,486.61, which
                  he borrowed from his uncle and repaid in three years. As reported by <persName>Frederick</persName>: <q>The business suggested to <persName>James</persName> the need of some standard remedy which physicians could order for coughs and colds. This suggestion was warmly
                     approved by the doctors; and the result, <persName>Cherry Pectoral</persName>, was generally ordered by them for those complaints.
                     Without other notice its fame grew until the demand induced him to put it up for the general market. From this time the business of
                     supplying the market absorbed him so much that he took...a partner to run the drug store.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On November 14, 1850, 32 year-old <persName>J. C. Ayer</persName> married <persName>Josephine Mellen Southwick</persName>. The
                  couple purchased a large historic stone tavern on Pawtucket Street as their residence. They had three children: <persName>Frederick
                     Fanning</persName>, <persName>Henry Southwick</persName>, and <persName>Lesley Josephine</persName>. As a relative wrote in an 1859
                  letter: <q>
                     <persName>Mrs. Ayer</persName> is a jolly, easy woman,...very girlish in her ways and quite witty. They live in an immense stone
                     house. It is furnished quite nicely and handsomely, but there is little display....</q>
               </p>
               <p>In 1855 <persName>Ayer</persName> sent for his brother <persName>Frederick</persName>, who was managing a general store in <placeName>Syracuse</placeName>, <placeName>NY</placeName>, and invited him to become his business partner. <persName>Frederick</persName> sold his interest in the general store and returned to <persName>Lowell</persName> where he became a one-third
                  partner in <persName>J.C. Ayer</persName>
                  <pb n="205"/> &amp; Co. <persName>Frederick</persName> lived with his brother's family until his own marriage in December, 1858. As <persName>Frederick</persName> wrote in his Reminiscenes: <q>When I went into the business with my brother the only medicine he had
                     perfected and put upon the market was <persName>Cherry Pectoral</persName>...My brother was at that time at work on a pill for general
                     use, which was soon after put on the market as <persName>Ayer's Cathartic</persName> Pills. Subsequently, through much labor
                     investigation, experimentation, and study, the Sarsaparilla and Hair Vigor were also put on the market, and all of the medicines soon
                     became very popular.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Extensive advertising was a key element in the success of <persName>J.C. Ayer</persName> &amp; Company. The products were promoted
                  heavily through newspaper advertisements and giveaway flyers and pamphlets. By 1871 <persName>Ayer's</persName> products were advertised
                  in 2,000 newspapers. The company gave away millions of <persName>Ayer's</persName> Almanacs each year (<ref target="#fig-130">fig.
                     6</ref>). These Alamancs were filled with advertisements and testimonials for Ayer products. The company eventually purchased its own
                  printing plant.</p>
               <p>One interesting international incident related to the <persName>Ayer</persName> company involves a man befriended by the <persName>Ayer</persName> sales agent in <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName>. The man was <persName>Jose
                     Carlos Rodriguez</persName>, the Assistant Secretary of State of <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName>. <persName>Rodriguez</persName> planned a coup and tricked the Secretary of State into leaving <placeName>Rio de Janeiro</placeName>. But
                  the Secretary returned early and the coup failed. <persName>Rodriguez</persName> fled to the mountains where he was harbored by the <persName>Ayers</persName> agent. Later, <persName>Rodriguez</persName> sneaked out of the country in a packing crate addressed to the
                     <persName>J.C. Ayer</persName> Company in <persName>Lowell, MA</persName>. He was given employment translating <persName>Ayer</persName> printed matter into <placeName>Portuguese</placeName>, <placeName>Spanish</placeName>, <placeName>Italian</placeName>, and <placeName>French</placeName>. He later published his own <placeName>Portuguese</placeName>-language newspaper
                  which was shipped to <placeName corresp="#geonames_3469034">Brazil</placeName> and caused quite an annoyance to the Emperor. <q>[<persName>J. C. Ayer</persName>] was a most indefatigable worker...For many years he wrote the <persName>Ayer's</persName> American
                     Almanack, which was issued in fourteen languages, with calendars adapted to the longitude of the different countries for which it was
                     issued. He also wrote the newspaper and postal advertising matter and did much of the most important correspondence of the office. He was a
                     reader of authors like Darwin and Huxley, and a student of the sciences and history, with an intense interest in every new development.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <persName>Ayer</persName> became interested in mining, and in 1865 he was awarded <pb n="206"/> patents for ore-reducing processes. He
                  financed the Lake Superior Ship <placeName>Canal</placeName> &amp; Railroad &amp; Iron Company. He acquired timber lands in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4155751">Florida</placeName> and built saw mills nearby. He made two journeys to <placeName corresp="#nomisma_europe">Europe</placeName>. He died on July 3, 1878 at the age of 60. His death was said to be caused by many years of
                  overwork and exhaustion. He was buried in <persName>Lowell</persName> Cemetery, where his grave is marked by a massive lion. His brother
                     <persName>Frederick</persName> managed the business until his retirement in 1893.</p>

               <p>
                  <persName>Gault</persName> advertised his product in several newspapers. One such ad appeared in the November 6, 1862 <hi rend="italic">
                     <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Herald</hi>: <q>THE NEW METALLIC CURRENCY—APPLICATIONS for

               <p>
                  <persName>Gault</persName> undoubtably lured several of his clients in this time period. But with the supply of stamps running low, and
                  the new Postal and Fractional currency notes beginning to alleviate the coin shortage, his days as a manufacturer of Encased Postage Stamps
                  were numbered. The year 1863 also brought bad news from the battlefront: on the 13th of April, <persName>Gault's</persName> brother
                  Samuel was killed at the battle of Teche, Louisiana.</p>
               <p>The metallic cent-sized pieces now known as Civil War Tokens were also eating into <persName>Gault's</persName> business; so much so,
                  apparently, that <persName>Gault</persName> decided to devote some of his business to selling them. On August 29, 1863 the following ad
                  appeared in Harper's Weekly: <q>PENNY TOKENS of COPPER... The best quality, and in any quantity, furnished at $8 per thousand by <persName>JOHN GAULT</persName>, No. 1 Park Place, two doors from Broadway, <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York

               <p>With Presidential elections approaching in 1864, the entrepreneurial <persName>Gault</persName> wrote a letter to incumbent <persName corresp="#viaf_76349832">Abraham Lincoln</persName> on June 18th. Still at No. 1 Park Place, <persName>Gault</persName>
                  wrote: <q>Sir:</q>

                  Broadway address until 1893, when he was 62. The <persName>Gaults</persName> travelled extensively, spending many of their winters in

               <p>There are many similarities in the lives of the two men who were primarily responsible for the issue of Encased Postage Stamps during the
                     <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Civil War. <persName>John Gault</persName> and <persName>James
                     Cook Ayer</persName> both lost their fathers before reaching adulthood. They were both tinkerers and inventors who worked hard to earn their
                  fortunes at an early age, and both married late in life. They each foresaw a need in the marketplace, and created and sold a product to fill
                  that need, while making extensive use of advertising.</p>
               <p>Encased Postage Stamps were just one small aspect of their respective careers. For <persName>Ayer</persName>, they were just one more
                  piece of advertising material he used to promote his vast business enterpise. For <persName>Gault</persName>, <pb n="210"/> they were
                  just one invention and business venture among many. For today's collectors, they are one colorful component of the history of <placeName>America's</placeName> coinage.</p>

            <p>Many years ago someone offered two 1785 Confederatio coppers, one with the stars in a small circle (<ref target="#fig-134">fig. 1</ref>), and the
               other with the stars in a large circle (<ref target="#fig-135">fig. 2</ref>). The coins were high grade and the Price was $10,000 each. According
               to the "Red Book" the Price was very reasonable.<ref target="#CH9-n1">1</ref>
            </p>
            <p>In the back of my mind was a pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">Struck Copies of Early American Coins</hi>.<ref target="#CH9-n2">2</ref> The
               Confederatio cents were described on page 8. The author, <persName>Richard D. Kenney</persName>, said that in 1863, <persName>John
                  A. Bolen</persName> of Springfield, MA, struck two of each type in silver and 40 in copper, then destroyed the dies. The dies were nicely made,
               with only slight differences from the genuine coins. To make certain that his copies would not be taken for the genuine examples, <persName>Bolen</persName> placed a dot in the Y of TYRANNIS as a secret mark. This mark was present on both pieces offered to me (<ref target="#fig-136">fig. 3</ref>).</p>

            <p>I showed the book to the owner of the two pieces and he lowered the <persName>Price</persName> slightly—to $5.00 each—which seemed
               reasonable. There were a few other oddities in my collection, and some of them were mentioned in the book. So I started to collect them—not too
               seriously—just when they came along.</p>
            <p>The article by <persName>Kenney</persName> was the first in a new series of <persName>Wayte Raymond's</persName>
               <hi rend="italic">The Coin Collector's Journal</hi> (Vol. 19, No. 1), issued in 1952. It sold for $1.00 or was part of the yearly subscription at
               $3.00 per year. The booklet covers copies struck from dies, but <persName>Kenney</persName> deliberately omitted some copies. The copies of
                  <persName>C. Wyllys Betts</persName> and <persName>Tom Elder</persName> are "too numerous to mention here and are deserving of
               separate studies." One of the coins struck by Betts was the New Haven "Restrike" of the Fugio cent, which contained narrow rings compared to the
               wide rings on the original coins.</p>
            <p>Bolen also had dies made and struck 65 Bar Cents, 40 Higley Coppers, 40 Carolina Tokens, 40 <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> Liber Natus Eagles, and 40 Clinton Cents. A few silver pieces and brass examples were struck from most dies, and many
               mules were made by mixing the dies. Some of the dies were sold to others, who made additional copies.</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Alfred S. Robinson</persName>, a coin dealer (also banker, broker, etc.) from <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, CT, struck many
               copies, including the <placeName>Non Vi Virtute Vici</placeName>, <placeName>Rosa Americana</placeName>, <placeName>Brasher
                  Doubloon</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New England</placeName> Token, and several other tokens and medals. One piece, the
               Washington Cent of 1789, is thought to be a complete fabrication, as no original is known.</p>

               <persName>William Idler</persName>, a <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> coin dealer,
               issued copies of the Washington Half Dollar and <placeName corresp="#geonames_4347778">Baltimore</placeName> Penny. These were certainly not
               meant to deceive, because he placed his advertisement on them (<ref target="#fig-137">fig. 4</ref>).</p>
            <p>
               <persName>Dr. Frank S.</persName> Edwards was a serious coin collector in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York
                  City</placeName>. He had dies made for the 1796 Half Cent, with pole. When he died in 1865, the dies and all but 12 pieces were destroyed. He also
               struck copies of the IMMUNE COLUMBIA / NOVA CONSTELLATIO pieces, <pb n="214"/> shown by <persName>Crosby</persName> in his book,<ref target="#CH9-n3">3</ref> but <persName>Kenney</persName> was not able to find one.</p>
            <p>Prof. <persName>Montroville W. Dickeson</persName>, author of the <hi rend="italic">American Numismatical Manual</hi> (<placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName>, 1859), in 1859 struck copies of the Bermuda "Hogge" Tokens and later made
               copies of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Continental Dollar. The Dollar was struck for the 1876 Centennial
               celebration. Fifty specimens were struck in silver. The dies were much better than the originals, and there is little chance of confusing the
               two. The dies were acquired by <persName corresp="#viaf_48881600">Thomas L. Elder</persName>, a famous <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> dealer, and later by <persName>Robert Bashlow</persName>, who struck thousands of
               copies. Bashlow also bought the dies for the Confederate Cent, and struck thousands of them in many different metals, fibre, etc. The dies had
               been used by Hazeltine to make 74 restrikes in 1874, then damaged by striking them with an axe. Bashlow's restrikes show all of the damage. The
               dies for the Continental Dollar were not damaged, however; it may not be possible to differentiate betweeen Dickeson's and Bashlow's
               restrikes.</p>

            <p>One of the copies made by <persName>C. Wyllys Betts</persName> was the New Haven "Restrike" of the Fugio Cent. This was made from dies
               copied from the original in 1860. The interlocking rings are much narrower in cross section than are the originals.</p>
            <p>My favorites are the copies made by <persName>Thomas Wyatt</persName> of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_8502102">New
                  England</placeName> Shilling and Sixpence (<ref target="#fig-145">fig. 12</ref>). Unable to obtain actual coins for the engraver to copy, Wyatt
               furnished a copy of Felt's 1839 book on Massachusetts currency.<ref target="#CH9-n4">4</ref> which in turn was copied from Folkes's <hi rend="italic">English Coinage</hi>, published in 1763.<ref target="#CH9-n5">5</ref> Felt carried over the horizontal lines used by Folkes to
               add shading to the illustrations. In turn, Wyatt's engraver faithfully copied each line, and they show very prominently on the coins struck from
               his dies (<ref target="#fig-146">fig. 13</ref>)! Wyatt issued eight copies in all, including the Oak Tree Shilling and Twopence, the Pine Tree
               Sixpence, Threepence, and Penny and the Good Samaritan Shilling (itself a fabricaton).<ref target="#CH9-n6">6</ref>
            </p>
            <p>With the differences between the original coins and these copies, it is evident that the copies were struck to furnish examples of the rare coins
               for collectors. This is also shown by the personal marks added by the makers. These marks made it easy to differentiate between the originals and
               the copies. Of course, the marks could be removed, as was the "KETTLE" on one coin, but an honest effort had been made.</p>

            <p>The American Numismatic Society is to be commended for staging this 1994 conference on "The Token: <placeName>America's</placeName> Other
               Money," and for its choice of <persName>Richard Doty</persName> of the Smithsonian Institution as conference chairman. The timing of the
               conference was exquisite since tokens are rapidly evolving into one of the most active and most interesting of all numismatic disciplines, and
               just two months ago there was released the <hi rend="italic">Standard Catalog of <placeName>United States</placeName> Tokens 1700-1900</hi>, a
               project toward which my personal efforts have been aimed for well over 30 years.<ref target="#CH10-n1">1</ref> This paper examines the role of

                  <hi rend="bold">What Is A Token?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>In general, a token is a metallic substitute for government coinage, or else a form of coin-like advertising. There are so many exceptions and
                  supplements to this basic rule that intriguing debate could rage for hours over the semantics.</p>
               <p>Within obvious limitations, a token is whatever we choose to describe by this term, remembering that the line between token and medal is thin
                  and tenuous. Sometimes even the line between token and coin is unclear.</p>
               <p>A token does not have to be made of metal to deserve that term. Cardboard chits for value are usually considered tokens rather than paper
                  money, for example, and technology in the nineteenth century introduced celluloid, vulcanite and other substances to the token world, joining
                  leather, mother-of-pearl and other non-metallic exceptions.</p>
               <p>Various groups of purists, from time to time, try to narrow the meaning of the word token. Many say a token must be "worth" something to be
                  truly a token. For example, it must be "good for" 5 cents, one shave, one ride, one bushel or one task. They overlook <placeName>America's</placeName> great tradition of store cards. We have no objection to such redefinition efforts because we know they are
                  well-intended—but doomed.</p>
               <p>English is a living language. Numismatists can influence it, but only time and wide public acceptance can constrict it. This author has never
                  subscribed to any ideological or semantic effort in his token writings, always preferring "useful" to "pure." One quality a token must have,
                  however, is set in concrete: a token must not have been issued by a government for any clear legal tender purpose.</p>

               <p>It is easy to flatter ourselves that the English colonies in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>
                  <pb n="221"/> were the first to introduce tokens, in the early eighteenth century. But the facts are quite different.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>Spanish America's</placeName> civilization preceded our own in this activity by up to 150 years. <placeName>Mexican</placeName> tlacos and pilones may have appeared as early as 1550, and narrative accounts in Chile and Peru mention private mitads in
                  the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Mexico was inundated with private tlacos and pilones by 1753. My 1992 catalog, <hi rend="italic">
                     <persName>Latin</persName> American Tokens 1700-1920</hi> sets forth source data on this subject.<ref target="#CH10-n2">2</ref>
               </p>
               <p>What is now the <placeName>United States</placeName> did precede <placeName corresp="#geonames_6251999">Canada</placeName> in token
                  issuance, for whatever nationalistic comfort that may afford us. Our very first token appears to have been the Rigault &amp; Dawson brass
                  12-pence of Gloucester County, Virgina, bearing dates 1714 and 1715. The exact purpose for which the so-called "Gloucester shilling" was
                  issued is not known, but it may have been a tobacco warehouse tally.</p>
               <p>The first token to achieve fairly good acceptance was the 1737 copper threepence of <persName>Samuel Higley</persName> of Granby, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City's 1789-dated Mott halfpenny token has long been considered <placeName>America's</placeName> first true trade token, but research in recent years has clouded even further its murky provenance. It may
                  well have been issued after 1807 (<ref target="#fig-147">fig. 1</ref>).</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Toward the end of the eighteenth century, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> was infected with the <placeName>British</placeName>
                  <persName>Conder</persName> token craze, which may account for the 1794/95 cents of Talbot, Allum &amp; Lee of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName>, as well as the spate of <persName>George</persName> Washington coppers dated as
                  early as 1783 (though believed issued over the period 1791 to 1820).</p>
               <p>Many collectors consider these eighteenth century issues to be part of <placeName>America's</placeName> colonial coin story. The 1766-dated
                  coppers of The Friends of Liberty and Trade struck by <persName>James Smither</persName> of <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> also dance along that fine line between coin, token and medal.</p>
               <p>The year 1823 is a safe one to use as the beginning date for the wider use of trade tokens in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>. English immigrant <persName>Richard</persName> Trested opened his token-making business in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_new_york_city">New York City</placeName> City that year, and the Kettle firm in <placeName corresp="#geonames_2655603">Birmingham</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#geonames_6269131">England</placeName>, began exporting <pb n="222"/> American trade tokens such
                  as those of Tredwell Kissam and C. &amp; I.D. Wolfe.</p>
               <p>Most early trade tokens were intended to—and did—serve duty as a cent. In some instances higher denomination coins were imitated, especially
                     <placeName>German</placeName> silver "bits" (12 1/2 cents), but in the main the large copper cent of the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> Mint from 1793 on was the object of imitation.</p>
               <p>The Hard Times era of Jacksonian democracy led in 1833 to a dramatic expansion in token making. It has been estimated that in 1837 as much as
                  one-third of all copper cents in circulation were in fact tokens, not Mint-struck cents.</p>
               <p>Token motifs and sizes—and metallic content—started changing dramatically in the 1848-51 period. Replacing the copper "cents" and <placeName>German</placeName> silver dime (or bit) imitations, several variations now came into vogue.</p>
               <p>Brass replaced copper as the dominant token metal, and imitations of <placeName>United States</placeName> $10 and $5 gold coins started to
                  appear, displaying the Coronet Liberty Head or Eagle Displayed along with a commercial message. Often they were issued with reeded edges and
                  were gilded before striking to further enhance the similarity.</p>
               <p>Counterstamped coins had been used sparingly as tokens as early as 1800 and were still infrequent through the end of the Hard Times period in
                  1844, but their usage widened from 1845 on. A great many of these are awaiting attribution, but remarkable strides have been made in the past
                  15 years, especially since we Numismatists are concentrating on the metalsmith trades for name matches. By "metalsmith" I mean every trade
                  from silversmith and gunsmith to brazier, pewterer, cutler and clockmaker.</p>
               <p>
                  <placeName>German</placeName> silver, cupronickel, white metal and various bronzes were pressed into token use after 1845, along with
                  silver and lead. Even gold strikes are known, most probably created as vanity pieces for affluent collectors of the day.</p>
               <p>In 1857 the <placeName>United States</placeName> Mint changed the large copper cent to a small cupronickel piece, and banned further legal
                  tender status for foreign coins. Token sizes quickly followed the 29mm to 19mm cent reduction, and vast quantities of worn-out <placeName>Spanish</placeName> silver became available for more counterstamping activity.</p>
               <p>The decade of the 1850s, though, saw less monetary usage for tokens, and store cards reigned supreme. At least, those pieces larger than 19mm
                  were seldom offered as money substitutes. But in 1858 a new phenomenon occurred: 19mm copper cent-sized "store cards" appeared in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName> and elsewhere which not only imitated the Flying Eagle Cent reverse but passed
                  current as private cents. This latter event foreshadowed the Civil War token.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Only in two periods of American history have the need for a private token coinage been absolute, because the reigning authority proved unable
                  to provide a circulating medium of small change sufficient to the needs of commerce.</p>
               <p>These two periods were the Colonial/Early Republican era, and the period of the War Between the States. In the first instance the colonial
                  masters in Great <placeName>Britain</placeName> failed their subjects in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName>, but
                  in the second instance people began hoarding hard currency, even one-cent pieces, in 1862. Within a year there was no one willing to pay out
                  coin of the realm even though the Mint remained in operation.</p>
               <p>All sorts of paper substitutes for small change appeared, from paper scrip and cardboard chits to postage stamps, both encased and loose. The
                  needs of commerce demanded something more durable, and private small cents of copper, brass, etc., appeared in huge numbers. Some 25 million
                  Civil War tokens must have been in circulation in late 1863, whereas there had been perhaps 10 million Hard Times tokens in public hands in
                  1837.</p>
               <p>More than 11,000 varieties of Civil War tokens are cataloged, making this by far the largest period of token issuance in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> until that time. A federal law in 1864 cut off most further token issuance, as the <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">U.S.</placeName> realized its sovereign coinage right was actually being imperiled by this unbridled
                  expansion of unbacked money supply.</p>

               <p>The 1864 law supposedly banned the use of tokens as money, but such laws worked no better in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> in the nineteenth century industrializing period than they did anywhere else in the world.</p>
               <p>Imitation cents and counterstamped coins kept appearing well into the 70s, and that decade also saw vulcanite store cards, "shell cards"
                  (imitations of silver dollars or double eagles made of embossed metal faces bonded to paper backs), and something quite new, the "trade
                  token." The trade token was a utilitarian emission "good for" a drink, a bath, 5 cents, 12 1/2 cents, a cord (of Wood), a meal or even a visit
                  to a bordello. Billiard table and saloon fixture manufacturers were quick to supply their customers with tokens, and the number and variety of
                  trade tokens which appeared in the last 30 years of the nineteenth century is quite large. This area of attribution is now being researched by
                  scholars in every state of the Union, with a great number of varieties already documented. In most cases, individual trade token issues appear
                  to have been small—perhaps <pb n="224"/> 100 to 1,000 pieces—but it requires little imagination to realize that with one to two million
                  possible issuers, the number of pieces in public hands by 1890 must have been staggering.</p>
               <p>Store cards of beauty continued to be issued after the Civil War, especially connected with the 1876 Centennial Fair in <placeName corresp="#nomisma_philadelphia_pennsylvania">Philadelphia</placeName> and the 1893 Columbian Exposition in <placeName corresp="#geonames_4887398">Chicago</placeName>.</p>
               <p>The commercial introduction of aluminum to token manufacture began about 1891, and by the turn of the century the cheap, beautiful and durable
                  metal expanded token usage even further.</p>
               <p>It has been said that in early <persName>America</persName> (before 1840), tokens were sort of a status symbol for successful merchants.
                  Sixty years later every saloonkeeper, general store proprietor, dry goods dealer, druggist and corner grocer who wanted tokens could have
                  them. They had become truly the money of the people—or maybe they always were!</p>

               <p>This subject might well be treated in depth in another paper, but a few words in closing this paper seem in order. I can state with conviction
                  that the status of token research in <placeName corresp="#geonames_6252001">America</placeName> has never been healthier! One of my
                  colleagues stated in a review recently that all token catalogers are "highly idiosyncratic...to one degree or another." Another opined that
                  serendipity was a useful, even necessary, characteristic for catalogers of tokens.</p>
               <p>Perhaps both are right, but both miss the point. Cataloging tokens is very, very hard work. Fortunately for our beloved hobby, we are blessed
                  in 1994 with the largest number of devoted researches we've ever had. Organizations that deserve special mention in this regard include: Token
                  and Medal Societyr, Active Token Collectors Organization, Civil War Token Society, Maryland Token and Medal Society, American Vecturist
                  Association, and <placeName corresp="#geonames_5332921">California</placeName> Exonumist Society.</p>
